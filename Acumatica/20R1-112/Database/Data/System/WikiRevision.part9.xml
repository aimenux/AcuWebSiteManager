The Projects module helps you monitor and manage costs, revenues, and budget for projects. You can define projects and specify their settings, including defining tasks and populating projects with employees, resources, and equipment. By using the Projects module, you can manage projects of varying complexity across different project types and industries. {br}

The Projects module is seamlessly integrated with other Acumatica ERP modules, so you can automatically track project costs and budget and predict future revenue. Once you integrate the Projects module with another Acumatica ERP module, you can associate any document posted in the module with a specific project, which ensures that any project-related activity will be accounted for. You can integrate the Projects module with the General Ledger, Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, Inventory, Purchase Orders, Sales Orders, and Time and Expenses modules. {br}

You can use the Projects module to maintain complete, structured information about projects, including tracking their costs, budget, and expected revenues. In Acumatica ERP, a ''project'' is defined as a one-time effort planned for execution within specific time and cost limits, and with an expected budget and revenue. A project can consist of one task or multiple tasks, and you can associate individual projects and tasks with workgroups. {br}

The primary features of the Projects module are described briefly below and in more detail in other topics. {br}{TOC}
==Integration with Other Modules==
Integration between the Projects module and other Acumatica ERP modules makes it possible to maintain complete project information as the project-related data is entered into other modules: 
*Integration with the Accounts Payable, Purchase Orders, and Inventory modules gives users the ability to track costs and re-invoice them with or without a premium. This integration includes the following benefits:
**Integration with the Accounts Receivable and Sales Orders modules makes it easy to manage billing information.
**By using integration with the Time and Expenses module, managers can the track labor costs related to specific projects.

For more information, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__con_Integration_With_Other_Modules|Integration with Other Modules].
==Labor Time and Cost Accounting==
 Acumatica ERP supports labor accounting through the attribution of labor hours to specific projects and tasks within projects. To this end, the time that employees spend on projects is recorded in time cards. The time-tracking information transparently flows in the Projects module. 
==Flexible Budget Tracking==
You can easily compare actual project costs with the original and revised budgets. As a project progresses, you can also continuously track budget execution, including whether actual costs match the budget, and act appropriately by either adjusting expenditures or revising the budget. In Acumatica ERP, you can also implement continuous budgeting. 
==Fixed-Price and Cost-Based Projects==
 Acumatica ERP supports two types of projects: fixed-price and cost-based. With fixed-price projects, the price for the project is defined at the beginning of the project and is not changed until the end of the project. With cost-based projects, the final price of the project depends on the overall cost of fulfilling the project, and the costs may be invoiced again with or without a premium. You can also run projects with a cap. 
==Work-in-Progress Accounting==
When maintaining project accounting in Acumatica ERP, you can track the work in progress (WIP) performed in the project. Work in progress is the amount of work that was performed but not yet invoiced. By using this functionality, you can use for billing only those project expenses that are relevant for specific billing periods.
==External and Internal Projects==
By using the Projects module, you can manage both external and internal projects. Generally, the scope of internal projects is limited to the physical and organizational boundaries of an organization; these projects serve the needs of the organization and never produce any revenue. On the other hand, an external project is revenue-driven, and the key objective is balancing costs and income to make sure the organization remains profitable, while meeting project goals and maximizing customer satisfaction. 
==Flexible Rate Calculation==
By using the flexible rate calculation engine in Acumatica ERP, you can implement complex pricing and accrual models that require the consideration of a large number of parameters. With this project management engine, you can differentiate rates depending on the project, task, account group, and employee class. You can even define different rates for specific dates or date ranges. 
==Billable Revenue Tracking==
You can track future revenues as a project progresses from task to task. By using Acumatica ERP, you can accommodate complex pricing models with a high level of granularity. 
==Templates for Projects and Tasks==
If your company routinely performs standardized projects (for instance, the building of standard houses), you do not need to create these projects from scratch and each time go through the entire procedure of defining a new project and its tasks. Instead, you can create templates for standard projects and tasks and use them each time you start a new project. For details, see [HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Templates_Mapref|Configuring Project Templates and Tasks].
==Commitment Tracking==
 Acumatica ERP supports tracking purchase orders by project as the project cost commitments. These commitments affect the execution status of a project. A user can track the budget and actual amounts of a project, as well as the original commitments that remain open. For details, see [HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Commitments_Mapref|Processing Purchases on Projects].
==Draft Invoice Workflow==
You can enable draft invoices in the project billing workflow to work with a draft invoice that is isolated from the Accounts Receivable module. You can review and modify the draft invoice and reach agreement about the document with all required parties before the accounting team prepares the final Accounts Receivable invoice with all information copied from the draft invoice. With this process, the company can minimize corrections in the Accounts Receivable module. For details, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__con_Draft_Invoice_Workflow|Pro Forma Invoices].
==Automated Project Billing and Invoicing==
As a project progresses from milestone to milestone or when it is completed, you can define the project to automatically generate billing information and generate invoices for customers. This saves time, reduces errors, and helps you improve the cash flow in your organization.
==Project Security==
 Acumatica ERP provides you with the variety of options that can be used to set up security of specific projects. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__con_Project_Access|Project Security].]]></column>

This topic covers the prerequisites and preparatory steps needed before you begin configuring the Projects module.{br}{TOC}
==Prerequisites and Dependencies==[anchor|#ol_jgy_kxd_fm]
#The license for Acumatica ERP should include the Projects feature, and the feature should be enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Managing_Features|Managing Features].
#The initial system configuration must be completed and the General Ledger module must be configured before you implement the Projects module. The Projects module can be tightly integrated with many Acumatica ERP modules, including General Ledger, Accounts Payable, Account Receivable, Inventory, Purchase Orders, Sales Orders, Time and Expenses, and Customer Management. These modules do not require any change in their configuration when Projects is implemented; however, the modules to be integrated with Projects should be implemented first.
#If you plan to track employee time spent on activities related to projects, make sure the ''Time Reporting on Activities'' feature is included in your license and enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. 
[anchor|#2]
==Preparation==
You should start the implementation of the Projects module with collecting and analyzing the necessary information. Perform the following steps before you actually configure the Projects module; these steps do not need to be done in the listed order and many can be done in parallel. ((({S:Warn}Because this is the preparation phase of implementation, enter no data into the system at this time.
)))[anchor|#table_yq3_2vh_vl]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="20%" ! Item 
!width="80%" ! Description
|- 
| '''Develop a naming convention for projects and tasks'''
|  Each project in Acumatica ERP is assigned a unique ''project ID''. Project identifiers can be comprised of segments with optional validation of each segment. Plan the structure of the project ID based on the segmented key ''PROJECT'': number of segments, length of segments, whether and how they should be validated, and whether auto-numbering should be used. Note that the ''PROJECT'' segmented key is also used for project templates, so decide whether you want the identifiers of projects to differ from the identifiers of templates. Prepare a list of valid entries for segments that should be validated. Design a numbering sequence for an auto-numbered segment, if one will be used. 
Plan also the structure for the identifiers of tasks (the segmented key ''PROTASK'').((({S:Hint} The task ID should be unique only within a project. Two different projects can have tasks with the same identifier, and they will be different tasks. For this reason, you should not use auto-numbering for task IDs.
))) For additional information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Identifier_Segmentation|Segmented Identifiers].
|- 
| '''Define non-project code'''
|  Once the Projects module is enabled, the system will require project IDs and project task IDs for every transaction in all the integrated modules of Acumatica ERP. This does not mean that each transaction must be linked to a project; the user can enter the non-project code (which you define) for a transaction that is not related to any project. For convenience, the non-project code should be distinctly different from project IDs and should be short, such as the single character ''X'', which is used by default.
|- 
| '''Define account groups'''
|  The role of ''account groups'' in Projects is similar to the role of accounts in General Ledger: All transaction processing and all reporting in Projects are done by using account groups. When defining account groups, first identify the accounts that will be used in project-related transactions. Accounts Receivable accounts (accounts debited by project billing) and Accounts Payable accounts (accounts credited by vendor bills) should be excluded. 
For each identified group, write down the following:[anchor|#ul_cy3_2vh_vl]
*A short '''Description''' of the account group.
* The '''Type''' of account group: ''Asset'', ''Liability'', ''Income'', ''Expense'', or ''Off-Balance''. The type of the group should be the same as the type of General Ledger accounts included in the group. An ''off-balance'' group cannot include any General Ledger account.
*The list of '''GL Accounts''' associated with the group.
* The '''Account Group ID''' (which should comply with the ''ACCGROUP'' segmented key).
For details, see [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_10_00|Account Groups] ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]).
|- 
| '''Develop a naming convention for account groups'''
|  Plan the structure of identifiers to be used for account groups. The structure is defined by the ''ACCGROUP'' segmented key. The account group identifiers can mimic the GL account numbers or be text identifiers, such as ''BUDGET'', ''REVENUE'', and ''EXPENSE''. If needed, the identifiers can be defined with multiple segments. Use similar identifiers for similar account groups to be able to specify ranges of account groups (arranged alphabetically) when defining allocation rules.
|- 
| '''Plan labor items'''
|  Labor items provide information on hourly rates, GL accounts, and tax categories to be used to account for labor on projects. ((({S:Warn}The GL accounts used for labor items should be mapped to appropriate account groups; otherwise, the transactions related to labor on projects will not be visible in the Projects module. 
)))Decide what different types of labor are involved with projects and how they differ (thus, how their settings will differ). Decide how many labor items you will need for these types of labor. 
|- 
| '''Create a list of non-stock items to be used in projects'''
| Write down all non-stock items to denote services, miscellaneous expenditures that may be used for projects, and various types of labor. Select the GL accounts to be used for those items and note that the accounts should be mapped to the defined account groups. For details, see the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form.
|- 
| '''Define equipment to be used for projects'''
| If you plan to use specific equipment for projects, write it down on the list. For each piece of equipment, specify runtime, suspend, and setup rates and respective rate items. Also, write down the accounts (and subaccounts) to be used to record costs of using the equipment for projects; map the accounts to appropriate account groups.
|- 
| '''Plan reason codes'''
| To issue a stock item from a warehouse for a project, you have to specify a reason code that would provide appropriate accounts for the transaction. The accounts specified for the reason codes should be mapped to appropriate account groups. For details, see [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_21_10_00|Reason Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS211000|CS211000]). 
|- 
| '''Plan attributes'''
| Attributes can be used to store additional information about projects. You can define the types of UI controls to be used for attributes and the lists of possible values; you can even make them required elements on the forms. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Attributes_and_User_Defined_Fields|Managing Attributes and User-Defined Fields].
|- 
| '''Plan on integrating Projects with other modules'''
| The Projects module can be integrated with the General Ledger, Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, Order Management, Purchase Orders, Organization Structure, Inventory, Cash Management, and Customer Management modules. Integration with a specific module means that projects are visible in this module, and the users can enter project-related transactions in this module. 
Particular projects and their tasks can have their own (more narrow) visibility scopes. ((({S:Hint} Whether or not the Projects module is integrated with the General Ledger and Accounts Receivable modules, the system will post the Projects transactions to the General Ledger module and generate Accounts Receivable invoices.
)))
|- 
| '''Define integration with Time and Expenses'''
|  If you are going to track the time your employees work on specific projects or bill customers for equipment involved in projects, integrate the Projects module with the Time and Expenses module. With this integration, the Time and Expenses module will initially release the employee and equipment time cards to the Projects module; then, on allocation, the Projects module will post them to General Ledger. 
|- 
| '''Decide whether you need to track time on activities'''
| Enabling the ''Time Reporting on Activities'' feature will allow you to track the work time and overtime your employees spend on the activities related to projects. This feature should be included in your license. Also, plan the activity types for which you want to track time. 
|- 
| '''Create a list of employees who will work for projects'''
| Make sure that all the employees who will work for projects have employee and user accounts; also, make sure that their hourly rates are specified and the appropriate labor items are defined.
|- 
| '''Design roles'''
| Design the roles you need for users who will configure rate tables, set up allocation and billing rules, manage projects, and enter the data for projects.
|- 
| colspan="2" | The steps below can be done later when you will be configuring project templates or creating particular projects.
|- 
| '''Define @Rates (Rate Tables)'''
|  In Projects, ''@Rate'' is a parameter used in formulas of the allocation and billing rules. Different rates can be applied to different transactions based on many related factors, such as particular tasks or projects, account groups, equipment used, inventory items involved, particular employees participating, and the particular step of the allocation or billing. For example, you can charge customers for consultant work differently depending on the particular consultant involved in a project.((({S:Hint}
Do not confuse the term ''rate'' in rate tables with other rates in Acumatica ERP, such as employee hourly rates or equipment run rates. In the context of rate tables, ''rate'' is a number (''@Rate'') that you can use in allocation rules as a multiplier, an addend, or a constant value. For instance, to implement a price model that estimates the project price as total costs plus 10 percent, you can define a ''@Rate'' of 1.1 in the appropriate rate table and calculate the project price as the total cost multiplied by this rate.
)))
For more information on rates, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__con_Rate_Codes_and_Pricing_Rates|Rate Tables: Usage and Configuration Examples] and [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__how_to_Configure_Rate_Table|To Configure a Rate Table].{br}

Write down the rates to be used for different sets of factors.
|- 
| '''Define earning types'''
| You will need non-stock items to account for labor on projects. You can define earning types on a per-project basis.
|- 
| '''Design allocation rules'''
|  Allocation rules define how to:[anchor|#ul_uz3_2vh_vl]
*Re-allocate costs between account categories, tasks, and projects.
*Calculate burdens, overheads, unbilled, and unearned revenues.
*Select and group transactions for posting.
*Calculate billable amounts and generate Accounts Receivable invoices.
 Analyze your business needs and practices and design your own allocation rules. For further details, see [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_75_00|Allocation Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207500|PM207500]).
|- 
| '''Design billing rules'''
| Billing rules define how to bill the customers for work performed by your company on specific projects. For further details, see [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]).
|- 
| '''Consider creating templates for projects and tasks'''
|  Review the planned projects, group them by similar properties, and decide on creating project templates. Review the project tasks, and write down a list of the tasks that are common for most projects (common tasks). Also, create the lists of tasks specific for each group of projects—you will include them in respective project templates.

Prerequisites and Dependencies The license for  Acumatica ERP should include the Projects feature, and the feature should be enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. For details, see  Managing Features. The initial system configuration must be completed and the General Ledger module must be           configured before you implement the Projects module. The Projects module can be tightly           integrated with many  Acumatica ERP modules, including General Ledger, Accounts Payable, Account Receivable, Inventory,           Purchase Orders, Sales Orders, Time and Expenses, and Customer Management. These modules           do not require any change in their configuration when Projects is implemented; however,           the modules to be integrated with Projects should be implemented first. If you plan to track employee time spent on activities related to projects, make sure           the  Time Reporting on Activities  feature is included in your license and enabled on           the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form.  Preparation You should start the implementation of the Projects module with collecting and analyzing         the necessary information. Perform the following steps before you actually configure the         Projects module; these steps do not need to be done in the listed order and many can be done         in parallel.  Because this is the preparation phase of implementation, enter no data into the system         at this time. Item  Description Develop a naming convention for projects and tasks  Each project in  Acumatica ERP is assigned a unique  project ID . Project identifiers can be comprised of                 segments with optional validation of each segment. Plan the structure of the project                 ID based on the segmented key  PROJECT : number of segments, length of                 segments, whether and how they should be validated, and whether auto-numbering                 should be used. Note that the  PROJECT  segmented key is also used for project                 templates, so decide whether you want the identifiers of projects to differ from the                 identifiers of templates. Prepare a list of valid entries for segments that should                 be validated. Design a numbering sequence for an auto-numbered segment, if one will                 be used.  Plan also the structure for the identifiers of tasks (the segmented key                      PROTASK ).  The task ID should be unique only within                   a project. Two different projects can have tasks with the same identifier, and                   they will be different tasks. For this reason, you should not use auto-numbering                   for task IDs.  For additional information, see  Segmented Identifiers. Define non-project code  Once the Projects module is enabled, the system will require project IDs and                 project task IDs for every transaction in all the integrated modules of  Acumatica ERP. This does not mean that each transaction must be linked to a project; the user                 can enter the non-project code (which you define) for a transaction that is not                 related to any project. For convenience, the non-project code should be distinctly                 different from project IDs and should be short, such as the single character                    X , which is used by default. Define account groups  The role of  account groups  in Projects is similar to the role of                 accounts in General Ledger: All transaction processing and all reporting in Projects                 are done by using account groups. When defining account groups, first identify the                 accounts that will be used in project-related transactions. Accounts Receivable                 accounts (accounts debited by project billing) and Accounts Payable accounts                 (accounts credited by vendor bills) should be excluded.  For each identified                   group, write down the following: A short  Description  of the account group.  The  Type  of account group:  Asset ,  Liability ,                          Income ,  Expense , or  Off-Balance . The type of the group                       should be the same as the type of General Ledger accounts included in the                       group. An  off-balance  group cannot include any General Ledger                       account. The list of  GL Accounts  associated with the group.  The  Account Group ID  (which should comply with the  ACCGROUP                        segmented key). For details, see   ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) Account Groups                   (PM201000). Develop a naming convention for account groups  Plan the structure of identifiers to be used for account groups. The structure                 is defined by the  ACCGROUP  segmented key. The account group identifiers can                 mimic the GL account numbers or be text identifiers, such as  BUDGET ,                    REVENUE , and  EXPENSE . If needed, the identifiers can be defined with                 multiple segments. Use similar identifiers for similar account groups to be able to                 specify ranges of account groups (arranged alphabetically) when defining allocation                 rules. Plan labor items  Labor items provide information on hourly rates, GL accounts, and tax                 categories to be used to account for labor on projects.  The GL accounts used                   for labor items should be mapped to appropriate account groups; otherwise, the                   transactions related to labor on projects will not be visible in the Projects                   module.  Decide what different types of labor are involved with projects and                 how they differ (thus, how their settings will differ). Decide how many labor items                 you will need for these types of labor.  Create a list of non-stock items to be used in projects Write down all non-stock items to denote services, miscellaneous expenditures                 that may be used for projects, and various types of labor. Select the GL accounts to                 be used for those items and note that the accounts should be mapped to the defined                 account groups. For details, see the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000)                 form. Define equipment to be used for projects If you plan to use specific equipment for projects, write it down on the list.                 For each piece of equipment, specify runtime, suspend, and setup rates and                 respective rate items. Also, write down the accounts (and subaccounts) to be used to                 record costs of using the equipment for projects; map the accounts to appropriate                 account groups. Plan reason codes To issue a stock item from a warehouse for a project, you have to specify a                 reason code that would provide appropriate accounts for the transaction. The                 accounts specified for the reason codes should be mapped to appropriate account                 groups. For details, see   ([~/?ScreenId=CS211000|CS211000]) Reason Codes (CS211000).  Plan attributes Attributes can be used to store additional information about projects. You can                 define the types of UI controls to be used for attributes and the lists of possible                 values; you can even make them required elements on the forms. For more information,                 see  Managing Attributes and User-Defined Fields. Plan on integrating Projects with other modules The Projects module can be integrated with the General Ledger, Accounts                 Payable, Accounts Receivable, Order Management, Purchase Orders, Organization                 Structure, Inventory, Cash Management, and Customer Management modules. Integration                 with a specific module means that projects are visible in this module, and the users                 can enter project-related transactions in this module.  Particular projects and                   their tasks can have their own (more narrow) visibility scopes.   Whether or not the Projects module is integrated with the General                   Ledger and Accounts Receivable modules, the system will post the Projects                   transactions to the General Ledger module and generate Accounts Receivable                   invoices. Define integration with Time and Expenses  If you are going to track the time your employees work on specific projects or                 bill customers for equipment involved in projects, integrate the Projects module                 with the Time and Expenses module. With this integration, the Time and Expenses                 module will initially release the employee and equipment time cards to the Projects                 module; then, on allocation, the Projects module will post them to General Ledger.                Decide whether you need to track time on activities Enabling the  Time Reporting on Activities  feature will allow you to                 track the work time and overtime your employees spend on the activities related to                 projects. This feature should be included in your license. Also, plan the activity                 types for which you want to track time.  Create a list of employees who will work for projects Make sure that all the employees who will work for projects have employee and                 user accounts; also, make sure that their hourly rates are specified and the                 appropriate labor items are defined. Design roles Design the roles you need for users who will configure rate tables, set up                 allocation and billing rules, manage projects, and enter the data for                 projects. The steps below can be done later when you will be                 configuring project templates or creating particular projects. Define @Rates (Rate Tables)  In Projects,  @Rate  is a parameter used in formulas of the allocation                 and billing rules. Different rates can be applied to different transactions based on                 many related factors, such as particular tasks or projects, account groups,                 equipment used, inventory items involved, particular employees participating, and                 the particular step of the allocation or billing. For example, you can charge                 customers for consultant work differently depending on the particular consultant                 involved in a project. Do not confuse the term  rate  in rate tables with other rates in  Acumatica ERP, such as employee hourly rates or equipment run rates. In the context of rate                     tables,  rate  is a number ( @Rate ) that you can use in                     allocation rules as a multiplier, an addend, or a constant value. For instance,                     to implement a price model that estimates the project price as total costs plus                     10 percent, you can define a  @Rate  of 1.1 in the appropriate rate table                     and calculate the project price as the total cost multiplied by this rate. For more information on rates, see  Rate Tables: Usage and Configuration Examples and  To Configure a Rate Table. Write down the rates to be                   used for different sets of factors. Define earning types You will need non-stock items to account for labor on projects. You can define                 earning types on a per-project basis. Design allocation rules  Allocation rules define how to: Re-allocate costs between account categories, tasks, and projects. Calculate burdens, overheads, unbilled, and unearned revenues. Select and group transactions for posting. Calculate billable amounts and generate Accounts Receivable invoices.  Analyze your business needs and practices and design your own allocation                 rules. For further details, see   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207500|PM207500]) Allocation Rules                 (PM207500). Design billing rules Billing rules define how to bill the customers for work performed by your                 company on specific projects. For further details, see   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules (PM207000). Consider creating templates for projects and tasks  Review the planned projects, group them by similar properties, and decide on                 creating project templates. Review the project tasks, and write down a list of the                 tasks that are common for most projects (common tasks). Also, create the lists of                 tasks specific for each group of projects—you will include them in respective                 project templates. ]]></column>

Rates are date-sensitive.                   You can define date ranges when one rate supersedes another. However, for the                   purpose of implementation, all rates should have the start date as the first                   operational date of the Projects module and a blank end date. 12 Create allocation rules  Use the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207500|PM207500]) Allocation Rules (PM207500) form to create the rules for                 project allocation.  13 Create billing rules  Use the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules (PM207000) form to create the rules                 for project billing.  14 Create project templates  Use the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) Project Templates (PM208000) form to create project                 templates.  15 Create template tasks and common tasks  Use the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM208010|PM208010]) Project Template Tasks (PM208010) form to create template  tasks                 and the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM208030|PM208030]) Common Tasks (PM208030) form to create common tasks.  ]]></column>

You can seamlessly integrate the Projects module with other modules of Acumatica ERP. With this integration, information about transactions related to projects can transparently flow into the Projects module and be available for tracking budget, costs, and future revenue for projects. {br}

You can integrate the Projects module with the following modules: 
*General Ledger
*Accounts Payable
*Accounts Receivable
*Inventory Management
*Order Management
*Time and Expenses
{br}{TOC}
==Visibility Settings==
If you integrate the Projects module with other modules, the active projects defined in the Projects module become visible in those modules. All data entry forms of any integrated module include two additional elements—'''Project ''' and '''Task'''. Each time you enter a transaction that relates to a specific active project in the Projects module, you can associate the transaction with this project by selecting the appropriate project and task. 
==Non-Project Code==
The non-project code, which is specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form, is a code that you can use to indicate that specific transactions are not associated with any project. By default, this code is ''X'', but you can specify a different non-project code. {br}

Once you activate the Projects module and integrate another Acumatica ERP module with it, users must specify '''Project''' and '''Task''' values when they enter transactions on the data entry forms of that module. If a user does not want to associate a particular transaction with any project, the user must select the non-project code as the '''Project'''. With this code selected, no information will be transferred to the Projects module and no project balances will be updated. 
==Integration with Accounts Payable, Inventory, and Purchase Orders==
When you integrate the Projects module with the Accounts Payable, Inventory, and Purchase Orders modules, the mandatory '''Project''' and '''Task''' columns are added to data entry forms in the integrated module so that purchases of stock items, non-stock items, and services can be associated with specific project tasks, as can inventory transactions. Each time a user enters a document in any of these modules, the user must either specify the project and task to associate with the current transaction or select the non-project code. {br}

Integrated modules do not post transactions to Projects directly. A transaction originating in the Purchase Orders module, on release, generates transactions in the Inventory module and in the Accounts Payable module. The transactions related to projects in the Accounts Payable and Inventory modules are first released and then posted to the General Ledger module; then from the General Ledger module, they are copied to the Projects module. You can reduce the time required for processing transactions by configuring integrated modules in the following ways: [anchor|#ul_zsm_1pq_fm]
*Select the '''Release AP Documents Automatically''' and '''Release IN Documents Automatically''' check boxes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form.
*Select the '''Automatically Post on Release''' check boxes on the following forms: [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_10_10_00|Accounts Payable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AP101000|AP101000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]).

To update the General Ledger module with the full details of the original transactions, clear the '''Post Summary on Updating GL''' check boxes on the following forms: [anchor|#ul_emb_2nq_fm]
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_10_10_00|Accounts Payable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AP101000|AP101000])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000])

==Integration with the Accounts Receivable and Sales Orders Modules==
When you integrate the Projects module with the Sales Orders and Accounts Receivable module, on the forms of these modules, the '''Project''' box is added to the Summary area and the '''Task''' column is added to the Details area. If a user selects a specific project, the user must also specify a particular task of this project. {br}

Transactions originating in the Sales Order module, on release, generate transactions in the Inventory and Accounts Receivables modules. The Accounts Receivable and Inventory modules do not post transactions to Projects directly. The original transaction is first released and then posted to General Ledger, and then from General Ledger it is copied to the Projects module. You can reduce the time required for the processing of transactions by configuring the integrated modules as follows:[anchor|#ul_srm_5xq_fm]
*Select the '''Release IN Documents Automatically''' option on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form.
* Select the '''Automatically Post on Release''' check boxes on both the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) forms. 

To update the Projects module with the full details of the original transactions, clear the '''Post Summary on Updating GL''' check boxes on the following forms: [anchor|#ul_ncm_gyq_fm]
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000])

==Integration with the Time and Expenses Module==
When you integrate the Projects module with the Time and Expenses module, the '''Project''' and '''Task''' columns are added on all data entry forms. These columns are mandatory. {br}

If your employees work on projects managed by using the Projects module, you can use the Time and Expenses module to track the time they spend on projects, including regular time and overtime. By default, you use time cards for this purpose, but you can instead use expense claims. {br}

Once released, a time card or an expense claim associated with a specific project does not directly generate General Ledger transactions; instead, Acumatica ERP generates one or more transactions in the Projects module. By using the options located on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_10_10_00|Time and Expenses Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=EP101000|EP101000]) form, you can select whether the transactions from the Projects module will be posted to an account group of the ''Off-Balance'' type or to account groups of standard types: ''Asset'', ''Liability'', ''Expense'', and ''Income''. The General Ledger will be updated through the transactions generated based on the transactions posted to account groups of standard types.{br}

To reduce the time required for transaction processing, select the '''Automatically Release PM Documents''' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_10_10_00|Time and Expenses Preferences] form. ((({S:Warn}In the Time and Expenses module, notes and attached documents from a Time and Expenses transaction can be copied to a Projects transaction if the '''Copy Files to PM Documents''' and '''Copy Notes to PM Documents''' check boxes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_10_10_00|Time and Expenses Preferences] form are selected.
)))
You can use expense claims to track the expenses your employees incur when they work on specific projects. Once released, an expense claim associated with a specific project does not generate Accounts Receivable transactions; instead, Acumatica ERP generates transactions in the Projects module that, in turn, will generate the Account Receivable transactions. {br}

If equipment is used in projects managed by using the Projects module, you can use the Time and Expenses module to track the time the equipment was used for projects, including run time, standby time, and suspend time. Once released, a time card associated with a specific project does not generate General Ledger transactions. Instead, Acumatica ERP generates transactions in the Projects module.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
An ''account group'' is an entity in Acumatica ERP that you can define by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_10_00|Account Groups] ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) form and map to a subset of General Ledger accounts. In projects, the account group plays the same role as the General Ledger accounts do in the General Ledger ledger: it is used to track the project budget and balances.{br}

Account groups facilitate aggregation, tracking, control, and management of information related to the project budget, costs, and future revenues. Because they are mapped to General Ledger accounts, account groups provide transfer of the project-related financial information between the General Ledger and Projects modules. For instance, on the '''Balances''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, you can view the budget, revised budget, and actual balance of each account group in the selected project. {br}{TOC}
==Account Group Identifiers==
To configure the identifiers of account groups in Acumatica ERP, you use the ''ACCGROUP'' segmented key on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form. By default, this segmented key specifies that the account group identifier is an alphanumeric string of up to 10 characters. If needed, you can divide account group identifiers into segments with specific values. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Identifier_Segmentation|Segmented Identifiers]. In most cases, you do not need to change the default configuration of the ''ACCGROUP'' key. {br}

For clarity, we recommend that you assign user-friendly identifiers to account groups. For instance, you can use ''LABOR'' as the name of the account group to track labor costs or ''TRAVEL'' as the name of the account group to track travel costs. 
==Types of Account Groups==
An account group can belong to one of the following types: ''Asset'', ''Liability'', ''Expense'', or ''Income''. An account group of a particular type can be mapped to specific General Ledger accounts of only certain types—that is, an account group of the ''Asset'' or ''Liability'' type may include only asset and liability accounts, an account group of the ''Income'' or ''Expense'' type may include accounts of any type.{br}

You can use account groups of the ''Off-Balance'' type to collect and track for projects statistical and other information that is unrelated to finance. Account groups of the ''Off-Balance'' type are not mapped to any General Ledger accounts. The transactions posted to account groups of this type will not update the General Ledger. For example, you can create an off-balance group to record all work hours spent by employees on the project. You may want to know the total of work hours, but you do not want to post those amounts to General Ledger. 
==Account Groups and General Ledger==
You can create account groups to be used in the Projects module by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_10_00|Account Groups] ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) form. When you define account groups, first identify the accounts that will be used in project-related transactions. ((({S:Warn}Accounts receivable accounts (accounts debited by project billing), accounts payable accounts (accounts credited by vendor bills), and cash accounts should be excluded. 
)))
Use the following rules to create account groups:[anchor|#ul_tx3_2vh_vl]
*Any single account group may include one or more General Ledger accounts; however, you cannot map any General Ledger account to more than one account group. 
*An account group should include accounts of only certain types (for instance, an account group of the ''Liability'' type may include only asset and liability accounts).
*When you map the accounts to account groups, consider the billing and allocation rules. For billing and allocation, if the transactions of two accounts should be processed differently, these two accounts should be included in different account groups. If the transactions usually use the same rate, consider including their accounts in one group. If for specific transactions usually different rates are used, consider including their accounts in different groups.
*Consider whether you need the ''Off-balance'' account groups that are not linked to General Ledger accounts and that would hold amounts not posted to General Ledger. For information about using account groups in this way, see the examples of allocation and billing rules further in the article. 

By using account groups, you can view specific balances by project. For example, the ''EXPENSE'' account group was created for customization projects and includes the following accounts: [anchor|#ul_vkf_43p_vl]
*4010 Travel Expenses
*4030 Accommodation
*4050 Car Rent
*4113 Office Supplies
*4115 Miscellaneous Expenses

As the customization group arrives to the client location and the employees start working on the customization project, they record their expenditures related to the project to appropriate General Ledger accounts. The project manager can view the project&rsquo;s expenses as the balance of the ''EXPENSE'' account group, which is the total of all expenses recorded to all the expense accounts included in the ''EXPENSE'' account group.
==Account-Task Mapping for Automatically Added Transactions==
When you create a document, you specify a project task for each transaction where it is applicable. For an automatically added transaction, however, there is no project task specified, and this causes an error. For instance, the system can add a freight transaction for an AR invoice. {br}

You have to provide mapping for the accounts that may be automatically added to project in the '''Default Task for GL Account''' table on the '''Settings''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. If the same mapping should be used for multiple similar projects, specify the rules by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_00|Project Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) form.
==Attributes for Account Groups==
You can create attributes to store additional properties of account groups that can be used in billing and in allocations. You can create attributes by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_50_00|Attributes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) form, and by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_20_00|Attributes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM202000|PM202000]) form, you can specify which of the attributes can be assigned to account groups. To assign attributes to a specific account group, use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_10_00|Account Groups] ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) form.{br}

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Account Groups in Projects An  account group  is an entity in  Acumatica ERP that you can define by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) Account Groups                 (PM201000) form and map to a subset of General Ledger accounts. In projects, the                 account group plays the same role as the General Ledger accounts do in the General                 Ledger ledger: it is used to track the project budget and balances. Account groups facilitate aggregation, tracking, control, and management of                 information related to the project budget, costs, and future revenues. Because they                 are mapped to General Ledger accounts, account groups provide transfer of the                 project-related financial information between the General Ledger and Projects                 modules. For instance, on the  Balances  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, you can view the                 budget, revised budget, and actual balance of each account group in the selected                 project.  Account Group Identifiers To configure the identifiers of account groups in  Acumatica ERP, you use the  ACCGROUP  segmented key on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) Segmented Keys                 (CS202000) form. By default, this segmented key specifies that the account group                 identifier is an alphanumeric string of up to 10 characters. If needed, you can                 divide account group identifiers into segments with specific values. For more                 information, see  Segmented Identifiers. In most cases,                 you do not need to change the default configuration of the  ACCGROUP  key.  For clarity, we recommend that you assign user-friendly identifiers to account                 groups. For instance, you can use  LABOR  as the name of the account group to                 track labor costs or  TRAVEL  as the name of the account group to track travel                 costs.  Types of Account Groups An account group can belong to one of the following types:  Asset ,                      Liability ,  Expense , or  Income . An account group of a                 particular type can be mapped to specific General Ledger accounts of only certain                 types—that is, an account group of the  Asset  or  Liability  type                 may include only asset and liability accounts, an account group of the  Income                  or  Expense  type may include accounts of any type. You can use account groups of the  Off-Balance  type to collect and track for                 projects statistical and other information that is unrelated to finance. Account                 groups of the  Off-Balance  type are not mapped to any General Ledger accounts.                 The transactions posted to account groups of this type will not update the General                 Ledger. For example, you can create an off-balance group to record all work hours                 spent by employees on the project. You may want to know the total of work hours, but                 you do not want to post those amounts to General Ledger.  Account Groups and General Ledger You can create account groups to be used in the Projects module by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) Account Groups (PM201000) form. When you define account groups, first                 identify the accounts that will be used in project-related transactions.  Accounts receivable accounts (accounts debited by project billing), accounts                 payable accounts (accounts credited by vendor bills), and cash accounts should be                 excluded.  Use the following rules to create account groups: Any single account group may include one or more General Ledger accounts;                     however, you cannot map any General Ledger account to more than one account                     group.  An account group should include accounts of only certain types (for instance, an                     account group of the  Liability  type may include only asset and liability                     accounts). When you map the accounts to account groups, consider the billing and allocation                     rules. For billing and allocation, if the transactions of two accounts should be                     processed differently, these two accounts should be included in different                     account groups. If the transactions usually use the same rate, consider                     including their accounts in one group. If for specific transactions usually                     different rates are used, consider including their accounts in different                     groups. Consider whether you need the  Off-balance  account groups that are not                     linked to General Ledger accounts and that would hold amounts not posted to                     General Ledger. For information about using account groups in this way, see the                     examples of allocation and billing rules further in the article.  By using account groups, you can view specific balances by project. For example, the                      EXPENSE  account group was created for customization projects and includes                 the following accounts:  4010 Travel Expenses 4030 Accommodation 4050 Car Rent 4113 Office Supplies 4115 Miscellaneous Expenses As the customization group arrives to the client location and the employees start                 working on the customization project, they record their expenditures related to the                 project to appropriate General Ledger accounts. The project manager can view the                 project's expenses as the balance of the  EXPENSE  account group, which is the                 total of all expenses recorded to all the expense accounts included in the                      EXPENSE  account group. Account-Task Mapping for Automatically Added Transactions When you create a document, you specify a project task for each transaction where it                 is applicable. For an automatically added transaction, however, there is no project                 task specified, and this causes an error. For instance, the system can add a freight                 transaction for an AR invoice.  You have to provide mapping for the accounts that may be automatically added to                 project in the  Default Task for GL Account  table on the                      Settings  tab on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects                 (PM301000) form. If the same mapping should be used for multiple similar                 projects, specify the rules by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) Project Templates                 (PM208000) form. Attributes for Account Groups You can create attributes to store additional properties of account groups that can                 be used in billing and in allocations. You can create attributes by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) Attributes (CS205000) form, and by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM202000|PM202000]) Attributes (PM202000) form, you can specify which of the                 attributes can be assigned to account groups. To assign attributes to a specific                 account group, use the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) Account Groups (PM201000) form.

Many organizations use projects to achieve their business objectives efficiently. An organization may have multiple projects in progress. By limiting users&rsquo; access to and visibility of information about particular projects and related transactions, managers can properly organize the work on each project. In Acumatica ERP, you can use roles to provide access to forms according to employees&rsquo; responsibilities and restriction groups to configure the visibility of particular projects only to a responsible team, as described in this topic.[anchor|#_5ad3602f-2e36-4c97-b6df-a872f38937a0]((({S:Warn}In Acumatica ERP, you can configure groups with direct and inverse restriction.

))){br}{TOC}
==Usage Scenarios==
The most common scenarios of managing the security of projects are the following:[anchor|#_8a516856-7e3b-47d3-b618-6d35760a1249]
*Managing access to forms based on functional role: Each employee involved with a project has his or her specific tasks. You can configure user roles that will provide employees access to forms of the Projects module according to their responsibilities. For details, see [[#_a1a3517d-330e-46f3-99c9-9cd175555245|Access to Forms Based on Roles].
*Managing the visibility of particular projects by user: If your organization has multiple project teams and multiple employees have the same functional responsibilities in different projects, you can make particular projects available to employees of only a particular project team by using restriction groups. For more information, see [[#_09dbf69d-67e7-47a4-a0a4-45c5feceb599|Visibility of Projects by Users].
*Managing the visibility of projects by module: If a project should be associated with transactions in a particular module (such as Accounts Payable), you can make it visible only within this module. For details, see [[#_c2eba80a-a026-4c5a-9a00-7c90b46b5c2c|Visibility of Projects by Modules].
[anchor|#_a1a3517d-330e-46f3-99c9-9cd175555245]
==Access to Forms Based on Roles==
By using the forms of the User Security module, you can configure access rights to the forms of the Projects module for each employee in accordance with the employee&rsquo;s typical responsibilities. For more information about user roles, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Role-Based_Access|Role-Based Access].{br}

For example, you can create the following roles for employees of your organization who work with projects: [anchor|#_deedce39-513e-44a0-9e1b-ce57207b4fcc]
*''Project Manager:'' A role for an employee who coordinates the project and is responsible for achieving the project goals. In the system, this person sets up pricing in projects, creates tasks, and configures projects and project templates. This role should have access to forms on the '''Configuration''' tab in the Projects module. Also, this role may have access to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) form so that the users with this role can approve projects.
*''Project Controller'': A role for an employee who controls project transactions, performs allocations, and runs project billing. This role should have full access to forms on the '''Processes''' tab of the Projects module.
*''Project Accountant'': A role for an employee who plans and executes the project budget and enters project transactions. This role should have access to forms on the '''Work Area''' tab of the Projects module.
*''Project Team Member:'' A role for an employee who works for a project and enters time sheets and time cards. This role should have access to the forms on the '''Work Area''' tab of the Projects module and to the forms on the '''Work Area''' tab of the Time and Expenses module.
[anchor|#_09dbf69d-67e7-47a4-a0a4-45c5feceb599]
==Visibility of Projects by Users==
By using the forms of the Row-Level Security module, you can configure the system to hide or display particular projects for employees, in addition to implementing task-based roles. Employees who have access to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form will be able to view or edit all the projects available in your organization. You may need to use restriction groups to restrict the visibility of specific projects to only employees of the project team. For details on restriction groups, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Overview_of_Restriction_Groups|Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP].{br}

For example, suppose that you need to restrict the visibility of projects to employees in your organization considering the following: [anchor|#_34f9b13e-28e0-4f0f-957b-7adabb9e702c]
*There are two projects in your organization: ''Project Y'' and ''Project Z''.
*User PM is a project manager who controls all projects in your organization.
*User AC is an accountant who plans budgets and performs transactions for all projects in your organization.
*Users E1 and E2 are engineers who work on ''Project Y''.
*Users E3 and E4 are engineers who work on ''Project Z''.

To configure the visibility of projects according to the listed statements, you would do the following on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_20_00|Project Access] ([~/?ScreenId=PM102000|PM102000]) form:[anchor|#_24249e5d-505a-4525-8d90-611d19b22eb9]
#You create two restriction groups of type ''A'' (with direct restriction): Group 1 for ''Project Y'' and Group 2 for ''Project Z''.
#In Group 1, you include ''Project Y'', User PM, User AC, Users E1 and E2.
#In Group 2, you include ''Project Z'', User PM, User AC, Users E3 and E4.

With the settings you have made, the visibility of projects would be the following:[anchor|#_6dc42048-6645-4acb-951f-1ca44d5c4e17]
*Users PM and AC can see both ''Project Y'' and ''Project Z''.
*Users E1 and E2 can see only ''Project Y''.
*Users E3 and E4 can see only ''Project Z''.
[anchor|#_c2eba80a-a026-4c5a-9a00-7c90b46b5c2c]
==Visibility of Projects by Modules==
After you have created a project in Acumatica ERP, the project is available system-wide by default. You can control the visibility of projects within modules in the following ways:[anchor|#_58af0770-87e6-43be-93c1-9a755b2d4ed9]
*Display or hide the '''Project''' boxes and columns on forms: If you use projects in a particular module (for example, Accounts Receivable), you can configure the system to display the boxes and columns where a user can select a project on forms only within this module. In the '''Visibility Settings''' section of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form, you can select all such modules.
*Display or hide a project: If the project transactions should be performed within a particular module (for example, Inventory), you can make the project visible only in this module so that users can select only appropriate projects when they are preparing documents. You can select modules in the '''Visibility Settings''' section of the '''General Info''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. After you have selected a module, users can select the project in documents generated on the module forms, and the release of these documents automatically updates the project data.
*Display or hide tasks of a project: If employees need to process documents related to a project in multiple modules, but the users perform particular tasks of a project in a certain module (for example, the ''Warehouse operations'' task is performed in the Inventory module and the ''Customer payments'' task is performed in the Accounts Receivable module), you can select the modules where the task will be displayed. You select these modules in the '''Visibility Settings''' section of the '''General Info''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form.

==Forms for Project Security==
In the following table, you can find the list of the forms that you can use to manage restriction groups with projects. The table also includes the tasks that you can solve by using each form.[anchor|#_6c986839-9edc-43e0-93a0-0be8ac758f29]

This role should have access to the forms on the  Work Area  tab of the Projects module and to the forms on the  Work Area  tab of the Time and Expenses module. Visibility of Projects by Users By using the forms of the Row-Level Security module, you can configure the system to hide or display particular projects for employees, in addition to implementing task-based roles. Employees who have access to the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form will be able to view or edit all the projects available in your organization. You may need to use restriction groups to restrict the visibility of specific projects to only employees of the project team. For details on restriction groups, see  Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP. For example, suppose that you need to restrict the visibility of projects to employees in your organization considering the following:  There are two projects in your organization:  Project Y  and  Project Z . User PM is a project manager who controls all projects in your organization. User AC is an accountant who plans budgets and performs transactions for all projects in your organization. Users E1 and E2 are engineers who work on  Project Y . Users E3 and E4 are engineers who work on  Project Z . To configure the visibility of projects according to the listed statements, you would do the following on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM102000|PM102000]) Project Access (PM102000) form: You create two restriction groups of type  A  (with direct restriction): Group 1 for  Project Y  and Group 2 for  Project Z . In Group 1, you include  Project Y , User PM, User AC, Users E1 and E2. In Group 2, you include  Project Z , User PM, User AC, Users E3 and E4. With the settings you have made, the visibility of projects would be the following: Users PM and AC can see both  Project Y  and  Project Z . Users E1 and E2 can see only  Project Y . Users E3 and E4 can see only  Project Z . Visibility of Projects by Modules After you have created a project in  Acumatica ERP, the project is available system-wide by default. You can control the visibility of projects within modules in the following ways: Display or hide the  Project  boxes and columns on forms: If you use projects in a particular module (for example, Accounts Receivable), you can configure the system to display the boxes and columns where a user can select a project on forms only within this module. In the  Visibility Settings  section of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form, you can select all such modules. Display or hide a project: If the project transactions should be performed within a particular module (for example, Inventory), you can make the project visible only in this module so that users can select only appropriate projects when they are preparing documents. You can select modules in the  Visibility Settings  section of the  General Info  tab on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. After you have selected a module, users can select the project in documents generated on the module forms, and the release of these documents automatically updates the project data. Display or hide tasks of a project: If employees need to process documents related to a project in multiple modules, but the users perform particular tasks of a project in a certain module (for example, the  Warehouse operations  task is performed in the Inventory module and the  Customer payments  task is performed in the Accounts Receivable module), you can select the modules where the task will be displayed. You select these modules in the  Visibility Settings  section of the  General Info  tab on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) Project Tasks (PM302000) form. Forms for Project Security In the following table, you can find the list of the forms that you can use to manage restriction groups with projects. The table also includes the tasks that you can solve by using each form.

In Acumatica ERP, you can create project templates from scratch by adding every detail that you think will be required for a typical project of specific type. Alternatively, you can create a template based on an existing project which you think is a typical representative of projects of specific type. {br}

When users create projects based on the templates, they can change any settings for particular projects—templates are used only to provide the default settings, thus making the project creation easier for users.{br}{TOC}
==Lesson Objectives==
You will learn how to:[anchor|#_e6676c13-b43e-4e59-a30d-7ffa0422a714]
*Create a project template
*Create a common task
*Create a project based on the project template
*Add a task to the project by using the common task
*Restructure a budget before and after billing
*Create a new template from the project

==Applicable Scenarios==
You create project templates and common tasks if you need to ease the creation of typical projects and typical tasks for existing projects, respectively.
==Templates Created from Existing Projects==
You can create a template based on an existing project. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, select a project that is a typical project of specific type and click '''Create Template''' from the '''Actions''' menu. A template will be created with all the tasks that were included in the project. You can modify the created template as you want. You can delete some of the tasks and add new tasks.
==Templates from Scratch==
You can create project templates from scratch by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_00|Project Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) form. {br}

When you create a project template, you can specify as many settings as you want, including the following:[anchor|#ul_h3w_blj_jn]
*'''General information''': The broad information about the projects, including the default account and subaccount, default accrual account and subaccounts, and billing period. In the '''Status''' box, you can specify whether the specific project template is available for creating new projects. You can create projects only by using project templates with the ''Active'' status. 
*'''Visibility settings''': The list of functional areas where the projects based on this template will be visible.
*'''Template tasks''': The tasks to be included in the projects based on this template. Tasks for the project template can be added by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_10|Project Template Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208010|PM208010]) form.
*'''List of employees''': The employees who will work on the projects and the project manager who will be monitoring projects of the type. You also specify labor items and hourly rates for employees working on this project. Also, you can specify whether only the listed employees can work for the project.
*'''List of equipment''': The equipment to be used for the projects with appropriate non-stock items designating setup, run, and suspend rates and respective prices specific for projects of the type. You can specify whether only the listed equipment can be used for these projects.

==Template Tasks and Common Tasks==
A project template may include tasks that are actually templates of tasks that can be included in projects based on the template. You can add task templates to the project template. {br}

 You add the tasks to the project template and specify the settings for these tasks by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_10|Project Template Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208010|PM208010]) form. When you create a new template task, you can specify whether it is automatically included in all projects based on the project template. {br}

Template task settings include the following: [anchor|#ul_a5v_54s_mn]
*'''General settings''' are overall information about the task, including approver, tax category, default subaccount, and billing period. The general settings also include ''Visibility Settings'', the list of functional areas in which this project task must be visible. You can make tasks visible only in the functional areas in which the parent project is visible—the scope for the task cannot be wider than the scope for the project.
*'''Recurring billing''' can be used to implement the flat-price scenario with recurring payments when your future project uses flat rates for services or products you provide to your customer regularly. For more information about recurring billing, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__con_Billing_Procedure|Project Billing].

When a user creates a new project based on a project template, the user can add to the new project any of the tasks associated with this project template and any of the existing common tasks. {br}

Common tasks are also templates of tasks, but they are not linked to any specific project template and, as such, can be added to any new or existing project. You can create common tasks with the help of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_30|Common Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208030|PM208030]) form. Generally, you provide the same types of settings for common tasks as for the template tasks: general, budget, and recurring billing settings. ]]></column>

The following hands-on exercise will walk you through the process of configuring project templates. You will create a common task and add this task to a project. A common task is a task that can be added to any project and that provides default settings, such as general, budget, and billing settings. You will also learn how to create a new project based on a project template, how to reestablish the budget structure of the project, and how to create a project template based on the project.[anchor|#_8e8a836f-ba36-475e-a8fc-7609775fc31d]((({S:Warn}The following activity is based on the ''U100'' dataset.

))){br}{TOC}
==Story==
Suppose that the Lake Cafe customer has ordered a juicer, along with the following services: site review, installation, and training of employees on operating the juicer. The project accountant has analyzed the past projects and realized that customers are usually doing typical fixed-price projects that involve the sale of a juicer, along with the services of installation and site review. Sometimes customers&rsquo; projects also involve training on operating the juicer. {br}

The project accountant decides to create a new project template for such a project, and to create a common task for training on operating juicers (so the task can be quickly added to projects as needed). Then the project accountant creates a project for the customer based on the created project template and common task. During the lifecycle of a project, the project accountant adjusts the project budget structure and saves the list of budget revisions for the project.{br}

You will perform the needed actions in the system, acting as the project accountant.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this lesson, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Project Accounting'' feature has been enabled to support the project accounting functionality.
==Process Overview==
You create a project template on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_00|Project Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) form. You create a common task on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_30|Common Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208030|PM208030]) form. Then you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form to create a project based on the created project template and add the common task to the project. You adjust the project budget and save project budget revisions on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form.{br}

Finally, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form to initiate the creation of a project template based on a selected project. You complete the creation of a project template on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_00|Project Templates] form.
==System Preparation==
To sign in to the system and prepare to perform the instructions of the activity, do the following:[anchor|#_6c9e4914-0e56-4fc0-9f9d-df880dcd99b6]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the U100 dataset preloaded as Pam Brawner by using the ''brawner'' login and the ''123'' password.[anchor|#_9713cff8-bfa1-4d0d-9f1d-8b7f3b02dc5b]
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select ''1/30/2020'' on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.

==Step 1. Creating a Project Template==
A project template is an entity that you select when creating a new project to auto-populate the budget, settings, and attributes of the project with default values that are appropriate for projects of the type. (You can override these values, if needed.) To create a new project template, do the following:[anchor|#_b82d266e-1e09-4588-a0b3-c9891941a196]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_00|Project Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) form, create a new project template with the following settings, as shown in the screenshot below:
#*'''Template ID''': <tt>INSTALL</tt>
#*'''Status''': ''Active''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Installation project</tt>
#*'''Summary''' tab:
#**'''Revenue Budget Level''' ('''Project Properties''' section): ''Task and Item''
#** '''Project Manager''' ('''Project Properties''' section): ''EP00000001 - Pam Brawner''
#** '''Billing Period''' ('''Billing and Allocation Settings''' section): ''On Demand''
#** '''Billing Rule''' ('''Billing and Allocation Settings''' section): ''COMBINED''[anchor|#image_alb_ppj_by][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_Templates.png|popup|Settings of the project template|450px]
#On the '''Tasks''' tab, add to the project each task listed in the following table by clicking '''Add Row''' and specifying the listed identifier and description in the row.
#:{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="50%" ! '''Task ID'''
!width="50%" !  '''Description'''
|- 
| <tt>PHASE 1</tt>
| <tt>Site review</tt>
|- 
| <tt>PHASE 2</tt>
| <tt>Installation</tt>
|}
#:By default, the system inserts ''By Billing Period'' as the '''Billing Option''' of each project task.
#On the '''Revenue Budget''' tab, add each line of the project revenue that is listed in the following table by clicking '''Add Row '''and specifying the listed settings in the row.
#:{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="25%" ! '''Project Task'''
!width="25%" !  '''Inventory ID'''
!width="25%" !  '''Original Budgeted Quantity'''
!width="25%" !  '''Unit Rate'''
|- 
|  ''PHASE 1''
|  ''SITEREVIEW''
| <tt>2.00</tt>
| <tt>50.00</tt>
|- 
| ''PHASE 2''
|  ''JUICER10''
| <tt>1.00</tt>
| <tt>1,500.00</tt>
|- 
| ''PHASE 2''
|  ''INSTALL''
| <tt>4.00</tt>
| <tt>100.00</tt>
|}
#:For each line, the system inserts ''REVENUE'' as the '''Account Group''' because the ''REVENUE'' account group is the only account group of the income type.
#Save your changes to the project template.
#:When you save the project template, the system automatically creates project template tasks corresponding to the tasks you have added to the project template.
#On the '''Tasks''' tab, in the '''Task ID''' column, click the ''PHASE 1'' link to open the task on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_10|Project Template Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208010|PM208010]) form.
#:On the '''Summary''' tab of this form, which the system has opened in a pop-up window, notice that the '''Automatically Include in Project''' check box is selected by default. (See the following screenshot.) With this setting, the project template task will be automatically included in any project created based on the associated project template.[anchor|#image_lbk_4pb_3cb][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_Templates2.png|popup|The project template task|450px]

You have created a project template and project template tasks. In the next step, you will create a common task.
==Step 2. Creating a Common Task==
A common task is a task that can be added to any new or existing project (unlike a project template task, which is associated with just one project template). To create a common task, perform the following instructions:[anchor|#_9f5808af-1653-4d47-98c6-e4c568c2872a]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_30|Common Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208030|PM208030]) form, create a new common task with the following settings:
#*'''Task ID''': <tt>TRAINING</tt>
#*'''Description''': <tt>Training on juicer usage</tt>
#On the '''Budget''' tab, add a budget line with the following settings, as shown in the screenshot below: 
#*'''Account Group''' ''LABOR''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''TRAINING''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Training on juicer usage</tt>
#*'''UOM''': ''HOUR''
#* '''Unit Rate''': <tt>50</tt>[anchor|#_30626444-24a9-494c-a379-f11ae3023182][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_Templates4.png|popup|The common task|450px]
#Save your changes to the common task.

You have created a common task. In the next step, you will create a project based on the project template you have created.
==Step 3. Creating a Project Based on the Project Template==
You can use the active template you have created to quickly create a new project based on this template. To create a project based on template, do the following:[anchor|#_e439e111-d177-4d9e-a954-236f391c4ce1]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, create a project, and specify the following settings: 
#*'''Project ID''': <tt>INSTLAKE</tt>
#*'''Customer''': ''LAKECAFE - Lake Cafe''
#* '''Template''': ''INSTALL - Installation project''
#:When you select the project template, the system fills in the relevant elements of the project with the settings specified for the template, including tasks and revenue budget lines.
#In the Summary area, enter <tt>Installation project for Lake Cafe</tt> as the '''Description''' of the project.
#On the table toolbar of the '''Tasks''' tab, click '''Activate Tasks''' to change the status of the added tasks to ''Active''.
#On the '''Revenue Budget''' tab, specify the settings in the following table as the revenue budget lines; these settings establish the original budgeted quantities of each task and inventory item.
#:{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="33%" ! '''Project Task'''
!width="33%" !  '''Inventory ID'''
!width="33%" !  '''Original Budgeted Quantity'''
|- 
|  ''PHASE 1''
|  ''SITEREVIEW''
| <tt>4.00</tt>
|- 
| ''PHASE 2''
|  ''INSTALL''
| <tt>8.00</tt>
|- 
| ''PHASE 2''
|  ''JUICER10''
| <tt>2.00</tt>
|}
#:When you enter the '''Original Budgeted Quantity''', the system automatically calculates the '''Original Budgeted Amount''' as the '''Original Budgeted Quantity''' multiplied by the '''Unit Rate'''.
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and save the project (which now has the ''Active'' status).

You have created the project based on the project template. In the next step, you will add the common task to the project.
==Step 4. Adding the Common Task to the Project==
The common task that you have created in this lesson can be easily added to any project. To add it to the ''CUST1'' project, perform the following instruction:[anchor|#_d05565b0-3374-47f9-8664-70ae04d0cd95]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''INSTLAKE'' project.
#On the table toolbar of the '''Tasks''' tab, click '''Add Common Tasks'''.
#In the '''Add Tasks''' dialog box, which has opened in a pop-up window, all common tasks are listed. Select the check box in the unlabeled column for the line with the ''TRAINING'' common task, as shown in the following screenshot, and click '''Add Common Tasks'''.
#:The system adds the common task to the project and closes the dialog box.[anchor|#_e60cbc62-80f8-4443-a06c-42e15e4d0975][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_Templates6.png|popup|Selection of the common task for the project|300px]
#On the '''Tasks''' tab, select ''Active'' as the '''Status''' of the ''TRAINING'' task (which you just added).
#On the '''Cost Budget''' tab, make sure that the line with the ''TRAINING'' common task has been successfully added to the budget.
#Save your changes to the project.

You have added the common task to the project. In the next step, you will restructure the revenue budget of the project.
==Step 5. Restructuring the Project Budget==
Each particular project, even one based on a template, is unique and might require various changes. Also, the lifecycle of a project can lead to adjustments to your project budget structure and require you to store the list of budget revisions. To restructure the project budget and save the original version of the budget, do the following:[anchor|#_1216a88d-831f-4bdc-8268-3a784f5aaab3]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''INSTLAKE'' project.
#To create a backup of the original revenue budget of the project, do the following:
##On the table toolbar of the '''Revenue Budget''' tab, click '''Export to Excel''' ([image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_ExportToExcel.png|Selection of the common task for the project]).
##:The system exports the revenue budget to an Excel file.
##On your computer, locate the created file, and rename it to <tt>INSTLAKE&#95;Revenue&#95;Budget.xlsx</tt>.
#To attach to the project the file with the exported revenue budget, do the following:
##On the form title bar, click '''Files'''.
##In the '''Files''' dialog box, which has opened in a pop-up window, click '''Browse''', and open the <tt>INSTLAKE&#95;Revenue&#95;Budget.xlsx</tt> file.
##Click '''Upload''' to upload the selected file.
##:The system uploads the selected file to the project and shows the file in the table of the dialog box.
##In the line with the uploaded <tt>INSTLAKE&#95;Revenue&#95;Budget.xlsx</tt> file, click the ''Edit'' link, which is shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_ba0646d0-b3c9-4e97-81ab-26b6fe8550a9][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_Templates8.png|popup|Selection of the common task for the project|300px]
##:On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_10|File Maintenance] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202510|SM202510]) form, which has opened in a new tab, you can check the document revision, upload a new version of the document, or delete the document.
##On the '''Versions''' tab, enter <tt>The original revenue budget of the project</tt> in the '''Comment''' column for the uploaded file, as shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_9b62de61-3599-4dea-8056-3f7877e06eb2][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_Templates9.png|popup|The comment on the uploaded file|450px]
##Save your changes to the file.
#To upload a new revision of the revenue budget of the project to the file with the original revenue budget, do the following:
##On the form toolbar click '''Upload New Version'''.
##In the '''File Upload''' dialog box, which has opened in a pop-up window, click '''Choose File''', and open the <tt>INSTLAKE&#95;Revenue&#95;Budget&#95;1.xlsx</tt> file, which is provided with the training materials.
##Click '''Upload''' to upload the selected file.
##:The system uploads the selected file as a new file version and closes the dialog box.
##On the '''Versions''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_10|File Maintenance] form, enter <tt>Revision 1</tt> in the '''Comment''' column for the uploaded file with a '''Version ID''' of ''2'', as shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_3ffc85bf-013b-441e-8973-883ccf9fd3b5][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_Templates10.png|popup|A new revision of the uploaded file|450px]
##Save your changes to the file, and close the browser tab with the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_10|File Maintenance] form.
#Go back to the browser tab with the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, and close the '''Files''' dialog box.
#On the '''Revenue Budget''' tab, click the topmost line in the table, and on the table toolbar, click '''Delete Row''' ([image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_DeleteRow.png|A new revision of the uploaded file]). Repeat this for each revenue budget line until you have deleted all the revenue budget lines of the project.
#On the '''Summary''' tab ('''Project Properties''' section), select ''Task'' as the '''Revenue Budget Level'''.
#On the table toolbar of the '''Revenue Budget''' tab, click '''Load Records from File''' ([image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_LoadRecordsfromFile.png|A new revision of the uploaded file]), and upload the revenue budget from the <tt>INSTLAKE&#95;Revenue&#95;Budget&#95;1.xlsx</tt> file. While you are uploading the lines, leave the default column mapping.
#:The revenue budget of the project with the uploaded lines should look like the revenue budget shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#image_alb_zzj_by][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_Templates11.png|popup|The revenue budget of the project uploaded from the Excel file|450px]
#Save your changes to the project.

You have restructured the revenue budget of the project and attached budget revisions to the project. In the next step, you will bill the project.
==Step 6. Billing the Project==
To process the transactions of this project and bill the project, do the following:[anchor|#_aae7eb57-9fae-4f8a-9a1a-c76b6b817ea3]
#On the toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) form, click '''Add a New Record''' ([image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_AddNewRecord.png|The revenue budget of the project uploaded from the Excel file]) to create a new batch of transactions, and in the Summary area, specify <tt>The INSTLAKE project: training</tt> as the '''Description'''.
#On the table toolbar, click '''Load Records from File''' ([image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_LoadRecordsfromFile.png|The revenue budget of the project uploaded from the Excel file]), and upload the transactions from the <tt>INSTLAKE&#95;Project&#95;Transactions.xlsx</tt> file. While you are uploading the lines, leave the default column mapping.
#:The '''Total Amount''' in the Summary area of the form should be ''3,680.00''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save''' to save the project transactions, and then click '''Release''' to release them.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''INSTLAKE'' project, and make sure that the system has updated the cost budget of the project. The '''Expenses''' box in the Summary area of the form should now contain ''3,680.00''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Run Project Billing'''. The system has created a pro forma invoice, which should look like that shown in the following screenshot, and opened it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form.[anchor|#image_x3z_fcf_gcb][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_Templates12.png|popup|The pro forma invoice created during the billing|450px]
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and on the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the pro forma invoice. The system creates the accounts receivable invoice based on the pro forma invoice and assigns the ''Closed'' status to the pro forma invoice.
#On the '''Financial Details''' tab, click the link in the '''AR Ref. Nbr.''' box to open the created accounts receivable invoice.
#In the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form, which the system has opened in a pop-up window, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and on the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the accounts receivable invoice.

You have billed the project. In the next step, you will restructure the revenue budget of the project again.
==Step 7. Restructuring the Project Budget After Billing==
Suppose that after the billing you realized that you needed an extra level of detail of the revenue budget. To perform one more budget revision after billing, do the following:[anchor|#_de8ae040-9872-409a-8394-4859807e3506]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''INSTLAKE'' project.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Project Templates and Common Tasks: Process Activity The following hands-on exercise will walk you through the process of configuring                 project templates. You will create a common task and add this task to a project. A                 common task is a task that can be added to any project and that provides default                 settings, such as general, budget, and billing settings. You will also learn how to                 create a new project based on a project template, how to reestablish the budget                 structure of the project, and how to create a project template based on the                 project. The following activity is based on the                  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system settings             have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the activity             and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100  dataset             to its initial state. Story Suppose that the Lake Cafe customer has ordered a juicer, along with the following                 services: site review, installation, and training of employees on operating the                 juicer. The project accountant has analyzed the past projects and realized that                 customers are usually doing typical fixed-price projects that involve the sale of a                 juicer, along with the services of installation and site review. Sometimes                 customers' projects also involve training on operating the juicer.  The project accountant decides to create a new project template for such a project,                 and to create a common task for training on operating juicers (so the task can be                 quickly added to projects as needed). Then the project accountant creates a project                 for the customer based on the created project template and common task.                  During                 the lifecycle of a project, the project accountant adjusts the project budget                 structure and saves the list of budget revisions for the                 project. You will perform the needed actions in the system, acting as the project                 accountant. Configuration Overview For the purposes of this lesson, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000)                 form, the  Project Accounting  feature has been enabled to support the project                 accounting functionality. Process Overview You create a project template on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) Project Templates (PM208000) form.                 You create a common task on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM208030|PM208030]) Common Tasks (PM208030) form.                 Then you use the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form to create a project                 based on the created project template and add the common task to the project. You                 adjust the project budget and save project budget revisions on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form. Finally, you use the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form to initiate the creation of                 a project template based on a selected project. You complete the creation of a                 project template on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) Project Templates form. System Preparation To sign in to the system and prepare to perform the instructions of the activity, do                 the following: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the U100 dataset preloaded as Pam                     Brawner by using the  brawner  login and the  123  password. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP             screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to  1/30/2020. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and             select  1/30/2020 on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and             process all documents in the system during this business date. Step 1. Creating a Project Template A project template is an entity that you select when creating a new project to                 auto-populate the budget, settings, and attributes of the project with default                 values that are appropriate for projects of the type. (You can override these                 values, if needed.) To create a new project template, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) Project Templates (PM208000) form, create a new project                     template with the following settings, as shown in the screenshot below: Template ID :  INSTALL Status :  Active Description :  Installation                                 project Summary  tab: Revenue Budget Level  ( Project                                         Properties  section):  Task and Item Project Manager  ( Project                                         Properties  section):  EP00000001 - Pam                                         Brawner Billing Period  ( Billing and                                         Allocation Settings  section):  On                                     Demand Billing Rule  ( Billing and                                         Allocation Settings  section):                                      COMBINED Settings of the project template On the  Tasks  tab, add to the project each task listed in                     the following table by clicking  Add Row  and specifying                     the listed identifier and description in the row. Task ID Description PHASE 1 Site review PHASE 2 Installation By default, the system inserts  By Billing Period  as the                              Billing Option  of each project task. On the  Revenue Budget  tab, add each line of the project                     revenue that is listed in the following table by clicking  Add Row                      and specifying the listed settings in the row. Project Task Inventory ID Original Budgeted Quantity Unit Rate PHASE 1 SITEREVIEW 2.00 50.00 PHASE 2 JUICER10 1.00 1,500.00 PHASE 2 INSTALL 4.00 100.00 For each line, the system inserts  REVENUE  as the                              Account Group  because the  REVENUE  account                         group is the only account group of the income type. Save your changes to the project template. When you save the project template,                         the system automatically creates project template tasks corresponding to the                         tasks you have added to the project template. On the  Tasks  tab, in the  Task ID                      column, click the  PHASE 1  link to open the task on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM208010|PM208010]) Project Template Tasks (PM208010) form. On the                              Summary  tab of this form, which the system has                         opened in a pop-up window, notice that the  Automatically Include                             in Project  check box is selected by default. (See the                         following screenshot.) With this setting, the project template task will be                         automatically included in any project created based on the associated                         project template. The project template task You have created a project template and project template tasks. In the next step, you                 will create a common task. Step 2. Creating a Common Task A common task is a task that can be added to any new or existing project (unlike a                 project template task, which is associated with just one project template). To                 create a common task, perform the following instructions: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM208030|PM208030]) Common Tasks (PM208030) form, create a new common task                     with the following settings: Task ID :  TRAINING Description :  Training on juicer                                 usage On the  Budget  tab, add a budget line with the following                     settings, as shown in the screenshot below:  Account Group LABOR Inventory ID :  TRAINING Description :  Training on juicer                                 usage UOM :  HOUR Unit Rate :  50 The common task Save your changes to the common task. You have created a common task. In the next step, you will create a project based on                 the project template you have created. Step 3. Creating a Project Based on the Project Template You can use the active template you have created to quickly create a new project                 based on this template. To create a project based on template, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, create a project, and                     specify the following settings:  Project ID :  INSTLAKE Customer :  LAKECAFE - Lake Cafe Template :  INSTALL - Installation                             project When you select the project template, the system fills in the relevant                         elements of the project with the settings specified for the template,                         including tasks and revenue budget lines. In the Summary area, enter  Installation project for Lake                         Cafe  as the  Description  of the                     project. On the table toolbar of the  Tasks  tab, click                          Activate Tasks  to change the status of the added                     tasks to  Active . On the  Revenue Budget  tab, specify the settings in the                     following table as the revenue budget lines; these settings establish the                     original budgeted quantities of each task and inventory item. Project Task Inventory ID Original Budgeted Quantity PHASE 1 SITEREVIEW 4.00 PHASE 2 INSTALL 8.00 PHASE 2 JUICER10 2.00 When you enter the  Original Budgeted Quantity ,                         the system automatically calculates the  Original Budgeted                             Amount  as the  Original Budgeted                             Quantity  multiplied by the  Unit                         Rate . In the Summary area, clear the  Hold  check box, and save                     the project (which now has the  Active  status). You have created the project based on the project template. In the next step, you                 will add the common task to the project. Step 4. Adding the Common Task to the Project The common task that you have created in this lesson can be easily added to any                 project. To add it to the  CUST1  project, perform the following                 instruction: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, open the  INSTLAKE                      project. On the table toolbar of the  Tasks  tab, click                          Add Common Tasks . In the  Add Tasks  dialog box, which has opened in a pop-up                     window, all common tasks are listed. Select the check box in the unlabeled                     column for the line with the  TRAINING  common task, as shown in the                     following screenshot, and click  Add Common Tasks . The                         system adds the common task to the project and closes the dialog                         box. Selection of the common task for the project On the  Tasks  tab, select  Active  as the                          Status  of the  TRAINING  task (which you just                     added). On the  Cost Budget  tab, make sure that the line with the                          TRAINING  common task has been successfully added to the budget. Save your changes to the project. You have added the common task to the project. In the next step, you will restructure                 the revenue budget of the project. Step 5. Restructuring the Project Budget Each particular project, even one based on a template, is unique and might require                 various changes. Also, the lifecycle of a project can lead to adjustments to your                 project budget structure and require you to store the list of budget revisions. To                 restructure the project budget and save the original version of the budget, do the                 following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, open the  INSTLAKE                      project. To create a backup of the original revenue budget of the project, do the                         following: On the table toolbar of the  Revenue Budget  tab,                             click  Export to Excel  ( ). The system exports                                 the revenue budget to an Excel file. On your computer, locate the created file, and rename it to                                  INSTLAKE_Revenue_Budget.xlsx . To attach to the project the file with the exported revenue budget, do the                         following: On the form title bar, click  Files . In the  Files  dialog box, which has opened in a                             pop-up window, click  Browse , and open the                                  INSTLAKE_Revenue_Budget.xlsx  file. Click  Upload  to upload the selected file. The                                 system uploads the selected file to the project and shows the file                                 in the table of the dialog box. In the line with the uploaded                                  INSTLAKE_Revenue_Budget.xlsx  file, click the                                  Edit  link, which is shown in the following screenshot. Selection of the common task for the project On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202510|SM202510]) File Maintenance (SM202510) form, which                                 has opened in a new tab, you can check the document revision, upload                                 a new version of the document, or delete the document. On the  Versions  tab, enter  The                                 original revenue budget of the project  in the                                  Comment  column for the uploaded file, as                             shown in the following screenshot. The comment on the uploaded file Save your changes to the file. To upload a new revision of the revenue budget of the project to the file with                     the original revenue budget, do the following: On the form toolbar click  Upload New                             Version . In the  File Upload  dialog box, which has opened                             in a pop-up window, click  Choose File , and open                             the  INSTLAKE_Revenue_Budget_1.xlsx  file, which is                             provided with the training materials. Click  Upload  to upload the selected file. The                                 system uploads the selected file as a new file version and closes                                 the dialog box. On the  Versions  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202510|SM202510]) File Maintenance form, enter  Revision                                 1  in the  Comment  column for the                             uploaded file with a  Version ID  of  2 , as                             shown in the following screenshot. A new revision of the uploaded file Save your changes to the file, and close the browser tab with the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202510|SM202510]) File Maintenance form. Go back to the browser tab with the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, and                     close the  Files  dialog box. On the  Revenue Budget  tab, click the topmost line in the                     table, and on the table toolbar, click  Delete Row  ( ). Repeat this for each revenue                     budget line until you have deleted all the revenue budget lines of the                     project. On the  Summary  tab ( Project                         Properties  section), select  Task  as the                          Revenue Budget Level . On the table toolbar of the  Revenue Budget  tab, click                          Load Records from File  ( ), and upload the revenue budget from the                          INSTLAKE_Revenue_Budget_1.xlsx  file. While you are                     uploading the lines, leave the default column mapping. The revenue budget of                         the project with the uploaded lines should look like the revenue budget                         shown in the following screenshot. The revenue budget of the project uploaded from the Excel                             file Save your changes to the project. You have restructured the revenue budget of the project and attached budget revisions                 to the project. In the next step, you will bill the project. Step 6. Billing the Project To process the transactions of this project and bill the project, do the                 following: On the toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) Project Transactions (PM304000) form, click                          Add a New Record  ( ) to create a new batch of                     transactions, and in the Summary area, specify  The INSTLAKE project:                         training  as the  Description . On the table toolbar, click  Load Records from File                          ( ), and upload the transactions from the                          INSTLAKE_Project_Transactions.xlsx  file. While you are                     uploading the lines, leave the default column mapping. The  Total                             Amount  in the Summary area of the form should be                              3,680.00 . On the form toolbar, click  Save  to save the project                     transactions, and then click  Release  to release                     them. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, open the  INSTLAKE                      project, and make sure that the system has updated the cost budget of the                     project. The  Expenses  box in the Summary area of the form                     should now contain  3,680.00 . On the form toolbar, click  Run Project Billing . The                     system has created a pro forma invoice, which should look like that shown in the                     following screenshot, and opened it on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices                     (PM307000) form.

Because pricing is so important in managing projects, you can use the functionality of the Projects module to properly balance project revenues and costs. To ensure that business outcomes are met and the project budget is used effectively, you must establish an adequate pricing model. {br}{TOC}
==Rate Table==
A ''rate table'' is a mechanism the system uses to determine a specific value, ''rate'', for a particular transaction to be processed with the help of allocation rules. The table includes rates for all combinations of factors that might affect the rate, such as particular tasks, account groups, equipment used, inventory items involved, employees participating, and dates. Also, you can define separate rate sets for specific steps in allocation rules where the rates will be used (by using different rate types for different steps). The rate—that is, the value returned by the rate table for each transaction—can be referred to in the formulas of the allocation rules as ''@Rate'' and can be used as a multiplier, addend, or constant. For instance, to implement a price model that estimates the project price as its total costs plus 10 percent, you can define a rate of 1.1 in the appropriate rate table and calculate the project price as the total cost multiplied by this rate (''@Rate''=1.1). Also, you can define the rate of an employee to be applied for a specific task only.{br}

You can create one rate table to be used for all projects or multiple tables to be used for different projects. ((({S:Warn}If you want to define rates of different types—such as expressed as factors (1.2, 1.0, 0.2), defined as amounts ($1000), or defined as rates ($100 per hour)—create a separate rate table for each type. 
)))
==Rate Table Configuration==You fully configure a rate table in four stages by using the following forms:[anchor|#ol_xdv_ctn_3n]
#[HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_42_00|Rate Tables] ([~/?ScreenId=PM204200|PM204200]): To create a rate table. Initially, you just create an empty container for a new rate table; later, on another form, you will specify the rates and date ranges.
#[HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_41_00|Rate Types] ([~/?ScreenId=PM204100|PM204100]): To create rate types; during this stage, too, you are actually creating empty containers for the rate types. Consider a ''rate type'' as a new dimension in the same table. Typically, different rates are used to allocate labor costs, revenues, and expenses. At this stage, you plan only how many and which rate types you will need; later, when you create allocation rules, you will assign different rate types to different steps of allocation rules, so that you can define step-specific rates. 
#[HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_50_00|Rate Lookup Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM205000|PM205000]): To create ''sequences'', each of which is a set of factors. Any combination of the following factors can be specified for a sequence: ''Project'', ''Project task'', ''Account group'', ''Inventory item'', and ''Employee''. For instance, if you include ''Project'' in a sequence, you will be able to define a special rate for a particular project or group of projects in the rate table. If you have two or more projects (or groups of projects) with different rates, create the same number of sequences or consider using different rate codes with the same sequence. For details, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__con_Rate_Codes_and_Pricing_Rates|Rate Tables: Usage and Configuration Examples].
#[HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_60_00|Rate Tables] ([~/?ScreenId=PM206000|PM206000]): To actually specify the rates (with their date ranges) for each sequence—that is, for each combination of particular factors. You can define rate codes on the fly to define multiple rates for the same sequence.

==Rate Lookup Sequences==
For rate tables, sequences include multiple factors that may affect the rates. You define sequences by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_50_00|Rate Lookup Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM205000|PM205000]) form as follows: [anchor|#ul_l1h_h3t_bm]
*A sequence defines which of the factors affect the rate: projects, project tasks, employees, account groups, or inventory items. If, for example, tasks are a factor, special rates can be applied to particular tasks, or to particular tasks of particular projects if particular employees work on the tasks.
*The numeric identifiers of the sequences are important because they define the order in which the system uses the sequences to find the rate. Starting with the first sequence (the one with the smallest number), the system matches the factors specified on the transactions to the factors defined by a current sequence, and if the factors match, assigns the rate to the ''@Rate'' parameter. If the factors do not match, the system applies the next sequence (by its number). If the system doesn&rsquo;t find matching factors for the last sequence, it will operate according to the option selected for the particular step of the allocation rules. (You can select from the following options: ''Set @Rate to 1'', ''Set @Rate to 0'', ''Raise Error'', and ''Do not allocate''.)

A rate table may include different sets of sequences for different rate types. 
==Rate Codes==
A ''rate code'' is an additional dimension in a rate table that you can use to more easily configure a rate table. By using rate codes, you can reduce for each rate table-rate type pair the number of sequences you would otherwise create to specify all the required different rates. {br}

For example, suppose that you want to define a specific rate for each employee working on a project. You have two possible ways to create such rates:[anchor|#ol_tv5_gr3_hm]
*Create as many sequences with the '''Employee''' check box selected as there are employees to have a separate rate. In the rate table, enter one rate code for all these sequences. For each sequence, select a particular employee and enter the rate.
*Create only one sequence with the '''Employee''' check box selected. In the rate table, for each employee with a specific rate, enter a separate rate code, select the employee, and enter the rate for this employee.

The total number of code-sequence combinations are the same with both ways; however, with the second way (by using rate codes), you can reuse the same sequence to define multiple rates. Notice that even with different rate codes, combinations of particular factors should be unique within a sequence. When searching for rates, the system looks through all rate codes. 
==Rate Specification==
By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_60_00|Rate Tables] ([~/?ScreenId=PM206000|PM206000]) form, you can finally fill in the rate table for each rate type that you are going to use in the allocation rules. Enter rates with the date range during which the rates are effective and, on tabs for different types of factors (that appear if they were defined in the rate lookup rules), specify particular factors, such as projects, tasks, employees, items, or account groups. ((({S:Warn}The rate application condition is defined as follows: Conditions on particular projects, items, employees, or account groups are joined by OR operators, while conditions on different rate factors are joined by AND operators. For instance, a special rate is valid for tasks 1, 2, 3 of Project 1 and Project 2 if employees JOHN or JACK are involved. The resulting condition is expressed as follows.
{{{{ ((Project=Project1) OR (Project=Project2))AND  
((Employee=JOHN) OR (Employee=JACK))AND
((Task=Task1) OR (Task=Task2)OR(Task=Task3))
 
}}}}
)))((({S:Hint}
You can use the ''@Rate'' value as a multiplier, an addend, or a constant. However, be consistent when you specify rates for different sequences for the same rate type— the meaning of all the rates should be the same, because all values are used in the same way in the same formula in allocation rules. 
)))
==Example of Rate Table Definition (One Rate Code)==
In this example, we will define the rates to be used to allocate labor costs in various projects. We will define sequences and rates for the rate type ''LABORRATE'', which is intended for labor cost allocations. {br}

Suppose that company employees Tom and John install home ventilation systems in a new house that was built by a construction company. The default rate for Tom, a senior specialist, is $45 per hour, while for John, a junior specialist, the rate is $30. {br}

For the ''New House'' project (which is currently a standard project for the company), the rates of both employees do not change. In allocations, we will use the multiplier 1.0. The rate sequence is defined as follows.[anchor|#table_mkm_jfv_gm]

|}
With this sequence defined, the system will use @Rate=1.0 on allocation of all labor transactions on and after February 1, 2013. In allocation rules, we will use the rate (''@Rate'') as a multiplier for employees&rsquo; default rates.
==Project-Specific Rates==
Imagine that the company discussed in the previous section takes on a new project, installing a ventilation system in a new office building. The project should be completed in a month, although it is the coldest time of the year and the building has no heating system. To take into account these uncomfortable working conditions, the project manager will increase employee rates by 50%. The rate sequences will be defined as follows.[anchor|#table_t3w_5gv_gm]

Imagine that the company later gets a contract for installing the ventilation system for an old brick house. For this project, employee experience and skills are important. Tom, as a more experienced worker, will have twice his usual rate. The following sequence should be added.[anchor|#table_p1g_ljv_gm]

| 1.0
|}
Thus, the system will apply a rate of 2.0 to transactions based on Tom&rsquo;s time card if they are related to the Old House project or a rate of 1.5 if they are related to the Office Building project, while the system will apply a rate of 1.0 to John&rsquo;s transactions unless they are related to the Office Building project (with rate of 1.5 for John).{br}

According to sequence 200 in the rate table, on the Old House project, the system will use a rate of 2.0 for Tom. On this project, according to sequence 999, the system will use a rate of 1.0 for John. ((({S:Warn}Notice that the reference number of sequences is important, because sequences are applied in the order of their numbers, from low to high. Sequence 999 does not check for projects, and if it exchanges numbers with the sequence 500, on the Office Building project, the system would use a rate of 1.0 for both Tom and John, because the system would stop on the sequence 500 and would not check the sequence 999. 
)))
==Example of Rate Table Definition (Multiple Rate Codes)==
In this example, we will define rates to be used in various projects and demonstrate how to use rate codes. We will define sequences and rates for the rate type ''LABORRATE'', which is intended for labor cost allocations. {br}

Suppose that company employees Tom and John again install home ventilation systems in new and old houses and in office buildings. These employees have different rates on all projects. There are three projects: one for a new house, one for an old house, and one for an office building. We need to create six sequences (specified in the following table) because for each project, we need to specify two different rates: one for Tom and another for John. [anchor|#table_ycx_2kk_hm]

With this many similar sequences, it would be easy to make a mistake and specify incorrect rates. By using rate codes, we can simplify the table setup. We will create only two sequences (indicated in the following table).[anchor|#table_vkc_nmk_hm]

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Rate Tables: Usage and Configuration Examples Because pricing is so important in managing projects, you can use the functionality 				of the Projects module to properly balance project revenues and costs. To ensure 				that business outcomes are met and the project budget is used effectively, you must 				establish an adequate pricing model.  Rate Table A  rate table  is a mechanism the system uses to determine a specific value,  rate , 				for a particular transaction to be processed with the help of allocation rules. The 				table includes rates for all combinations of factors that might affect the rate, 				such as particular tasks, account groups, equipment used, inventory items involved, 				employees participating, and dates. Also, you can define separate rate sets for 				specific steps in allocation rules where the rates will be used (by using different 				rate types for different steps). The rate—that is, the value returned by the 				rate table for each transaction—can be referred to in the formulas of the 				allocation rules as  @Rate  and can be used as a multiplier, addend, or 				constant. For instance, to implement a price model that estimates the project price 				as its total costs plus 10 percent, you can define a rate of 1.1 in the appropriate 				rate table and calculate the project price as the total cost multiplied by this rate 					( @Rate =1.1). Also, you can define the rate of an employee to be 				applied for a specific task only. You can create one rate table to be used for all projects or multiple tables to be 				used for different projects.  If you want to define rates of different types—such as expressed as factors (1.2, 1.0, 				0.2), defined as amounts ($1000), or defined as rates ($100 per hour)—create a 				separate rate table for each type.  Rate Table Configuration You fully configure a rate table in four 			stages by using the following forms:  ([~/?ScreenId=PM204200|PM204200]) Rate Tables (PM204200): To create a rate table. 					Initially, you just create an empty container for a new rate table; later, on 					another form, you will specify the rates and date ranges.

Consider a  rate type  as a new dimension in the same table. Typically, 					different rates are used to allocate labor costs, revenues, and expenses. At 					this stage, you plan only how many and which rate types you will need; later, 					when you create allocation rules, you will assign different rate types to 					different steps of allocation rules, so that you can define step-specific rates.

Any combination of the following factors can be 					specified for a sequence:  Project ,  Project task ,  Account 						group ,  Inventory item , and  Employee . For instance, if you 					include  Project  in a sequence, you will be able to define a special rate 					for a particular project or group of projects in the rate table. If you have two 					or more projects (or groups of projects) with different rates, create the same 					number of sequences or consider using different rate codes with the same 					sequence. For details, see  Rate Tables: Usage and Configuration Examples.

If the factors do not match, the system applies the next sequence (by 					its number). If the system doesn't find matching factors for the last sequence, 					it will operate according to the option selected for the particular step of the 					allocation rules. (You can select from the following options:  Set @Rate to 						1 ,  Set @Rate to 0 ,  Raise Error , and  Do not 					allocate .) A rate table may include different sets of sequences for different rate types.  Rate Codes A  rate code  is an additional dimension in a rate table that you can use to more easily 				configure a rate table.

  You can use the  @Rate  value as a multiplier, an addend, or a constant. 					However, be consistent when you specify rates for different sequences for the 					same rate type— the meaning of all the rates should be the same, because 					all values are used in the same way in the same formula in allocation rules. 				 Example of Rate Table Definition (One Rate Code) In this example, we 				will define the rates to be used to allocate labor costs in various projects.

For the  New 					House  project (which is currently a standard project for the company), the 				rates of both employees do not change. In allocations, we will use the multiplier 				1.0. The rate sequence is defined as follows.  Sequence Account Group Project Task Inventory Employee Description  999 False False False False True Default Rates (New House) The rate table will include one row, as follows.  Sequence Employees Start Date @Rate  999 Tom, John  1 Feb 2013  1.00 With this sequence defined, the system will use @Rate=1.0 on allocation of 				all labor transactions on and after February 1, 2013. In allocation rules, we will 				use the rate ( @Rate ) as a multiplier for employees' default 			rates. Project-Specific Rates Imagine that the company discussed in the 				previous section takes on a new project, installing a ventilation system in a new 				office building. The project should be completed in a month, although it is the 				coldest time of the year and the building has no heating system. To take into 				account these uncomfortable working conditions, the project manager will increase 				employee rates by 50%. The rate sequences will be defined as follows.

For this project, employee experience and skills are 				important. Tom, as a more experienced worker, will have twice his usual rate. The 				following sequence should be added.

According to sequence 200 in the rate table, on the Old 				House project, the system will use a rate of 2.0 for Tom. On this project, according 				to sequence 999, the system will use a rate of 1.0 for John.  Notice that 				the reference number of sequences is important, because sequences are applied in the 				order of their numbers, from low to high. Sequence 999 does not check for projects, 				and if it exchanges numbers with the sequence 500, on the Office Building project, 				the system would use a rate of 1.0 for both Tom and John, because the system would 				stop on the sequence 500 and would not check the sequence 999.  Example of Rate Table Definition (Multiple Rate Codes) In this example, 				we will define rates to be used in various projects and demonstrate how to use rate 				codes. We will define sequences and rates for the rate type  LABORRATE , which 				is intended for labor cost allocations.  Suppose that company employees Tom 				and John again install home ventilation systems in new and old houses and in office 				buildings. These employees have different rates on all projects. There are three 				projects: one for a new house, one for an old house, and one for an office building. 				We need to create six sequences (specified in the following table) because for each 				project, we need to specify two different rates: one for Tom and another for John. 					  Sequence Account Group Project Task Inventory Employee Description  150 False True False False True Office Building, Tom  200 False True False False True Office Building, John  350 False True False False True Old House, Tom  400 False True False False True Old House, John  550 False False False False True New House, Tom  600 False False False False True New House, John The rate table will include the following six rates.  Sequence Projects Employees Start Date @Rate  150 Old House Tom 1 Feb 2013  2.0  200 Old House John 1 Feb 2013  1.3  350 Office Building Tom 13 Nov 2013  1.75  400 Office Building  John  1 Nov 2013  1.25  550 New House Tom 1 Feb 2013  1.5  600 New House John 1 Feb 2013  1.1 With this many similar sequences, it would be easy to make a mistake and 				specify incorrect rates. By using rate codes, we can simplify the table setup. We 				will create only two sequences (indicated in the following table).  Sequence Account Group Project Task Inventory Employee Description  150 False True False False True  Tom  200 False True False False True John When creating the rate table, we will use the same two sequences with three 				different rate codes— HIGH ,  MEDIUM , and 				 STANDARD —that designate the three different levels of rates for both 				employees.  Rate Code  Sequence Projects Employees Start Date @Rate HIGH 150 Old House Tom 13 Nov 2013  2.0 HIGH 200 Old House  John  1 Nov 2013  1.3 MEDIUM 150 Office Building Tom 1 Feb 2013  1.75 MEDIUM 200 Office Building John 1 Feb 2013  1.25 STANDARD 150 New House Tom 1 Feb 2013  1.5 STANDARD 200 New House John 1 Feb 2013  1.1  ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000])  ([~/?ScreenId=PM202000|PM202000])  ([~/?ScreenId=PM206000|PM206000])  ([~/?ScreenId=PM205000|PM205000])  ([~/?ScreenId=PM206000|PM206000])  ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000])  ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) ]]></column>

In Acumatica ERP, you can define sales prices for goods or services. You can express prices in a specific currency and define them for either particular customers or customers of specific customer price classes.{br}

In Acumatica ERP, you can maintain multiple prices by using the following mechanisms:[anchor|#ul_cb4_4nc_fp]
*''Default prices'': You can define a price for each inventory item in the '''Default Price''' box on the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form or on the '''Price/Cost Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. Default prices, which you can specify manually or by using import scenarios, are expressed only in the base currency.
*''Price lists'': On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form, you can define a base price list, price lists that apply to a group of customers (customer price class) or a particular customer, promotional price lists, and prices that depend on the quantity of the product. If the ''Multi-Currency Accounting'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can select the needed currency for a particular price list.

For more information about sales prices and their configuration, see [HelpRoot_PricesAndDiscounts\PriceDiscount_Reviewing_Sales_Prices_GeneralInfo|Sales Prices: General Information].{br}{TOC}
==Sales Prices in Projects==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_75_00|Allocation Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207500|PM207500]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) forms, for Projects transactions with associated stock or non-stock items, you can retrieve the effective sales price of an inventory item by using the ''@Price'' parameter. For instance, to implement a price model that estimates the project billable amount as the billable quantity of the provided services multiplied by the price, you can use the following formula: <tt>=&#91;PMTran.BillableQty&#93;&#42;@Price</tt>.
==Sales Prices Selection==
The system selects the price for a particular inventory item by using the following priority:[anchor|#ul_kyg_byt_ndb]

*:If there is no sales price of the item in the document currency, the system recalculates the default price of the item, which is in the base currency, to the document currency.
*If the '''Always Calculate Price from Base Currency Price''' check box is selected on the '''Price/Discount Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] form, the system selects the sales price of the item in the base currency and recalculates this price to the document currency.
*:If there is no sales price of the item in the base currency, the system recalculates the default price of the item, which is in the base currency, to the document currency.

For the allocation process, the system always selects sales prices in the base currency.

You can define labor cost rates specific to different entities, including the employee, labor item, project, project task, and rate type. The labor cost rates feature provides the following advantages:[anchor|#_102697f3-ea08-44ba-89d9-011cf70123c8]
*Visibility and maintenance of all the labor cost rates on a single form.
*Simple time entry because the system retrieves the labor items and labor cost rates.
*Ability to select a labor item in a time card line.
*Support of the prevailing wage.
*:The ''prevailing wage'' is a government mechanism to equalize the wage rates that are paid by a construction company to non-union workers compared to labor union workers for the same type of work performed for a certified job. A ''certified job'' is a job performed for government, such as a construction project of a municipal building. For a certified job, the government requires the construction companies to pay a non-union employee no less than the dictated prevailing wage rate.
*Support of union locals.
*:If an employee is a member of a local branch of a union, then the union requires the company to pay the dictated union rate, which is usually higher than the prevailing wage rate.
{br}{TOC}
==Creation of Labor Cost Rates==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_99_00|Labor Cost Rates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209900|PM209900]) form, you can view and edit the existing labor cost rates. Labor costs can be specified at particular detail levels—that is, for particular entities or groups of entities. You can create labor cost rates of the following types and detail levels:[anchor|#_12cb5eb1-8dd1-4fd2-93eb-3934cb7e894c]
*''Labor Item'': The labor item
*''Employee'': The employee and optionally the labor item
*''Project'': The project and optionally any of the following: the project task, the employee, and the labor item
*''Union Wage'': The union local and labor item
*''Prevailing Wage'': The project and labor item
((({S:Warn}You can view, edit, and create labor cost rates of the ''Union Wage'' and ''Prevailing Wage'' types if the ''Construction'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
)))
For each labor cost rate, you specify the effective date. If there are multiple labor cost rates with the same settings, the system uses the rate with the actual effective date—that is, with the most recent effective date that precedes the current date. You can also create a labor cost rate with the same settings as an existing labor cost rate but with an effective date later than the latest effective date of the existing labor cost rate.{br}

When you specify the rate for a line with a selected labor item, you specify the rate for the base unit of measure (UOM) of the labor item.{br}

For example, suppose that you have the ''TRAINING'' labor item, whose base UOM is ''UNIT''. According to the conversion rules specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) form, one unit equals four hours. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_99_00|Labor Cost Rates] form, when you add a labor cost rate with an employee and the ''TRAINING'' labor item, you should specify the rate for the base UOM, which is ''UNIT'', even if the unit consists of four hours. When the employee enters a time card on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_50_00|Employee Time Card] ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]) form and select in a time activity the ''TRAINING'' labor item, the time is reported in hours even though the base UOM of the selected item is not an hour. When the time card with the corresponding time activities is released, the system generates a project transaction with the ''TRAINING'' labor item in the base UOM of the item. If the employee has reported eight hours, the transaction contains two ''TRAINING'' units.((({S:Warn}[anchor|#_3fbeae1d-51f4-44da-91d6-b8315b62a0a0]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_99_00|Labor Cost Rates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209900|PM209900]) form, when you create a labor cost rate with a labor item with a base UOM that is not an hour, make sure that you enter the rate for the base UOM of the labor item so that the system calculates the correct amount when a time activity with this labor item is released.
*The base UOM of the labor item should be convertible into minutes so that the system can convert the base UOM to a minute and vice versa. That is, there should be the conversion rules from a minute to the base UOM on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) form.

==Retrieval of Labor Cost Rates==
When you create a time card on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_50_00|Employee Time Card] ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]) form, for each line, you select the employee, project, project task, labor item, date, union local, certified job, and worker compensation code.((({S:Warn}The '''Certified Job''', '''Union Local''', and '''WCC Code''' columns are shown on the '''Summary''' and '''Details''' tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_50_00|Employee Time Card] form if the ''Construction'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
)))
The system automatically selects the '''Certified Job''' check box in the time card line if for the corresponding project, the '''Certified Job''' check box is selected in the '''Project Properties''' section on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. You can clear this check box if it has been selected or select it manually, if needed.{br}

The system automatically populates the '''Union Local''' column in the time card line by using the settings of the employee and the project as follows:[anchor|#_2e5021b6-71de-4fba-84bb-887f12ec8d88]
*If the employee has a '''Union Local ID''' specified in the '''Employee Settings''' section on the '''General Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form and the project has no union local specified on the '''Union Locals''' tab of the of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the system inserts the union local of the employee into the column.
*If the employee has a '''Union Local ID''' specified in the '''Employee Settings''' section on the '''General Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] form and this union local is one of the union locals of the project specified on the '''Union Locals''' tab of the of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the system inserts the union local of the employee into the column.
*If the employee has a '''Union Local ID''' specified in the '''Employee Settings''' section on the '''General Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] form and this union local is not one of the union locals of the project specified on the '''Union Locals''' tab of the of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the system leaves the '''Union Local''' column blank.
*If the employee has no '''Union Local ID''' specified in the '''Employee Settings''' section on the '''General Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] form, the system leaves the '''Union Local''' column blank.

In the time card, you can clear a '''Union Local''' value that has been selected or select a union local manually, if needed.{br}

For each time card line, the system retrieves the cost rate for the specified employee, project, project task, labor item, date, union local, and certified job as follows:[anchor|#_067e04ad-4815-4e87-bbe6-3f2b17399431]
#Among labor cost rates of the ''Project'', ''Employee'', and ''Labor Item'' rate types, the system selects the most specific existing labor cost rate that matches all the settings specified in the time card line. The following list shows the sets of settings of the labor cost rate, from the most specific to the least specific:
#*The ''Project'' rate type, project, project task, employee, labor item, and effective date
#*The ''Project'' rate type, project, project task, employee, and effective date
#*The ''Project'' rate type, project, project task, labor item, and effective date
#*The ''Project'' rate type, project, project task, and effective date
#*The ''Project'' rate type, project, employee, labor item, and effective date
#*The ''Project'' rate type, project, employee, and effective date
#*The ''Project'' rate type, project, labor item, and effective date
#*The ''Project'' rate type, project, and effective date
#*The ''Employee'' rate type, employee, labor item, and effective date
#*The ''Employee'' rate type, employee, and effective date
#*The ''Labor Item'' rate type, labor item, and effective date
#For the time card line, if the '''Certified Job''' check box is selected and a '''Union Local''' is specified, the system selects the ''Union Wage'' and ''Prevailing Wage'' rate types that match the settings specified in the time card line. Then the system compares the most specific labor cost rate that has been found in the previous step with the selected labor cost rates of the ''Union Wage'' and ''Prevailing Wage'' rate types. Based on the comparison, the system selects the higher labor cost rate.

On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM209900|PM209900]) Labor Cost Rates (PM209900) form, when you create a labor cost rate 						with a labor item with a base UOM that is not an hour, make sure that you 						enter the rate for the base UOM of the labor item so that the system 						calculates the correct amount when a time activity with this labor item is 						released. The base UOM of the labor item should be convertible into minutes so that 						the system can convert the base UOM to a minute and vice versa. That is, 						there should be the conversion rules from a minute to the base UOM on the 							  ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) Units of Measure (CS203100) form. Retrieval of Labor Cost Rates When you create a time card on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]) Employee Time Card 				(EP305000) form, for each line, you select the employee, project, project task, 				labor item, date, union local, certified job, and worker compensation code. The  Certified Job ,  Union Local , and 					 WCC Code  columns are shown on the 					 Summary  and  Details  tabs of the 					  ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]) Employee Time Card form if the  Construction  				feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) 				form. The system automatically selects the  Certified Job  check box in the 				time card line if for the corresponding project, the  Certified 					Job  check box is selected in the  Project 					Properties  section on the  Summary  tab of the 					  ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. You can clear this 				check box if it has been selected or select it manually, if needed. The system automatically populates the  Union Local  column in the time 				card line by using the settings of the employee and the project as follows: If the employee has a  Union Local ID  specified in the 						 Employee Settings  section on the  General 						Info  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) Employees 					(EP203000) form and the project has no union local specified on the 						 Union Locals  tab of the of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, the system inserts the union 					local of the employee into the column. If the employee has a  Union Local ID  specified in the 						 Employee Settings  section on the  General 						Info  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) Employees 					form and this union local is one of the union locals of the project specified on 					the  Union Locals  tab of the of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, the system inserts the union 					local of the employee into the column. If the employee has a  Union Local ID  specified in the 						 Employee Settings  section on the  General 						Info  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) Employees 					form and this union local is not one of the union locals of the project 					specified on the  Union Locals  tab of the of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, the system leaves the 						 Union Local  column blank. If the employee has no  Union Local ID  specified in the 						 Employee Settings  section on the  General 						Info  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) Employees 					form, the system leaves the  Union Local  column 					blank. In the time card, you can clear a  Union Local  value that has been 				selected or select a union local manually, if needed. For each time card line, the system retrieves the cost rate for the specified 				employee, project, project task, labor item, date, union local, and certified job as 				follows: Among labor cost rates of the  Project ,  Employee , and  Labor 						Item  rate types, the system selects the most specific existing labor 					cost rate that matches all the settings specified in the time card line. The 					following list shows the sets of settings of the labor cost rate, from the most 					specific to the least specific: The  Project  rate type, project, project task, employee, labor 							item, and effective date The  Project  rate type, project, project task, employee, and 							effective date The  Project  rate type, project, project task, labor item, and 							effective date The  Project  rate type, project, project task, and effective 							date The  Project  rate type, project, employee, labor item, and 							effective date The  Project  rate type, project, employee, and effective date The  Project  rate type, project, labor item, and effective 							date The  Project  rate type, project, and effective date The  Employee  rate type, employee, labor item, and effective 							date The  Employee  rate type, employee, and effective date The  Labor Item  rate type, labor item, and effective date For the time card line, if the  Certified Job  check box is selected 					and a  Union Local  is specified, the system selects the 						 Union Wage  and  Prevailing Wage  rate types that match the 					settings specified in the time card line. Then the system compares the most 					specific labor cost rate that has been found in the previous step with the 					selected labor cost rates of the  Union Wage  and  Prevailing Wage  					rate types. Based on the comparison, the system selects the higher labor cost 					rate.  ([~/?ScreenId=PM209700|PM209700])  ([~/?ScreenId=PM209800|PM209800]) ]]></column>

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
In Acumatica ERP, ''allocation'' is the process of allocating amounts to specific accounts, account groups, or both to acknowledge expenses and revenues. For instance, each month you can allocate amounts of the actual expenditures entailed by the project and the future revenues calculated based on those expenditures. The allocation process is governed by allocation rules you specify by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_75_00|Allocation Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207500|PM207500]) form. {br}

The allocation process consists of two basic stages: 
*'''Selection of transactions''': By using allocation rule settings, Acumatica ERP selects only those transactions that conform to the rule settings. These are used as underlying transactions for allocating amounts and quantities. For instance, you can use as an underlying transaction a bill your employee paid when providing service to a customer.
*'''Allocation''': Acumatica ERP generates one or more allocation transactions with the amounts and quantities calculated based on those of the underlying transactions. You can specify rules that generate any transactions involving any accounts and posting; however, you normally use allocation to account for your current reimbursable costs (based on the completion percents of project tasks) and future revenues from the project. For instance, if you use a cost-based pricing model that implies a 15 percent uptick, you can specify an allocation rule that adds up all the cost transactions&rsquo; current amounts, multiplies the sum by 1.15, and debits the resulting amount to the account you use for tracking your unbilled revenue. 
{br}{TOC}
==Tracking Current Revenue==
You may want to view future revenues as they are accumulated during project execution, regardless of when they will be actually recognized, charged to the customer, or both. For instance, the project may be billed monthly but you may need to track the amount you will bill to the customer weekly or even daily. This way, you can continuously monitor how the actual revenues align with the projected revenues for the project. {br}

In Acumatica ERP, you can track future project-related revenues as they are accumulated by allocating the corresponding amounts to special account groups. To track future revenues, you need to create the following account groups: 
*'''Unbilled Revenue:''' This is an account group of the ''Asset'' type used to accumulate future revenue. When you view the allocation rule on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, this account group appears in the '''Debit''' column. This way, each time you run allocation, you post to this account group the amounts that you plan to bill to the customer. This account group may include multiple accounts to enable allocating different amounts for different allocations—for instance, allocating amounts for travel, labor, and services. Alternatively, you can use different accounting groups for each of these categories.
*'''Unrecognized Revenue:''' This account group of the ''Liability'' type is used to accumulate unrecognized revenue. When you view the allocation rule on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_75_00|Allocation Rules] form, this account group appears in the '''Credit''' column. This way, each time you run allocation, you post the amounts that you plan to recognize as revenue to this account group. This account group may include multiple accounts to enable allocating different amounts for different allocations.

Each time you run allocation, you debit the account group used for unbilled revenue and credit the account group used for unrecognized revenue for the same amount. Later, you will recognize this amount as revenue and charge it to the customer when you run billing for the project. 
==Multiple Steps of the Allocation Rules==
 For allocation purposes, you normally use the cost transactions. In Acumatica ERP, this method is called ''Transaction'' and is defined in the allocation rule for the project. This method can be used in multiple steps of an allocation rule. With this method, the pricing for the project is based on direct costs associated with the project.{br}

Using multiple steps of the ''Transaction'' type, you can allocate future revenues for different activities. For example, the first step can allocate reimbursable travel expenses, while the second step can allocate labor time. 
==Formulas in Allocation Rules==
In formulas of an allocation rule, to retrieve the data, you can use the following data access classes:[anchor|#_08adbc35-6de2-425f-93d4-bd17b7f41183]
*{{PMAccountGroup}}
*{{PMBudget}}
*{{PMProject}}
*{{PMTask}}
*{{PMTran}}
*{{Customer}}
*{{EPEmployee}}
*{{InventoryItem}}
*{{Vendor}}

When you allocate a project using an allocation rule with a formula that uses the {{PMBudget}} data access class, for each budget line of the project, the system retrieves {{PMBudget}} records that are associated with the same project, project task, account group, inventory item, and cost code if the ''Cost Code'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
==The Creation and Reversing of Allocation Transactions==
To make it to identify a batch of allocation transactions, the system assigns the following description to such a batch: ''Allocation for &lt;Project ID&gt;''.{br}

A reversal transaction copied the original transaction and reversed the sign of the amount.{br}

Allocation transactions are always reversed in the full amount.{br}

The allocation transactions created with the ''On AR Invoice Generation'' option selected in the '''Reverse Allocation''' box on the '''Allocation Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_75_00|Allocation Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207500|PM207500]) form are reversed as follows:[anchor|#_2dfe1aa4-19e7-4a7b-858f-1d2d1daf0cbd]
*If the corresponding AR document is created with the ''Balanced'' status, the allocation reversal transaction is also created with the ''Balanced'' status.
*The allocation reversal transaction is automatically released when the corresponding AR document is released.
*The allocation reversal transaction is automatically deleted when the corresponding AR document is deleted.

==Allocating Labor in Projects==
If the Projects module is not enabled, the release of a transaction in the Time and Expenses module generates the corresponding transactions in the Accounts Payable module. Enabling the Projects module in Acumatica ERP changes the way transactions are released in the Time and Expenses module. {br}

When non-project transactions are released, Acumatica ERP generates regular Accounts Payable transactions. If you enable the Projects module functionality, the release of a transaction associated with a specific project does not generate an Accounts Payable transaction, but instead generates the corresponding Projects module transactions. The further processing of the Projects transactions originating in the Time and Expenses module is handled in the Projects module using allocation and billing rules. This workflow with the extra stage allows you to use costs in allocating and billing for projects and implement a cost-driven pricing model. Once you have all direct labor costs for the project entered in the Projects module, you can use the transaction information to allocate for the project any amounts and quantities enforced by your pricing model.

Allocation :  Acumatica ERP generates one or more allocation transactions with the amounts and quantities                     calculated based on those of the underlying transactions. You can specify rules                     that generate any transactions involving any accounts and posting; however, you                     normally use allocation to account for your current reimbursable costs (based on                     the completion percents of project tasks) and future revenues from the project.                     For instance, if you use a cost-based pricing model that implies a 15 percent                     uptick, you can specify an allocation rule that adds up all the cost                     transactions' current amounts, multiplies the sum by 1.15, and debits the                     resulting amount to the account you use for tracking your unbilled revenue.                  Tracking Current Revenue You may want to view future revenues as they are accumulated during project                 execution, regardless of when they will be actually recognized, charged to the                 customer, or both. For instance, the project may be billed monthly but you may need                 to track the amount you will bill to the customer weekly or even daily. This way,                 you can continuously monitor how the actual revenues align with the projected                 revenues for the project.  In  Acumatica ERP, you can track future project-related revenues as they are accumulated by                 allocating the corresponding amounts to special account groups. To track future                 revenues, you need to create the following account groups:  Unbilled Revenue:  This is an account group of the  Asset  type used                     to accumulate future revenue. When you view the allocation rule on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules (PM207000) form, this account group                     appears in the  Debit  column. This way, each time you run allocation, you                     post to this account group the amounts that you plan to bill to the customer.                     This account group may include multiple accounts to enable allocating different                     amounts for different allocations—for instance, allocating amounts for                     travel, labor, and services. Alternatively, you can use different accounting                     groups for each of these categories. Unrecognized Revenue:  This account group of the  Liability  type is                     used to accumulate unrecognized revenue. When you view the allocation rule on                     the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207500|PM207500]) Allocation Rules form, this account group appears in the                          Credit  column. This way, each time you run allocation, you post the                     amounts that you plan to recognize as revenue to this account group. This                     account group may include multiple accounts to enable allocating different                     amounts for different allocations. Each time you run allocation, you debit the account group used for unbilled revenue                 and credit the account group used for unrecognized revenue for the same amount.                 Later, you will recognize this amount as revenue and charge it to the customer when                 you run billing for the project.  Multiple Steps of the Allocation Rules  For allocation purposes, you normally use the cost transactions. In  Acumatica ERP, this method is called  Transaction  and is defined in the allocation rule                 for the project. This method can be used in multiple steps of an allocation rule.                 With this method, the pricing for the project is based on direct costs associated                 with the project. Using multiple steps of the  Transaction  type, you can allocate future revenues                 for different activities. For example, the first step can allocate reimbursable                 travel expenses, while the second step can allocate labor time.  Formulas in Allocation Rules In formulas of an allocation rule, to retrieve the data, you can use the following                 data access classes: PMAccountGroup PMBudget PMProject PMTask PMTran Customer EPEmployee InventoryItem Vendor When you allocate a project using an allocation rule with a formula that uses the                      PMBudget  data access class, for each budget line of the                 project, the system retrieves  PMBudget  records that are associated                 with the same project, project task, account group, inventory item, and cost code if                 the  Cost Code  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. The Creation and Reversing of Allocation Transactions To make it to identify a batch of allocation transactions, the system assigns the                 following description to such a batch:  Allocation for <Project ID> . A reversal transaction copied the original transaction and reversed the sign of the                 amount. Allocation transactions are always reversed in the full amount. The allocation transactions created with the  On AR Invoice Generation  option                 selected in the  Reverse Allocation  box on the                      Allocation Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207500|PM207500]) Allocation Rules (PM207500) form are reversed as                 follows: If the corresponding AR document is created with the  Balanced  status, the                     allocation reversal transaction is also created with the  Balanced                      status. The allocation reversal transaction is automatically released when the                     corresponding AR document is released. The allocation reversal transaction is automatically deleted when the                     corresponding AR document is deleted. Allocating Labor in Projects If the Projects module is not enabled, the release of a transaction in the Time and                 Expenses module generates the corresponding transactions in the Accounts Payable                 module. Enabling the Projects module in  Acumatica ERP changes the way transactions are released in the Time and Expenses module.  When non-project transactions are released,  Acumatica ERP generates regular Accounts Payable transactions. If you enable the Projects                 module functionality, the release of a transaction associated with a specific                 project does not generate an Accounts Payable transaction, but instead generates the                 corresponding Projects module transactions. The further processing of the Projects                 transactions originating in the Time and Expenses module is handled in the Projects                 module using allocation and billing rules. This workflow with the extra stage allows                 you to use costs in allocating and billing for projects and implement a cost-driven                 pricing model. Once you have all direct labor costs for the project entered in the                 Projects module, you can use the transaction information to allocate for the project                 any amounts and quantities enforced by your pricing model.

If you need to bill customers for the services provided as a part of a project, you can generate invoices based on the information collected in the Projects module. The billing procedure is available only for external projects—that is, for projects associated with customers. You can run the billing procedure automatically, manually, or on a schedule. You can enable draft invoices for a particular project, which gives you the ability to review and modify billable transactions and amounts in a draft invoice before you prepare the final Accounts Receivable invoice with all information copied from the draft invoice. Also, you can choose whether to post any amounts to the General Ledger when you run the billing procedure.{br}{TOC}
==Billing Procedure==
In Acumatica ERP, you perform project billing by using one of the following forms:[anchor|#ul_tg4_54c_bcb]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, you can run billing for the selected project by clicking '''Run Project Billing''' on the form toolbar. If the project is pending billing, the system creates an invoice with a date that is the same as the '''Next Billing Date''' of the project. For projects with the ''On Demand'' billing period, the date of the invoice is the business date.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_50_30_00|Run Project Billing] ([~/?ScreenId=PM503000|PM503000]) form, you can run billing for multiple projects that are pending billing, depending on the '''Invoice Date''' selected in the Summary area of the form. (By default, this box contains the business date.) The system creates invoices with a date that is the same as the '''Invoice Date'''.
*:((({S:Warn}The form does not show the projects with the '''Next Billing Date''', which is specified on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, is later than the '''Invoice Date''', which in specified in the Selection area of the form.
)))

On both forms, the system bills only a project that is pending billing—that is, at least one of the following exist for the project:[anchor|#ul_e4h_2qc_bcb]
*An unbilled transaction that is ready to be billed on the invoice date—that is, the date of the transaction is not later than the invoice date.
*:The invoice date is the date of the invoice that the system creates during the billing. The invoice date depends on the form where you run billing as follows:
**On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the invoice date is the '''Next Billing Date''', which is specified on the '''Summary''' tab, for all the projects except those that are billed on demand.
**On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the invoice date is the business date for all the projects for which the '''Billing Period''', which is specified on the '''Summary''' tab, is ''On Demand''.
**On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_50_30_00|Run Project Billing] form, the invoice date is the '''Invoice Date''', which in specified in the Selection area of the form.
*:Whether the system uses or not the transactions with the date is equal to the invoice date depends on the '''Billing Cut-off Date''' setting on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form as follows:
**''Include Trans. created on billing date'': With this setting, the unbilled transaction is ready to be billed if its date is earlier than or the same as the invoice date.
**''Exclude Trans. created on billing date'': With this setting, the unbilled transaction is ready to be billed if its date is earlier than the invoice date.
*A revenue budget line with a nonzero '''Pending Invoice Amount''' on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, including a negative amount.
*An amount postponed to the next billing from a pro forma invoice for which the corresponding Accounts Receivable invoice is released.
*A task with a recurring billing item.

The billing procedure in Acumatica ERP is straightforward and depends on the type of a step of the billing rule, which is specified for a project task on the '''Tasks''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, as follows:[anchor|#ul_dh1_tsk_2bb]
*For the ''Time and Material'' steps of the billing rules of project tasks, the system selects all the outstanding allocated project transactions and generates an invoice for the customer based on these transactions and according to the billing rule (for details about billing rules, see the section below).
*:If you do not want to bill any of the transactions, you can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_50_50_00|Reverse Unbilled Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=PM505000|PM505000]) form to reverse allocated transactions (either all listed transactions at once or only the selected ones).
*For the ''Progress Billing'' steps of the billing rules of project tasks whose processing does not involve allocations, the system generates an invoice with the billable project revenue, meaning the revenue budget lines with a nonzero '''Pending Invoice Amount''' listed on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form.

For the billing process for a project to be run successfully, the project should meet the following criteria:[anchor|#ul_hhc_2m1_hbb]
*All the mandatory settings should be specified for the project and its tasks.
*The project status should be ''Active'', ''Completed'', or ''Suspended''.
*The status of the project tasks should be ''Active'' or ''Completed'', and the billing rule should be specified for these tasks.
*The project should have a provision for billing, such as a billable line of the revenue budget associated with the task for a progress billing, or an unbilled project transaction associated with the task within this billing period for a time and material billing.
*The steps of the billing rule should be applicable to the billing provisions. For example, the billing rule of a task that is supposed to be billed by a revenue budget line should have a ''Progress Billing'' step.

==Billing Rules==
For each project task, the billing process is defined by billing rules, which are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form. For each billing rule, you can create steps of the following types:[anchor|#ul_gdm_dcl_2bb]
*A single ''Progress Billing'' step to bill pending invoice amounts
*Multiple ''Time and Material'' steps to bill transactions by different account groups

In a single billing rule, you can mix these types of billing steps, as well as create separate billing rules for each type of step. Each step of a billing rule has a variety of settings that depend on the step type, including the following:[anchor|#ul_ccd_fzk_2bb]
*The account group that is used as a filter to select the transactions for billing by the ''Time and Material'' billing steps. The system selects all the transactions that are due for billing when the billing procedure is run. Normally, you use for billing the same account group or groups that you use for accumulating the unrecognized revenue. By running billing for these account groups, you recognize the revenue.
*Formulas to define the description of the invoice and each invoice line, to make the system compose these descriptions dynamically during the billing process.
*Formulas to calculate the amount and quantity of the invoice lines created by the ''Time and Material'' billing steps. In these formulas, you can use fields and attributes from such entities as the project, project budget, project task, project transaction, customer, vendor, employee, inventory item, and account group. You can also use different sources of the project rates: those from the rate tables that can be configured on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_60_00|Rate Tables] ([~/?ScreenId=PM206000|PM206000]) form, and those from sales price lists that are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form.
*The sources of the sales account and the destination branch for each invoice line.
*:The billing process uses the originating branch from the project settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form and the destination branches from the sources according to the billing rules. When an Accounts Receivable invoice is released, the Accounts Receivable account is updated under the originating branch of the invoice, while the revenue amounts are recorded to the destination branches of the invoice lines.
*The invoice group to make the system create separate invoices for particular steps with the similar invoice group during the project billing (either pro forma invoices or Accounts Receivable invoices, depending on the billing workflow of the project).
*:During the billing process, the system groups the billable amounts into invoices by the following:[anchor|#ul_wn4_122_pbb]
**The invoice group of the steps of the billing rules to which the project tasks refer
**The customer
**The customer location
**The '''Bill Separately''' setting of each project task defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form
*Non-billable transactions that do not contribute to the amount billed to the customer and that you may decide to include in the invoice.
*Grouping criteria by date, employee, vendor, and inventory item for the invoice lines created by the ''Time and Material'' billing steps.

==Formulas in Billing Rules==
In formulas of a billing rule, to retrieve the data, you can use the following data access classes:[anchor|#_08adbc35-6de2-425f-93d4-bd17b7f41183]
*{{PMAccountGroup}}
*{{PMBudget}}
*{{PMProject}}
*{{PMTask}}
*{{PMTran}}
*{{Customer}}
*{{EPEmployee}}
*{{InventoryItem}}
*{{Vendor}}

When you bill a project using a billing rule with a formula that uses the {{PMBudget}} data access class, for each budget line of the project, the system retrieves {{PMBudget}} records that are associated with the same project, project task, account group, inventory item, and cost code if the ''Cost Code'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.[anchor|#section_rxl_kjw_1bb]
==Progress Billing==
Progress billing is a simple billing workflow for the projects that are gradually billed at a fixed contract amount. Progress billing does not involve project transactions, and the system uses ''Progress Billing'' steps of billing rules of the project tasks to process this billing. The project setup and the billing workflow proceed as follows:[anchor|#ul_krj_rnp_1bb]
*A user adds a revenue budget line with a '''Revised Amount''' to a project on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form.
*To provide a billable amount (for example, on a monthly basis), the user populates the '''Pending Invoice Amount''' or '''Completed (%)''' column on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab for the revenue budget lines to make the system calculate the '''Pending Invoice Amount''' as follows:
*:{{Pending Invoice Amount = Revised Budgeted Amount * ( Completed (%) / 100 ) - Draft Invoices Amount - Actual Amount}}
*The user runs the project billing process to create a pro forma invoice (or an Accounts Receivable invoice, depending on the selected workflow).
*The system creates an invoice with the amounts derived from the '''Pending Invoice Amount''' column of the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form for the revenue budget lines. The system updates the '''Draft Invoices Amount''' of the revenue budget lines with the '''Pending Invoice Amount''' and clears the '''Pending Invoice Amount'''.
*If the system creates a pro forma invoice (depending on the selected workflow), the invoice lines that are produced by the progress billing steps are displayed on the '''Progress Billing''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form.
((({S:Warn}[anchor|#ul_syj_rnp_1bb]
*If a project task uses a billing rule that has no ''Progress Billing'' step, when the system updates the '''Completed (%)''' column on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the system does not recalculate the '''Pending Invoice Amount''' column for the revenue budget lines that belong to this task, and the system ignores any pending invoice amount of these lines during the billing process.
*The '''Actual Quantity''' of the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) is always zero in the revenue budget lines that are billed only by progress billing.
)))[anchor|#section_hpm_c4w_1bb]
==Transaction-Based Billing==
This billing workflow is provided for projects that are billed based on project transactions. The system uses the ''Time and Material'' steps of the billing rules of the project tasks to process this billing. A billing rule may have a number of ''Time and Material'' steps for different account groups of transactions that should be used to determine the invoiced amounts by different formulas. The ''Time and Material'' billing can be executed right after the project transactions that match the selection criteria have been provisioned in the system. The allocation process can be executed before billing, if necessary.{br}

The project setup and billing workflow proceeds as follows:[anchor|#ul_sck_rnp_1bb]
*The user runs the project billing process to create a pro forma invoice (or an Accounts Receivable invoice, depending on the selected workflow).
*The system creates the invoice based on the unbilled project transactions with amounts calculated by the billing rules of the project tasks.
*:The system considers in the billing the transactions with a date that is earlier than the billing date and does not consider the transactions with the date that is later than the billing date. The transactions with a date on the billing date are billed if ''Include Trans. created on billing date'' is selected as the '''Billing Cut-off Date''' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form.
*If the system creates a pro forma invoice, the invoice lines that are produced by the ''Time and Material'' billing steps are displayed on the '''Time and Material''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form.

==Recurring Billing==
Your company may provide services to customers regularly for a flat price. For instance, you can lease construction machines to customers for an agreed number of hours per month for a fixed price. If you decide to manage this activity as a project, you do not have to manually create a new invoice every month—each time you run project billing, recurring transactions are added to the invoice (or to the invoice listed first in the rule if multiple invoices must be generated for the billing rule). Recurring billing is a task-level setting you define on the '''Recurring Billing''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form. You can use non-stock items as line items for recurring billing to track employee and equipment work time. For each item, you can specify the following: 
*The flat price charged once each billing period.
*The number of units included in the item fee. For instance, you may have an agreement with the customer to provide 40 hours of road scraper work at a flat price, while any extra hours are charged on a per-hour basis.
*The option that determines whether the number of units included in the flat price is to be reset for each billing period or it is a fixed number for the entire project duration. For instance, with the agreement for 40 hours of road scraper work at a flat monthly price, you can use hour as the unit of measure and reset the number of hours each month to ensure that the customer gets their quota of 40 hours each month. In a different scenario, the agreement may imply the lease of one to three road scrapers to the customer at a flat monthly price (here, you use scraper as a unit of measure); in this case, you do not need to reset the number of scrapers each month.
*The minimum number of units for which billing may be performed. If the amount of services or products you provide is less than this value, you do not charge the customer. For instance, your agreement may stipulate a flat monthly price for 10 to 40 hours of road scraper work. Any scraper time below 10 hours is not charged.

The billing period is a project-wide setting that you specify when planning the project at the level of the project template on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_00|Project Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) form. The following options are available: ''Week'', ''Month'', ''Quarter'', ''Year'', or ''On Demand''. The ''On Demand'' option defines the billing that may be initiated when it is needed.
==Billing of Postponed Amounts==
With the draft invoice workflow, a user can modify a pro forma invoice and postpone the difference until the next billing. This remaining amount will be billed during the next billing if the Accounts Receivable invoice that contains the line from which the remainder originates is released. For more information about the draft invoice workflow, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__con_Draft_Invoice_Workflow|Pro Forma Invoices].
==Reversing an Accounts Receivable Invoice==
When you reverse a released Accounts Receivable invoice that was created based on a project transaction, the system creates the corresponding credit memo. When you release this reversing credit memo, the system creates the non-billable reversing project transaction that reverses the impact of the original project transaction. The original project transaction remains billed. The system also creates a copy of the original project transaction with the original quantity and amount even if these quantity and amount was adjusted in the credit memo. The date and the financial period of this copied project transaction are the same as the date and the financial period of the original transaction if the financial period is not locked. If the financial period of the original transaction is locked, the financial period of the created transaction is copied from the credit memo. The copied project transaction is unbilled. Thus, as the result of such a reversal, there are the following project transactions in the system:[anchor|#_1de2680c-fdd1-499e-9e77-1980e8981250]
*The original project transaction, which is billed
*The non-billable reversing project transaction, which reverses the impact of the original project transaction
*The copy of the original project transaction with the original amount and quantity, which is unbilled and ready for billing again

==Mapping of Accounts to Tasks==
When you run a billing procedure for a project, the system may generate additional transactions—for instance, to include a discount or freight charge. Such transactions are automatically associated with the project, but you may also need to automatically associate these transactions with specific tasks in the project.{br}

You can have Acumatica ERP automatically assign transactions to specific tasks by mapping specific General Ledger accounts to tasks within the project in the '''Default Task for GL Account''' section on the '''Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. Once you map a General Ledger account to a task, any transactions automatically generated by the system and associated with the account will be linked to this default task.
==Project Billing in Migration Mode==
If Accounts Receivable is in migration mode—that is, the '''Activate Migration Mode''' check box is selected in the '''Posting Settings''' section of the '''General Settings''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) form, the system does not create invoices during project billing. The creation of AR documents and pro forma invoices during project billing and the creation of AR documents during the release of pro forma invoices are not available.{br}

For more information on migration mode, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__con_Migration_Process_Overview|Migrating Documents to Acumatica ERP].

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Project Billing If you need to bill customers for the services provided as a part of a project, you 				can generate invoices based on the information collected in the Projects module. The 				billing procedure is available only for external projects—that is, for 				projects associated with customers. You can run the billing procedure automatically, 				manually, or on a schedule. You can enable draft invoices for a particular project, 				which gives you the ability to review and modify billable transactions and amounts 				in a draft invoice before you prepare the final Accounts Receivable invoice with all 				information copied from the draft invoice. Also, you can choose whether to post any 				amounts to the General Ledger when you run the billing procedure. Billing Procedure In  Acumatica ERP, you perform project billing by using one of the following forms: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, you can run billing for 					the selected project by clicking  Run Project Billing  on 					the form toolbar. If the project is pending billing, the system creates an 					invoice with a date that is the same as the  Next Billing 						Date  of the project. For projects with the  On Demand  					billing period, the date of the invoice is the business date. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM503000|PM503000]) Run Project Billing (PM503000) form, you can 					run billing for multiple projects that are pending billing, depending on the 						 Invoice Date  selected in the Summary area of the 					form. (By default, this box contains the business date.) The system creates 					invoices with a date that is the same as the  Invoice 						Date . The form does not show the projects with the 							 Next Billing Date , which is specified on the 							 Summary  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, is later than the  Invoice Date , which in 						specified in the Selection area of the form. On both forms, the system bills only a project that is pending billing—that is, at 				least one of the following exist for the project: An unbilled transaction that is ready to be billed on the invoice date—that is, 					the date of the transaction is not later than the invoice date. The invoice 						date is the date of the invoice that the system creates during the billing. 						The invoice date depends on the form where you run billing as 						follows: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, the invoice date is the 								 Next Billing Date , which is specified on the 								 Summary  tab, for all the projects except 							those that are billed on demand. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, the invoice date is the 							business date for all the projects for which the  Billing 								Period , which is specified on the 								 Summary  tab, is  On Demand . On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM503000|PM503000]) Run Project Billing form, the invoice 							date is the  Invoice Date , which in specified in 							the Selection area of the form. Whether the system uses or not the transactions with the date is equal 						to the invoice date depends on the  Billing Cut-off 							Date  setting on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form as follows: Include Trans. created on billing date : With this setting, the 							unbilled transaction is ready to be billed if its date is earlier than 							or the same as the invoice date. Exclude Trans. created on billing date : With this setting, the 							unbilled transaction is ready to be billed if its date is earlier than 							the invoice date. A revenue budget line with a nonzero  Pending Invoice 						Amount  on the  Revenue Budget  tab of the 						  ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, including a negative amount. An amount postponed to the next billing from a pro forma invoice for which the 					corresponding Accounts Receivable invoice is released. A task with a recurring billing item. The billing procedure in  Acumatica ERP is straightforward and depends on the type of a step of the billing rule, which 				is specified for a project task on the  Tasks  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, as follows: For the  Time and Material  steps of the billing rules of project tasks, 					the system selects all the outstanding allocated project transactions and 					generates an invoice for the customer based on these transactions and according 					to the billing rule (for details about billing rules, see the section 						below). If you do not want to bill any of the transactions, you can use 						the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM505000|PM505000]) Reverse Unbilled Transactions (PM505000) form to reverse 						allocated transactions (either all listed transactions at once or only the 						selected ones). For the  Progress Billing  steps of the billing rules of project tasks 					whose processing does not involve allocations, the system generates an invoice 					with the billable project revenue, meaning the revenue budget lines with a 					nonzero  Pending Invoice Amount  listed on the 						 Revenue Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. For the billing process for a project to be run successfully, the project should meet 				the following criteria: All the mandatory settings should be specified for the project and its 					tasks. The project status should be  Active ,  Completed , or 						 Suspended . The status of the project tasks should be  Active  or  Completed , and 					the billing rule should be specified for these tasks. The project should have a provision for billing, such as a billable line of the 					revenue budget associated with the task for a progress billing, or an unbilled 					project transaction associated with the task within this billing period for a 					time and material billing. The steps of the billing rule should be applicable to the billing provisions. 					For example, the billing rule of a task that is supposed to be billed by a 					revenue budget line should have a  Progress Billing  step. Billing Rules For each project task, the billing process is defined by billing rules, which are 				defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules (PM207000) form. For 				each billing rule, you can create steps of the following types: A single  Progress Billing  step to bill pending invoice amounts Multiple  Time and Material  steps to bill transactions by different 					account groups In a single billing rule, you can mix these types of billing steps, as well as create 				separate billing rules for each type of step. Each step of a billing rule has a 				variety of settings that depend on the step type, including the following: The account group that is used as a filter to select the transactions for 					billing by the  Time and Material  billing steps. The system selects all 					the transactions that are due for billing when the billing procedure is run. 					Normally, you use for billing the same account group or groups that you use for 					accumulating the unrecognized revenue. By running billing for these account 					groups, you recognize the revenue. Formulas to define the description of the invoice and each invoice line, to make 					the system compose these descriptions dynamically during the billing 					process. Formulas to calculate the amount and quantity of the invoice lines created by 					the  Time and Material  billing steps. In these formulas, you can use 					fields and attributes from such entities as the project, project budget, project 					task, project transaction, customer, vendor, employee, inventory item, and 					account group. You can also use different sources of the project rates: those 					from the rate tables that can be configured on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM206000|PM206000]) Rate Tables (PM206000) form, and those from sales price lists that are defined on the 						  ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) Sales Prices (AR202000) form. The sources of the sales account and the destination branch for each invoice 						line. The billing process uses the originating branch from the project 						settings on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form and the 						destination branches from the sources according to the billing rules. When 						an Accounts Receivable invoice is released, the Accounts Receivable account 						is updated under the originating branch of the invoice, while the revenue 						amounts are recorded to the destination branches of the invoice 					lines. The invoice group to make the system create separate invoices for particular 					steps with the similar invoice group during the project billing (either pro 					forma invoices or Accounts Receivable invoices, depending on the billing 					workflow of the project). During the billing process, the system groups the 						billable amounts into invoices by the following: The invoice group of the steps of the billing rules to which the 								project tasks refer The customer The customer location The  Bill Separately  setting of each project 								task defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) Project Tasks (PM302000) 								form Non-billable transactions that do not contribute to the amount billed to the 					customer and that you may decide to include in the invoice. Grouping criteria by date, employee, vendor, and inventory item for the invoice 					lines created by the  Time and Material  billing steps. Formulas in Billing Rules In formulas of a billing rule, to retrieve the data, you can use the following data 				access classes: PMAccountGroup PMBudget PMProject PMTask PMTran Customer EPEmployee InventoryItem Vendor When you bill a project using a billing rule with a formula that uses the 					 PMBudget  data access class, for each budget line of the 				project, the system retrieves  PMBudget  records that are associated 				with the same project, project task, account group, inventory item, and cost code if 				the  Cost Code  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. Progress Billing Progress billing is a simple billing workflow for the projects that are gradually 				billed at a fixed contract amount. Progress billing does not involve project 				transactions, and the system uses  Progress Billing  steps of billing rules of 				the project tasks to process this billing. The project setup and the billing 				workflow proceed as follows: A user adds a revenue budget line with a  Revised Amount  					to a project on the  Revenue Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. To provide a billable amount (for example, on a monthly basis), the user populates the 						 Pending Invoice Amount  or  Completed 						(%)  column on the  Revenue Budget  tab for 					the revenue budget lines to make the system calculate the  Pending 						Invoice Amount  as follows: Pending Invoice Amount = 							Revised Budgeted Amount * ( Completed (%) / 100 ) - Draft Invoices 							Amount - Actual Amount The user runs the project billing process to create a pro forma invoice (or an 					Accounts Receivable invoice, depending on the selected workflow). The system creates an invoice with the amounts derived from the 						 Pending Invoice Amount  column of the 						 Revenue Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form for the revenue budget lines. The 					system updates the  Draft Invoices Amount  of the revenue 					budget lines with the  Pending Invoice Amount  and clears 					the  Pending Invoice Amount . If the system creates a pro forma invoice (depending on the selected workflow), 					the invoice lines that are produced by the progress billing steps are displayed 					on the  Progress Billing  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form. If a project task uses a billing rule that has no  Progress Billing  						step, when the system updates the  Completed (%)  						column on the  Revenue Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, the system does not recalculate the 							 Pending Invoice Amount  column for the revenue 						budget lines that belong to this task, and the system ignores any pending 						invoice amount of these lines during the billing process. The  Actual Quantity  of the  Revenue 							Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) 						is always zero in the revenue budget lines that are billed only by progress 						billing. Transaction-Based Billing This billing workflow is provided for projects that are billed based on project 				transactions. The system uses the  Time and Material  steps of the billing 				rules of the project tasks to process this billing. A billing rule may have a number 				of  Time and Material  steps for different account groups of transactions that 				should be used to determine the invoiced amounts by different formulas. The  Time 					and Material  billing can be executed right after the project transactions 				that match the selection criteria have been provisioned in the system. The 				allocation process can be executed before billing, if necessary. The project setup and billing workflow proceeds as follows: The user runs the project billing process to create a pro forma invoice (or an 					Accounts Receivable invoice, depending on the selected workflow). The system creates the invoice based on the unbilled project transactions with 					amounts calculated by the billing rules of the project tasks. The system 						considers in the billing the transactions with a date that is earlier than 						the billing date and does not consider the transactions with the date that 						is later than the billing date. The transactions with a date on the billing 						date are billed if  Include Trans. created on billing date  is selected 						as the  Billing Cut-off Date  on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form. If the system creates a pro forma invoice, the invoice lines that are produced 					by the  Time and Material  billing steps are displayed on the 						 Time and Material  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form. Recurring Billing Your company may provide services to customers regularly for a flat price. For 				instance, you can lease construction machines to customers for an agreed number of 				hours per month for a fixed price. If you decide to manage this activity as a 				project, you do not have to manually create a new invoice every month—each time you 				run project billing, recurring transactions are added to the invoice (or to the 				invoice listed first in the rule if multiple invoices must be generated for the 				billing rule). Recurring billing is a task-level setting you define on the 					 Recurring Billing  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) Project Tasks (PM302000) form. You can use non-stock 				items as line items for recurring billing to track employee and equipment work time. 				For each item, you can specify the following:  The flat price charged once each billing period. The number of units included in the item fee. For instance, you may have an 					agreement with the customer to provide 40 hours of road scraper work at a flat 					price, while any extra hours are charged on a per-hour basis. The option that determines whether the number of units included in the flat 					price is to be reset for each billing period or it is a fixed number for the 					entire project duration. For instance, with the agreement for 40 hours of road 					scraper work at a flat monthly price, you can use hour as the unit of measure 					and reset the number of hours each month to ensure that the customer gets their 					quota of 40 hours each month. In a different scenario, the agreement may imply 					the lease of one to three road scrapers to the customer at a flat monthly price 					(here, you use scraper as a unit of measure); in this case, you do not need to 					reset the number of scrapers each month. The minimum number of units for which billing may be performed. If the amount of 					services or products you provide is less than this value, you do not charge the 					customer. For instance, your agreement may stipulate a flat monthly price for 10 					to 40 hours of road scraper work. Any scraper time below 10 hours is not 					charged. The billing period is a project-wide setting that you specify when planning the 				project at the level of the project template on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) Project Templates 				(PM208000) form. The following options are available:  Week ,  Month , 					 Quarter ,  Year , or  On Demand . The  On Demand  option 				defines the billing that may be initiated when it is needed. Billing of Postponed Amounts With the draft invoice workflow, a user can modify a pro forma invoice and postpone 				the difference until the next billing. This remaining amount will be billed during 				the next billing if the Accounts Receivable invoice that contains the line from 				which the remainder originates is released. For more information about the draft 				invoice workflow, see  Pro Forma Invoices. Reversing an Accounts Receivable Invoice When you reverse a released Accounts Receivable invoice that was created based on a project 				transaction, the system creates the corresponding credit memo. When you release this 				reversing credit memo, the system creates the non-billable reversing project 				transaction that reverses the impact of the original project transaction. The 				original project transaction remains billed. The system also creates a copy of the 				original project transaction with the original quantity and amount even if these 				quantity and amount was adjusted in the credit memo. The date and the financial 				period of this copied project transaction are the same as the date and the financial 				period of the original transaction if the financial period is not locked. If the 				financial period of the original transaction is locked, the financial period of the 				created transaction is copied from the credit memo. The copied project transaction 				is unbilled. Thus, as the result of such a reversal, there are the following project 				transactions in the system: The original project transaction, which is billed The non-billable reversing project transaction, which reverses the impact of the 					original project transaction The copy of the original project transaction with the original amount and quantity, which is 					unbilled and ready for billing again Mapping of Accounts to Tasks When you run a billing procedure for a project, the system may generate additional 				transactions—for instance, to include a discount or freight charge. Such 				transactions are automatically associated with the project, but you may also need to 				automatically associate these transactions with specific tasks in the project. You can have  Acumatica ERP automatically assign transactions to specific tasks by mapping specific General 				Ledger accounts to tasks within the project in the  Default Task for GL 					Account  section on the  Settings  tab of the 					  ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. Once you map a 				General Ledger account to a task, any transactions automatically generated by the 				system and associated with the account will be linked to this default task. Project Billing in Migration Mode If Accounts Receivable is in migration mode—that is, the  Activate 					Migration Mode  check box is selected in the  Posting 					Settings  section of the  General Settings  tab 				on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) Accounts Receivable Preferences (AR101000) form, the system does not create 				invoices during project billing. The creation of AR documents and pro forma invoices 				during project billing and the creation of AR documents during the release of pro 				forma invoices are not available. For more information on migration mode, see  Migrating Documents to Acumatica ERP.

Project accounting is integrated with the following functional areas of Acumatica ERP:[anchor|#_b3049ef6-36bb-4211-b5d1-fec190fd10cb]
*General ledger
*Accounts receivable
*Accounts payable
*Inventory management
*Order management
*Time and expenses

With this integration, information about transactions related to projects can seamlessly flow into project accounting and be available for tracking budget, costs, and revenue of projects.{br}{TOC}
==Lesson Objectives==
You will learn how to:[anchor|#ul_k5h_z41_1cb]
*Make the system create a project transaction based on a GL transaction
*Create a project transaction
*Create a project transaction without posting to general ledger

==Applicable Scenarios==
You enter project transactions manually if you need to track project actuals without documents that originate in other Acumatica ERP modules.
==Non-Project Code==
The non-project code, which is specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form, is the code that you can use to indicate that specific transactions are not associated with any project. By default, this code is ''X'', but you can specify a different non-project code. {br}

Once you enable the ''Project Accounting'' feature, you must specify '''Project''' and '''Task''' values when you enter transactions on data entry forms of Acumatica ERP. If you do not want to associate a particular transaction with any project, you select the non-project code as the '''Project'''. With this code selected, no information will be transferred to project accounting and no project balances will be updated.
==Integration with General Ledger==
In general ledger, you can directly enter transactions related to specific project tasks. By using account groups that are mapped to general ledger accounts on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_10_00|Account Groups] ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) form, you will be able to view the transactions that are generated in other functional areas of Acumatica ERP and eventually posted to general ledger.{br}

When you process a project transaction, the expense account of the corresponding inventory item is updated. This also affects the account group to which this expense account is mapped, as illustrated in the diagram below.[anchor|#fig_d1h_xxg_wr][anchor|#image_hpf_cyg_wr][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_Transactions2.png|popup|Integration of project accounting and general ledger|450px]

==Story==
Suppose that the Thai Food Restaurant customer has ordered training on how to use a previously bought juicer. The project accountant has created a project for this training, and the training has taken place. The project accountant then needs to enter the general ledger transactions to directly capture the costs involved with delivering this training. You will perform the needed actions in the system, acting as the project accountant.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this lesson, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Project Accounting'' feature has been enabled to provide support for the project accounting functionality.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, the ''TOMYUM1'' project has been created.
==Process Overview==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_30_10_00|Journal Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=GL301000|GL301000]) form, you create a batch of general ledger transactions. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) form, you create a batch of project transactions.
==System Preparation==
To sign in to the system and prepare to perform the instructions of the activity, do the following:[anchor|#_6c9e4914-0e56-4fc0-9f9d-df880dcd99b6]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the U100 dataset preloaded as Pam Brawner by using the ''brawner'' login and the ''123'' password.[anchor|#_69b9851f-08bf-450d-b256-c81365a146af]
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select ''1/30/2020'' on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.

==Step 1: Creating General Ledger Transactions==
To create a batch of general ledger transactions, do the following:[anchor|#_de8b7925-a170-40ef-91d6-1d90afb86754]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_30_10_00|Journal Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=GL301000|GL301000]) form, create a new batch of general ledger transactions.
#Add the first row, which represents your expenses for the project, and specify the following settings:
#*'''Account''': ''54100 - Project Labor Expense''
#* '''Project''': ''TOMYUM1''
#* '''Project Task''': ''PHASE1''
#* '''Debit Amount''': <tt>320.00</tt>
#*'''Transaction Description''': <tt>8 hours of training for the customer&rsquo;s employee</tt>
#Add the second row, which represents non-project expenses, and specify the following settings:
#*'''Account''': ''81000 - Other Expense''
#* '''Project''': ''X''
#* '''Debit Amount''': <tt>50.00</tt>
#*'''Credit Amount''': <tt>Cleared</tt>
#*'''Transaction Description''': <tt>Travel expenses</tt>
#Add the third row, which balances the batch of transactions, and specify the following settings:
#*'''Account''': ''23015 - Accrued Expenses''
#* '''Project''': ''X''
#* '''Credit Amount''': <tt>370.00</tt>
#Clear the '''Hold''' check box in the Summary area, and click '''Release''' on the form toolbar to release the batch of transactions.
#:When you release the batch of general ledger transactions, for the general ledger transaction with the specified project and project task, the system creates the corresponding project transaction. The account of the general ledger transaction is mapped to the account group of the created project transaction.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_10_00|Project Transaction Details] ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) form, in the Summary area, select ''TOMYUM1'' as the '''Project''' and review the project transaction that has been created based on the released time activities. Notice the following:
#*The system has created only one project transaction, because only one corresponding general ledger transaction has the specified project and project task. The corresponding batch of general ledger transactions is shown in the '''GL Batch Nbr.''' column.
#*The '''Debit Account Group''' of the project transaction is ''LABOR''.
#*The '''Debit Account''' is ''54100''—that is, the ''54100 - Project Labor Expense'' account.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''TOMYUM1'' project.
#On the '''Cost Budget''' tab, review the cost budget line, which was created based on the batch of general ledger transactions you have just released. Notice that the '''Account Group''' of the budget line is ''LABOR''.
#Click the cost budget line, and on the table toolbar, click '''View Transactions''' to review the project transaction that correspond to the selected line.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_10_00|Project Transaction Details] form, which the system opens in a pop-up window, notice that the project transaction is the transaction that you reviewed in Step 1.6.
#Close the pop-up window with the form.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_10_00|Account Groups] ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) form, open the ''LABOR'' account group, and on the '''Accounts''' tab, notice that the ''54100 - Project Labor Expense'' account is mapped to the account group.

==Step 2: Creating Project Transactions Without Posting to GL==
To create a project transaction that does not affect the general ledger, do the following:[anchor|#_36531b5b-bd53-4aeb-8af4-09409c06c5c3]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) form, create a new project transaction.
#In the Summary area, enter <tt>A 4-hour training session</tt> as the '''Description'''.
#Add a new line with the following settings:
#*'''Project''': ''TOMYUM1''
#* '''Project Task''': ''PHASE2''
#* '''Account Group''': ''LABOR''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''TRAINING''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>4.00</tt>
#*'''Amount''': <tt>160.00</tt>
#:You leave the '''Debit Account''' and '''Credit Account''' columns empty to not create the corresponding general ledger transaction.
#Save your changes to the project transaction, and release it.
#:Notice that no corresponding general ledger transaction has been created and the '''GL Batch Nbr.''' column is empty, as shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_4ad7563b-7bbb-4ad1-8865-cd6ce4bad453][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_Transactions.png|popup|The project transaction that produces no GL transaction|400px]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''TOMYUM1'' project.
#On the '''Cost Budget''' tab, notice that a new cost budget line with the ''PHASE2'' project task has appeared.
#Click the cost budget line, and on the table toolbar, click '''View Transactions''' to review the project transaction that correspond to the selected line.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_10_00|Project Transaction Details] ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) form, which the system opens in a pop-up window, notice that the corresponding project transaction is the transaction that you created and released in this step.

Add the first row, which represents your expenses for the project, and specify                     the following settings: Account :  54100 - Project Labor                             Expense Project :  TOMYUM1 Project Task :  PHASE1 Debit Amount :  320.00 Transaction Description :  8 hours of                                 training for the customer's employee Add the second row, which represents non-project expenses, and specify the                     following settings: Account :  81000 - Other Expense Project :  X Debit Amount :  50.00 Credit Amount :                              Cleared Transaction Description :  Travel                                 expenses Add the third row, which balances the batch of transactions, and specify the                     following settings: Account :  23015 - Accrued Expenses Project :  X Credit Amount :  370.00 Clear the  Hold  check box in the Summary area, and click                          Release  on the form toolbar to release the batch of                         transactions. When you release the batch of general ledger transactions,                         for the general ledger transaction with the specified project and project                         task, the system creates the corresponding project transaction. The account                         of the general ledger transaction is mapped to the account group of the                         created project transaction. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) Project Transaction Details (PM401000) form, in the Summary area,                     select  TOMYUM1  as the  Project  and review the                     project transaction that has been created based on the released time activities.                     Notice the following: The system has created only one project transaction, because only one                             corresponding general ledger transaction has the specified project and                             project task. The corresponding batch of general ledger transactions is                             shown in the  GL Batch Nbr.  column.

 Acumatica ERP supports project quotes, which you can enter and modify on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) form. A project quote is used to estimate a potential project and send a proposal to the customer before a project is created in the system for billing and accounting of revenues and costs. Each modification of a project quote can be printed and sent to the customer for review, and you can modify the quote as many times as is necessary until an agreement is reached. Optionally, you can set up an approval workflow for project quotes so that a manager can approve each modification of a quote before it is sent to the customer. After the customer agrees to the terms of the quote, you can convert the winning quote to a project.{br}{TOC}
==Lesson Objectives==
You will learn how to:[anchor|#ul_nwj_gch_tbb]
*Create a project quote
*Create a project based on the project quote

==Applicable Scenarios==
If your company uses the functionality of opportunities and you want to create a project based on an opportunity, if you want to send a proposal to the customer before a project is created, or if you need to agree with the customer about the terms of a potential project before creating the project, you can use the functionality of project quotes.
==Enabling Project Quotes==
The functionality of project quotes is available only if the ''Project Quotes'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

If the ''Customer Management'' feature is also enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form, a project quote can be created based on an opportunity that has been created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) form.{br}{TOC}[anchor|#section_i3l_d4p_mcb]
==Project Quote Workflow==
The project quote workflow may include the following stages, which are described in the remaining sections of this topic and shown in the diagram below:[anchor|#ol_i13_11l_n2b]
#Creating a project quote.
#:You can start on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) form or use an opportunity on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) form as a starting point and create a quote for the opportunity.
#Submitting the quote.
#Optionally, obtaining approval for the quote.
#Sending the approved quote to the customer for agreement.
#Changing the quote after negotiations with the customer.
#:To keep the history of proposals, you can create a new project quote and make changes to it instead of changing the original project quote. Optionally, project quotes can be linked to an opportunity and you can see the history of proposals in the scope of each opportunity.
#Converting the quote to a project.
[anchor|#fig_fhq_2nv_q2b][anchor|#image_ghq_2nv_q2b][image:UserGuide/Images/Project_Quotes_Workflow.png|popup|The workflow of a project quote|350px][anchor|#section_fdf_x42_p2b]
==Project Quote Creation==
You generally use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) form as a starting point to create a project quote.{br}

For a new project quote, you can specify the following settings:[anchor|#ul_fsf_yfs_p2b]
*The description of the project quote.
*The project template, which the system uses to populate the project tasks, attributes, and project manager of the project quote. You can change these default settings, if needed.
*:If you first specify the tasks, attributes, and project manager of the project quote, and then select the project template, you can either replace your specified settings with the settings of the project template or leave your specified settings.
*The business account associated with the project quote.
*:Based on the settings specified for the selected business account, on the '''Billing Information''' tab, the system populates the contact information and the financial details. You can override these settings, if needed.
*Project tasks on the '''Project Tasks''' tab.
*The estimation of labor and material costs and prices on the '''Estimation''' tab. If you convert the project quote to a project, the system populates the revenue and cost budget of the project based on the settings specified on this tab.
*Activities related to the project quote on the '''Activities''' tab.

You can also create a project quote by selecting an existing project quote on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] form and then invoking the '''Copy Quote''' action on the form toolbar. The system opens the '''Copy Quote''' dialog box, where you can define the settings the system will use when copying the project quote. When you click '''OK''' in the dialog box, the system creates a copy of the project quote based on the settings specified in the dialog box.{br}

You can also create a project quote based on a particular opportunity that is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) form. For more information, see the [[#_82f9bfae-4548-4a6b-8b59-54795eefd6a4|Integration Between Opportunities, Sales Quotes, and Project Quotes] section of this topic.[anchor|#section_xv2_f1w_mcb]
==Project Quote Approval==
A project quote supports the standard Acumatica ERP approval process. The approval map can be configured on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_55_00|Assignment and Approval Maps] ([~/?ScreenId=EP205500|EP205500]) form and then specified in the '''Quote Approval Map''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form. The approval notification for project quotes can be specified in the '''Quote Pending Approval Notification''' box on the same form.{br}

The approval process is optional; the configuration of the approval process can be skipped and a user can create a project quote that is processed without the step of approval.[anchor|#section_vgz_15w_mcb]
==Printing of a Project Quote ==
You can print a project quote with any status. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) form, you can print the selected project quote by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Print Quote''' on the form toolbar.{br}

For the printing of project quotes, the system uses the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\PM_60_45_00|Project Quote] ([~/?ScreenId=PM604500|PM604500]) report. This report supports the printing of estimation lines, the header-level note, and the detailed description of a project quote.{br}

On the '''Billing Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] form, you can specify the contact information of the customer to whom the project quote should be sent.[anchor|#section_spq_ggr_y2b]
==Emailing of a Project Quote==
You can email a submitted and approved (if approval of project quotes is set up in the system) project quote to the customer for review if the status of the project quote is ''Prepared'' or ''Sent''. To do this, you select the quote and then invoke the '''Send Quote''' action on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) form. In this case, an email activity is created and listed on the '''Activities''' tab of the form, the quote is attached to the email activity (in the form of a report) and sent to the recipient, and the status of the quote is changed to ''Sent''.{br}

The email address of the recipient is taken from the contact information specified on the '''Billing Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] form.{br}

The system generates the email in accordance with the settings of the ''PMQUOTE'' mailing of the project template selected for the project quote. The settings of the project template on the '''Mailing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_00|Project Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) form are copied from the '''Mailing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form and can be overridden.{br}

For the ''PMQUOTE'' mailing of each project template, you could change the following settings:[anchor|#ul_ncf_bfw_hdb]
*The email address from which the mailing will be sent; if none is specified, the system will use the default system email account
*The notification template based on which the email body will be generated
*The report that will be attached to the email and the format of the attachment
[anchor|#section_kcj_x42_p2b]
==Creation of a Project Based on a Project Quote==
A project quote with the ''Prepared'' or ''Sent'' status can be converted to a project. Before you convert the project quote, the following settings should be specified for it in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) form:[anchor|#ul_ejx_dpv_q2b]
*'''Project Template''': The template to be used for the creation of the project
*'''Business Account''': The customer of the project
*'''New Project ID''': The identifier of the project

If the project quote has been created based on an opportunity (that is, the project quote has an opportunity selected in the '''Opportunity ID''' box in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] form), the project quote should also be the primary quote of the opportunity (that is, the '''Primary''' check box should be selected in the Summary area of the same form).{br}

For a project quote that satisfies these basic requirements, on the toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] form, you can click '''Convert to Project''' to convert the project quote to a project. The system opens the '''Convert to Project''' dialog box, where you can define the settings to be used for the project creation. When you click '''OK''' in the dialog box, the system creates a project based on the project quote and the settings specified in the dialog box, using the rules described in the next section.{br}

Once a project quote is converted to a project, the quote is assigned the ''Closed'' status and cannot be modified. If you delete the project, the system assigns the ''Prepared'' status to the project quote so you can again create a project based on the modified quote, if needed.
==Settings and Rules a Project Created Based on a Project Quote==
When the system creates a project based on the project quote,the settings of the created project in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form are populated with the following settings of the project quote:[anchor|#ul_n35_h4k_y2b]
*'''Project ID''': If auto-numbering has not been configured for project quotes, the system fills this box with the '''New Project ID''' value specified for the project quote on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) form. Otherwise, the project identifier is assigned automatically.
*'''Customer''': This box is filled with the business account selected for the project quote.
*'''Template''': This box is left empty. The project template reference is not copied from the project quote to the project to avoid confusion, because a project that is created based on a project quote with a project template specified can have a very different structure of project tasks and the project budget than a project that is created directly on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form based on the same project template.
*'''Description''': The system fills this box with description of the project quote.
*'''Status''': The status of the new project is ''Active'' if the '''Activate Project''' check box has been selected in the '''Convert to Project''' dialog box used to convert the project task to a project. Otherwise, the status is ''In Planning''.

When the system creates a project based on the project quote, to populate the settings on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, it uses the corresponding settings of the following sources:[anchor|#ul_dkn_mrk_y2b]
*'''Revenue Budget Level''': The project template specified for the project quote on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] form
*'''Cost Budget Level''': The project template specified for the project quote on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] form
*'''Start Date''': The business date of the project quote
*'''Project Manager''': The project quote
*'''Restrict Employees''': The project template specified for the project quote
*'''Restrict Equipment''': The project template specified for the project quote
*'''Track Production Data''': The project template specified for the project quote
*'''Billing Period''': The project template specified for the project quote
*'''Allocation Rule''': The project template specified for the project quote
*'''Run Allocation on Release of Project Transactions''': The project template specified for the project quote
*'''Billing Rule''': The project template specified for the project quote
*'''Branch''': The project quote

*'''Create Pro Forma on Billing''': The project template specified for the project quote
*'''Use T&M Revenue Budget Limits''': The project template specified for the project quote
*'''Automatically Release AR Documents''': The project template specified for the project quote
*'''Customer Location''': The location of the project quote on the '''Billing Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] form
*'''Bill-To''' section: The contact information of the project quote on the '''Billing Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] form
*'''Bill-To Address''' section: The address of the project quote on the '''Billing Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] form
*'''Visibility Settings''' section: The project template specified for the project quote

When the system creates a project based on the project quote, it populates the tasks on the '''Tasks''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form using the following rules:[anchor|#ul_xgw_1vk_y2b]
*If the project quote has two or more tasks, these tasks are copied to the project. In this case, if the project quote does not have a default task, the created project does not have the default task either.
*If the project quote has only one task, this task is copied to the project and marked as the default task of the project even if the task has not been marked as the default task of the project quote.
*If the project quote has no tasks, the system creates a default project task for the project—that is, a task with the ''0'' identifier and ''Default'' description.
*The status of the created project tasks is ''Active'' if the '''Activate Tasks''' check box has been selected in the '''Convert to Project''' dialog box during the conversion process. Otherwise, the status is ''In Planning''.
*The location of the created tasks is the location of the project quote from the '''Billing Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] form.
*If the project quote has only one task or does not have any task at all and some or all the estimation lines of the project quote have no project task assigned, the system assigns the default task of the project to the cost budget and revenue budget lines of the project that it creates based on these estimation lines.

When the system creates a project based on the project quote, to populate the revenue budget, the system groups the estimation lines of the project quote by the following entities, depending on the revenue budget level of the project template specified for the project quote. This setting is specified in the '''Revenue Budget Level''' box on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_00|Project Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) form:[anchor|#ul_zcw_csv_q2b]
*''Task'': The estimation lines are aggregated by project task and revenue account group.
*''Task and Item'': The estimation lines are grouped by project task, revenue account group, and inventory item.
*''Task and Cost Code'': The estimation lines are grouped by project task, revenue account group, and cost code.

For each group of estimation lines, on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the system creates a revenue budget line with the following settings:[anchor|#ul_ckd_5qv_q2b]
*'''Project Task''': The system uses the project task of the aggregated estimation lines.
*'''Inventory ID''': The system uses the inventory item of the aggregated estimation lines. Estimation lines without an inventory item specified are aggregated into a cost budget line with the empty item code, which is defined in the '''Empty Item Code''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form.
*'''Account Group''': The system uses the revenue account group of the aggregated estimation lines.
*'''Description''': Depending on the number of aggregated estimation lines in a group, the system assigns the following description to the revenue budget line:
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of one line, the description of this line is copied to the cost budget line.
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines, the description of the cost budget line is ''Aggregated: Account Group Description'', where ''Account Group Description'' is the description of the account group by which the group of estimation lines has been aggregated.
*'''Original Budgeted Quantity''': The system inserts the total quantity of the aggregated lines if each of the lines has the same UOM. Otherwise, the quantity is zero.
*'''UOM''': The system uses the UOM of aggregated estimation lines if each of the lines has the same UOM. Otherwise the UOM is empty.
*'''Unit Rate''': The calculation of the unit rate of the revenue budget line depends on the number of aggregated estimation lines in a group as follows:
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of one line, the unit price of this line is copied to the revenue budget line.
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and each of these lines has the same UOM, the system calculates the unit rate as the total '''Amount''' of the lines divided by the total quantity of the lines.
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and the lines have different UOM values,the unit rate of the revenue budget line is zero.
*'''Original Budgeted Amount''': The system inserts the total amount of the aggregated lines.
*'''Tax Category''': The tax category of the revenue budget line depends on the tax category of aggregated estimation lines in the group as follows:
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of one line, the tax category of this line is copied to the revenue budget line.
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and all the lines have the same tax category, this tax category is copied to the revenue budget line.
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and the lines have either the same tax category or an empty tax category, the specified tax category is copied to the revenue budget line.
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and the lines have at least two different tax categories, the tax category of the revenue budget line is empty.

When the system creates a project based on the project quote, to populate the cost budget, the system groups the estimation lines of the project quote by the following entities, depending on the cost budget level of the project template specified for the project quote. This setting is specified in the '''Cost Budget Level''' box on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_00|Project Templates] form:[anchor|#_97924563-f62a-45ac-96cb-016335f5e9a6]
*''Task'': The estimation lines are aggregated by project task and account group.
*''Task and Item'': The estimation lines are grouped by project task, account group, and inventory item.
*''Task and Cost Code'': The estimation lines are grouped by project task, account group, and cost code.

For each group of estimation lines, on the '''Cost Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the system creates a cost budget line with the following settings:[anchor|#ul_cxz_hqv_q2b]
*'''Project Task''': The system inserts the project task of the aggregated estimation lines.
*'''Inventory ID''': The system uses the inventory item of the aggregated estimation lines. Estimation lines without an inventory item specified are aggregated into a cost budget line with the empty item code, which is defined in the '''Empty Item Code''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] form.
*'''Account Group''': The system inserts the cost account group of the aggregated estimation lines.
*'''Description''': Depending on the number of aggregated estimation lines in a group, the system assigns the following description to the cost budget line:
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of one line, the description of this line is copied to the cost budget line.
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines, the description of the cost budget line is ''Aggregated: Account Group Description'', where ''Account Group Description'' is the description of the account group by which the group of estimation lines has been aggregated.
*'''Original Budgeted Quantity''': The system inserts the total quantity of the aggregated lines if each of the lines has the same UOM. Otherwise, the quantity is zero.
*'''UOM''': The system uses the UOM of the aggregated estimation lines if each of the lines has the same UOM. Otherwise, the UOM is empty.
*'''Unit Rate''': The calculation of the unit rate of the cost budget line depends on the number of aggregated estimation lines in the group as follows:
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of one line, the unit rate of this line is copied to the cost budget line.
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines, the system calculates the unit rate as the total '''Ext. Cost''' of lines that have a nonzero quantity divided by the total quantity of these lines. The lines of the group with the zero quantity or zero '''Ext. Cost''' are ignored in the calculation.
*'''Original Budgeted Amount''': The system calculates this amount as the total extended cost of the aggregated lines.
*'''Unit Price''': The calculation of the unit price of the cost budget line depends on the number of aggregated estimation lines in the group as follows:
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of one line, the unit price of this line is copied to the cost budget line.
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and each of these lines has the same UOM, the system calculates the unit price as the total '''Amount''' of the lines divided by the total quantity of the lines.
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and the lines have different UOM values, the unit price of the cost budget line is zero.

The project settings on the following tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form are copied from the following sources:[anchor|#ul_kzp_3wp_y2b]
*'''Activity History''': The project quote if the '''Link Activities to Project''' check box has been selected in the '''Convert to Project''' dialog box during conversion
*'''Equipment''': The project template specified for the project quote
*'''Settings''': The project template specified for the project quote
*'''Attributes''': The project quote
*'''Mailing Settings''': The project template specified for the project quote

In a project created based on a project quote, the reference to the project quote is displayed in the '''Quote Ref. Nbr.''' box of the '''Quote''' section on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form.[anchor|#_82f9bfae-4548-4a6b-8b59-54795eefd6a4]
==Integration Between Opportunities, Sales Quotes, and Project Quotes==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) form, for the selected opportunity, a user can create a project quote or a sales quote in any of the following ways:[anchor|#ul_mvv_xgq_ncb]
*By clicking '''Create Quote''' on the form toolbar
*By clicking '''Create Quote''' on the table toolbar of the '''Quotes''' tab
*By selecting an existing quote on the '''Quotes''' tab and then invoking the '''Copy Quote''' action on the table toolbar; in this case, a copy of the selected quote is created

On the '''Quotes''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] form, the user can review all the quotes linked to the selected opportunity. The tab lists both project quotes and sales quotes. The primary quote of the opportunity is the quote for which the check box in the '''Primary''' column is selected. If a project quote is the primary project quote of an opportunity, the project quote reflects the opportunity value in sales reports. However, the details of the project quote and the actions applicable to the quote are not reflected in the opportunity.{br}

With the linked opportunity and project quote, the user can do the following:[anchor|#ul_ofr_42r_r2b]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] form, create a copy of the quote selected on the '''Quotes''' tab
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] form, mark the quote selected on the '''Quotes''' tab as the primary quote
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] form, print the quote selected on the '''Quotes''' tab
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] form, send the quote selected on the '''Quotes''' tab, which creates the corresponding activity and updates the quote status to ''Sent''
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] form, make the primary quote available for editing, which updates the status of the quote to ''Draft''
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] form, submit the primary quote, which updates the status of the quote to ''Prepared''
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) form, remove the opportunity with the ''New'' or ''Open'' status from a project quote if the project quote is not the primary quote for the opportunity

A user can find all the project and sales quotes on the All Quotes (PM3045PL) form.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Project Quotes: General Info  Acumatica ERP supports project quotes, which you can enter and modify on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes (PM304500) form. A project quote is used to estimate a potential         project and send a proposal to the customer before a project is created in the system for         billing and accounting of revenues and costs. Each modification of a project quote can be         printed and sent to the customer for review, and you can modify the quote as many times as         is necessary until an agreement is reached. Optionally, you can set up an approval workflow         for project quotes so that a manager can approve each modification of a quote before it is         sent to the customer. After the customer agrees to the terms of the quote, you can convert         the winning quote to a project. Lesson Objectives You will learn how to: Create a project quote Create a project based on the project quote Applicable Scenarios If your company uses the functionality of opportunities and you want to create a project         based on an opportunity, if you want to send a proposal to the customer before a project is         created, or if you need to agree with the customer about the terms of a potential project         before creating the project, you can use the functionality of project quotes. Enabling Project Quotes The functionality of project quotes is available only if the  Project Quotes  feature         is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. If the  Customer Management  feature is also enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features form, a         project quote can be created based on an opportunity that has been created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) Opportunities (CR304000)         form. Project Quote Workflow The project quote workflow may include the following stages, which are described in the         remaining sections of this topic and shown in the diagram below: Creating a project quote. You can start on the    ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes             (PM304500) form or use an opportunity on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) Opportunities             (CR304000) form as a starting point and create a quote for the opportunity. Submitting the quote. Optionally, obtaining approval for the quote. Sending the approved quote to the customer for agreement. Changing the quote after negotiations with the customer. To keep the history of             proposals, you can create a new project quote and make changes to it instead of changing             the original project quote. Optionally, project quotes can be linked to an opportunity             and you can see the history of proposals in the scope of each opportunity. Converting the quote to a project. The workflow of a project quote Project Quote Creation You generally use the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes (PM304500) form as a starting point         to create a project quote. For a new project quote, you can specify the following settings: The description of the project quote. The project template, which the system uses to populate the project tasks, attributes,           and project manager of the project quote. You can change these default settings, if             needed. If you first specify the tasks, attributes, and project manager of the project             quote, and then select the project template, you can either replace your specified             settings with the settings of the project template or leave your specified           settings. The business account associated with the project quote. Based on the settings             specified for the selected business account, on the  Billing               Information  tab, the system populates the contact information and the             financial details. You can override these settings, if needed. Project tasks on the  Project Tasks  tab. The estimation of labor and material costs and prices on the              Estimation  tab. If you convert the project quote to a project,           the system populates the revenue and cost budget of the project based on the settings           specified on this tab. Activities related to the project quote on the  Activities            tab. You can also create a project quote by selecting an existing project quote on the             ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes form and then invoking the  Copy           Quote  action on the form toolbar. The system opens the  Copy           Quote  dialog box, where you can define the settings the system will use when         copying the project quote. When you click  OK  in the dialog box, the         system creates a copy of the project quote based on the settings specified in the dialog         box. You can also create a project quote based on a particular opportunity that is selected on         the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) Opportunities         (CR304000) form. For more information, see the  Integration Between Opportunities, Sales Quotes, and Project Quotes Integration Between Opportunities, Sales Quotes, and Project Quotes section of this topic. Project Quote Approval A project quote supports the standard  Acumatica ERP approval process. The approval map can be configured on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP205500|EP205500]) Assignment and Approval Maps (EP205500)         form and then specified in the  Quote Approval Map  box on the            General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form. The approval notification for         project quotes can be specified in the  Quote Pending Approval           Notification  box on the same form. The approval process is optional; the configuration of the approval process can be skipped         and a user can create a project quote that is processed without the step of approval. Printing of a Project Quote  You can print a project quote with any status. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes         (PM304500) form, you can print the selected project quote by clicking  Actions Print Quote  on the form toolbar. For the printing of project quotes, the system uses the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM604500|PM604500]) Project Quote         (PM604500) report. This report supports the printing of estimation lines, the header-level         note, and the detailed description of a project quote. On the  Billing Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes form, you can specify the contact information of the customer to whom the project quote         should be sent. Emailing of a Project Quote You can email a submitted and approved (if approval of project quotes is set up in the         system) project quote to the customer for review if the status of the project quote is            Prepared  or  Sent . To do this, you select the quote and then invoke the            Send Quote  action on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes (PM304500) form. In this case, an email activity is created and         listed on the  Activities  tab of the form, the quote is attached to         the email activity (in the form of a report) and sent to the recipient, and the status of         the quote is changed to  Sent . The email address of the recipient is taken from the contact information specified on the            Billing Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes         form. The system generates the email in accordance with the settings of the  PMQUOTE          mailing of the project template selected for the project quote. The settings of the project         template on the  Mailing Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) Project Templates (PM208000) form are copied from the  Mailing           Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form and can be         overridden. For the  PMQUOTE  mailing of each project template, you could change the following         settings: The email address from which the mailing will be sent; if none is specified, the system           will use the default system email account The notification template based on which the email body will be generated The report that will be attached to the email and the format of the attachment Creation of a Project Based on a Project Quote A project quote with the  Prepared  or  Sent  status can be converted to a         project. Before you convert the project quote, the following settings should be specified         for it in the Summary area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes (PM304500) form: Project Template : The template to be used for the creation of the           project Business Account : The customer of the project New Project ID : The identifier of the project If the project quote has been created based on an opportunity (that is, the project quote         has an opportunity selected in the  Opportunity ID  box in the Summary         area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes form), the project quote should also be the         primary quote of the opportunity (that is, the  Primary  check box         should be selected in the Summary area of the same form). For a project quote that satisfies these basic requirements, on the toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes form, you can click  Convert to Project  to         convert the project quote to a project. The system opens the  Convert to           Project  dialog box, where you can define the settings to be used for the         project creation. When you click  OK  in the dialog box, the system         creates a project based on the project quote and the settings specified in the dialog box,         using the rules described in the next section. Once a project quote is converted to a project, the quote is assigned the  Closed          status and cannot be modified. If you delete the project, the system assigns the            Prepared  status to the project quote so you can again create a project based on the         modified quote, if needed. Settings and Rules a Project Created Based on a Project Quote When the system creates a project based on the project quote,the settings of the created         project in the Summary area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000)         form are populated with the following settings of the project quote: Project ID : If auto-numbering has not been configured for project           quotes, the system fills this box with the  New Project ID  value           specified for the project quote on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes (PM304500) form.           Otherwise, the project identifier is assigned automatically. Customer : This box is filled with the business account selected           for the project quote. Template : This box is left empty. The project template reference           is not copied from the project quote to the project to avoid confusion, because a project           that is created based on a project quote with a project template specified can have a very           different structure of project tasks and the project budget than a project that is created           directly on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form based on the same           project template. Description : The system fills this box with description of the           project quote. Status : The status of the new project is  Active  if the              Activate Project  check box has been selected in the              Convert to Project  dialog box used to convert the project task to           a project. Otherwise, the status is  In Planning . When the system creates a project based on the project quote, to populate the settings on         the  Summary  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects         form, it uses the corresponding settings of the following sources: Revenue Budget Level : The project template specified for the           project quote on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes form Cost Budget Level : The project template specified for the project           quote on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes form Start Date : The business date of the project quote Project Manager : The project quote Restrict Employees : The project template specified for the           project quote Restrict Equipment : The project template specified for the           project quote Track Production Data : The project template specified for the           project quote Billing Period : The project template specified for the project           quote Allocation Rule : The project template specified for the project           quote Run Allocation on Release of Project Transactions : The project           template specified for the project quote Billing Rule : The project template specified for the project           quote Branch : The project quote Rate Table : The project template specified for the project           quote Create Pro Forma on Billing : The project template specified for           the project quote Use T&M Revenue Budget Limits : The project template specified           for the project quote Automatically Release AR Documents : The project template           specified for the project quote Customer Location : The location of the project quote on the              Billing Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes           form Bill-To  section: The contact information of the project quote on           the  Billing Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes           form Bill-To Address  section: The address of the project quote on the              Billing Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes           form Visibility Settings  section: The project template specified for           the project quote When the system creates a project based on the project quote, it populates the tasks on the            Tasks  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form         using the following rules: If the project quote has two or more tasks, these tasks are copied to the project. In           this case, if the project quote does not have a default task, the created project does not           have the default task either. If the project quote has only one task, this task is copied to the project and marked as           the default task of the project even if the task has not been marked as the default task           of the project quote. If the project quote has no tasks, the system creates a default project task for the           project—that is, a task with the  0  identifier and  Default  description. The status of the created project tasks is  Active  if the  Activate             Tasks  check box has been selected in the  Convert to             Project  dialog box during the conversion process. Otherwise, the status is              In Planning . The location of the created tasks is the location of the project quote from the              Billing Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes           form. If the project quote has only one task or does not have any task at all and some or all           the estimation lines of the project quote have no project task assigned, the system           assigns the default task of the project to the cost budget and revenue budget lines of the           project that it creates based on these estimation lines. When the system creates a project based on the project quote, to populate the revenue         budget, the system groups the estimation lines of the project quote by the following         entities, depending on the revenue budget level of the project template specified for the         project quote. This setting is specified in the  Revenue Budget Level          box on the  Summary  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) Project Templates (PM208000) form: Task : The estimation lines are aggregated by project task and revenue account           group. Task and Item : The estimation lines are grouped by project task, revenue account           group, and inventory item. Task and Cost Code : The estimation lines are grouped by project task, revenue           account group, and cost code. For each group of estimation lines, on the  Revenue Budget  tab of the             ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, the system creates a revenue budget         line with the following settings: Project Task : The system uses the project task of the aggregated           estimation lines. Inventory ID : The system uses the inventory item of the           aggregated estimation lines. Estimation lines without an inventory item specified are           aggregated into a cost budget line with the empty item code, which is defined in the              Empty Item Code  box on the  General             Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000)           form. Account Group : The system uses the revenue account group of the           aggregated estimation lines. Description : Depending on the number of aggregated estimation           lines in a group, the system assigns the following description to the revenue budget             line: If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of one line, the description of               this line is copied to the cost budget line. If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines, the               description of the cost budget line is  Aggregated: Account Group Description ,               where  Account Group Description  is the description of the account group by               which the group of estimation lines has been aggregated. Original Budgeted Quantity : The system inserts the total quantity           of the aggregated lines if each of the lines has the same UOM. Otherwise, the quantity is           zero. UOM : The system uses the UOM of aggregated estimation lines if           each of the lines has the same UOM. Otherwise the UOM is empty. Unit Rate : The calculation of the unit rate of the revenue budget           line depends on the number of aggregated estimation lines in a group as follows: If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of one line, the unit price of               this line is copied to the revenue budget line. If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and each               of these lines has the same UOM, the system calculates the unit rate as the total                  Amount  of the lines divided by the total quantity of the               lines. If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and the               lines have different UOM values,the unit rate of the revenue budget line is zero. Original Budgeted Amount : The system inserts the total amount of           the aggregated lines. Tax Category : The tax category of the revenue budget line depends           on the tax category of aggregated estimation lines in the group as follows: If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of one line, the tax category               of this line is copied to the revenue budget line. If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and all               the lines have the same tax category, this tax category is copied to the revenue               budget line. If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and the               lines have either the same tax category or an empty tax category, the specified tax               category is copied to the revenue budget line. If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and the               lines have at least two different tax categories, the tax category of the revenue               budget line is empty. When the system creates a project based on the project quote, to populate the cost budget,         the system groups the estimation lines of the project quote by the following entities,         depending on the cost budget level of the project template specified for the project quote.         This setting is specified in the  Cost Budget Level  box on the            Summary  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) Project Templates         form: Task : The estimation lines are aggregated by project task and account group. Task and Item : The estimation lines are grouped by project task, account group,           and inventory item. Task and Cost Code : The estimation lines are grouped by project task, account           group, and cost code. For each group of estimation lines, on the  Cost Budget  tab of the             ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, the system creates a cost budget line         with the following settings: Project Task : The system inserts the project task of the           aggregated estimation lines. Inventory ID : The system uses the inventory item of the           aggregated estimation lines. Estimation lines without an inventory item specified are           aggregated into a cost budget line with the empty item code, which is defined in the              Empty Item Code  box on the  General             Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences form. Account Group : The system inserts the cost account group of the           aggregated estimation lines. Description : Depending on the number of aggregated estimation           lines in a group, the system assigns the following description to the cost budget line: If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of one line, the description of               this line is copied to the cost budget line. If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines, the               description of the cost budget line is  Aggregated: Account Group Description ,               where  Account Group Description  is the description of the account group by               which the group of estimation lines has been aggregated. Original Budgeted Quantity : The system inserts the total quantity           of the aggregated lines if each of the lines has the same UOM. Otherwise, the quantity is           zero. UOM : The system uses the UOM of the aggregated estimation lines           if each of the lines has the same UOM. Otherwise, the UOM is empty. Unit Rate : The calculation of the unit rate of the cost budget           line depends on the number of aggregated estimation lines in the group as follows: If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of one line, the unit rate of               this line is copied to the cost budget line. If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines, the               system calculates the unit rate as the total  Ext. Cost  of lines               that have a nonzero quantity divided by the total quantity of these lines. The lines               of the group with the zero quantity or zero  Ext. Cost  are               ignored in the calculation. Original Budgeted Amount : The system calculates this amount as           the total extended cost of the aggregated lines. Unit Price : The calculation of the unit price of the cost budget           line depends on the number of aggregated estimation lines in the group as follows: If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of one line, the unit price of               this line is copied to the cost budget line. If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and each               of these lines has the same UOM, the system calculates the unit price as the total                  Amount  of the lines divided by the total quantity of the               lines. If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and the               lines have different UOM values, the unit price of the cost budget line is zero. The project settings on the following tabs of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form are copied from the following sources: Activity History : The project quote if the  Link             Activities to Project  check box has been selected in the  Convert             to Project  dialog box during conversion Equipment : The project template specified for the project           quote Settings : The project template specified for the project           quote Attributes : The project quote Mailing Settings : The project template specified for the project           quote In a project created based on a project quote, the reference to the project quote is         displayed in the  Quote Ref.

Integration Between Opportunities, Sales Quotes, and Project Quotes On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) Opportunities         (CR304000) form, for the selected opportunity, a user can create a project quote or a sales         quote in any of the following ways: By clicking  Create Quote  on the form toolbar By clicking  Create Quote  on the table toolbar of the              Quotes  tab By selecting an existing quote on the  Quotes  tab and           then invoking the  Copy Quote  action on the table toolbar; in this           case, a copy of the selected quote is created On the  Quotes  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) Opportunities form, the         user can review all the quotes linked to the selected opportunity. The tab lists both         project quotes and sales quotes. The primary quote of the opportunity is the quote for which         the check box in the  Primary  column is selected. If a project quote         is the primary project quote of an opportunity, the project quote reflects the opportunity         value in sales reports. However, the details of the project quote and the actions applicable         to the quote are not reflected in the opportunity. With the linked opportunity and project quote, the user can do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) Opportunities form, create a copy of the quote selected on the  Quotes  tab On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) Opportunities form, mark the quote selected on the  Quotes  tab as the primary           quote On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) Opportunities form, print the quote selected on the  Quotes  tab On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) Opportunities form, send the quote selected on the  Quotes  tab, which creates           the corresponding activity and updates the quote status to  Sent On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) Opportunities form, make the primary quote available for editing, which updates the status of the           quote to  Draft On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) Opportunities form, submit the primary quote, which updates the status of the quote to              Prepared On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes (PM304500) form, remove the opportunity with the              New  or  Open  status from a project quote if the project quote is not the           primary quote for the opportunity A user can find all the project and sales quotes on the All Quotes  (PM3045PL)          form.

==Story==
Suppose that the HM&rsquo;s Bakery and Cafe customer has ordered a juicer for one of its restaurants, along with the installation and training services. The sales manager has created an opportunity for the provision of the juicer and the services. The estimator will then create a project quote for this opportunity, review the quote with the customer, and convert the quote to the project. You will perform the needed actions in the system, acting as the estimator.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this lesson, the following features have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form:[anchor|#_4387db18-6b29-4015-8d96-56b9069f20d7]
*''Project Accounting'', which provides support for the project accounting functionality
*''Project Quotes'', which provides the ability to create project quotes

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) form, the ''000001'' opportunity has been configured.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_00|Project Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) form, the ''PROGRESS'' project template has been configured.
==Process Overview==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) form, you initiate the creation of a project quote for the opportunity created for the customer. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) form, you add estimation lines to the project quote. You also print the project quote to send it to the customer for review. Then you convert the quote to a project.
==System Preparation==
Before you begin performing the steps of this activity, perform the following instructions to prepare the system:[anchor|#_6c9e4914-0e56-4fc0-9f9d-df880dcd99b6]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the U100 dataset preloaded as Pam Brawner by using the ''brawner'' login and the ''123'' password.[anchor|#_3ded097c-d9d0-46ba-8f5c-88cbd16eb879]
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select ''1/30/2020'' on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.

==Step 1: Creating a Project Quote==
To create a project quote for an opportunity, do the following:[anchor|#_de8b7925-a170-40ef-91d6-1d90afb86754]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) form, open the ''000001'' opportunity.
#On the form title bar, notice that the opportunity has a note and an attached file.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Create Quote'''.
#In the '''Create New Quote''' dialog box, which opens in a pop-up window, select ''Project Quote'' as the '''Quote Type''', and click '''Create and Review'''.
#:The system creates a project quote based on the opportunity and opens the project quote on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) form.
#On this form, notice that the note and the attached file have been copied to the project quote from the opportunity.
#In the Summary area, specify the following settings:
#*'''Project Template''': ''PROGRESS''
#* '''New Project ID''': <tt>HMBAKERY1</tt>
#:When you select the project template, the system fills in the relevant elements of the project quote with the settings specified for the template, including tasks.
#On the '''Estimation''' tab, add three lines with the settings from the following table as the estimation lines; these settings establish cost by task and inventory item.
#:{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="25%" ! '''Inventory ID'''

|  ''LABOR''
|}
#For each of the added lines, clear the '''Ext. Price''' and '''Revenue Account Group''' columns. The system will not convert lines with no price and revenue account group to the project revenue.
#On the '''Estimation''' tab, add two more lines with the settings from the following table as the estimation lines; these settings establish revenue by task.
#:{| class="checklist" | width="100%"

| ''PHASE2''
|  ''REVENUE''
|}
#Save your changes to the project quote.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Print Quote''' to print the project quote.
#:The system navigates to the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\PM_60_45_00|Project Quote] ([~/?ScreenId=PM604500|PM604500]) report, which is a ready-to-print version of the quote.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] form, again open the ''000001'' opportunity, and notice that the '''Amount''' in the Summary area is equal to the total sales of the created quote, which is the primary quote of the opportunity, and shown in the '''Amount''' column on the '''Quotes''' tab.

==Step 2: Creating a Project Based on the Project Quote==
To create a project based on the project quote, do the following:[anchor|#_4557bd7a-f6e8-429a-8de0-d8aa89226c02]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) form, open the project quote that you have just created.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Submit Quote'''. The system changes the status of the quote to ''Prepared''.
#Notice that now you cannot edit the project quote.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Convert to Project''' to convert the quote to a project.
#In the '''Convert to Project''' dialog box, which opens in a pop-up window, select the '''Copy Notes to Project''' and '''Copy Files to Project''' check boxes, and click '''OK'''.
#:The system changes the status of the project quote to ''Closed'', creates a project based on the project quote, and opens the project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form.
#On this form, notice that the note and the attached file have been copied to the project from the project quote.
#On the '''Tasks''' tab, review project tasks that have been copied from the project quote.
#On the '''Revenue Budget''' tab, review revenue budget lines of the project that have been created based on the estimation lines of the project quote with the specified revenue account group.
#On the '''Cost Budget''' tab, review cost budget lines of the project that have been created based on the estimation lines of the project quote with the specified cost account group.
#On the '''Balances''' tab (see the following screenshot), verify the totals: The '''Income Totals''' of the project balance should match the '''Total Sales''' of the project quote, and the '''Expense Totals''' of the project balance should match the '''Total Cost''' of the project quote.

The project management functionality in Acumatica ERP offers a new way of handling financial and management accounting in the company. By using projects, you can break corporate activity into separate units of work that are more relevant to the job and less complex. In the process, you gain valuable insight into what is happening within the company. {br}

A project in Acumatica ERP is a one-time endeavor with a defined start and end date, usually constrained by time and often limited in funding, deliverables, or both factors. For example, if your company builds residential houses, you might consider the process of building each house a separate project with its own budget, costs, and revenues. {br}{TOC}
==Projects ==
A project in Acumatica ERP can be viewed as a container for ''project tasks''. A project provides a unified environment, context, and scope for executing the tasks. For instance, a project specifies the date range, calendar, customer, resources (including employees and equipment), and modules that are integrated with the project. {br}

You can view and specify the settings of a particular project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. You can also track balances for account groups involved in the project, viewing budgeted, revised, and actual amounts. Each account group balance in a project is the total of all the corresponding amounts in the project tasks. That is, the project does not have any balances beyond those in the tasks of the project.
==Type of Projects==
You can use projects for tracking both in-house work and activities involving interaction with customers. An ''internal'' project is used to track activity completed within your company and for your company; for example, you can run an in-house training program as an internal project. Internal projects have budgets, do not include billing settings, and do not refer to any customer. {br}

An ''external'' project involves providing services and products to customers. An external project can be a ''fixed-price'' project or a ''cost-plus'' project in which the price is a percentage of the costs.
==Project Tasks==
A ''project task'' (or simply ''task'') is the smallest identifiable piece of work that is a part of the project. Tasks are used to identify different steps or activities within the project that are easily manageable, separable, traceable, and accountable. {br}

Tasks are always defined within the scope and limitations of a specific project. For instance, the task may not extend beyond the start and end dates of the project. Also, you may not make a task visible in the modules in which its parent project is not visible. You can, however, narrow or even disable the visibility of a task in the modules where the parent project ''is'' visible. A task includes the following settings, which are specific to each task and do not extend to the project: [anchor|#ul_txb_4gb_nr]
*'''Billing rule''': You can define the allocation and billing procedures for the particular task.
*'''Recurring billing''': You can stipulate the provision of services and products on a regular basis for a flat price.
*'''Status''': You can set the most appropriate status for each task. Thus, there is no correlation between the statuses of individual tasks in a given project.
*'''Percent completed''': Percent of task completion is used for revenue allocations. This is a unique property of tasks, since a percentage of completion for a project cannot be calculated in the current version. To work around this limitation, you can add a task that is used exclusively to track project progress. For each task, you can select the method of completion calculation:
**''Manual'': The percent of task completion is specified manually.
**''Budgeted Quantity'': The percent of completion is calculated automatically for the selected cost line (with the '''Production''' check box selected). The percent of task completion is calculated as actual quantity divided by the budgeted quantity for the selected line.
**''Budgeted Amount'': The percent of completion is calculated automatically for multiple cost lines (with the '''Production''' check box selected) as the total actual amount divided by the total budgeted amount. 
*'''Default''': You can assign one of the project tasks as the default one. On the data entry forms that support the selection of a project, the default project task is automatically populated when you selects the project.
*:You can select a task to be the default one for a project with the ''Active'' or ''In Planning'' status.

==Project and Task IDs==
As with other identifiers in Acumatica ERP, you can configure the project and task identifiers by configuring the segmented keys: ''PROJECT'' and ''PROTASK'', respectively. You can use the predefined configurations of the keys or you can configure the segmented keys as you need by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form. You can define how many segments each key will include, what values may be used, whether they should be validated, and whether auto-numbering should be used in one of the segments.

For example, if 				your company builds residential houses, you might consider the process of building 				each house a separate project with its own budget, costs, and revenues.  Projects  A project in  Acumatica ERP can be viewed as a container for  project tasks . A project provides a 				unified environment, context, and scope for executing the tasks. For instance, a 				project specifies the date range, calendar, customer, resources (including employees 				and equipment), and modules that are integrated with the project.  You can view and specify the settings of a particular project on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. You can also track 				balances for account groups involved in the project, viewing budgeted, revised, and 				actual amounts. Each account group balance in a project is the total of all the 				corresponding amounts in the project tasks. That is, the project does not have any 				balances beyond those in the tasks of the project. Type of Projects You can use projects for tracking both in-house work and activities involving 				interaction with customers. An  internal  project is used to track activity 				completed within your company and for your company; for example, you can run an 				in-house training program as an internal project. Internal projects have budgets, do 				not include billing settings, and do not refer to any customer.   An  external  project involves providing services and products to customers. An external 				project can be a  fixed-price  project or a  cost-plus  project in which 				the price is a percentage of the costs. Project Tasks A  project task  (or simply  task ) is the smallest identifiable piece of 				work that is a part of the project. Tasks are used to identify different steps or 				activities within the project that are easily manageable, separable, traceable, and 				accountable.  Tasks are always defined within the scope and limitations of a specific project. For 				instance, the task may not extend beyond the start and end dates of the project. 				Also, you may not make a task visible in the modules in which its parent project is 				not visible. You can, however, narrow or even disable the visibility of a task in 				the modules where the parent project  is  visible. A task includes the 				following settings, which are specific to each task and do not extend to the 				project:  Billing rule : You can define the allocation and billing procedures for 					the particular task. Recurring billing : You can stipulate the provision of services and 					products on a regular basis for a flat price. Status : You can set the most appropriate status for each task. Thus, 					there is no correlation between the statuses of individual tasks in a given 					project. Percent completed : Percent of task completion is used for revenue 					allocations. This is a unique property of tasks, since a percentage of 					completion for a project cannot be calculated in the current version. To work 					around this limitation, you can add a task that is used exclusively to track 					project progress. For each task, you can select the method of completion 						calculation: Manual : The percent of task completion is specified 							manually. Budgeted Quantity : The percent of completion is calculated 							automatically for the selected cost line (with the 								 Production  check box selected). The percent 							of task completion is calculated as actual quantity divided by the 							budgeted quantity for the selected line. Budgeted Amount : The percent of completion is calculated 							automatically for multiple cost lines (with the 								 Production  check box selected) as the total 							actual amount divided by the total budgeted amount.  Default : You can assign one of the project tasks as the 					default one. On the data entry forms that support the selection of a project, 					the default project task is automatically populated when you selects the 						project. You can select a task to be the default one for a project with 						the  Active  or  In Planning  status. Project and Task IDs As with other identifiers in  Acumatica ERP, you can configure the project and task identifiers by configuring the segmented 				keys:  PROJECT  and  PROTASK , respectively. You can use the predefined 				configurations of the keys or you can configure the segmented keys as you need by 				using the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) Segmented Keys (CS202000) form. You can 				define how many segments each key will include, what values may be used, whether 				they should be validated, and whether auto-numbering should be used in one of the 				segments.

In Acumatica ERP, a project is a separate one-time or recurring endeavor with a specific scope, time frame, and budget. From its inception to completion, a project goes through the following stages: [anchor|#ul_rmk_5yq_qn]
*'''Planning''': During this stage, you specify project parameters, define tasks, add activities, and populate the project with employees, resources, and equipment. Each project once created is automatically assigned the ''In Planning'' status.
*'''Approval''': The project passes through this stage only if approval of projects is required in your system.
*'''Active''': During this stage, the project is executed, and it becomes visible in the integrated modules and available for posting transactions. 
*'''Completion''': Once the project is finished, it is assigned the ''Completed'' status. A project with the ''Completed'' status is no longer available for posting transactions. This is the final stage in the project life cycle.

These stages are described in greater detail below. {br}{TOC}
==Prerequisites==
Before you enter any new project in Acumatica ERP, you must ensure that the following are configured: 
*'''Account Groups''': Create and populate the account groups that will be used in the project. Account groups make it possible to transfer financial and non-financial information between the Projects module and other modules by associating transactions posted in other modules with your project.
*'''Rate Tables''': If your project uses a pricing model in which price may differ depending on multiple factors, such as task and inventory item, you need to define this model in Acumatica ERP by using rate tables that will provide rates for different sets of factors.
*'''Allocation Rules''': If your project uses a complex cost accrual model, you must specify appropriate allocation rules to correctly track project expenditures and future revenues.
*'''Billing Rules''': These rules define which of the transactions should be used for billing and which accounts should be used to record the transactions that are generated in the billing process.

==Planning Stage==
 Any new project you create in Acumatica ERP is automatically assigned the ''In Planning'' status. Before you make any project active or submit it for approval, you must thoroughly plan it and specify all the key properties. {br}

You can create a project either from scratch or from a template. Creating a project from scratch requires you to specify all the details. If you use a template, your new project will be populated with the template settings, and you need to enter only information that differs from (or is more specific than) the information in the template. {br}

When you are adding a new project by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, you enter the following information: [anchor|#ul_uyr_kyw_2n]
*'''General Information''': This information includes the description, start date, end date, and billing period. You also select one of these billing options: on the date of the customer statement, at the end of each month, at the end of each quarter, or at the end of each year.
*'''Visibility Settings''': You can specify the modules with which you want to integrate your project. We recommend that you select only those modules that you will use to post documents related to your project.
*'''Tasks''': You can define the tasks for the project. A task in a project is a separate work unit with its own life cycle, budget, cost, and revenue.
*'''Employees''': You specify the employees to be engaged in the project. You can override the default labor class specified for specific employees by defining different labor classes for regular working hours and for overtime hours.
*'''Equipment''': You can list the equipment to be used in the project. You can override the default run, standby, and suspend rates for specific equipment.
*'''Attributes''': You can specify attribute values for the project—if a group of attributes has been assigned to projects on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form—and for project tasks if a group of attributes has been assigned to tasks.

A project in the planning stage is not available for selection on data entry forms in other modules integrated with the Projects module. To projects and project tasks that are in the ''In Planning'' status, you can add activities by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) forms. For instance, you can add an employee task for planning budgets for project tasks while at the stage of project planning. However, the transactions generated for completed activities (if any) can not be released until the project gets the ''Active'' status.{br}

You may move a project to the active stage once such essential preparation steps as the following have been completed: [anchor|#ul_ayj_kzw_2n]
*Reaching an agreement with all the stakeholders, including customers and employees
*Estimating the budget for the project and the expenditures it will entail
*Preparing the equipment and materials required for the project

 After preparation has been completed, you can take the project off hold by clearing the '''On Hold''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form and saving it. If approval is not required in your system, the project becomes active. 
==Approval (Optional Stage)==
If projects in your organization should be approved before they can be used, the project gets the ''Pending Approval'' status once it is taken off hold. The project has this status until it is approved or rejected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) form by an assigned employee. If approved, the project gets the ''Active'' status. If rejected, the project gets the ''In Planning'' status. For more information on approvals, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__con_Project_Approval|Approval of Projects and Project-Related Activities].
==Active Stage==
Active projects become available for selection on the forms of the modules you have selected for integration with the Projects module. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__con_Integration_With_Other_Modules|Integration with Other Modules]. When users create transactions in the integrated modules, they can link the transactions with a specific project task by specifying the project and task. Also, they can specify whether the transaction is billable for the project task. If users do not want to link a transaction with any project, they can specify the non-project code. {br}

Budget changes often occur during the course of the project. In Acumatica ERP, you cannot change the initial budget, although you can enter the revised figures for the project budget. The revised budget appears in a separate column. 
==Completion of Project==
A project life cycle ends when the project is either completed or closed. The project is considered completed when all its tasks are completed; this is the normal end of a project life. You complete the project by assigning it the ''Completed'' status. {br}

A project may end prematurely when the customer stops using the services your company provides. In that case, you can close the project before completing all its tasks. You complete the project by assigning it the ''Closed'' status.

Before you make any                 project active or submit it for approval, you must thoroughly plan it and specify                 all the key properties.  You can create a project either from scratch or from a template. Creating a project                 from scratch requires you to specify all the details. If you use a template, your                 new project will be populated with the template settings, and you need to enter only                 information that differs from (or is more specific than) the information in the                 template.

We recommend that you select only those modules that you                     will use to post documents related to your project. Tasks : You can define the tasks for the project. A task in a project is a                     separate work unit with its own life cycle, budget, cost, and revenue. Employees : You specify the employees to be engaged in the project.

)))
==Approval of Projects==
To make approval required for projects, in the '''Approval Map''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form, you must specify the approval map to be used to assign projects to employees for approval. If no value is specified in the box, approval is not required. You can create an approval map by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_55_00|Assignment and Approval Maps] ([~/?ScreenId=EP205500|EP205500]) form; in the map, you can specify conditions for assigning projects to specific workgroups and particular employees for approval. {br}

If approval of projects is configured, once a user takes a project off hold, the system assigns the project the ''Pending Approval'' status and uses the rules defined by the approval map to assign the project to a workgroup or to a particular employee (in the workgroup) for approval. If no assignment occurs, the project gets the ''Active'' status. {br}

Once the project is assigned to a workgroup, any member of the workgroup can view the project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) form and approve or reject it. If the project is rejected, it gets the ''In Planning'' status. {br}

An approved project gets the ''Active'' status and becomes visible when users record project-related transactions in the modules that are integrated with the Projects module.
==Approval of Time Activities==
To control completion of projects, you can assign a ''project manager'' to each project by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. If the same project manager will be assigned to most projects that are based on the same template, you can assign the project manager to the template on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_00|Project Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) form. The project manager is authorized to approve any time activities related to the project by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_70_10|Approve Time Activities] ([~/?ScreenId=EP507010|EP507010]) form.{br}

Once a project has been activated and approved, users can use project tasks to account for the time they worked on the project. For each project task, you can assign an approver—an employee who is authorized to approve time activities filed by employees working on the project. For a common task (a typical task not associated with any particular project template) added to the project, you can assign an approver on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_30|Common Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208030|PM208030]) form. For project-specific tasks, you can assign an approver to each task by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form. {br}

An employee appointed to be the approver of specific tasks can view the time activities associated with these tasks on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_70_10|Approve Time Activities] ([~/?ScreenId=EP507010|EP507010]) form. On this form, the project manager can view all the activities associated with all tasks of the project. The approver or project manager can apply a filter to the list of activities to find specific activities and to then approve or reject all of the listed activities.

Approval of Time Activities To control completion of projects, you can assign a  project manager  to each project by     using the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. If the same project manager will     be assigned to most projects that are based on the same template, you can assign the project     manager to the template on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) Project Templates (PM208000) form. The project     manager is authorized to approve any time activities related to the project by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP507010|EP507010]) Approve Time Activities (EP507000) form. Once a project has been activated and approved, users can use project tasks to account for the     time they worked on the project. For each project task, you can assign an approver—an     employee who is authorized to approve time activities filed by employees working on the project.     For a common task (a typical task not associated with any particular project template) added to     the project, you can assign an approver on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM208030|PM208030]) Common Tasks (PM208030)     form. For project-specific tasks, you can assign an approver to each task by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) Project Tasks (PM302000) form.  An employee appointed to be the approver of specific tasks can view the time activities     associated with these tasks on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP507010|EP507010]) Approve Time Activities (EP507000) form. On this     form, the project manager can view all the activities associated with all tasks of the project.     The approver or project manager can apply a filter to the list of activities to find specific     activities and to then approve or reject all of the listed activities.  ([~/?ScreenId=EP205500|EP205500])  ([~/?ScreenId=EP404300|EP404300])  ([~/?ScreenId=EP507010|EP507010])  ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000])  ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) ]]></column>

A project task (or simply ''task'') is the smallest identifiable piece of work that is a part of the project. Some tasks may require more than one financial period to complete and may be billed on task completion or even on completion of the entire project. Often, the allocation rules for projects are rather straightforward and use the percentage-of-completion scheme to evaluate the revenue earned during a specific financial period. {br}

This topic describes the methods that can be used to evaluate or calculate the percentage of task completion.
==Methods of Calculation of Task Completion Percentage==
For each task in the project, you can select which method will be used to evaluate the completion percentage of the task, which is shown in the '''Completed (%)''' column on the '''Tasks''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. You select the method in the '''Completion Calculation Method''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form. You can select one of the following options:[anchor|#ul_hbz_rqj_cr]
*''Manual'': You can use this method if it is not possible to select one cost line in which the actual amount or quantity would reflect the overall task progress. This may be the case if different cost lines are expressed as quantities measured in different UOMs, or some of the lines have budgets expressed as amounts with other line budgets expressed as quantities. With this method, you evaluate the task progress by using all the available information and manually specify the task completion percentage in the '''Completed (%)''' box. You can change the value as often as needed and we recommend that you update it before you perform an allocation for the project.
*''Budgeted Quantity'': With this method, the system calculates the task completion percentage for all cost budget lines associated with the task for which the '''Auto Completed (%)''' check box is selected on the '''Cost Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. The system calculates the percentage based on the quantities in the '''Actual Quantity''' and '''Revised Quantity''' columns on the '''Cost Budget''' tab by using the following formula: {{Completed (%) = Actual Quantity / Revised Quantity}}.
*:((({S:Warn}If the '''Auto Completed (%)''' check box is selected for more than one cost budget line associated with the task with this completion method, the result of the '''Completed (%)''' calculation can be unpredictable due to different UOMs of the cost budget lines. We strongly recommended that you use this method only if the task has a cost budget line whose actual quantity reflects the task&rsquo;s overall progress, so that you can select the '''Auto Completed (%)''' check box for only this cost budget line.
)))
*:For example, suppose that a task has a budget for 100 hours of consulting (with a cost of $100 per hour) for a customer company and a budget for 25 round trips (with a cost of $10 per hour) to the customer location. If you select the consulting cost for tracking the task completion, with 40 hours of consulting completed, the percentage of the task completion is calculated as 40%. Splitting or merging consulting sessions may change the number of required round trips; however, the task progress should be measured by the actual hours of consulting performed.
*''Budgeted Amount'': You can use this method for a task if all cost lines have budgeted amounts. With this method selected, the system calculates the task completion percentage for all the cost budget lines associated with the task for which the '''Auto Completed (%)''' check box is selected on the '''Cost Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. The system calculates the percentage based on the amounts in the '''Actual Amount''' and '''Revised Amount''' columns on the '''Cost Budget''' tab by using the following formula: {{Completed (%) = Actual Amount / Revised Amount}}.

==Evaluation of Project Completion Percentage==
With Acumatica ERP, you cannot directly track the completion percentage for the entire project although you can track completion for each of the project tasks. If needed, you can create a separate task (for instance, a task named ''Progress'') and use it exclusively to manually specify the project completion percentage that you evaluate by using all the information available about the progress of project tasks and project-related transactions.

A cost code represents an additional classification level for project revenues and costs, as a subaccount does in the General Ledger module. You can associate cost codes with different documents and document lines across the system where projects can be referenced, such as General Ledger transactions, Accounts Payable bills, purchase orders, Accounts Receivable invoices, expense entries, time cards, and lines of project budgets.{br}

The functionality of cost codes is available only if the ''Cost Codes'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. This feature can be used only with the Construction Edition.
==Cost Code Identifier==
The identifiers of cost codes have a segmented structure, which can be configured on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form for the ''COSTCODE'' segmented key. By default, ''COSTCODE'' is a one-segment key that consists of four numeric symbols. For details on changing the structure of a segmented key, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Identifier_Segmentation|Segmented Identifiers].{br}

You can change the value of a cost code identifier by selecting the cost code on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_95_00|Cost Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209500|PM209500]) form and clicking '''Change ID''' on the form toolbar.
==System Cost Code==
Starting 2020 R1 the system cost code is present by default, even if the ''Cost Codes'' feature is not enabled. The system cost code has the '''Default''' check box selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_95_00|Cost Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209500|PM209500]) form. The system does this to preserve data consistency, because the system cost code is one of the components of the compound key in the <tt>PMBudget</tt> table in the database. When the ''Cost Codes'' feature is enabled and the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_95_00|Cost Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209500|PM209500]) form becomes available, a user can change this cost code and its description but cannot delete it.
==Cost Code Lookup Table==
When you create a document or a document line that you want to associate with a cost code, you first specify a GL account, a project, and a project task for the record. When you click the selector button for a '''Cost Code''' element to assign a cost code to this document or document line, the system opens a lookup table that has the following tabs:[anchor|#_8048b50d-e49b-4f3f-8ad4-6e92b49ff5ee]
*'''All Records''': The tab lists all the cost codes defined in the system.
*'''Project Codes''': The tab, which is opened by default, lists the cost codes that are filtered as follows: The system looks for the cost codes used in budget lines of the project selected for the document or document line, and it then looks for the budget lines that have the same project task and the account group, which corresponds to the GL account selected for the document or document line. The cost code description that is displayed in the '''Project Codes''' filter tab of the lookup table is retrieved from the found project budget line. The list is empty if there are no cost codes already used for the combination of project, project task, and GL account specified for the document or document line. In this case, switch to the '''All Records''' tab, and select the needed cost code.
((({S:Warn}If you select a cost code that has not yet been used for the combination of project, project task, and account, the system will warn you about this.
)))
==Project Budget with Cost Codes==
You can define the revenue budget of a project at the task and cost code detail level by selecting for a project the ''Task and Cost Code'' option in the '''Revenue Budget Level''' box on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. {br}

You can define the revenue budget of a project at the task, item, and cost code detail level by selecting for a project the ''Task, Item, and Cost Code'' option in the '''Revenue Budget Level''' box on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. {br}

When one of these options is selected, you can view revenue budget lines by cost codes on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form for the project. You can change a cost code for each line manually, if needed.{br}

Similarly, you can view and change cost codes for each cost budget line on the '''Cost Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form for the project.
==Project Billing by Cost Codes==
Progress billing by cost code is available for projects with the ''Task and Cost Code'' or ''Task, Item, and Cost Code'' revenue budget level specified on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. Time and material billing by cost code is available for projects with the ''Task and Cost Code'' or ''Task, Item, and Cost Code'' cost budget level specified on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. Both types of billing (progress and time and material) work similarly to billing by task or by task and inventory item. For details, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__con_Billing_Procedure|Project Billing].

 Acumatica ERP provides change order functionality, which you can use to control changes to project&rsquo;s budgeted and committed values and control the profitability of every change initiated by a customer. A change order is a document for profitability analysis and an audit trial of changes to the project revenue budget, commitments, and budgeted costs. Change orders do not alter the original figures of a project directly; they are tracked separately from the original figures for analysis.{br}

Change orders provide the following functionality:[anchor|#_7c070315-7a83-4386-87e0-699526baa0d0]
*The ability to record changes to the project revenue budget, cost budgets, and commitments.
*The ability to review the list of change orders related to a project on the '''Change Orders''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form.
*The ability to see on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_60_00|Commitments] ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) form the changes for each purchase order as well as the original and committed values.
*The ability to see on the '''Change Orders''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form the list of change orders that affect the purchase order.
*The ability to see the profitability of every change of the project budget initiated by the customer.

The functionality of change orders is available only if the ''Change Orders'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}{TOC}[anchor|#section_i3l_d4p_mcb]
==Projects with the Change Order Workflow==
To enable the change order workflow for a project, which enables the creation of change orders, you should select the '''Change Order Workflow''' check box on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form and save changes to the project.{br}

During the initial stage of a project, after the project budget has been agreed upon, you can lock the original figures from further editing by using the '''Lock Budget''' action on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. After the original values are locked, you can update the revised budget figures in the following ways:[anchor|#_0f87a112-f7d5-449b-bb02-9ddc7c69efaa]
*If the project does not use the change order workflow, the revised budget figures can be edited manually on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form.
*:The following columns of the project with the locked budget are read-only on the '''Revenue Budget''' and '''Cost Budget''' tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form: '''Original Budgeted Quantity''', '''Unit Rate''', and '''Original Budgeted Amount'''.
*With the change order workflow enabled for the project, the revised budget figures become read-only, and all changes to the project budget can be made only with change orders. The system updates the revised budget figures based on change orders as follows: '''Revised Budgeted Amount''' = '''Original Budgeted Amount''' + The amount of the released change orders.
*:The following columns of the project with the locked budget are read-only on the '''Revenue Budget''' and '''Cost Budget''' tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form: '''Original Budgeted Quantity''', '''Unit Rate''', '''Original Budgeted Amount''', '''Revised Budgeted Quantity''', and '''Revised Budgeted Amount'''.

The '''Lock Budget''' action on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form applies to both the '''Revenue Budget''' and '''Cost Budget''' tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. The '''Unlock Budget''' action makes the original budget figures available for editing even if the change order workflow has been enabled for the project.[anchor|#section_pbd_zbq_mcb]
==Change Order Creation==
A new change order can be created either directly on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) form or on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, if you click '''Create Change Order''' on the form toolbar or click '''Create Change Order''' on the table toolbar of the '''Change Orders''' tab.{br}

The '''Change Date''' of the change order must belong to an existing financial period of the master calendar.{br}

In a change order with the ''On Hold'' status, you can enter the necessary amendments to the project budget and commitments. On the '''Revenue Budget''' and '''Cost Budget''' tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] form, when you edit a change order line, you can see the original budgeted amount in the '''Original Budgeted Amount''' column; the released and draft change order amounts in the '''Previously Approved CO Amount''' and '''Other Draft CO Amount''' columns, respectively; and the revised budgeted amount in the '''Revised Budgeted Amount''' column. You can do any of the following on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] form:[anchor|#_1ed4c058-fc8b-4546-8970-953569aa8338]
*On the '''Revenue Budget''' and '''Cost Budget''' tabs:
**Create a new budget line with a positive amount
**Create a new budget line with a negative amount
**Make an addition to an existing budget line
**Make a deduction from an existing budget line
**:((({S:Warn}You can add an existing budget line to be modified to the change order in the '''Select Budget Lines''' dialog box if you click '''Select Budget Lines''' on the table toolbar.
)))
*On the '''Commitments''' tab:
**Create a new purchase order with a new line
**Add a new line to an existing purchase order
**Make an addition to an existing purchase order line
**Make a deduction from an existing purchase order line
**:((({S:Warn}[anchor|#ul_ums_3vl_zcb]
*You can add an existing commitment to be modified to the change order in the '''Select Commitments''' dialog box if you click '''Select Commitments''' on the table toolbar.
*The deduction from the amount and quantity of a purchase order line can be no greater than the '''Received Qty.''' and '''Received Amount''' of the line.
)))

A change order document has the following reference numbers in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] form:[anchor|#_7ad7e8ee-88e8-4a5e-b504-c6b7d3069bfe]
*'''Reference Nbr.''': The number of the change order in the system. This number is assigned to each change order based on the ''CHANGEORD'' numbering sequence, which is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form and can be reviewed or modified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_10_10|Numbering Sequences] ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) form.
*'''Revenue Change Nbr.''': The number of the change order that can affect the revenue within the applicable project. Each project has its own numbering sequence of such change orders. The '''Revenue Change Nbr.''' is an integer that the system assigns sequentially: 0001 for the first change order for the project, 0002 for the second, 0003 for the third, and so on. The last assigned number for the project is shown in the '''Last Revenue Change Nbr.''' box in the '''Project Properties''' area of the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form.
*:You can manually change the '''Revenue Change Nbr.''' of a particular change order. (Duplicate numbers within a project are not allowed, however.) If you change the '''Revenue Change Nbr.''' of a change order, you should make a similar change to the '''Last Revenue Change Nbr.''' of the corresponding project so that the system continues to assign these numbers correctly.
*:((({S:Hint}You should follow these recommendations while manually assigning revenue change numbers:[anchor|#_fd2c5c78-7f55-4bf5-9c71-5e534a97e416]
*You should use a four-digit number as a revenue change number, such as '' 0001''.
*If you need to use mixed characters for a revenue change number—that is, letters, symbols, and numerals, add a four-digit number to the character string, resulting in a revenue change number such as ''CO#0001''.
*If a project has revenue change orders and the numeric part of the last assigned revenue change number for the project consists of a one- or two-digit number, add enough zeros before the numeric part of the last change number so that the numeric part of the number is at least four digits. For example, if the '''Last Revenue Change Nbr.''' in the '''Project Properties''' area of the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form is ''CO#9'', change it to ''CO#0009''.
)))
*:For the change orders that cannot affect the project revenue and the ''Reversing'' change orders, the '''Revenue Change Nbr.''' box is read-only and contains ''N/A''.
*:For the ''Reversed'' change orders, you can reuse the '''Revenue Change Nbr.'''—that is, assign the '''Revenue Change Nbr.''' of a ''Reversed'' change order to a new change order. This will not lead to an error of duplicated numbers because the ''Reversed'' change order does not affect the project revenue anymore. If you reuse the '''Revenue Change Nbr.''' of a ''Reversed'' change order, you should respectively change the '''Last Revenue Change Nbr.''' of the corresponding project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form so that the system continues to assign these numbers correctly.
*'''External Reference Nbr.''': The external reference number. This number, which is entered manually, can be the identifier required by the customer or the number from an external system integrated with Acumatica ERP.

A change order can also have a detailed description, which you can enter on the '''Detailed Description''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] form.[anchor|#section_xv2_f1w_mcb]
==Change Order Approval==
The change order supports the standard Acumatica ERP approval process.{br}

The approval map can be configured on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_55_00|Assignment and Approval Maps] ([~/?ScreenId=EP205500|EP205500]) form and then specified in the '''Change Order Approval Map''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form along with the default pending change order approval notification in the '''Pending Change Order Approval Notification''' box on the same form.{br}

The approval process is optional; the configuration of the approval process can be skipped and you can create an approved change order right away.[anchor|#section_vgz_15w_mcb]
==Change Order Printing==
You can print a change order with any status. For the printing of change orders, the system uses the form that is specified on the '''Mailing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form. By default, this is the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\PM_64_30_00|Change Order] ([~/?ScreenId=PM643000|PM643000]) report. This report supports the printing of revenue budget lines, header-level and line-level notes, and the detailed description of a change order.{br}

You can override the default printed form by defining a project-specific report on the '''Mailing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. For a project, you can specify the custom print form and email notification template that should be used for printing and emailing of change orders prepared for the project. On the '''Billing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, you can also specify the contact information of the customer to whom change orders prepared for the project should be sent.[anchor|#section_py4_wtw_mcb]
==Change Order Release==
When a change order is released, the balances and commitments of the corresponding project are updated as follows:[anchor|#_025830d7-ba7d-4735-9884-1ddf203522b7]
*If the project has a revenue budget line with the same project task, cost code or inventory item, and account group as a revenue budget line of the change order, the system updates the following columns of the revenue budget line of the project on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form:
**'''Budgeted CO Quantity''' = The total quantity of released change orders
**'''Budgeted CO Amount''' = The total amount of released change orders
**'''Revised Budgeted Quantity''' = '''Original Budgeted Quantity''' + '''Budgeted CO Quantity'''
** '''Revised Budgeted Amount''' = '''Original Budgeted Amount''' + '''Budgeted CO Amount'''
** '''Pending Invoice Amount''' = '''Revised Budgeted Amount''' &#42; '''Completed (%)''' / 100 – '''Actual Amount''' – '''Draft Invoices Amount'''
**:((({S:Warn}As the result of the update, this amount can take rational values, including negative ones.
)))
*If the project does not have a revenue budget line with the same project task, cost code or inventory item, and account group as a revenue budget line of the change order, the system creates a new revenue budget line for the project based on the revenue budget line of the change order.
*If the project has a cost budget line with the same project task, cost code or inventory item, and account group as a cost budget line of the change order, the system updates the following columns of the cost budget line of the project on the '''Cost Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form:
**'''Budgeted CO Quantity''' = The total quantity of released change orders
**'''Budgeted CO Amount''' = The total amount of released change orders
**'''Revised Budgeted Quantity''' = '''Original Budgeted Quantity''' + '''Budgeted CO Quantity'''
** '''Revised Budgeted Amount''' = '''Original Budgeted Amount''' + '''Budgeted CO Amount'''
*If the project does not have a cost budget line with the same project task, cost code or inventory item, and account group as a cost budget line of the change order, the system creates a new cost budget line for the project based on the cost budget line of the change order.
*If a commitment line of the change order has the ''Update'' or ''Reopen'' status, the system updates the following values of the corresponding purchase order line on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form based on the commitment line of the change order:
**'''Order Qty.''' = Original '''Order Qty.''' of the purchase order line + '''Quantity''' of the commitment line of the change order
**'''Ext. Cost''' = Original '''Ext. Cost''' of the purchase order line + '''Amount''' of the commitment line of the change order
**'''Requested''' = '''Order Date''' of the commitment line of the change order
**'''Completed''', '''Canceled''', and '''Closed''' check boxes are cleared
*If a commitment line of the change order has the ''New Line'' status, the system adds a new line with the following values to the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form for the corresponding purchase order based on the commitment line of the change order:
**'''Order Qty.''' = '''Quantity''' of the commitment line of the change order
**'''Ext. Cost''' = '''Amount''' of the commitment line of the change order
**'''Requested''' = '''Order Date''' of the commitment line of the change order
*If any commitment lines of the change order have the ''New Document'' status, the system groups these lines by vendor and creates a new purchase order on [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form for each vendor based on the commitment lines of the change order as follows:
**The date of the created purchase order is the earliest '''Order Date''' of the commitment lines of the change order.
**The '''Requested''' of each purchase order line is the '''Order Date''' of the commitment line of the change order.
**The system generates the default description of the created purchase order by using the following formula: {{'''Description''' = 'Change Order #' + [PMChangeOrder.RefNbr]}}.
*:((({S:Warn}A purchase order that originates from a change order cannot be edited or removed and can be only canceled, completed, or altered by yet another change order.
)))
*For each purchase order line updated by a change order, the system updates the corresponding project commitment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_60_00|Commitments] ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) form. For each purchase order line created from a change order, the system creates a new project commitment. In these commitments, the values are updated as follows:
**'''Revised Committed Quantity''' = '''Order Qty.''' of the purchase order line
**'''Revised Committed Amount''' = '''Ext. Cost''' of the purchase order line
**'''Committed CO Quantity''' = '''Revised Committed Quantity''' – '''Original Committed Quantity'''
** '''Committed CO Amount''' = '''Revised Committed Amount''' – '''Original Committed Amount'''
** '''Committed Open Amount''' = '''Open Amount''' of the purchase order line
*:If the project has a cost budget line with the same project task, cost code or inventory item, and account group as an updated or newly created commitment, the system updates the cost budget line of the project on the '''Cost Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. Otherwise, the system creates a new cost budget line for the project based on the commitment.
[anchor|#section_zlm_f3x_mcb]
==Change Order Reversal==
After a change order has been released, it can no longer be changed and can only be reversed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) form if you click '''Reverse''' action on the form toolbar. When the change order is reversed, the system creates a new change order with lines that reverse the impact of the original change order. In this reversing change order, the quantity and amount of a commitment line cannot be greater than the '''Received Qty.''' and '''Received Amount''' of the corresponding purchase order line on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. A commitment line of this reversing change order also cannot reduce the '''Order Qty.''' of a purchase order line to zero. You may cancel the purchase order line in this case.[anchor|#section_qkr_hkx_mcb]
==Change Order Classes==
Change order classes, which you can create on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_30_00|Change Order Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM203000|PM203000]) form, make it possible to group change orders by their impact on projects and by additional attributes that classes can have. You can also segregate changes by class in reports to analyze, for example, which types of changes have the greatest impact on project profitability. For instance, by using a change order class, you can create an internal change order that does not affect the revenue budget of projects and is not assigned any reference number within a project. This class of change orders will not have the '''Revenue Budget''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) form.{br}

Change order classes also support the use of global attributes defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_50_00|Attributes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) form. A list of attributes can be specified for a change order class to be available in each change order belonging to the class.{br}

You can specify a default change order class in the '''Default Change Order Class''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form. The default change order class is then assigned to each newly created document on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] form.[anchor|#section_pg4_ylx_mcb]
==Purchase Order Workflow with Change Orders==
Change orders can be created for the ''Normal'' type of purchase orders. The change order workflow affects the standard purchase order life cycle as follows:[anchor|#_83759acb-5a92-49e2-8d05-f1e2502876e2]
*If a normal purchase order has at least one line refers to a project with the change order workflow enabled and the purchase order has no related change orders, the purchase order can be modified directly on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. At the same time, you can create a change order for such purchase order, if needed.
*The change order workflow is automatically enabled for a normal purchase order with at least one line refers to a project with the change order workflow enabled if at least one change order has been created for the purchase order.
*After the change order workflow has been enabled for a purchase order, the purchase order cannot be removed or put on hold.
*After an existing purchase order with the ''Open'' status has been changed by means of a change order and printing or emailing is required for the purchase order, the system assigns to the purchase order the ''Pending Printing'' or ''Pending Email'' status, respectively.
*A purchase order with the ''Pending Printing'' or ''Pending Email'' status cannot be removed from the system if there is a change order that refers to this purchase order.
*A purchase order with the ''Open'' status and with the change order workflow enabled can be modified by means of change orders only.
*A purchase order with the ''Open'' status and with the change order workflow enabled or an open line of this purchase order can be canceled or completed.
*A purchase order with the ''Completed'', ''Closed'', or ''Canceled'' status can be reopened by means of change orders. Such an order will be assigned the ''Open'', ''Pending Printing'', or ''Pending Email'' status depending on the purchase order workflow.
*A purchase order that originates from a change order cannot be edited or removed and can be only printed, emailed, canceled, completed, or altered by yet another change order.

==Ability to Control the Original Committed Values==
At the initial stage of a project, after the original commitments have been agreed on with vendors and entered into the system, you can lock the commitments for the project, after which all further amendments to the committed figures should be tracked as project changes by change orders. The following commands in the '''Actions''' menu become available on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form when the ''Change Orders'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form and the '''Internal Cost Commitment Tracking''' check boxes is selected on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form:{br}

This action appears on the form if .[anchor|#_2d5a13bf-1ecd-4ecd-9d12-881f5090d75b]
*'''Lock Commitments''': When this action is applied for a project, purchase orders for this project cannot be created directly on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, existing purchase orders cannot be put on hold, and the commitments of the project can be modified by means of change orders only.
*'''Unlock Commitments''': This action gives users the ability to directly enter purchase orders for the project.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Change Management  Acumatica ERP provides change order functionality, which you can use to control changes to project's         budgeted and committed values and control the profitability of every change initiated by a         customer. A change order is a document for profitability analysis and an audit trial of         changes to the project revenue budget, commitments, and budgeted costs. Change orders do not         alter the original figures of a project directly; they are tracked separately from the         original figures for analysis. Change orders provide the following functionality: The ability to record changes to the project revenue budget, cost budgets, and           commitments. The ability to review the list of change orders related to a project on the              Change Orders  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects           (PM301000) form. The ability to see on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) Commitments (PM306000) form the changes           for each purchase order as well as the original and committed values. The ability to see on the  Change Orders  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form the list of change orders that affect the           purchase order. The ability to see the profitability of every change of the project budget initiated by           the customer. The functionality of change orders is available only if the  Change Orders  feature is         enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. Projects with the Change Order Workflow To enable the change order workflow for a project, which enables the creation of change         orders, you should select the  Change Order Workflow  check box on the            Summary  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form         and save changes to the project. If the  Internal Cost Commitment Tracking  check boxes is selected on         the  General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences         (PM101000) form, and a project has related purchase orders, you can enable the change order         workflow for the project if there are no open related purchase order lines. That is, the         status of related purchase order lines of the project is only  Completed ,            Closed , or  Canceled . Project Budget Freeze During the initial stage of a project, after the project budget has been agreed upon, you can         lock the original figures from further editing by using the  Lock           Budget  action on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. After         the original values are locked, you can update the revised budget figures in the following         ways: If the project does not use the change order workflow, the revised budget figures can be           edited manually on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form. The following columns of             the project with the locked budget are read-only on the  Revenue               Budget  and  Cost Budget  tabs of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form:  Original Budgeted Quantity ,                Unit Rate , and  Original Budgeted             Amount . With the change order workflow enabled for the project, the revised budget figures become           read-only, and all changes to the project budget can be made only with change orders. The           system updates the revised budget figures based on change orders as follows:              Revised Budgeted Amount  =  Original Budgeted             Amount  + The amount of the released change orders. The following columns             of the project with the locked budget are read-only on the  Revenue               Budget  and  Cost Budget  tabs of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form:  Original Budgeted Quantity ,                Unit Rate ,  Original Budgeted Amount ,                Revised Budgeted Quantity , and  Revised Budgeted               Amount . The  Lock Budget  action on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form     applies to both the  Revenue Budget  and  Cost Budget      tabs of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form. The  Unlock Budget      action makes the original budget figures available for editing even if the change order workflow     has been enabled for the project. Change Order Creation A new change order can be created either directly on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) Change Orders         (PM308000) form or on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, if you click            Create Change Order  on the form toolbar or click  Create           Change Order  on the table toolbar of the  Change Orders          tab. The  Change Date  of the change order must belong to an existing         financial period of the master calendar. In a change order with the  On Hold  status, you can enter the necessary amendments to         the project budget and commitments. On the  Revenue Budget  and            Cost Budget  tabs of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) Change Orders form, when         you edit a change order line, you can see the original budgeted amount in the            Original Budgeted Amount  column; the released and draft change         order amounts in the  Previously Approved CO Amount  and            Other Draft CO Amount  columns, respectively; and the revised         budgeted amount in the  Revised Budgeted Amount  column. You can do any         of the following on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) Change Orders form: On the  Revenue Budget  and  Cost Budget  tabs: Create a new budget line with a positive amount Create a new budget line with a negative amount Make an addition to an existing budget line Make a deduction from an existing budget line You can add an existing budget                 line to be modified to the change order in the  Select Budget                   Lines  dialog box if you click  Select Budget                   Lines  on the table toolbar. On the  Commitments  tab: Create a new purchase order with a new line Add a new line to an existing purchase order Make an addition to an existing purchase order line Make a deduction from an existing purchase order line You can add an existing commitment to be modified to the change order in the                        Select Commitments  dialog box if you click                        Select Commitments  on the table toolbar. The deduction from the amount and quantity of a purchase order line can be no                     greater than the  Received Qty.  and  Received                       Amount  of the line. A change order document has the following reference numbers in the Summary area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) Change Orders form: Reference Nbr. : The number of the change order in the system. This           number is assigned to each change order based on the  CHANGEORD  numbering sequence,           which is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form and can be           reviewed or modified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) Numbering Sequences (CS201010) form. Revenue Change Nbr. : The number of the change order that can             affect the revenue within the applicable project. Each project has its own numbering             sequence of such change orders. The  Revenue Change Nbr.  is an             integer that the system assigns sequentially: 0001 for the first change order for the             project, 0002 for the second, 0003 for the third, and so on. The last assigned number             for the project is shown in the  Last Revenue Change Nbr.  box in             the  Project Properties  area of the  Summary              tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form. You can manually change the  Revenue Change Nbr.  of a particular             change order. (Duplicate numbers within a project are not allowed, however.) If you             change the  Revenue Change Nbr.  of a change order, you should make             a similar change to the  Last Revenue Change Nbr.  of the             corresponding project so that the system continues to assign these numbers             correctly. You should follow these recommendations while manually assigning revenue change               numbers: You should use a four-digit number as a revenue change number, such as                     0001 . If you need to use mixed characters for a revenue change number—that is, letters,                 symbols, and numerals, add a four-digit number to the character string, resulting in                 a revenue change number such as  CO#0001 . If a project has revenue change orders and the numeric part of the last assigned                 revenue change number for the project consists of a one- or two-digit number, add                 enough zeros before the numeric part of the last change number so that the numeric                 part of the number is at least four digits. For example, if the  Last                   Revenue Change Nbr.  in the  Project Properties                  area of the  Summary  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form is  CO#9 , change it to  CO#0009 . For the change orders that cannot affect the project revenue and the  Reversing              change orders, the  Revenue Change Nbr.  box is read-only and             contains  N/A . For the  Reversed  change orders, you can reuse the  Revenue Change               Nbr. —that is, assign the  Revenue Change Nbr.  of a                Reversed  change order to a new change order. This will not lead to an error of             duplicated numbers because the  Reversed  change order does not affect the project             revenue anymore. If you reuse the  Revenue Change Nbr.  of a                Reversed  change order, you should respectively change the  Last               Revenue Change Nbr.  of the corresponding project on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form so that the system continues to assign these numbers             correctly. External Reference Nbr. : The external reference number. This number,           which is entered manually, can be the identifier required by the customer or the number           from an external system integrated with  Acumatica ERP. A change order can also have a detailed description, which you can enter on the            Detailed Description  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) Change Orders         form. Change Order Approval The change order supports the standard  Acumatica ERP approval process. The approval map can be configured on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP205500|EP205500]) Assignment and Approval Maps (EP205500) form         and then specified in the  Change Order Approval Map  box on the            General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences         (PM101000) form along with the default pending change order approval notification in the            Pending Change Order Approval Notification  box on the same         form. The approval process is optional; the configuration of the approval process can be skipped and         you can create an approved change order right away. Change Order Printing You can print a change order with any status. For the printing of change orders, the system         uses the form that is specified on the  Mailing Settings  tab of the             ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form. By default, this is the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM643000|PM643000]) Change Order (PM643000) report. This report supports the printing of         revenue budget lines, header-level and line-level notes, and the detailed description of a         change order. You can override the default printed form by defining a project-specific report on the            Mailing Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects         (PM301000) form. For a project, you can specify the custom print form and email         notification template that should be used for printing and emailing of change orders         prepared for the project. On the  Billing Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, you can also specify the contact information of the         customer to whom change orders prepared for the project should be sent. Change Order Release When a change order is released, the balances and commitments of the corresponding project are     updated as follows: If the project has a revenue budget line with the same project task, cost code or inventory           item, and account group as a revenue budget line of the change order, the system updates           the following columns of the revenue budget line of the project on the  Revenue             Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form: Budgeted CO Quantity  = The total quantity of released change               orders Budgeted CO Amount  = The total amount of released change               orders Revised Budgeted Quantity  =  Original Budgeted                 Quantity  +  Budgeted CO Quantity Revised Budgeted Amount  =  Original Budgeted                 Amount  +  Budgeted CO Amount Pending Invoice Amount  =   Revised Budgeted                 Amount  *  Completed (%)  / 100 –                  Actual Amount  –  Draft Invoices                 Amount As the result of the update, this amount can take rational                 values, including negative ones. If the project does not have a revenue budget line with the same project task, cost code or      inventory item, and account group as a revenue budget line of the change order, the system      creates a new revenue budget line for the project based on the revenue budget line of the      change order. If the project has a cost budget line with the same project task, cost code or inventory           item, and account group as a cost budget line of the change order, the system updates the           following columns of the cost budget line of the project on the  Cost             Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form: Budgeted CO Quantity  = The total quantity of released change               orders Budgeted CO Amount  = The total amount of released change               orders Revised Budgeted Quantity  =  Original Budgeted                 Quantity  +  Budgeted CO Quantity Revised Budgeted Amount  =  Original Budgeted                 Amount  +  Budgeted CO Amount If the project does not have a cost budget line with the same project task, cost code or      inventory item, and account group as a cost budget line of the change order, the system creates      a new cost budget line for the project based on the cost budget line of the change order. If a commitment line of the change order has the  Update  or  Reopen  status, the           system updates the following values of the corresponding purchase order line on the              Document Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders           (PO301000) form based on the commitment line of the change order: Order Qty.  = Original  Order Qty.  of               the purchase order line +  Quantity  of the commitment line of               the change order Ext. Cost  = Original  Ext. Cost  of the               purchase order line +  Amount  of the commitment line of the               change order Requested  =  Order Date  of the               commitment line of the change order Completed ,  Canceled , and                  Closed  check boxes are cleared If a commitment line of the change order has the  New Line  status, the system adds a           new line with the following values to the  Document Details  tab of           the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form for the corresponding purchase order based on the           commitment line of the change order: Order Qty.  =  Quantity  of the               commitment line of the change order Ext. Cost  =  Amount  of the commitment               line of the change order Requested  =  Order Date  of the               commitment line of the change order If any commitment lines of the change order have the  New Document  status, the system           groups these lines by vendor and creates a new purchase order on   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form for each vendor based on the commitment lines of the           change order as follows: The date of the created purchase order is the earliest  Order                 Date  of the commitment lines of the change order. The  Requested  of each purchase order line is the                  Order Date  of the commitment line of the change order. The system generates the default description of the created purchase order by using               the following formula:  Description  = 'Change Order #' +                 [PMChangeOrder.RefNbr] . A purchase order that originates from a change order cannot be edited or             removed and can be only canceled, completed, or altered by yet another change             order. For each purchase order line updated by a change order, the system updates the corresponding           project commitment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) Commitments (PM306000) form. For each           purchase order line created from a change order, the system creates a new project           commitment. In these commitments, the values are updated as follows: Revised Committed Quantity  =  Order                 Qty.  of the purchase order line Revised Committed Amount  =  Ext. Cost                of the purchase order line Committed CO Quantity  =  Revised Committed                 Quantity  –  Original Committed Quantity Committed CO Amount  =  Revised Committed                 Amount  –  Original Committed Amount Committed Open Amount  =  Open Amount  of               the purchase order line If the project has a cost budget line with the same project task, cost code or             inventory item, and account group as an updated or newly created commitment, the system             updates the cost budget line of the project on the  Cost Budget              tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form. Otherwise, the system creates a new             cost budget line for the project based on the commitment. Change Order Reversal After a change order has been released, it can no longer be changed and can only be         reversed on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) Change Orders (PM308000) form if you click            Reverse  action on the form toolbar. When the change order is         reversed, the system creates a new change order with lines that reverse the impact of the         original change order. In this reversing change order, the quantity and amount of a         commitment line cannot be greater than the  Received Qty.  and            Received Amount  of the corresponding purchase order line on the            Document Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders         (PO301000) form. A commitment line of this reversing change order also cannot reduce the            Order Qty.  of a purchase order line to zero. You may cancel the         purchase order line in this case. Change Order Classes Change order classes, which you can create on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM203000|PM203000]) Change Order Classes         (PM203000) form, make it possible to group change orders by their impact on projects and         by additional attributes that classes can have. You can also segregate changes by class in         reports to analyze, for example, which types of changes have the greatest impact on project         profitability. For instance, by using a change order class, you can create an internal         change order that does not affect the revenue budget of projects and is not assigned any         reference number within a project. This class of change orders will not have the            Revenue Budget  tab on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) Change Orders         (PM308000) form. Change order classes also support the use of global attributes defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) Attributes (CS205000) form. A list of attributes can be specified for a         change order class to be available in each change order belonging to the class. You can specify a default change order class in the  Default Change Order           Class  box on the  General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form. The default change order class is then         assigned to each newly created document on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) Change Orders form. Purchase Order Workflow with Change Orders Change orders can be created for the  Normal  type of purchase orders. The change order     workflow affects the standard purchase order life cycle as follows: If a normal purchase order has at least one line refers to a project with the change           order workflow enabled and the purchase order has no related change orders, the purchase           order can be modified directly on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form. At           the same time, you can create a change order for such purchase order, if needed. The change order workflow is automatically enabled for a normal purchase order with at           least one line refers to a project with the change order workflow enabled if at least one           change order has been created for the purchase order. After the change order workflow has been enabled for a purchase order, the purchase           order cannot be removed or put on hold. After an existing purchase order with the  Open  status has been changed by means           of a change order and printing or emailing is required for the purchase order, the system           assigns to the purchase order the  Pending Printing  or  Pending Email  status,           respectively. A purchase order with the  Pending Printing  or  Pending Email  status cannot           be removed from the system if there is a change order that refers to this purchase           order. A purchase order with the  Open  status and with the change order workflow enabled           can be modified by means of change orders only. A purchase order with the  Open  status and with the change order workflow enabled           or an open line of this purchase order can be canceled or completed. A purchase order with the  Completed ,  Closed , or  Canceled  status can           be reopened by means of change orders. Such an order will be assigned the  Open ,              Pending Printing , or  Pending Email  status depending on the purchase order           workflow. A purchase order that originates from a change order cannot be edited or removed and can           be only printed, emailed, canceled, completed, or altered by yet another change           order. Ability to Control the Original Committed Values At the initial stage of a project, after the original commitments have been agreed on with         vendors and entered into the system, you can lock the commitments for the project, after         which all further amendments to the committed figures should be tracked as project changes         by change orders. The following commands in the  Actions  menu become         available on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form when the  Change           Orders  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features form and the            Internal Cost Commitment Tracking  check boxes is selected on the            General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences         (PM101000) form: This action appears on the form if . Lock Commitments : When this action is applied for a project, purchase           orders for this project cannot be created directly on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders           (PO301000) form, existing purchase orders cannot be put on hold, and the commitments of           the project can be modified by means of change orders only. Unlock Commitments : This action gives users the ability to directly           enter purchase orders for the project. ]]></column>

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
 Acumatica ERP provides comprehensive change management capabilities for projects, which are used to analyze profitability and to track and control project changes. Acumatica ERP 2020 R1 introduces the ''Change Requests'' feature. Change requests are detailed breakdowns of potential changes to the project budget and commitments, such as additions, deletions, or edits to the existing cost or revenue budget. This feature gives organizations the ability to set up two-tier change management for change orders. In the first tier, you create change requests, and the second tier involves you grouping multiple change requests into a single change order to be approved.{br}

Markups can be set up and calculated for change requests. A markup can be applied to an individual line of a change request or to the total amount of the document.{br}{TOC}
==Enabling the Two-Tier Change Management==
To start using the functionality of change requests, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, an administrative user enables the ''Change Requests'' feature. The ''Change Requests'' feature can be enabled only if the ''Change Orders'' feature has been enabled.{br}

The two-tier change management is controlled at the level of a change order class. If the '''2-Tier Change Management''' check box is selected for a particular class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_30_00|Change Order Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM203000|PM203000]) form, change orders of the selected class support two-tier change management and can include change requests; also, on the '''Details''' tab, the '''Cost Budget''' and '''Commitments''' check boxes become automatically selected and unavailable for editing.
==Configuration of Change Requests==
On the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form, the following settings have been added so that the use of change requests can be configured:[anchor|#_5dc4d8eb-4049-45b5-a1e3-5f7902248ffd]
*'''Change Request Numbering Sequence''': The numbering sequence the system uses to assign reference numbers to change requests.
*'''Change Request Approval Map''': The approval map to be used to assign change requests to employees for approval. If no value is specified in this box, approval is not required.
*'''Pending Change Request Approval Notification''': The notification template that the system uses to generate notification emails for employees who approve change requests. An employee receives a notification about pending approval when a change request requires approval from this employee. 
*'''Markups''' section: The settings that define the default price markup and the default markups for projects. These markups (if specified) can be modified for each project. For details about markups, see [[#_c01617e4-f6d5-42d0-89bc-38f404fa6f33|Markups].

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_10_00|Account Groups] ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) form, the '''Settings''' tab has been added. This tab contains the following settings:[anchor|#_f4961f30-ec78-449d-874f-5e3c9cd29187]
*'''Creates Commitment''': A check box that indicates (if selected) that a change request line that has this cost account group specified will result in a commitment line on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) form once you link the change request with this line to a change order.
*'''Default Line Markup, %''': The default markup percentage to be specified as '''Line Markup (%)''' for a change request line that has this account group specified as the cost account group. For details about markups, see [[#_c01617e4-f6d5-42d0-89bc-38f404fa6f33|Markups].

==Change Requests==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_85_00|Change Requests] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308500|PM308500]) form, you can create a new change request or view, modify, or delete an existing change request.{br}

A change request can have one of the following statuses, which is displayed in the '''Status''' box in the Summary area of the form:[anchor|#_ec16c7fc-69f2-4e9e-9d49-11d8daaa3afb]
*''On Hold'': The change request is a draft. You can edit or delete the change request, but cannot link it to a change order.
*''Pending Approval'': The change request has been taken off hold (that is, the '''Hold''' check box was cleared for the change request). On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) form, a change request with this status is visible to the employee who has been assigned to approve the change request in accordance with the change request approval map specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form. This status is available only if the ''Approval Workflow'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form and a change request approval map has been defined and then specified in the '''Change Request Approval Map''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] form.
*''Rejected'': The system assigns this status to the change request if the employee who was assigned to approve the change request has rejected it. The change request can be saved with the ''On Hold'' status for further editing. This status is available only if the ''Approval Workflow'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form and a change request approval map has been defined and then specified in the '''Change Request Approval Map''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] form.
*''Open'': The system assigns this status to the change request if the employee who was assigned to approve the change order has approved it. If no approval map is defined for change requests, the system assigns this status to the change request immediately after you clear the '''Hold''' check box. You can link this change request to a change order or save it with the ''On Hold'' status for further editing.
*''Closed'': The system assigns this status to the change request whose cost and commitment part and revenue part have been linked to one or two change orders (depending on whether the cost and commitment part and the revenue part are processed jointly or separately—see [[#_d8af546e-35d4-41d7-9b7c-fb8a22dc5ba6|Relations Between Change Requests and Change Orders] for details).

The '''Estimation''' tab of that form lists potential changes that will affect the revenue budget, the cost budget, and the commitments of the selected project when the related change orders are released. Until the related change orders are released, these potential changes are also tracked for the project in the '''Potential CO Quantity''' and '''Potential CO Amount''' columns on the '''Revenue Budget''' and '''Cost Budget''' tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form.[anchor|#_c01617e4-f6d5-42d0-89bc-38f404fa6f33]
==Markups==
The following types of markup are supported for change requests:[anchor|#_e8adf6c2-50a9-4cc2-8b38-af2f6a00ff80]
*Line-level markups: This type of markup applies to an individual estimation line of a change request. This type includes the following markups:
**''Price Markup (%)'': The markup specified for the item. If the item has no defined markup, the system uses the '''Default Price Markup, %''' specified on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form. This markup can be changed for each change request line manually.
**''Line Markup (%)'': The markup specified for the cost account group. The default value can be manually overridden for each change request line.
*Document-level markups: This type of markup applies to the total amount of a change request. For a change request, default markups are inherited from the related project and can be manually overridden on the '''Markups''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_85_00|Change Requests] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308500|PM308500]) form. For the project, default markups are inherited from the '''Markup''' section of the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] form and can be manually overridden on the '''Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. The following markup types can be defined:
**''%'': A markup whose amount is calculated as follows:
**:Markup Amount = '''Line Total''' &#42; ''% Markup Value'' / ''100''.
**:There can be as many markups of this type as necessary, with the markup subtotal calculated as a sum of all markup amounts.
**''Cumulative %'': A markup whose amount is calculated as follows:
**:Markup Amount = (all the previously applied % markups) &#42; ''Cumulative % Value'' / ''100''.
**''Flat Fee'': A markup whose amount is specified manually to be added to the total markup.
*:A document-level markup is applied to a change request only if all the project budget key attributes—project task, account group, and optionally inventory item or cost code—are defined for the markup at the change request level. The visibility of the inventory item or cost code columns depends on the '''Revenue Budget Level''' of the project specified in the '''Project Properties''' section on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form.

A price markup is an item-specific markup. It can be specified on the '''Price/Cost Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form or on the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. The markup percent specified for the item is retrieved by default as '''Price Markup (%)''' when the item is selected for the corresponding line on the '''Estimation''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_85_00|Change Requests] form. If no markup is specified for the item, the system uses the default price markup specified in the '''Default Price Markup, %''' box ('''Markup''' section) on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] form (if specified). The calculation of amounts is performed as follows:[anchor|#_e046c124-92ec-4a1b-8785-e40104880271]
*'''Ext. Cost''' = '''Quantity''' &#42; '''Unit Cost'''
* '''Unit Price''' = '''Unit Cost''' + '''Unit Cost''' &#42; '''Price Markup (%)''' / ''100''
* '''Ext. Price''' = '''Quantity''' &#42; '''Unit Price'''

Line markup, which is a default markup that is specific to an account group, is specified on the '''Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_10_00|Account Groups] ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) form. The markup percent specified for the account group is retrieved by default as the '''Line Markup (%)''' when the cost account group is selected for the corresponding line on the '''Estimation''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_85_00|Change Requests] form. The calculation of the line amount is performed as follows:{br}

'''Line Amount''' = '''Ext. Price''' + '''Ext. Price''' &#42; '''Line Markup (%)''' / ''100''{br}

Default markup values are specified in the '''Markup''' section of the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] form. The values are copied into each new project and can be overridden. When a new change request is created for a project, it inherits the project-specific markup values, which can be also overridden.
==Adding a Change Request to a Change Order==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_85_00|Change Requests] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308500|PM308500]) form, you can create a change order for the selected change request by clicking the '''Create Change Order''' button on the form toolbar. To be able to do that, a change order class that supports two-tier change management must be selected as the '''Default Change Order Class''' in the '''General Settings''' section on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) form, you can also add change requests to the selected change order. To do that, on the table toolbar of the '''Change Requests''' tab, you click the '''Select Change Requests''' button to open the '''Select Change Requests''' dialog box. In the dialog box, you select the change requests to be included in the change order.[anchor|#_d8af546e-35d4-41d7-9b7c-fb8a22dc5ba6]
==Relations Between Change Requests and Change Orders==
If the project cost budget and commitments need to be updated through a separate change order before the revenue part has been approved, a ''revenue change order'' and a ''cost change order'' may be used. A change request may be associated with both a revenue change order and a cost change order, or with just a revenue change order.{br}

A cost change order is a change order that contains only the cost and commitment parts of the change request and belongs to a change order class that has the '''Revenue Budget''' check box cleared and the '''Cost Budget''' check box, '''Commitments''' check box, or both the '''Cost Budget''' check box and the '''Commitments''' check box selected on the '''Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_30_00|Change Order Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM203000|PM203000]) form.{br}

A revenue change order is a change order that contains the revenue part of the change request and belongs to a change order class that has the '''Revenue Budget''' check box selected on the '''Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_30_00|Change Order Classes] form.{br}

You can release the cost change order as early as necessary to create commitments and change the project cost budget accordingly without having to have the revenue part approved at the same time. The revenue change order may be approved later.{br}

Most commonly, however, a change request relates to only one change order that contains all types of estimation lines—that is, revenue budget, cost budget, and commitment lines. In this case, the change order belongs to a change order class that has the '''Revenue Budget''' check box selected and the '''Cost Budget''' or '''Commitments''' check box selected on the '''Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_30_00|Change Order Classes] form.{br}

You can unlink a change request from the change order selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) form, by deleting the line with the change request on the '''Change Requests''' tab.{br}

A change request cannot be unlinked from the cost and commitment change order if it is also linked to a change order that affects the revenue budget.{br}

The revenue part of a change request that has been unlinked from a change order can be updated as needed.{br}

When a change request is on hold, the cost and commitment parts of the change request can be updated. (To be able to put the change request back on hold, you should first unlink it from the cost change order.){br}

A change order that has any number of linked change requests cannot be deleted. To be able to delete such a change order, you should first unlink all the change requests related to the change order and then put them back on hold.[anchor|#section_vgz_15w_mcb]
==Printing and Emailing of Change Requests==
You can print a change request with any status. For the printing of change requests, the system uses the report that is specified for the ''CHANGE REQUEST'' mailing of the corresponding project on the '''Mailing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. By default, this is the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\PM_64_35_00|Change Request] ([~/?ScreenId=PM643500|PM643500]) report. This report supports the printing of the estimation lines and markups of a change request.{br}

When you email a change request, the system uses the notification template of the same ''CHANGE REQUEST'' mailing of the corresponding project.{br}

On the '''Mailing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, you can specify a custom format and an email notification template for the ''CHANGE REQUEST'' mailing that should be used for the printing and emailing of the change requests prepared for the particular project. When you create a new project, the system copies all the predefined mailing settings from the '''Mailing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form, but you can override these settings.{br}

The [HelpRoot_ReportReference\PM_64_30_00|Change Order] ([~/?ScreenId=PM643000|PM643000]) report, which is the default report for the printing of change orders, supports the printing of related change requests.]]></column>
			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Two-Tier Change Management: General Info  Acumatica ERP provides comprehensive change management capabilities for projects, which are used to         analyze profitability and to track and control project changes.  Acumatica ERP 2020 R1 introduces the  Change Requests  feature. Change requests are detailed breakdowns of         potential changes to the project budget and commitments, such as additions, deletions, or         edits to the existing cost or revenue budget. This feature gives organizations the ability         to set up two-tier change management for change orders. In the first tier, you create change         requests, and the second tier involves you grouping multiple change requests into a single         change order to be approved. Markups can be set up and calculated for change requests. A markup can be applied to an         individual line of a change request or to the total amount of the document. Enabling the Two-Tier Change Management To start using the functionality of change requests, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000)         form, an administrative user enables the  Change Requests  feature. The  Change           Requests  feature can be enabled only if the  Change Orders  feature has been         enabled. The two-tier change management is controlled at the level of a change order class. If the            2-Tier Change Management  check box is selected for a particular         class on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM203000|PM203000]) Change Order Classes (PM203000) form, change orders of         the selected class support two-tier change management and can include change requests; also,         on the  Details  tab, the  Cost Budget  and            Commitments  check boxes become automatically selected and         unavailable for editing. Configuration of Change Requests On the  General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form, the following settings have been         added so that the use of change requests can be configured: Change Request Numbering Sequence : The numbering sequence the           system uses to assign reference numbers to change requests. Change Request Approval Map : The approval map to be used to           assign change requests to employees for approval. If no value is specified in this box,           approval is not required. Pending Change Request Approval Notification : The notification           template that the system uses to generate notification emails for employees who approve           change requests. An employee receives a notification about pending approval when a change           request requires approval from this employee.  Markups  section: The settings that define the default price           markup and the default markups for projects. These markups (if specified) can be modified           for each project. For details about markups, see  Markups Markups. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) Account Groups (PM201000) form, the            Settings  tab has been added. This tab contains the following         settings: Creates Commitment : A check box that indicates (if selected) that a change           request line that has this cost account group specified will result in a commitment line           on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) Change Orders (PM308000) form once you link the           change request with this line to a change order. Default Line Markup, % : The default markup percentage to be           specified as  Line Markup (%)  for a change request line that has           this account group specified as the cost account group. For details about markups, see              Markups Markups. Change Requests On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308500|PM308500]) Change Requests (PM308500) form, you can create a new         change request or view, modify, or delete an existing change request. A change request can have one of the following statuses, which is displayed in the            Status  box in the Summary area of the form: On Hold : The change request is a draft. You can edit or delete the change           request, but cannot link it to a change order. Pending Approval : The change request has been taken off hold (that is, the              Hold  check box was cleared for the change request). On the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) Approvals (EP503010) form, a change request with this           status is visible to the employee who has been assigned to approve the change request in           accordance with the change request approval map specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form. This status is available only if           the  Approval Workflow  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form and a change request approval map           has been defined and then specified in the  Change Request Approval             Map  box on the  General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences form. Rejected : The system assigns this status to the change request if the employee           who was assigned to approve the change request has rejected it. The change request can be           saved with the  On Hold  status for further editing. This status is available only if           the  Approval Workflow  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features form and a change request approval map has been           defined and then specified in the  Change Request Approval Map  box           on the  General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences form. Open : The system assigns this status to the change request if the employee who           was assigned to approve the change order has approved it. If no approval map is defined           for change requests, the system assigns this status to the change request immediately           after you clear the  Hold  check box. You can link this change           request to a change order or save it with the  On Hold  status for further           editing. Closed : The system assigns this status to the change request whose cost and           commitment part and revenue part have been linked to one or two change orders (depending           on whether the cost and commitment part and the revenue part are processed jointly or           separately—see  Relations Between Change Requests and Change Orders Relations Between Change Requests and Change Orders for details). The  Estimation  tab of that form lists potential changes that will         affect the revenue budget, the cost budget, and the commitments of the selected project when         the related change orders are released. Until the related change orders are released, these         potential changes are also tracked for the project in the  Potential CO           Quantity  and  Potential CO Amount  columns on the            Revenue Budget  and  Cost Budget  tabs of the             ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. Markups The following types of markup are supported for change requests: Line-level markups: This type of markup applies to an individual estimation line of a           change request. This type includes the following markups: Price Markup (%) : The markup specified for the item. If the item has no               defined markup, the system uses the  Default Price Markup, %                specified on the  General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form. This markup can be changed               for each change request line manually. Line Markup (%) : The markup specified for the cost account group. The default               value can be manually overridden for each change request line. Document-level markups: This type of markup applies to the total amount of a change           request. For a change request, default markups are inherited from the related project and           can be manually overridden on the  Markups  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308500|PM308500]) Change Requests (PM308500) form. For the project, default markups           are inherited from the  Markup  section of the  General             Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences form and           can be manually overridden on the  Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. The following markup types can           be defined: % : A markup whose amount is calculated as follows: Markup Amount =                    Line Total  *  % Markup Value  /                  100 . There can be as many markups of this type as necessary, with the                 markup subtotal calculated as a sum of all markup amounts. Cumulative % : A markup whose amount is calculated as follows: Markup Amount                 = (all the previously applied % markups) *  Cumulative % Value  /                  100 . Flat Fee : A markup whose amount is specified manually to be added to the               total markup. A document-level markup is applied to a change request only if all the project             budget key attributes—project task, account group, and optionally inventory item or cost             code—are defined for the markup at the change request level. The visibility of the             inventory item or cost code columns depends on the  Revenue Budget               Level  of the project specified in the  Project               Properties  section on the  Summary  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form. A price markup is an item-specific markup. It can be specified on the  Price/Cost           Info  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form         or on the  Price/Cost Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form. The markup percent specified for         the item is retrieved by default as  Price Markup (%)  when the item is         selected for the corresponding line on the  Estimation  tab of the             ([~/?ScreenId=PM308500|PM308500]) Change Requests form. If no markup is specified for the item,         the system uses the default price markup specified in the  Default Price Markup,           %  box ( Markup  section) on the  General           Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences form (if         specified). The calculation of amounts is performed as follows: Ext. Cost  =  Quantity  *  Unit             Cost Unit Price  =  Unit Cost  +  Unit             Cost  *  Price Markup (%)  /  100 Ext. Price  =  Quantity  *  Unit             Price Line markup, which is a default markup that is specific to an account group, is specified         on the  Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) Account Groups (PM201000) form. The markup percent specified for the account group is retrieved by         default as the  Line Markup (%)  when the cost account group is         selected for the corresponding line on the  Estimation  tab of the             ([~/?ScreenId=PM308500|PM308500]) Change Requests form. The calculation of the line amount is         performed as follows: Line Amount  =  Ext. Price  +  Ext.           Price  *  Line Markup (%)  /  100 Default markup values are specified in the  Markup  section of the            General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences form. The values are copied into each new project         and can be overridden. When a new change request is created for a project, it inherits the         project-specific markup values, which can be also overridden. Adding a Change Request to a Change Order On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308500|PM308500]) Change Requests (PM308500) form, you can create a         change order for the selected change request by clicking the  Create Change           Order  button on the form toolbar. To be able to do that, a change order class         that supports two-tier change management must be selected as the  Default Change           Order Class  in the  General Settings  section on the            General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) Change Orders (PM308000) form, you can also add         change requests to the selected change order. To do that, on the table toolbar of the            Change Requests  tab, you click the  Select Change           Requests  button to open the  Select Change Requests          dialog box. In the dialog box, you select the change requests to be included in the change         order. Relations Between Change Requests and Change Orders If the project cost budget and commitments need to be updated through a separate change         order before the revenue part has been approved, a  revenue change order  and a            cost change order  may be used. A change request may be associated with both a         revenue change order and a cost change order, or with just a revenue change order. A cost change order is a change order that contains only the cost and commitment parts of         the change request and belongs to a change order class that has the  Revenue           Budget  check box cleared and the  Cost Budget  check box,            Commitments  check box, or both the  Cost           Budget  check box and the  Commitments  check box selected         on the  Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM203000|PM203000]) Change Order Classes (PM203000) form. A revenue change order is a change order that contains the revenue part of the change         request and belongs to a change order class that has the  Revenue           Budget  check box selected on the  Details  tab of the             ([~/?ScreenId=PM203000|PM203000]) Change Order Classes form. You can release the cost change order as early as necessary to create commitments and         change the project cost budget accordingly without having to have the revenue part approved         at the same time. The revenue change order may be approved later. Most commonly, however, a change request relates to only one change order that contains all         types of estimation lines—that is, revenue budget, cost budget, and commitment lines. In         this case, the change order belongs to a change order class that has the  Revenue           Budget  check box selected and the  Cost Budget  or            Commitments  check box selected on the            Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM203000|PM203000]) Change Order Classes         form. You can unlink a change request from the change order selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) Change Orders (PM308000) form, by deleting the line with the         change request on the  Change Requests  tab. A change request cannot be unlinked from the cost and commitment change order if it is also         linked to a change order that affects the revenue budget. The revenue part of a change request that has been unlinked from a change order can be         updated as needed. When a change request is on hold, the cost and commitment parts of the change request can         be updated. (To be able to put the change request back on hold, you should first unlink it         from the cost change order.) A change order that has any number of linked change requests cannot be deleted. To be able         to delete such a change order, you should first unlink all the change requests related to         the change order and then put them back on hold. Printing and Emailing of Change Requests You can print a change request with any status. For the printing of change requests, the         system uses the report that is specified for the  CHANGE REQUEST  mailing of the         corresponding project on the  Mailing Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. By default, this is the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM643500|PM643500]) Change Request (PM643500) report. This report supports the printing of the         estimation lines and markups of a change request. When you email a change request, the system uses the notification template of the same            CHANGE REQUEST  mailing of the corresponding project. On the  Mailing Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, you can specify a custom format and an email         notification template for the  CHANGE REQUEST  mailing that should be used for the         printing and emailing of the change requests prepared for the particular project. When you         create a new project, the system copies all the predefined mailing settings from the            Mailing Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form, but you can override these         settings. The   ([~/?ScreenId=PM643000|PM643000]) Change Order (PM643000) report, which is the default         report for the printing of change orders, supports the printing of related change         requests. ]]></column>

Retainage is an amount held by a customer until a contractor finishes work. You can specify a retainage percent to be held by the customer of a project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. The system will use this retainage percent to automatically calculate the retained amount for each invoice issued for the project.
==Enabling Retainage==
To start using the functionality of retainage, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, an administrative user enables the ''Retainage Support'' feature and optionally the ''Payment Application by Line'' feature.{br}

If the ''Retainage Support'' feature is enabled, retainage can be calculated in one of the following ways:[anchor|#_c759ed05-c59b-4740-947c-707dcb8ee28d]
*As standard retainage: The standard processing of retainage.
*As standard retainage with steps: The standard processing of retainage that also allows users to specify a list of retainage percent values for the entire project to be applied in accordance with the project completion percent

If the ''Payment Application by Line'' feature is also enabled, retainage can be calculated as follows:[anchor|#_24e770a5-3fad-41bb-b42c-bea5384a6e3e]
*As project cap retainage: The retainage percent and cap are specified at the project level. The retainage amount is allocated across the billed lines until the maximum value is reached.
*As project cap retainage with steps: This retainage works as project cap retainage does, but a list of retainage percent values can be specified for the entire project to be applied in accordance with the project completion percent.
*As project item cap retainage: The retainage percent and cap are specified at the line level, and the retainage amount and maximum cap are calculated individually for each line.

==Default Retainage Settings==
You can specify default retainage settings for a project template in the '''Retainage''' section on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_00|Project Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) form. You can specify the retainage mode, retainage percent, cap percent, retainage steps, and whether change order amounts are to be included in the calculation of the contract total. The specified values will be used by default for all projects created based on this template. You can override the default values for each project (or specify new values, if no default values were defined on the template level) in the '''Retainage''' section on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form.{br}

When you select a customer for a new project, the system populates the '''Retainage %''' box in the '''Retainage''' section on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form with the '''Retainage Percent''' of the customer from the '''Retainage Settings''' section on the '''General Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form. When you change the customer of the project, the system suggests updating the '''Retainage %''' with the retainage percentage of the selected customer.
==Retainage in Revenue Budget==
When you save your changes after specifying a retainage percent for a project, the system calculates the retainage amount for each revenue budget line of the project according to the specified percent. You can manually override the retainage percent for each revenue budget line on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form.{br}

When you manually adjust the retainage percentage of a project in the '''Retainage (%)''' box in the '''Retainage''' section on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the system suggests updating the retainage percentage of the revenue budget lines of the project.
==Retainage Tracking in Progress Billing==
The way retainage is processed during the progress billing depends on settings selected in the '''Retainage''' section of the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form: what retainage mode is selected for the project and whether the '''Use Steps''' check box is selected or cleared.{br}

For the ''Standard'' retainage mode with the '''Use Steps''' check box cleared for the project, the retainage percent specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form (also in the '''Retainage''' section of the '''Summary''' tab) is used by default for revenue budget lines and for the lines of AR invoices related to the project, which originate from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form. The user can update the retainage percent at any time.{br}

This scenario is applicable if the ''Retainage Support'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

For the ''Standard'' retainage mode with the '''Use Steps''' check box selected for the project, the user specifies a retainage percent for a particular project completion threshold in the '''Stepped Retainage''' table in the '''Retainage''' section of the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. During the billing, the retainage percent that corresponds to the current project completion percent is used for revenue budget lines and for the lines of AR invoices related to the project, which originate from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] form{br}

This scenario is applicable if the ''Retainage Support'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form.{br}

For the ''Contract Cap'' retainage mode with the '''Use Steps''' check box cleared for the project, the functionality works as follows:[anchor|#_473c85d4-f67e-4dfb-bb85-940aaa54ab36]
#On the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the user specifies values in the '''Retainage (%)''' and '''Cap (%)''' boxes and selects or clears the '''Include CO''' check box depending on whether the contract total and project completion percent should be calculated based on the original revenue budget values or the revised ones.
#The system calculates the cap amount, which is the maximum retainage amount that can be held for the project, as follows:
#:{{Cap Amount = '''Contract Total''' * '''Cap (%)''' * '''Retainage (%)'''}}
#Progress billing with a pro forma invoice is performed for the project, the total retained amount held per project is validated for each pro forma invoice, and the retainage amount is calculated.
#Once the cap is reached and the total retained amount held per project is at its maximum, no new retainage amount is calculated, and reallocation of the allocated retained amount is performed based on the weight of the invoice lines.

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_51_00_00|Release AR Retainage] ([~/?ScreenId=AR510000|AR510000]) form, invoice lines can be filtered by various criteria, such as project, project task, account group, inventory ID, and cost code. On this form, the user can gradually release the retainage held to clear the unreleased retainage balance held on the AR invoice lines, thus decreasing the total retained amount held per project. Several retainage invoices may be generated during the processing because the lines are grouped by the parent AR invoice, and each retainage invoice can relate to only one AR invoice. In this case, the progress billing procedure follows the same rules so that the total retained amount would tend toward the cap amount once again. {br}

The scenario of releasing retainage by AR invoice lines and using the ''Contract Cap'' retainage mode is applicable if the ''Retainage Support'' and ''Payment Application by Line'' features are enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form, the '''Create Pro Forma on Billing''' check box is selected for the project on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, and the '''Pay by Line''' check box is selected for the AR invoice on the '''Financial Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] form.{br}

For the ''Contract Cap'' retainage mode with the '''Use Steps''' check box selected for the project, the scenario is similar to the previous one, but instead of a single retainage percent, the user can specify multiple retainage percent values that correspond to particular thresholds of project completion. If the project completion reaches a threshold and the retainage percent is changed, the system recalculates the cap amount, and the current and further billing iterations will be validated against the newly calculated cap figures.{br}

This scenario is applicable if the ''Retainage Support'' and ''Payment Application by Line'' features are enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form and the '''Create Pro Forma on Billing''' check box is selected for the project on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form.{br}

For the ''Contract Item Cap'' retainage mode, the scenario is similar to that for the ''Contract Cap'' retainage mode with the '''Use Steps''' check box cleared for the project, but it is performed for each line individually.{br}

This scenario is applicable if the ''Retainage Support'' and ''Payment Application by Line'' features are enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form and the '''Create Pro Forma on Billing''' check box is selected for the project on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form.((({S:Warn}For the ''Contract Cap'' and ''Contract Item Cap'' retainage modes, the '''Pay by Line''' check box is automatically selected and unavailable for editing on the '''Financial Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] form for AR invoices that originate from pro forma invoices.
)))
==Retainage Tracking in Time and Material Billing==
For time and material billing, the retainage percent is copied from the '''Retainage %''' box on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form and can be overridden. The time and material billing also supports the ''Standard'' retainage mode with the '''Use Steps''' check box selected in the retainage settings of the project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form.
==Retainage in AR Invoices==
The system generates the AR invoice based on the pro forma invoice or project transactions, depending on the billing workflow configured for the project. If draft invoice (pro forma) workflow is used, the retained amounts are copied from pro forma to the AR invoice once the latter is created, otherwise the retained amount is copied from a corresponding project transaction. The generated invoice with retainage is listed among other invoices for the project on the '''Invoices''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. Also, on this tab, you can initiate release of the retainage of the invoice by clicking the row of the invoice in the table and then clicking the '''Release Retainage''' button on the table toolbar.
==Retainage in Commitments==
The following amounts of a commitment that originate from the purchase order line always include the retained amount on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_60_00|Commitments] ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) form even if the corresponding purchase order line has the amount after retainage in the '''Amount''' column on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form:[anchor|#ul_hgb_znn_ldb]
*'''Original Committed Amount''': The amount originates from the '''Ext. Cost''' of the purchase order line that includes the retained amount.
*'''Committed Open Amount''': The amount originates from the '''Open Amount''' of the purchase order line that includes the retained amount.
*'''Revised Committed Amount''': The amount originates from the '''Ext. Cost''' of the purchase order line that includes the retained amount.

The other commitment amounts are calculated based on the amounts listed above—that is, the commitment amounts include the retained amount if any.
==Limitations of the Retainage Processing==
The following limitations apply to the retainage processing.{br}

The ''Contract Cap'' and ''Contract Item Cap'' retainage modes are available for selection only if the ''Retainage Support'' and ''Payment Application by Line'' features are enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. For these modes, the '''Pay by Line''' check box on the '''Financial Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form is selected and unavailable for editing for all AR invoices generated during the project billing.{br}

The ''Contract Cap'' retainage mode can be selected only if the '''Create Pro Forma on Billing''' check box is selected for the project on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form.{br}

Retainage with foreign currency documents is not supported. As a result, the base currency should be used as the billing currency. If a foreign currency is used as the project currency, the system will not be able to generate a pro forma invoice for the project.

As project item cap retainage: The retainage percent and cap are specified at the line           level, and the retainage amount and maximum cap are calculated individually for each           line. Default Retainage Settings You can specify default retainage settings for a project template in the            Retainage  section on the  Summary  tab of the             ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) Project Templates (PM208000) form. You can specify the retainage mode,         retainage percent, cap percent, retainage steps, and whether change order amounts are to be         included in the calculation of the contract total. The specified values will be used by         default for all projects created based on this template. You can override the default values         for each project (or specify new values, if no default values were defined on the template         level) in the  Retainage  section on the  Summary          tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. When you select a customer for a new project, the system populates the  Retainage           %  box in the  Retainage  section on the            Summary  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form with the            Retainage Percent  of the customer from the  Retainage           Settings  section on the  General Info  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000) form. When you change the customer of         the project, the system suggests updating the  Retainage %  with the         retainage percentage of the selected customer. Retainage in Revenue Budget When you save your changes after specifying a retainage percent for a project, the system         calculates the retainage amount for each revenue budget line of the project according to the         specified percent. You can manually override the retainage percent for each revenue budget         line on the  Revenue Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects         (PM301000) form. When you manually adjust the retainage percentage of a project in the  Retainage           (%)  box in the  Retainage  section on the            Summary  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, the system         suggests updating the retainage percentage of the revenue budget lines of the project. Retainage Tracking in Progress Billing The way retainage is processed during the progress billing depends on settings selected in         the  Retainage  section of the  Summary  tab of         the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form: what retainage mode is         selected for the project and whether the  Use Steps  check box is         selected or cleared. For the  Standard  retainage mode with the  Use Steps  check box         cleared for the project, the retainage percent specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form (also in the  Retainage          section of the  Summary  tab) is used by default for revenue budget         lines and for the lines of AR invoices related to the project, which originate from the             ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form. The user can update the         retainage percent at any time. This scenario is applicable if the  Retainage Support  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. For the  Standard  retainage mode with the  Use Steps  check box         selected for the project, the user specifies a retainage percent for a particular project         completion threshold in the  Stepped Retainage  table in the            Retainage  section of the  Summary  tab of the             ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form. During the billing, the retainage         percent that corresponds to the current project completion percent is used for revenue         budget lines and for the lines of AR invoices related to the project, which originate from         the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos form This scenario is applicable if the  Retainage Support  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features form. For the  Contract Cap  retainage mode with the  Use Steps  check         box cleared for the project, the functionality works as follows: On the  Summary  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, the user specifies values in the              Retainage (%)  and  Cap (%)  boxes and           selects or clears the  Include CO  check box depending on whether the           contract total and project completion percent should be calculated based on the original           revenue budget values or the revised ones. The system calculates the cap amount, which is the maximum retainage amount that can be           held for the project, as follows: Cap Amount =  Contract                 Total  *  Cap (%)  *  Retainage                 (%) Progress billing with a pro forma invoice is performed for the project, the total           retained amount held per project is validated for each pro forma invoice, and the           retainage amount is calculated. Once the cap is reached and the total retained amount held per project is at its           maximum, no new retainage amount is calculated, and reallocation of the allocated retained           amount is performed based on the weight of the invoice lines. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR510000|AR510000]) Release AR Retainage (AR510000) form, invoice lines can be         filtered by various criteria, such as project, project task, account group, inventory ID,         and cost code.

For the  Contract Cap  retainage mode with the  Use Steps  check         box selected for the project, the scenario is similar to the previous one, but instead of a         single retainage percent, the user can specify multiple retainage percent values that         correspond to particular thresholds of project completion. If the project completion reaches         a threshold and the retainage percent is changed, the system recalculates the cap amount,         and the current and further billing iterations will be validated against the newly         calculated cap figures. This scenario is applicable if the  Retainage Support  and  Payment Application by           Line  features are enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features form and         the  Create Pro Forma on Billing  check box is selected for the project         on the  Summary  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form. For the  Contract Item Cap  retainage mode, the scenario is similar to that for the            Contract Cap  retainage mode with the  Use Steps  check box         cleared for the project, but it is performed for each line individually. This scenario is applicable if the  Retainage Support  and  Payment Application by           Line  features are enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features form and         the  Create Pro Forma on Billing  check box is selected for the project         on the  Summary  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form. For the  Contract Cap  and  Contract Item Cap  retainage modes, the            Pay by Line  check box is automatically selected and unavailable for         editing on the  Financial Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos form for AR invoices that originate from pro forma         invoices. Retainage Tracking in Time and Material Billing For time and material billing, the retainage percent is copied from the            Retainage %  box on the  Summary  tab of the             ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form and can be overridden. The time and         material billing also supports the  Standard  retainage mode with the  Use           Steps  check box selected in the retainage settings of the project on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. Retainage in AR Invoices The system generates the AR invoice based on the pro forma invoice or project transactions,         depending on the billing workflow configured for the project. If draft invoice (pro forma)         workflow is used, the retained amounts are copied from pro forma to the AR invoice once the         latter is created, otherwise the retained amount is copied from a corresponding project         transaction. The generated invoice with retainage is listed among other invoices for the         project on the  Invoices  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects         form. Also, on this tab, you can initiate release of the retainage of the invoice by         clicking the row of the invoice in the table and then clicking the  Release           Retainage  button on the table toolbar. Retainage in Commitments The following amounts of a commitment that originate from the purchase order line always         include the retained amount on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) Commitments (PM306000) form even         if the corresponding purchase order line has the amount after retainage in the            Amount  column on the  Document Details  tab of         the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form: Original Committed Amount : The amount originates from the              Ext. Cost  of the purchase order line that includes the retained           amount. Committed Open Amount : The amount originates from the              Open Amount  of the purchase order line that includes the retained           amount. Revised Committed Amount : The amount originates from the              Ext. Cost  of the purchase order line that includes the retained           amount. The other commitment amounts are calculated based on the amounts listed above—that is, the         commitment amounts include the retained amount if any. Limitations of the Retainage Processing The following limitations apply to the retainage processing. The  Contract Cap  and  Contract Item Cap  retainage modes are available for         selection only if the  Retainage Support  and  Payment Application by Line          features are enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form.         For these modes, the  Pay by Line  check box on the            Financial Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form is selected and unavailable for         editing for all AR invoices generated during the project billing. The  Contract Cap  retainage mode can be selected only if the  Create Pro           Forma on Billing  check box is selected for the project on the            Summary  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects         (PM301000) form. Retainage with foreign currency documents is not supported. As a result, the base currency         should be used as the billing currency. If a foreign currency is used as the project         currency, the system will not be able to generate a pro forma invoice for the project. ]]></column>

With the ''Multi-Currency Projects'' feature, you can track a project in the project currency, which can differ from the base currency. You can do the following:[anchor|#_53c525fe-9cfd-4942-ab5a-35077ea26f1e]
*Manage project budgets in the project currency
*Review actual revenues, actual costs, and committed costs in the project currency, with an ability to calculate project profitability in both the project currency and the base currency, and present costs to the customer in the customer&rsquo;s currency
*Track actual balances in the base currency at the historical exchange rate
*Track cost commitments in the project currency at the historical exchange rate
*Track change orders for budgeted amounts in the project currency
*Create change orders for commitments in a currency that differs from the base currency and the project currency
*Bill projects by using progress billing based on the revenue budget that is defined in the project currency
*Apply the exchange rates of the project currency to time and material transactions billed by quantity
*Add markup to billable amounts in the project currency during time and material billing
*Re-bill the exact amount of an expense in a foreign currency if the currency of the expense transaction is the same as the project currency in which the project is billed, which can be useful to re-bill travel expenses incurred during visits to the customer
*Plan budgets by financial period and create budget forecasts in the project currency to compare actual budgets and change order amounts with monthly budgets
*Create a project quote in a foreign currency and convert the quote to a project in this currency

The functionality of multicurrency project accounting is available only if the ''Multi-Currency Projects'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. The ''Multi-Currency Projects'' feature can be enabled only if the ''Multi-Currency Accounting'' feature has been enabled.{br}{TOC}
==Configuration of Exchange Rates==
Projects in a foreign currency use currency exchange rates that are configured and maintained on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CM_30_10_00|Currency Rates] ([~/?ScreenId=CM301000|CM301000]) form. For more information on managing exchange rates, see [HelpRoot_Financials\CM__MNG_Managing_Currency_Rates|Managing Currency Rates].{br}

For multicurrency accounting in projects, as the default rate type, the system uses the rate type specified in the '''PM Rate Type''' box ('''Default Rate Types''' section) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CM_10_10_00|Currency Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) form.[anchor|#section_fdf_x42_p2b]
==Projects with Multicurrency Accounting==
Projects can have configurable currencies on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. If the project currency differs from the base currency, you can track the project in both the base currency and the project currency.{br}

For a new project created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the system fills in the '''Project Currency''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Project Properties''' section) with the customer&rsquo;s currency, which is selected in the '''Currency ID''' box on the '''General Info''' tab ('''Financial Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form. If the customer has no currency defined, the base currency is selected as the '''Project Currency'''. You can change the '''Project Currency''' if the project has no transactions, commitments, and change orders.{br}

The system selects the project currency in the '''Billing Currency''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Billing and Allocation Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. This currency is used as the currency of the invoices created during the project billing. You can select any currency as the '''Billing Currency''' if the project currency is the base currency.{br}

The following table lists possible configurations for common business scenarios.[anchor|#_f9daa89e-499f-4a66-8fb3-eae1fc03f603]

The '''Currency Rate for Budget''' (in the Summary area) is the exchange rate that is used to display amounts in the project and base currencies on the '''Revenue Budget''', '''Cost Budget''', and '''Balances''' tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. By default, this is the exchange rate of the rate type selected in the '''Currency Rate Type''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Project Properties''' section). If this box is cleared, which is the default value, the system uses the default rate type of projects specified in the '''PM Rate Type''' box ('''Default Rate Types''' section) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CM_10_10_00|Currency Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) form.{br}

You can click the exchange rate value in the '''Currency Rate for Budget''' box in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. Then in the '''Rate Selection''' dialog box, which is opened, you can override the exchange rate for the project if the '''Enable Rate Override''' check box is selected on the '''General Info''' tab ('''Financial Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form.{br}

By default, on the '''Revenue Budget''', '''Cost Budget''', and '''Balances''' tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the system shows the amounts in the project currency. You can enter the amounts in the project currency only. If you click the '''View Base''' button in the '''Currency Rate for Budget''' box in the Summary area, the system shows the budgeted amounts and balances in the base currency converted based on the rate shown in the '''Currency Rate for Budget''' box. To show the amounts in the project currency, you click the '''View Cury''' button in the '''Currency Rate for Budget''' box in the Summary area.{br}

Only amounts in the '''Hist. Actual Amount in Base Currency''' column on the '''Revenue Budget''', '''Cost Budget''', and '''Balances''' tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form are always shown in the base currency.
==Project Transactions with Multicurrency Accounting==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) form, you can create project transactions with the amount in any foreign currency. The system converts the amount of these transactions in the project currency, which is specified in the '''Project Currency''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Project Properties''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form.{br}

The '''Project Currency Rate''' of the project transaction is defined by the project-specific rate type selected in the '''Currency Rate Type''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Project Properties''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. If the project has no rate type selected, the system uses the default rate type of projects specified in the '''PM Rate Type''' box ('''Default Rate Types''' section) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CM_10_10_00|Currency Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) form.{br}

You enter the amount of the project transaction in the transaction currency. The system uses this amount in the transaction currency to calculate the transaction amounts in the project currency and in the base currency. The transaction amount in the base currency is not shown on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] form. The system also updates the actual amounts of the project budget in the project currency and in the base currency with the corresponding amounts of the project transaction.{br}

When the system creates a project transaction based on a general ledger transaction, the amount in the transaction currency and the amount in the base currency are copied from the general ledger transaction to the project transaction. The corresponding amount in the project currency of the project transaction is calculated based on the amount in the transaction currency. (See the following diagram.)[anchor|#_660d9149-36ce-4111-9fec-df590787dd2f][anchor|#_0c192b0f-5f24-45b4-b656-db53ca11d985][image:UserGuide/Images/Project_Multi_Currency2.png|popup|A project transaction created based on a GL transaction|300px]
When the system creates a general ledger transaction based on a project transaction, the amount in the transaction currency and the amount in the base currency are copied from the project transaction to the general ledger transaction, as the following diagram illustrates.[anchor|#_d0b16557-a678-4ce0-8593-833dfda5306d][anchor|#_7dd2a10e-f98e-4cea-a7dd-9044c25868aa][image:UserGuide/Images/Project_Multi_Currency3.png|popup|A GL transaction created based on a project transaction|300px]
==Invoices for Projects with Multicurrency Accounting==
During project billing, the system creates pro forma or accounts receivable invoices in the billing currency of the project specified in the '''Billing Currency''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Billing and Allocation Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form.{br}

The exchange rate for the invoice is defined by the project-specific rate type selected in the '''Currency Rate Type''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Project Properties''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. If the project has no rate type selected, the system uses the default rate type of projects specified in the '''PM Rate Type''' box ( '''Default Rate Types''' section) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CM_10_10_00|Currency Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) form.{br}

You can override the exchange rate for an invoice if for the customer, the '''Enable Rate Override''' check box is selected on the '''General Info''' tab ('''Financial Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form.{br}

All the invoice amounts can be reviewed in both the invoice currency and the base currency.
==Billing Process with Multicurrency Accounting==
During the billing process, the system produces amounts in the project currency. Then the amounts are converted into the billing currency of the project.{br}

If the {{@Price}} parameter is used in a time and material step of a billing rule on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, during the billing process with this billing rule, the system looks for the price in the project currency. If the price in the project currency is not found, the system converts the price from the base currency by using the exchange rate defined by the rate type of the project.{br}

If the {{@Rate}} parameter is used in a time and material step of a billing rule on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] form, during the billing process with this billing rule, the system retrieves the rate as is for use in the user-defined formulas of the billing rule. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] form, in formulas of time and material steps of a billing rule, you can convert an amount retrieved with the {{@Rate}} parameter by using the {{ConvertAmountToCurrency()}} function.{br}

The {{Report.ConvertAmountToCurrency(fromCuryID, toCuryID, rateType, effectiveDate, value)}} function has the following parameters:[anchor|#_8996a5fd-2fe8-4844-a643-507ac7ae8f12]
*{{fromCuryID}}: The source currency in which the {{@Rate}} has been defined
*{{toCuryID}}: The project currency
*{{rateType}}: The rate type of the project
*{{effectiveDate}}: The date on which the exchange rate is effective
*{{value}}: The amount to be converted

To re-bill an amount in the project currency as is, in the formula of a time and material step of a billing rule on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, you can use the following data field: {{[PMTran.ProjectCuryAmount]}}. {{PMTran.Amount}} is the amount in the base currency. {{PMTran.TranCuryAmount}} is the amount in the transaction currency. 
==Cost Commitments with Multicurrency Accounting==
The system creates commitments for a project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_60_00|Commitments] ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) form in the project currency.{br}

The exchange rate from the document currency to the project currency for the creation of the commitment is defined by the project-specific rate type selected in the '''Currency Rate Type''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Project Properties''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. If the project has no rate type selected, the system uses the default rate type of projects specified in the '''PM Rate Type''' box ( '''Default Rate Types''' section) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CM_10_10_00|Currency Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) form.
==Change Orders with Multicurrency Accounting==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) form, in the Summary area and on the '''Revenue Budget''' and '''Cost Budget''' tabs, amounts are shown in the project currency, which is specified in the '''Project Currency''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Project Properties''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. On the '''Commitments''' tab, amounts of change order lines are shown in the currency of the corresponding purchase orders.
==Project Quotes with Multicurrency Accounting==
For a new project quote created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) form, the system fills in the '''Currency''' box in the Summary area with the business account&rsquo;s currency selected in the '''Currency ID''' box on the '''General Info''' tab ('''Financial Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form. If no currency is defined for the customer, the base currency is selected as the project quote currency.{br}

If a project quote is created based on an opportunity selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) form, the system selects the opportunity currency as the project quote currency.{br}

You can change the project quote currency if for the customer, the '''Enable Currency Override''' check box is selected on the '''General Info''' tab ('''Financial Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form. If you change the project quote currency and the project quote is the primary quote of an opportunity, the system changes the opportunity currency accordingly.{br}

For project quotes, the system uses the exchange rate of the default rate type of projects specified in the '''PM Rate Type''' box ('''Default Rate Types''' section) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CM_10_10_00|Currency Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) form. You can override the exchange rate for a project quote if for the customer, the '''Enable Rate Override''' check box is selected on the '''General Info''' tab ('''Financial Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form.{br}

For the estimation lines of a project quote, the system converts the retrieved unit prices and unit costs of the selected inventory items to the project quote currency by using the exchange rate of the project quote.{br}

Although all the project quote amounts can be reviewed in both the project quote currency and the base currency, you can edit the amounts only in the project quote currency.{br}

When a project is created based on the project quote, the system copies to the project the project quote currency, the exchange rate of the project quote, and the price and cost information from the project quote in the project currency.

The  Multi-Currency Projects  feature can be enabled only if the            Multi-Currency Accounting  feature has been enabled. Configuration of Exchange Rates Projects in a foreign currency use currency exchange rates that are configured and         maintained on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CM301000|CM301000]) Currency Rates (CM301000) form. For more         information on managing exchange rates, see  Managing Currency Rates. For multicurrency accounting in projects, as the default rate type, the system uses the         rate type specified in the  PM Rate Type  box ( Default Rate           Types  section) on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) Currency Management Preferences (CM101000)         form. Projects with Multicurrency Accounting Projects can have configurable currencies on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. If the project currency differs from the base currency, you can track         the project in both the base currency and the project currency. For a new project created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, the         system fills in the  Project Currency  box on the            Summary  tab ( Project Properties  section)         with the customer's currency, which is selected in the  Currency ID          box on the  General Info  tab ( Financial           Settings  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers         (AR303000) form. If the customer has no currency defined, the base currency is selected as         the  Project Currency . You can change the  Project           Currency  if the project has no transactions, commitments, and change         orders. The system selects the project currency in the  Billing Currency  box         on the  Summary  tab ( Billing and Allocation           Settings  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form.         This currency is used as the currency of the invoices created during the project billing.         You can select any currency as the  Billing Currency  if the project         currency is the base currency. The following table lists possible configurations for common business scenarios. Business Scenario Possible Configuration Base Currency Project Currency Billing Currency A company performs projects for local clients only. The project currency equals the base currency. All currencies are the                 same. USD USD USD A company performs projects for local clients but can occasionally have a                 project for a foreign client. The project currency equals the base currency. The billing currency differs                 from the project currency and the base currency. USD USD EUR A company performs projects for local and foreign clients. The project currency differs from the base currency. The billing currency                 always equals the project currency. USD EUR EUR only The  Currency Rate for Budget  (in the Summary area) is the exchange         rate that is used to display amounts in the project and base currencies on the            Revenue Budget ,  Cost Budget , and            Balances  tabs of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects         form. By default, this is the exchange rate of the rate type selected in the            Currency Rate Type  box on the  Summary  tab           ( Project Properties  section). If this box is cleared, which is the         default value, the system uses the default rate type of projects specified in the            PM Rate Type  box ( Default Rate Types          section) on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) Currency Management Preferences (CM101000) form. You can click the exchange rate value in the  Currency Rate for           Budget  box in the Summary area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form. Then in the  Rate           Selection  dialog box, which is opened, you can override the exchange rate for         the project if the  Enable Rate Override  check box is selected on the            General Info  tab ( Financial Settings          section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers form. By default, on the  Revenue Budget ,  Cost           Budget , and  Balances  tabs of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, the system shows the amounts in the project         currency. You can enter the amounts in the project currency only. If you click the            View Base  button in the  Currency Rate for           Budget  box in the Summary area, the system shows the budgeted amounts and         balances in the base currency converted based on the rate shown in the  Currency           Rate for Budget  box. To show the amounts in the project currency, you click         the  View Cury  button in the  Currency Rate for           Budget  box in the Summary area. Only amounts in the  Hist.

Project Transactions with Multicurrency Accounting On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) Project Transactions (PM304000) form, you can create project         transactions with the amount in any foreign currency. The system converts the amount of         these transactions in the project currency, which is specified in the  Project           Currency  box on the  Summary  tab ( Project           Properties  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects         (PM301000) form. The  Project Currency Rate  of the project transaction is defined by         the project-specific rate type selected in the  Currency Rate Type  box         on the  Summary  tab ( Project Properties          section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form. If the project has no         rate type selected, the system uses the default rate type of projects specified in the            PM Rate Type  box ( Default Rate Types          section) on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) Currency Management Preferences (CM101000) form. You enter the amount of the project transaction in the transaction currency. The system         uses this amount in the transaction currency to calculate the transaction amounts in the         project currency and in the base currency. The transaction amount in the base currency is         not shown on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) Project Transactions form. The system also updates         the actual amounts of the project budget in the project currency and in the base currency         with the corresponding amounts of the project transaction. When the system creates a project transaction based on a general ledger transaction, the         amount in the transaction currency and the amount in the base currency are copied from the         general ledger transaction to the project transaction. The corresponding amount in the         project currency of the project transaction is calculated based on the amount in the         transaction currency. (See the following diagram.) A project transaction created based on a GL transaction When the system creates a general ledger transaction based on a project transaction, the         amount in the transaction currency and the amount in the base currency are copied from the         project transaction to the general ledger transaction, as the following diagram         illustrates. A GL transaction created based on a project transaction Invoices for Projects with Multicurrency Accounting During project billing, the system creates pro forma or accounts receivable invoices in the         billing currency of the project specified in the  Billing Currency  box         on the  Summary  tab ( Billing and Allocation           Settings  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects         (PM301000) form. The exchange rate for the invoice is defined by the project-specific rate type selected in         the  Currency Rate Type  box on the  Summary  tab           ( Project Properties  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form. If the project has no rate type selected, the         system uses the default rate type of projects specified in the  PM Rate           Type  box (  Default Rate Types  section) on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) Currency Management Preferences (CM101000) form. You can override the exchange rate for an invoice if for the customer, the            Enable Rate Override  check box is selected on the            General Info  tab ( Financial Settings          section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers form. All the invoice amounts can be reviewed in both the invoice currency and the base         currency. Billing Process with Multicurrency Accounting During the billing process, the system produces amounts in the project currency. Then the         amounts are converted into the billing currency of the project. If the  @Price  parameter is used in a time and material step of a billing         rule on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules (PM207000) form, during the billing         process with this billing rule, the system looks for the price in the project currency. If         the price in the project currency is not found, the system converts the price from the base         currency by using the exchange rate defined by the rate type of the project. If the  @Rate  parameter is used in a time and material step of a billing         rule on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules form, during the billing process         with this billing rule, the system retrieves the rate as is for use in the user-defined         formulas of the billing rule. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules form, in         formulas of time and material steps of a billing rule, you can convert an amount retrieved         with the  @Rate  parameter by using the            ConvertAmountToCurrency()  function. The  Report.ConvertAmountToCurrency(fromCuryID, toCuryID, rateType, effectiveDate,           value)  function has the following parameters: fromCuryID : The source currency in which the  @Rate  has           been defined toCuryID : The project currency rateType : The rate type of the project effectiveDate : The date on which the exchange rate is effective value : The amount to be converted To re-bill an amount in the project currency as is, in the formula of a time and material         step of a billing rule on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules (PM207000) form,         you can use the following data field:  [PMTran.ProjectCuryAmount] .            PMTran.Amount  is the amount in the base currency.            PMTran.TranCuryAmount  is the amount in the transaction currency.  Cost Commitments with Multicurrency Accounting The system creates commitments for a project on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) Commitments (PM306000) form in the project currency. The exchange rate from the document currency to the project currency for the creation of         the commitment is defined by the project-specific rate type selected in the            Currency Rate Type  box on the  Summary  tab           ( Project Properties  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. If the project has no rate type         selected, the system uses the default rate type of projects specified in the  PM           Rate Type  box (  Default Rate Types  section) on the             ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) Currency Management Preferences (CM101000) form. Change Orders with Multicurrency Accounting On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) Change Orders (PM308000) form, in the Summary area         and on the  Revenue Budget  and  Cost Budget          tabs, amounts are shown in the project currency, which is specified in the            Project Currency  box on the  Summary  tab           ( Project Properties  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. On the            Commitments  tab, amounts of change order lines are shown in the         currency of the corresponding purchase orders. Project Quotes with Multicurrency Accounting For a new project quote created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes         (PM304500) form, the system fills in the  Currency  box in the Summary         area with the business account's currency selected in the  Currency ID          box on the  General Info  tab ( Financial           Settings  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers         (AR303000) form. If no currency is defined for the customer, the base currency is selected         as the project quote currency. If a project quote is created based on an opportunity selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) Opportunities (CR304000) form, the system selects the opportunity         currency as the project quote currency. You can change the project quote currency if for the customer, the  Enable           Currency Override  check box is selected on the  General           Info  tab ( Financial Settings  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers form. If you change the project quote currency and         the project quote is the primary quote of an opportunity, the system changes the opportunity         currency accordingly. For project quotes, the system uses the exchange rate of the default rate type of projects         specified in the  PM Rate Type  box ( Default Rate           Types  section) on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) Currency Management Preferences (CM101000)         form. You can override the exchange rate for a project quote if for the customer, the            Enable Rate Override  check box is selected on the            General Info  tab ( Financial Settings          section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers form. For the estimation lines of a project quote, the system converts the retrieved unit prices         and unit costs of the selected inventory items to the project quote currency by using the         exchange rate of the project quote. Although all the project quote amounts can be reviewed in both the project quote currency         and the base currency, you can edit the amounts only in the project quote currency. When a project is created based on the project quote, the system copies to the project the         project quote currency, the exchange rate of the project quote, and the price and cost         information from the project quote in the project currency. ]]></column>

==Story==
Suppose that the HM&rsquo;s Bakery and Cafe customer has ordered a juicer, along with the services of installation and employee training on operating the juicer. The project accountant has created the project. The juicer has been delivered and installed, and a consultant has provided the training. As the project accountant, you need to bill the customer for materials and logged work time. 
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this lesson, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Project Accounting'' feature has been enabled to support the project accounting functionality.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, the ''HMBAKERY2'' project has been created.
==Process Overview==
To capture costs on a project by processing an AP bill, you create the bill on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form, specifying the project and project task in the bill; you then release the bill. Then you review the project balances on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form.
==System Preparation==
To sign in to the system and prepare to perform the instructions of the activity, do the following:[anchor|#_6c9e4914-0e56-4fc0-9f9d-df880dcd99b6]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the U100 dataset preloaded as Pam Brawner by using the ''brawner'' login and the ''123'' password.[anchor|#_c78ec8a1-6541-4fd6-84cf-e06ab93c7d0d]
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select ''1/30/2020'' on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.

==Step 1: Creating a Bill for the Project==
To create an accounts payable bill for the project, do the following:[anchor|#_a7fc6e3b-d40e-45c3-8b1a-031a0a172a9b]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, open the ''INSTALL'' item, which is the item defined in the system associated with the installation service being billed, and review some of its settings as follows:
##On the '''GL Accounts''' tab, notice that the '''Expense Account''' is ''54200 - Project Subcontract Expense''.
##On the '''General Settings''' tab, right of the '''Posting Class''' box, click the '''Edit''' button to review the settings of the posting class.
##On the '''Posting Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) form, which the system opens in a pop-up window with the posting class selected, notice that the '''Use COGS/Expense Account from''' settings is ''Inventory Item''.
##Close the pop-up window.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_10_00|Account Groups] ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) form, open the ''SUBCON'' account group. On the '''Accounts''' tab, notice that the ''54200 - Project Subcontract Expense'' account, which is the expense account of the ''INSTALL'' item, is mapped to the account group.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''HMBAKERY2'' project, and review its settings as follows:
#*On the '''Tasks''' tab, review project tasks, so that you can identify the task that the AP bill is associated with. Pay attention to the project task identifiers.
#*On the '''Cost Budget''' tab, review the cost budget of the project. Notice that the actual amounts are equal to zero because costs have not been captured yet for the project. Also notice that ''SUBCON'' is the account group of the lines with the ''INSTALL'' inventory item.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] (AP301000) form, create a bill, and select the ''SQUEEZO'' vendor in the Summary area.
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and add a row with the following settings:
#On the form, create a bill with the following settings:
#*'''Inventory ID''': ''INSTALL''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>4.00</tt>
#*'''Project''': ''HMBAKERY2''
#* '''Project Task''': ''PHASE1''
#:Notice that the system has selected ''54200 - Project Subcontract Expense'' as the '''Account''' of the bill line, because this is the expense account of the selected item.
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box; on the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the bill.
#On the '''Financial Details''' tab, click the link in the '''Batch Nbr.''' box (and notice this number) to open the batch of general ledger transactions that was created on release of the bill.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_30_10_00|Journal Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=GL301000|GL301000]) form, which the system has opened in a pop-up window, review the general ledger transactions that correspond to the released bill.
#Close the pop-up window.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_10_00|Project Transaction Details] ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) form, in the Summary area, select ''HMBAKERY2'' as the '''Project''', and review the project transaction that has been created based on the released accounts payable bill. In the '''GL Batch Nbr.''' column, notice the number of the corresponding batch of general ledger transactions, which is the batch you have just reviewed.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, open the ''HMBAKERY2'' project. Review the cost budget on the '''Cost Budget''' tab, and notice how the released bill has affected the '''Actual Quantity''' and '''Actual Amount''' of the corresponding budget line, as shown in the following screenshot.

The following activity is based on the                  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system settings             have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the activity             and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100  dataset             to its initial state. Story Suppose that the HM's Bakery and Cafe customer has ordered a juicer, along with the                 services of installation and employee training on operating the juicer. The project                 accountant has created the project. The juicer has been delivered and installed, and                 a consultant has provided the training. As the project accountant, you need to bill                 the customer for materials and logged work time.  Configuration Overview For the purposes of this lesson, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000)                 form, the  Project Accounting  feature has been enabled to support the project                 accounting functionality. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, the  HMBAKERY2  project                 has been created. Process Overview To capture costs on a project by processing an AP bill, you create the bill on the                       ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form, specifying the project and                 project task in the bill; you then release the bill. Then you review the project                 balances on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. System Preparation To sign in to the system and prepare to perform the instructions of the activity, do                 the following: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the U100 dataset preloaded as Pam                     Brawner by using the  brawner  login and the  123  password. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP             screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to  1/30/2020. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and             select  1/30/2020 on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and             process all documents in the system during this business date. Step 1: Creating a Bill for the Project To create an accounts payable bill for the project, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form, open the  INSTALL                      item, which is the item defined in the system associated with the installation                     service being billed, and review some of its settings as follows: On the  GL Accounts  tab, notice that the                                  Expense Account  is  54200 - Project                                 Subcontract Expense . On the  General Settings  tab, right of the                                  Posting Class  box, click the                                  Edit  button to review the settings of the                             posting class. On the  Posting Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) Posting Classes (IN206000) form, which the system opens in                             a pop-up window with the posting class selected, notice that the                                  Use COGS/Expense Account from  settings is                                  Inventory Item .

On the  Accounts  tab,                     notice that the  54200 - Project Subcontract Expense  account, which is the                     expense account of the  INSTALL  item, is mapped to the account group. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, open the                          HMBAKERY2  project, and review its settings as follows: On the  Tasks  tab, review project tasks, so that                             you can identify the task that the AP bill is associated with. Pay                             attention to the project task identifiers. On the  Cost Budget  tab, review the cost budget of                             the project. Notice that the actual amounts are equal to zero because                             costs have not been captured yet for the project. Also notice that                                  SUBCON  is the account group of the lines with the                                  INSTALL  inventory item. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments                     ( AP301000 )                     form, create a bill, and select the  SQUEEZO  vendor in the Summary                     area. On the  Document Details  tab, click  Add                         Row  on the table toolbar, and add a row with the following                     settings: On the  form, create a bill with the following settings: Inventory ID :  INSTALL Quantity :  4.00 Project :  HMBAKERY2 Project Task :  PHASE1 Notice that the system has selected  54200 - Project Subcontract                             Expense  as the  Account  of the bill line,                         because this is the expense account of the selected item. In the Summary area, clear the  Hold  check box; on the                     form toolbar, click  Release  to release the bill.

A project budget is an estimate of expenses or revenues for a project or project task. In Acumatica ERP, a budget can be defined, updated, and tracked for only a project task; the budget for a project holds the totals for all the project tasks included in the project.{br}{TOC}
==Budget Planning==
You plan a project budget during the planning stage of the project, before any project transaction occurs. (For information about the project life cycle, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__con_Project_Life_Cycle|Project Life Cycle].){br}

On the '''Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form, you can add, revise, and delete budget lines for any project task that has the ''In Planning'' status. A project task can have multiple budget lines. Each budget line has the following:[anchor|#ul_hpn_njy_mv]
*An account group, which determines the category of the expenditure or revenue that you expect to incur during the project execution.
*A particular inventory item (that is, a resource) needed to complete the task. You can select an inventory item from the list of inventory items associated with the accounts of the specified account group. However, if you want the budget line to include the budget for all transactions associated with the selected account group that are not linked to any particular inventory item, you can select ''&lt;OTHER&gt;'' in the '''Inventory ID''' column for the particular budget line. 

Other information that you can specify in a budget line includes the budgeted quantity of the selected inventory item, the rate, and the total budgeted amount, which is calculated automatically as the budgeted quantity multiplied by rate if you haven&rsquo;t specified a value manually.{br}

You can modify the data in a budget line until you change the status of the project task to ''Active''; after that, you can specify only a revised amount and quantity in the budget line.((({S:Warn}The system allows the modification of original budgeted totals for tasks with all statuses (not just ''In Planning''), so you need to be careful about how you manage project budgets. (For instance, you may want to restrict access to the project budget data by configuring a restriction group in the Row-Level Security module so that only authorized employees can modify budget lines; for more information about restriction groups, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__mng_Managing_Restriction_groups|Managing Visibility with Restriction Groups].)
)))
In Acumatica ERP, you can also use other forms, in addition to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] form, to enter, track, or revise a project budget. The forms, which include the same budget data but a different level of detail, include the following:[anchor|#ul_xkt_wpb_3v]
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form: On the '''Balances''' tab of this form, the most general information about project budgets is displayed. The information, which contains the details of all the project-related tasks regardless of their status, is broken down into budget lines by account group.
*:On this tab, you can view only the original budgeted amounts, the revised budgets, and the actual budgets calculated based on the project-related transactions that involve the specified account group; you cannot add, delete, or modify budget lines by using this form. 

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] and [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] forms, you can use the '''Auto-Budget''' action to automatically calculate an estimate of future revenue that will be added as a separate budget line for an account group with the ''Income'' type. For the calculation to be accurate, the project budget for the expenses, the involved account groups, and the allocation rules must be properly configured.((({S:Warn}If you want to track the costs of the budget planning activities, you can add an employee task to the related project or project task by using the '''Activity History''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] form, respectively. However, transactions generated for a completed task cannot be released until the project gets the ''Active'' status.
)))
In some cases (for instance, if project data has been modified through external tools or import scenarios), you may need to recalculate the project balances to bring them in line with the underlying transactions. You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_50_40_00|Validate Project Balances] ([~/?ScreenId=PM504000|PM504000]) form for recalculating the balances for the selected projects.
==Budget Tracking==
For each active project or project task, you can review the budget at any time and decide whether you need to revise it or to adjust expenditures.{br}

For tracking a budget, you can use any of the following forms, depending on the level of detail at which you want to view the budget information: [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]), or [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]). Also, you can run the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\PM_62_10_00|Project Balance] ([~/?ScreenId=PM621000|PM621000]) report, which shows the balances of all projects that are active during the selected financial period.{br}

In Acumatica ERP, account groups are used for aggregation of the information related to project budgets. An account group includes General Ledger accounts of a particular type to which project-related transactions are posted. As the project progresses, actual amounts are calculated for each budget line based on the posted transactions; you can track the actual amounts and compare them to the budgeted amounts when reviewing the budget. (For more information about account groups, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__con_Account_Groups|Account Groups in Projects].)((({S:Warn}Because there is no way to assign an AP bill line for a landed cost to any project task, the purchase price variance amount calculated as the difference between the landed cost specified in the purchase receipt and the landed cost specified in the AP bill is not reflected in the project expenses.
)))
Also, you can track the actual quantities of the inventory items included in the budget. An actual quantity is calculated automatically if the following conditions are met:[anchor|#ul_ocb_2qz_lv]
*The budget was specified for the project or project task before any project-related transaction occurred.
*Units of measure were specified for the inventory items before the project was activated.
*The same unit of measure is used for all inventory items that were used in the transactions posted to the accounts included in a particular account group.
*The transactions have been released and posted.

For examples of how the system calculates actual quantities, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__con_Actual_Quantity|Actual Quantity: Calculation Examples].
==Budget Revision==
In some cases (for instance, if you have specified an incorrect value in a budget line or if the project scope has changed), you may want to revise the budget. The original budgeted amounts and quantities should always remain unchanged so that you can later analyze the accuracy of your original estimates. You enter a revised amount or revised quantity for each budget line in a separate column labeled '''Revised Amount''' or '''Revised Qty'''.{br}

The actual progress of the task, which is displayed in the '''Performance''' column on the '''Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] form, is calculated as a ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the actual amount to the revised budget amount. Also, the system uses the revised values for calculation of the task completion percentage if ''Budgeted Quantity'' or ''Budgeted Amount'' is selected for the task in the '''Completion Calculation Method''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] form. (For more information about how the task completion percentage is calculated, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__con_Task_Completion|Calculation of Task Completion Percentage].)

Also, you can track the actual quantities of the inventory items included in the budget. An     actual quantity is calculated automatically if the following conditions are met: The budget was specified for the project or project task before any project-related      transaction occurred. Units of measure were specified for the inventory items before the project was      activated. The same unit of measure is used for all inventory items that were used in the transactions      posted to the accounts included in a particular account group. The transactions have been released and posted. For examples of how the system calculates actual quantities, see  Actual Quantity: Calculation Examples. Budget Revision In some cases (for instance, if you have specified an incorrect value in a budget line or if     the project scope has changed), you may want to revise the budget. The original budgeted amounts     and quantities should always remain unchanged so that you can later analyze the accuracy of your     original estimates. You enter a revised amount or revised quantity for each budget line in a     separate column labeled  Revised Amount  or  Revised      Qty .

Whether and how the system calculates an actual quantity for a budget line depends on the completeness and consistency of the information that is specified for the particular budget line and in the transactions posted to the accounts of the particular account group. Thus, the calculated actual quantity may appear confusing to the user; the task completion percentage may also seem confusing if ''Budgeted Quantity'' is selected for the task in the '''Completion Calculation Method''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form. The sections below include the most common examples of the ways an actual quantity may be calculated in Acumatica ERP.{br}{TOC}
==Scenario 1: Budget Lines and Related Transactions Have Matching Units of Measure==
Suppose that you are managing a large project of building a house, and this project includes a task of installing a ventilation system. For this task, 40 hours of regular labor and 10 hours of overtime labor are budgeted. The budget lines specified for the task on the '''Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] form include the following settings.[anchor|#table_kpq_pcm_mv]

One employee has spent 20 hours of regular labor and 6 hours of overtime labor on this task, and another employee has spent 20 hours of regular labor and 2 hours of overtime labor on this task, after which the task has been completed. You bill the project and release the transactions that include the following settings, which you can review on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_10_00|Project Transaction Details] ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) form.[anchor|#table_j3c_wgn_mv]

For each budget line, the system calculates the actual quantity as the sum of all relevant quantities with the same unit of measure, and the actual amount as the sum of all relevant amounts, which you can view on the '''Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] form.

==Scenario 2: No Unit of Measure Is Specified in the Budget Line==
Suppose that you have a project task for a business trip. An employee may incur various expenses during a business trip, such as transportation charges and accommodation expenses. You have budgeted all these expenses by specifying a total budgeted amount, but without specifying any particular inventory items or units of measure. The budget line specified for the task on the '''Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form includes the following information.[anchor|#table_ump_g5n_mv]

During the business trip, the employee spent three nights in a hotel, had three business lunches, and had a return flight. The involved inventory items have different units of measure. As a result, transactions that include the following settings, which you can review on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_10_00|Project Transaction Details] form, are generated as the project is billed.[anchor|#table_zqt_1wn_mv]

The system doesn&rsquo;t calculate the actual quantity on the '''Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] form because no unit of measure is specified for the budget line. However, ''1950'' is displayed in the '''Actual Amount''' column, which is the total of all travel expenses regardless of their units of measure.
==Scenario 3: Different Units of Measure Are Specified==
This scenario is similar to the previous scenario, except that a particular unit of measure is specified for the budget line on the '''Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form. The budget line includes the following settings.[anchor|#table_j2v_z14_mv]

The resulting transactions (whose settings, which you can review on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_10_00|Project Transaction Details] form, are shown in the table below) are identical to those in the previous scenario, but the system calculates the actual quantity for the budget line as the sum of all the quantities for the inventory items with the ''EACH'' unit of measure. Note that the actual amount is calculated as the total of all travel expenses regardless of their units of measure.[anchor|#table_prv_rb4_mv]

The actual quantity is calculated this way because the system cannot combine different units of measure, such as days, miles and currency amounts, into a single line.]]></column>
			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Actual Quantity: Calculation Examples Whether and how the system calculates an actual quantity for a budget line depends on the         completeness and consistency of the information that is specified for the particular budget         line and in the transactions posted to the accounts of the particular account group. Thus,         the calculated actual quantity may appear confusing to the user; the task completion         percentage may also seem confusing if  Budgeted Quantity  is selected for the task in         the  Completion Calculation Method  box on the  General Settings          tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) Project Tasks (PM302000) form. The sections below include         the most common examples of the ways an actual quantity may be calculated in  Acumatica ERP. Scenario 1: Budget Lines and Related Transactions Have Matching Units of         Measure Suppose that you are managing a large project of building a house, and this project         includes a task of installing a ventilation system. For this task, 40 hours of regular labor         and 10 hours of overtime labor are budgeted. The budget lines specified for the task on the            Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) Project Tasks form include the         following settings. Account Group Inventory ID Description Budget Qty UOM Rate Budget Amount LABOR PMLABOR Project Labor 40 HOUR 100 4000 LABOR PMLABOROT Project Labor Overtime 10 HOUR 150 1500 One employee has spent 20 hours of regular labor and 6 hours of overtime labor on this         task, and another employee has spent 20 hours of regular labor and 2 hours of overtime labor         on this task, after which the task has been completed. You bill the project and release the         transactions that include the following settings, which you can review on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) Project Transaction Details (PM401000) form.

In Acumatica ERP, the project budget can be exceeded as users enter documents. The system can check whether an entered document is within the cost budget of the project, taking into consideration the portion of the budget that has already been consumed.{br}{TOC}
==Lesson Objectives==
You will learn how to:[anchor|#ul_nwj_gch_tbb]
*Configure project accounting to control the budget on document entry
*Control the budget on entry such documents as AP bills, purchase orders, and change orders

==Applicable Scenarios==
You control the project budget on document entry if, for example, you need to approve with the customer all the budget overruns caused by project-related documents before such the documents are released.
==Enabling the Budget Control on Document Entry==
To cause the system to control the project budget, an administrative user selects ''Show a Warning'' in the '''Budget Control''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]).{br}{TOC}
==Controlling the Budget on Document Entry==
If an amount exceeds the cost budget of a project, the warning is shown in the '''Ext. Cost''' column on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) forms, in the '''Amount''' column on the '''Commitment''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) form, and in the Summary area of these forms. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form, the system controls only documents of the ''Open'' and ''Drop Ship'' types.{br}

The warning is shown when you enter an amount that exceeds the project budget, or when a document with such an amount is saved with any status except ''Closed'' for change orders and ''Open'' for purchase orders and AP bills. The document approver also sees this warning if the amount exceeds the project budget.{br}

The warning message in the document line displays the applicable amounts of the following:[anchor|#_ea172f54-6c0c-4eee-81e0-9a187f19b1e3]
*''Budgeted'': The revised budgeted amount of the corresponding project budget line in the project currency
*''Consumed'': The sum of the actual amount and the committed open amount of the corresponding project budget line in the project currency
*''Available'': The difference between the ''Budgeted'' and ''Consumed'' amounts
*''Document'': The sum of the '''Ext. Cost''' minus the '''Discount Amount''' amounts of all the document lines that impact the same budget line in the validated document
*''Remaining'': The difference between the ''Available'' and ''Document'' amounts

All the budget overruns of a project can be reviewed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_40_00|Project Budget Overruns] ([~/?ScreenId=PM404000|PM404000]) form.{br}{TOC}]]></column>

 Acumatica ERP provides draft (pro forma) invoice capabilities for project billing. A pro forma invoice, which you can view on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form, is isolated from the Accounts Receivable module. You can review and modify the billable transactions and amounts of the pro forma invoice before you prepare the Accounts Receivable invoice that is based on this pro forma invoice. A pro forma invoice can be printed and sent to a customer as many times as is necessary until an agreement is reached.{br}

Once all the necessary changes have been applied to the pro forma invoice, it can be approved and released. When you release the pro forma invoice, the system creates an Accounts Receivable invoice with all the information copied from the pro forma invoice. With this process, you minimize corrections in the Accounts Receivable module.{br}

Pro forma invoices provide the following capabilities:[anchor|#ul_sfp_r1d_pbb]
*On the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, you can define billing limit amounts for revenue budget lines of the project if the '''Use T&M Revenue Budget Limits''' check box is selected on the '''Summary''' tab of this form. The system applies these limit amounts to the pro forma invoices of the project. If an invoice exceeds a limit, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] form, the user receives a warning or an error message, depending on the '''Validate T&M Revenue Budget Limits''' setting on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form.
*You can configure an approval workflow for pro forma invoices that includes a sequence of approval steps based on a comprehensive approval map specified in the '''Pro Forma Approval Map''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] form.
*You can use different formats of printable pro forma invoices, depending on the particular project. On the '''Mailing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, you can specify a custom format and an email notification template that should be used for the printing and emailing of the pro forma invoices prepared for that project.
*:Also, in the '''Bill-to Contact''' and '''Bill-to Address''' sections of the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, you can specify the contact information of the customer to whom the pro forma invoices should be sent. This information is copied to each pro forma invoice created for the project and can be modified at the invoice level.
{br}{TOC}
==Creating a Pro Forma Invoice==
A pro forma invoice can be created only through the project billing process (and assigned a reference number only automatically). You cannot manually enter new pro forma invoices on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form. By default, the system creates a pro forma invoice when you bill a project because the '''Create Pro Forma on Billing''' check box is initially selected on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. To disable the draft invoice workflow for a project, you can clear this check box—that is, to prevent the system from creating a pro forma invoice when you bill the project.{br}

For a pro forma invoice created for a project, the system records to the following tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] form the lines to be billed:[anchor|#ul_udg_pwc_pbb]
*'''Progress Billing''': The system creates these lines by using the ''Progress Billing'' steps of billing rules specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form. The lines originate from the revenue budget of the project.
*'''Time and Material''' The system creates these lines by using the ''Time and Material'' steps of billing rules; the lines originate from the project transactions.
*:The ''Time and Material'' steps of billing rules support the aggregation of project transactions by date, employee, vendor, and inventory item. On the '''Time and Material''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] form, you can select a line and then click '''View Transactions Details''' on the table toolbar to drill down to the list of project transactions based on which the '''Billed Quantity''' and '''Billed Amount''' of the line have been calculated by the formula of the billing rule.

Fore more information about the billing process, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__con_Billing_Procedure|Project Billing].
==Modifying a Pro Forma Invoice==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form, you can edit a pro forma invoice when it is ''On Hold'', including the following:
*You can delete a line of the pro forma invoice to bill it later in the full amount.
*You can modify the pro forma invoice to bill any lines on the '''Progress Billing''' and '''Time and Material''' tabs in a greater or smaller amount by changing the '''Amount to Invoice''' as desired. The '''Amount to Invoice''' is added to the Accounts Receivable invoice when the pro forma invoice is released. 
*:On the '''Time and Material''' tab, if a manually edited '''Amount to Invoice''' is less than the '''Billed Amount''', you can make a decision about the difference between the calculated '''Billed Amount''' and the corrected '''Amount to Invoice''' by selecting the needed option in the '''Status''' column of the invoice line. The difference can be postponed until the next invoice (''Hold Remainder'') or written off by this invoice (''Write off Remainder''). The whole amount of the pro forma invoice line can also be written off (''Write off''); the amount will no longer show up in future invoices.
*:((({S:Warn}For a postponed amount to be added to a pro forma invoice, the Accounts Receivable invoice that contains the line from which this postponed amount originates must be released.
)))
*On the '''Time and Material''' tab, you can select a line and then click '''View Transactions Details''' on the table toolbar to drill down to the list of project transactions for which the '''Billed Quantity''' and '''Billed Amount''' have been calculated by the formula of the billing rule. These values are summed to obtain the '''Billed Quantity''' and '''Billed Amount''', respectively, of the pro forma invoice line. You can remove particular transactions from this list, and they will appear in the next invoice.
*You can rearrange lines within the invoice by dragging them to the appropriate positions. If billing limit amounts are defined for the project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, the system applies these limit amounts to the pro forma invoice lines as a running total, starting from the first line on the '''Time and Material''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] form. For each line of the invoice, the system subtracts the '''Amount to Invoice''' from the '''Max Available Amount''' and uses the reduced amount as the available limit for the next line. Invoice lines for which the '''Over Limit Amount''' becomes nonzero exceed the limit. By rearranging the lines, you can make the system apply the limit amounts to the needed lines of the invoice.
*You can add to a pro forma invoice an adjustment line that does not originate from the revenue budget or project transactions. Such lines are also included in the limit application and can decrease or increase the limit total.

==Releasing a Pro Forma Invoice==
The release of a pro forma invoice does not generate project transactions or General Ledger transactions directly. When you release the pro forma invoice, the system creates a corresponding Accounts Receivable invoice with all information copied from the pro forma invoice. You can release the pro forma invoices one by one on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form, or you can mass-process pro forma invoices to release them and produce Accounts Receivable invoices on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_50_60_00|Process Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM506000|PM506000]) form.{br}

The pro forma invoices of a project can be released according to the following rules:[anchor|#ul_knj_rnp_1bb]
*The pro forma invoices can be released only one by one, starting from the earliest one, on the '''Invoices''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. The only exception is when multiple pro forma invoices segregated by invoice group have been generated during a single iteration of the billing process; in this case, the pro forma invoices can be released in any order.
*A pro forma invoice can be released only after the Accounts Receivable invoice of the preceding pro forma invoice has been released.

If the '''Detail Total''' of a pro forma invoice is negative on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] form (for example, if you have added a negative adjustment line in an amount greater than the total amount of billable lines), the system creates an Accounts Receivable credit memo when the pro forma invoice is released.{br}

As a result of the release of the Accounts Receivable invoice, the General Ledger transactions are recorded, and the revenue budget of the corresponding project is changed as follows on '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form:[anchor|#ul_wcs_541_hbb]
*The '''Actual Quantity''' of the corresponding revenue budget line is increased by the line quantity of the released Accounts Receivable invoice if ''Task and Item'' is the '''Revenue Budget Level''' of the project; otherwise, the '''Actual Quantity''' is zero.
*The '''Actual Amount''' of the corresponding revenue budget line is increased by the line amount of the released Accounts Receivable invoice.
*The '''Draft Invoices Amount''' of the corresponding revenue budget line is decreased by the line amount of the released Accounts Receivable invoice.

The document details of an unreleased Accounts Receivable document that originates from a pro forma invoice are displayed in read-only mode on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form. To make a correction to the Accounts Receivable document, you need to delete this document and start over from the pro forma invoice.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] form, you can also navigate directly to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] form by using the '''View Pro Forma''' menu command and view the pro forma invoice from which the current Accounts Receivable document originates. This menu command becomes available on the '''Inquiries''' menu if the invoice being viewed has originated from a pro forma invoice.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Pro Forma Invoices  Acumatica ERP     provides draft (pro forma) invoice capabilities for project billing. A pro forma invoice, which     you can view on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form, is isolated from the     Accounts Receivable module. You can review and modify the billable transactions and amounts of     the pro forma invoice before you prepare the Accounts Receivable invoice that is based on this     pro forma invoice. A pro forma invoice can be printed and sent to a customer as many times as is     necessary until an agreement is reached. Once all the necessary changes have been applied to the pro forma invoice, it can be approved     and released. When you release the pro forma invoice, the system creates an Accounts Receivable     invoice with all the information copied from the pro forma invoice. With this process, you     minimize corrections in the Accounts Receivable module. Pro forma invoices provide the following capabilities: On the  Revenue Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects      (PM301000) form, you can define billing limit amounts for revenue budget lines of the project      if the  Use T&M Revenue Budget Limits  check box is selected on the        Summary  tab of this form. The system applies these limit amounts to the      pro forma invoices of the project. If an invoice exceeds a limit, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices form, the user receives a warning or an error message, depending on      the  Validate T&M Revenue Budget Limits  setting on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form. You can configure an approval workflow for pro forma invoices that includes a sequence of      approval steps based on a comprehensive approval map specified in the  Pro Forma       Approval Map  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences form. You can use different formats of printable pro forma invoices, depending on the particular      project. On the  Mailing Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, you can specify a custom format and an email notification      template that should be used for the printing and emailing of the pro forma invoices prepared      for that project. Also, in the  Bill-to Contact  and  Bill-to        Address  sections of the  Summary  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, you can specify the contact information of the customer to       whom the pro forma invoices should be sent. This information is copied to each pro forma       invoice created for the project and can be modified at the invoice level. Creating a Pro Forma Invoice A pro forma invoice can be created only through the project billing process (and assigned a     reference number only automatically). You cannot manually enter new pro forma invoices on the        ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form. By default, the system creates a pro forma     invoice when you bill a project because the  Create Pro Forma on Billing      check box is initially selected on the  Summary  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. To disable the draft invoice workflow for a     project, you can clear this check box—that is, to prevent the system from creating a pro forma     invoice when you bill the project. For a pro forma invoice created for a project, the system records to the following tabs of the        ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices form the lines to be billed: Progress Billing : The system creates these lines by using the        Progress Billing  steps of billing rules specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules (PM207000) form. The lines originate from the revenue budget of the project. Time and Material  The system creates these lines by using the  Time       and Material  steps of billing rules; the lines originate from the project       transactions. The  Time and Material  steps of billing rules support the aggregation of       project transactions by date, employee, vendor, and inventory item. On the  Time and        Material  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices form, you can select a line       and then click  View Transactions Details  on the table toolbar to drill       down to the list of project transactions based on which the  Billed        Quantity  and  Billed Amount  of the line have been       calculated by the formula of the billing rule. Fore more information about the billing process, see  Project Billing. Modifying a Pro Forma Invoice On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form, you can edit a pro forma invoice     when it is  On Hold , including the following: You can delete a line of the pro forma invoice to bill it later in the full amount. You can modify the pro forma invoice to bill any lines on the  Progress       Billing  and  Time and Material  tabs in a greater or smaller      amount by changing the  Amount to Invoice  as desired. The        Amount to Invoice  is added to the Accounts Receivable invoice when the      pro forma invoice is released.  On the  Time and Material  tab, if a       manually edited  Amount to Invoice  is less than the  Billed        Amount , you can make a decision about the difference between the calculated         Billed Amount  and the corrected  Amount to        Invoice  by selecting the needed option in the  Status        column of the invoice line. The difference can be postponed until the next invoice ( Hold        Remainder ) or written off by this invoice ( Write off Remainder ). The whole amount       of the pro forma invoice line can also be written off ( Write off ); the amount will no       longer show up in future invoices. For a postponed amount to be added to a pro forma       invoice, the Accounts Receivable invoice that contains the line from which this postponed       amount originates must be released. On the  Time and Material  tab, you can select a line and then click        View Transactions Details  on the table toolbar to drill down to the      list of project transactions for which the  Billed Quantity  and        Billed Amount  have been calculated by the formula of the billing rule.      These values are summed to obtain the  Billed Quantity  and        Billed Amount , respectively, of the pro forma invoice line. You can      remove particular transactions from this list, and they will appear in the next invoice. You can rearrange lines within the invoice by dragging them to the appropriate positions. If      billing limit amounts are defined for the project on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects      (PM301000) form, the system applies these limit amounts to the pro forma invoice lines as a      running total, starting from the first line on the  Time and Material  tab      of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices form. For each line of the invoice, the system subtracts      the  Amount to Invoice  from the  Max Available       Amount  and uses the reduced amount as the available limit for the next line.      Invoice lines for which the  Over Limit Amount  becomes nonzero exceed the      limit. By rearranging the lines, you can make the system apply the limit amounts to the needed      lines of the invoice. You can add to a pro forma invoice an adjustment line that does not originate from the      revenue budget or project transactions. Such lines are also included in the limit application      and can decrease or increase the limit total. Releasing a Pro Forma Invoice The release of a pro forma invoice does not generate project transactions or General Ledger     transactions directly. When you release the pro forma invoice, the system creates a     corresponding Accounts Receivable invoice with all information copied from the pro forma     invoice. You can release the pro forma invoices one by one on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form, or you can mass-process pro forma invoices to release them and produce     Accounts Receivable invoices on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM506000|PM506000]) Process Pro Forma Invoices (PM506000) form. The pro forma invoices of a project can be released according to the following rules: The pro forma invoices can be released only one by one, starting from the earliest one, on      the  Invoices  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000)      form. The only exception is when multiple pro forma invoices segregated by invoice group have      been generated during a single iteration of the billing process; in this case, the pro forma      invoices can be released in any order. A pro forma invoice can be released only after the Accounts Receivable invoice of the      preceding pro forma invoice has been released. If the  Detail Total  of a pro forma invoice is negative on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices form (for example, if you have added a negative adjustment line in an     amount greater than the total amount of billable lines), the system creates an Accounts     Receivable credit memo when the pro forma invoice is released. As a result of the release of the Accounts Receivable invoice, the General Ledger transactions     are recorded, and the revenue budget of the corresponding project is changed as follows on       Revenue Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form: The  Actual Quantity  of the corresponding revenue budget line is      increased by the line quantity of the released Accounts Receivable invoice if  Task and       Item  is the  Revenue Budget Level  of the project; otherwise, the        Actual Quantity  is zero. The  Actual Amount  of the corresponding revenue budget line is      increased by the line amount of the released Accounts Receivable invoice. The  Draft Invoices Amount  of the corresponding revenue budget line is      decreased by the line amount of the released Accounts Receivable invoice. The document details of an unreleased Accounts Receivable document that originates from a pro     forma invoice are displayed in read-only mode on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos     (AR301000) form. To make a correction to the Accounts Receivable document, you need to delete     this document and start over from the pro forma invoice. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos form, you can also navigate directly to the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices form by using the  View Pro Forma  menu command and view the pro     forma invoice from which the current Accounts Receivable document originates. This menu command     becomes available on the  Inquiries  menu if the invoice being viewed has     originated from a pro forma invoice. ]]></column>

If you need to bill customers for the services provided as a part of a project, you can generate invoices based on the information collected in Project Accounting. In Acumatica ERP, the billing procedure is available only for external projects—that is, for projects associated with customers. You can run the billing procedure automatically, manually, or on a schedule.{br}{TOC}
==Lesson Objectives==
You will learn how to:[anchor|#ul_nwj_gch_tbb]
*Update the progress of the project
*Bill the customer with a pro forma invoice
*Create an AR invoice based on the pro forma invoice
*Release the AR invoice with automatic updating of project actuals

==Applicable Scenarios==
You bill a project with progress billing if you need to bill the customer for the services provided as a part of a fixed-price project.
==Billing Procedure==
In Acumatica ERP, you perform project billing by using one of the following forms:[anchor|#ul_tg4_54c_bcb]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, you can run billing for the selected project by clicking '''Run Project Billing''' on the form toolbar. If the project is pending billing, the system creates an invoice with a date that is the same as the '''Next Billing Date''' of the project. For projects with the ''On Demand'' billing period, the date of the invoice is the business date.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_50_30_00|Run Project Billing] ([~/?ScreenId=PM503000|PM503000]) form, you can run billing for multiple projects that are pending billing, depending on the '''Invoice Date''' selected in the Summary area of the form. (By default, this box contains the business date.) The system creates invoices with a date that is the same as the '''Invoice Date'''.
*:((({S:Warn}The form does not show the projects with the '''Next Billing Date''', which is specified on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, later than the '''Invoice Date''', which is specified in the Selection area of the form.
)))

On both forms, the progress billing can be performed for only a project that is pending billing—that is, the project has at least one revenue budget line with a nonzero '''Pending Invoice Amount''' on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, including a negative amount.{br}

The billing procedure in Acumatica ERP is straightforward and depends on the type of a step of the billing rule, which is specified for a project task on the '''Tasks''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. For the ''Progress Billing'' steps of the billing rules of project tasks, the system generates an invoice with the billable project revenue, meaning the revenue budget lines with a nonzero '''Pending Invoice Amount''' listed on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form.{br}

For the billing process for a project to be run successfully, the project should meet the following criteria:[anchor|#ul_hhc_2m1_hbb]
*All the mandatory settings should be specified for the project and its tasks.
*The project status should be ''Active'', ''Completed'', or ''Suspended''.
*The status of the project tasks should be ''Active'' or ''Completed'', and the billing rule should be specified for these tasks.
*The project should have a provision for billing, such as a billable line of the revenue budget associated with the task for a progress billing, or an unbilled project transaction associated with the task within this billing period for a time and material billing.
*The steps of the billing rule should be applicable to the billing provisions. For example, the billing rule of a task that is supposed to be billed by a revenue budget line should have a ''Progress Billing'' step.

==Billing Rules==
For each project task, the billing process is defined by billing rules, which are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form. For each billing rule, you can create steps of the following types:[anchor|#ul_gdm_dcl_2bb]
*A single ''Progress Billing'' step to bill pending invoice amounts
*Multiple ''Time and Material'' steps to bill transactions by different account groups

In a single billing rule, you can mix these types of billing steps, as well as create separate billing rules for each type of step. A ''Progress Billing'' step of a billing rule has a variety of settings, including the following:[anchor|#ul_ccd_fzk_2bb]
*Formulas to define the description of the invoice and each invoice line, to make the system compose these descriptions dynamically during the billing process.
*The sources of the sales account and the destination branch for each invoice line.
*:The billing process uses the originating branch from the project settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form and the destination branches from the sources according to the billing rules. When an Accounts Receivable invoice is released, the Accounts Receivable account is updated under the originating branch of the invoice, while the revenue amounts are recorded to the destination branches of the invoice lines.
*The invoice group to make the system create separate invoices for particular steps with the similar invoice group during the project billing (either pro forma invoices or Accounts Receivable invoices, depending on the billing workflow of the project).
*:During the billing process, the system groups the billable amounts into invoices by the following:[anchor|#ul_wn4_122_pbb]
**The invoice group of the steps of the billing rules to which the project tasks refer
**The customer
**The customer location
**The '''Bill Separately''' setting of each project task defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form
[anchor|#section_rxl_kjw_1bb]
==Progress Billing==
Progress billing is a simple billing workflow for the projects that are gradually billed at a fixed contract amount. Progress billing does not involve project transactions, and the system uses ''Progress Billing'' steps of billing rules of the project tasks to process this billing. These billing rules are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form. The project setup and the billing workflow proceed as follows:[anchor|#ul_krj_rnp_1bb]
*A user adds a revenue budget line with a '''Revised Budgeted Amount''' to a project on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form.
*To provide a billable amount (for example, on a monthly basis), the user populates the '''Pending Invoice Amount''' or '''Completed (%)''' column on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab for the revenue budget lines to make the system calculate the '''Pending Invoice Amount''' as follows:
*:{{Pending Invoice Amount = Revised Budgeted Amount * ( Completed (%) / 100 ) - Draft Invoices Amount - Actual Amount}}
*The user runs the project billing process to create a pro forma invoice (or an accounts receivable invoice, depending on the selected workflow).
*The system creates an invoice with the amounts derived from the '''Pending Invoice Amount''' column of the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form for the revenue budget lines. The system updates the '''Draft Invoices Amount''' of the revenue budget lines with the '''Pending Invoice Amount''' and clears the '''Pending Invoice Amount'''.
*If the system creates a pro forma invoice (depending on the selected workflow), the invoice lines that are produced by the progress billing steps are displayed on the '''Progress Billing''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form.
((({S:Warn}[anchor|#ul_syj_rnp_1bb]
*If a project task uses a billing rule that has no ''Progress Billing'' step, when the value in the '''Completed (%)''' column is updated on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the system does not recalculate the '''Pending Invoice Amount''' column for the revenue budget line, and the system ignores any pending invoice amount of these lines during the billing process.
*The '''Actual Quantity''' on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form is always zero in the revenue budget lines that are billed only by progress billing.
*The '''Completed (%)''' of a revenue budget line on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form is updated only manually or recalculated when you adjust the '''Pending Invoice Amount''' of the line.
*:On the '''Progress Billing''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] form, if you manually adjust the '''Amount to Invoice''' of an invoice line, the system automatically recalculates the '''Total Completed (%)'''—the percentage of the revised budgeted amount of the revenue budget line of the project that has been invoiced by all the pro forma invoices of the project, including the current one. However, the system does not update the '''Completed (%)''' of the corresponding revenue budget line on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form accordingly.
*:Also, the '''Completed (%)''' of a revenue budget line on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form is not updated when a pro forma invoice with the corresponding progress billing line is deleted.

For each billing rule, you     can create steps of the following types: A single  Progress Billing  step to bill pending invoice amounts Multiple  Time and Material  steps to bill transactions by different account      groups In a single billing rule, you can mix these types of billing steps, as well as create separate     billing rules for each type of step. A  Progress Billing  step of a billing rule has a     variety of settings, including the following: Formulas to define the description of the invoice and each invoice line, to make the system      compose these descriptions dynamically during the billing process. The sources of the sales account and the destination branch for each invoice line. The       billing process uses the originating branch from the project settings on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form and the destination branches from the sources       according to the billing rules. When an Accounts Receivable invoice is released, the Accounts       Receivable account is updated under the originating branch of the invoice, while the revenue       amounts are recorded to the destination branches of the invoice lines. The invoice group to make the system create separate invoices for particular steps with the      similar invoice group during the project billing (either pro forma invoices or Accounts      Receivable invoices, depending on the billing workflow of the project). During the billing       process, the system groups the billable amounts into invoices by the following: The invoice group of the steps of the billing rules to which the project tasks refer The customer The customer location The  Bill Separately  setting of each project task defined on the            ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) Project Tasks (PM302000) form Progress Billing Progress billing is a simple billing workflow for the projects that are gradually billed at a     fixed contract amount. Progress billing does not involve project transactions, and the system     uses  Progress Billing  steps of billing rules of the project tasks to process this     billing. These billing rules are defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules     (PM207000) form. The project setup and the billing workflow proceed as follows: A user adds a revenue budget line with a  Revised Budgeted Amount  to a      project on the  Revenue Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects      (PM301000) form. To provide a billable amount (for example, on a monthly basis), the user populates the        Pending Invoice Amount  or  Completed (%)  column      on the  Revenue Budget  tab for the revenue budget lines to make the      system calculate the  Pending Invoice Amount  as        follows: Pending Invoice Amount = Revised Budgeted Amount * ( Completed (%) / 100 )        - Draft Invoices Amount - Actual Amount The user runs the project billing process to create a pro forma invoice (or an accounts      receivable invoice, depending on the selected workflow). The system creates an invoice with the amounts derived from the  Pending Invoice       Amount  column of the  Revenue Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form for the revenue budget lines. The system updates the        Draft Invoices Amount  of the revenue budget lines with the        Pending Invoice Amount  and clears the  Pending Invoice       Amount . If the system creates a pro forma invoice (depending on the selected workflow), the invoice      lines that are produced by the progress billing steps are displayed on the  Progress       Billing  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form. If a project task uses a billing rule that has no  Progress Billing  step, when the       value in the  Completed (%)  column is updated on the  Revenue        Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, the system does not       recalculate the  Pending Invoice Amount  column for the revenue budget       line, and the system ignores any pending invoice amount of these lines during the billing       process. The  Actual Quantity  on the  Revenue Budget  tab       of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form is always zero in the revenue budget lines that       are billed only by progress billing. The  Completed (%)  of a revenue budget line on the  Revenue        Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form is updated only manually       or recalculated when you adjust the  Pending Invoice Amount  of the        line. On the  Progress Billing  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices form, if you manually adjust the  Amount to         Invoice  of an invoice line, the system automatically recalculates the          Total Completed (%) —the percentage of the revised budgeted amount of        the revenue budget line of the project that has been invoiced by all the pro forma invoices        of the project, including the current one. However, the system does not update the          Completed (%)  of the corresponding revenue budget line on the          Revenue Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form        accordingly. Also, the  Completed (%)  of a revenue budget line on        the  Revenue Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form is        not updated when a pro forma invoice with the corresponding progress billing line is        deleted. ]]></column>

==Story==
Suppose that the HM&rsquo;s Bakery and Cafe customer has ordered 20 hours of new-employee training on operating juicers. The project accountant has created a project, and a consultant has provided five hours of the training. The project accountant needs to update the progress of the project and bill the customer. Acting as the project accountant, you need to update the progress on the project and bill the customer
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this lesson, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Project Accounting'' feature has been enabled to support the project accounting functionality.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, the ''HMBAKERY3'' project has been created.
==Process Overview==
To bill a progress billing project, you first review the applicable billing rule on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form. You then update the progress of the project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form and bill the project, which creates a pro forma invoice. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form, you review this pro forma invoice and release it, which causes the corresponding accounts receivable invoice to be created. You then review this accounts receivable invoice and release it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form.
==System Preparation==
To sign in to the system and prepare to perform the instructions of the activity, do the following:[anchor|#_6c9e4914-0e56-4fc0-9f9d-df880dcd99b6]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the U100 dataset preloaded as Pam Brawner by using the ''brawner'' login and the ''123'' password.[anchor|#_6c1ce27f-eaf2-432d-8813-806467714a08]
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select ''1/30/2020'' on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.

==Step 1: Reviewing a Billing Rule==
To review a billing rule used for progress billing, perform the following instructions:[anchor|#ol_qvk_dvs_sbb]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, open the ''PROGRESS'' billing rule. In the left pane, the billing rule has one step, which is selected by default.
#In the right pane, review the following settings of the step selected in the left pane:
#*'''Billing Type''': ''Progress Billing''
#*:For a billing rule, it does not make sense to create more than one step of the ''Progress Billing'' type.
#*'''Invoice Description Formula''': <tt>=&rsquo;Invoice for &rsquo;+&#91;PMProject.ContractCD&#93;</tt>
#*:The system uses this formula to define the description of the invoice created based on the billing rule. The {{PMProject.ContractCD}} data field stores the project identifier.
#*'''Line Description Formula''': <tt>=&#91;PMBudget.Description&#93;</tt>
#*The system uses this formula to define the description of the invoice line created based on the billing step. The {{PMBudget.Description}} data field stores the description of a project budget line.
#*'''Use Sales Account from''': ''Account Group''.
#*:The system uses as the sales account the default account of the account group of a revenue budget line of a project.
#*'''Create Lines with Zero Amount''': Cleared

You have reviewed the billing rule for progress billing. In the next step, you will bill a project that using this billing rule.
==Step 2: Billing the Project==
To update the progress of project completion, and bill the project in an amount corresponding to the progress, do the following:[anchor|#_07d9640b-ec86-4581-a97e-fc752f52e48f]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''HMBAKERY3'' project, and do the following:
#*On the '''Summary''' tab ('''Billing and Allocation Settings''' section), notice that the ''PROGRESS'' billing rule has been specified for the project.
#*On the '''Tasks''' tab, notice that the ''PROGRESS'' billing rule has been specified for the ''TRAINING'' project task.
#On the '''Revenue Budget''' tab, specify <tt>25.00</tt> as the '''Completed (%)''' of the revenue budget line. That is, 25% of the project has been completed.
#:Notice that the system automatically calculates the '''Pending Invoice Amount''' of the row by using the following formula:
#:{{Pending Invoice Amount = Revised Budgeted Amount * Completed (%) / 100 - (Actual Amount + Draft Invoices Amount)}}
#Save your changes to the project, and on the form toolbar, click '''Run Project Billing'''.
#:The system creates a pro forma invoice and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form.
#On the '''Progress Billing''' tab, review the invoice line, which has been created using the billing rule specified for the project task and based on the revenue budget line of the project that has a nonzero '''Pending Invoice Amount''' on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, open the ''HMBAKERY3'' project, and on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab, notice that the '''Pending Invoice Amount''' has been moved to the '''Draft Invoices Amount''' for the row (which in this case is the amount on pro forma invoices), and now the '''Pending Invoice Amount''' is zero.
#On the '''Invoices''' tab, click the link in the '''Pro Forma Reference Nbr.''' column to open the pro forma invoice you have just created.
#In the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] form, which the system has opened in a pop-up window, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and on the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the pro forma invoice.
#:In the Summary area, notice that the system has assigned the ''Closed'' status to the pro forma invoice. The system has also created the accounts receivable invoice based on the pro forma invoice.
#On the '''Financial Details''' tab, click the link in the '''AR Ref. Nbr.''' box to open the accounts receivable invoice that has been created.
#On the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form, which the system has opened in a pop-up window, notice that you cannot edit the document details. (You can edit only the corresponding pro forma invoice.)
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and on the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the accounts receivable invoice.
#On the '''Financial Details''' tab, click the link in the '''Batch Nbr.''' box to open the corresponding batch of general ledger transactions that has been created.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_30_10_00|Journal Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=GL301000|GL301000]) form, which the system has opened in a pop-up window, review the batch of general ledger transactions that correspond to the released accounts receivable invoice.
#Close the pop-up windows.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_10_00|Project Transaction Details] ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) form, in the Summary area, select ''HMBAKERY3'' as the '''Project''', and in the table, review the project transaction that has been created based on the released accounts receivable invoice. Notice that the number of the corresponding batch of general ledger transactions, which you have just reviewed, is shown in the '''GL Batch Nbr.''' column.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, open the ''HMBAKERY3'' project, and do the following:
#*On the '''Revenue Budget''' tab, notice that the '''Draft Invoices Amount''' has been moved to the '''Actual Amount''' for the row, and now the '''Draft Invoices Amount''' is zero (see the following screenshot).
#*On the '''Balances''' tab, review the project balance.

Step 2: Billing the Project To update the progress of project completion, and bill the project in an amount                 corresponding to the progress, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, open the                          HMBAKERY3  project, and do the following: On the  Summary  tab ( Billing and                                 Allocation Settings  section), notice that the                                  PROGRESS  billing rule has been specified for the                             project. On the  Tasks  tab, notice that the  PROGRESS                              billing rule has been specified for the  TRAINING  project                             task. On the  Revenue Budget  tab, specify                          25.00  as the  Completed (%)  of                     the revenue budget line. That is, 25% of the project has been                         completed. Notice that the system automatically calculates the                              Pending Invoice Amount  of the row by using the                         following formula: Pending Invoice Amount = Revised Budgeted                             Amount * Completed (%) / 100 - (Actual Amount + Draft Invoices                             Amount) Save your changes to the project, and on the form toolbar, click  Run                         Project Billing . The system creates a pro forma invoice and                         opens it on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form. On the  Progress Billing  tab, review the invoice line,                     which has been created using the billing rule specified for the project task and                     based on the revenue budget line of the project that has a nonzero                          Pending Invoice Amount  on the  Revenue                         Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form.

In Acumatica ERP, you can bill customers based on costs captured on projects with project transactions. The billing procedure is available only for external projects—that is, for projects associated with customers. You can run the billing procedure automatically, manually, or on a schedule.{br}{TOC}
==Lesson Objectives==
You will learn how to:[anchor|#_0a40ef21-458b-4b9f-91a3-e6474774aa0d]
*Review project transactions that affect the project budget
*Bill the customer with a pro forma invoice
*Create an AR invoice based on the pro forma invoice
*Release the AR invoice with automatic updating of project actuals

==Applicable Scenarios==
You bill a project with time and material billing if you need to bill the customer based on the project transactions.
==Billing Procedure==
In Acumatica ERP, you perform time and material billing by using one of the following forms:[anchor|#ul_tg4_54c_bcb]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, you can run billing for the selected project by clicking '''Run Project Billing''' on the form toolbar. If the project is pending billing, the system creates an invoice with a date that is the same as the '''Next Billing Date''' of the project. For projects with the ''On Demand'' billing period, the date of the invoice is the business date.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_50_30_00|Run Project Billing] ([~/?ScreenId=PM503000|PM503000]) form, you can run billing for multiple projects that are pending billing, depending on the '''Invoice Date''' selected in the Summary area of the form. (By default, this box contains the business date.) The system creates invoices with a date that is the same as the '''Invoice Date'''.
*:((({S:Warn}The form does not show the projects with the '''Next Billing Date''', which is specified on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, is later than the '''Invoice Date''', which in specified in the Selection area of the form.
)))

On both forms, the time and material billing can be performed for only a project that is pending billing—that is, the project has at least one unbilled transaction that is ready to be billed on the invoice date—that is, the date of the transaction is not later than the invoice date.{br}

The invoice date is the date of the invoice that the system creates during the billing. The invoice date depends on the form where you run billing as follows:[anchor|#ul_d22_lqc_bcb]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the invoice date is the '''Next Billing Date''', which is specified on the '''Summary''' tab, for all the projects except those that are billed on demand.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the invoice date is the business date for all the projects for which the '''Billing Period''', which is specified on the '''Summary''' tab, is ''On Demand''.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_50_30_00|Run Project Billing] form, the invoice date is the '''Invoice Date''', which in specified in the Selection area of the form.

Whether the system uses or not the transactions with the date is equal to the invoice date depends on the '''Billing Cut-off Date''' setting on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form as follows:[anchor|#ul_grh_2qc_bcb]
*''Include Trans. created on billing date'': With this setting, the unbilled transaction is ready to be billed if its date is earlier than or the same as the invoice date.
*''Exclude Trans. created on billing date'': With this setting, the unbilled transaction is ready to be billed if its date is earlier than the invoice date.

The billing procedure in Acumatica ERP is straightforward and depends on the type of a step of the billing rule, which is specified for a project task on the '''Tasks''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. For the ''Time and Material'' steps of the billing rules of project tasks, the system selects all the outstanding allocated project transactions and generates an invoice for the customer based on these transactions and according to the billing rule.{br}

For the billing process for a project to be run successfully, the project should meet the following criteria:[anchor|#ul_hhc_2m1_hbb]
*All the mandatory settings should be specified for the project and its tasks.
*The project status should be ''Active'', ''Completed'', or ''Suspended''.
*The status of the project tasks should be ''Active'' or ''Completed'', and the billing rule should be specified for these tasks.
*The project should have a provision for billing, such as a billable line of the revenue budget associated with the task for a progress billing, or an unbilled project transaction associated with the task within this billing period for a time and material billing.
*The steps of the billing rule should be applicable to the billing provisions. For example, the billing rule of a task that is supposed to be billed by a cost budget line should have a ''Time and Material'' step.

==Billing Rules==
For each project task, the billing process is defined by billing rules, which are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form. For each billing rule, you can create steps of the following types:[anchor|#ul_gdm_dcl_2bb]
*A single ''Progress Billing'' step to bill pending invoice amounts
*Multiple ''Time and Material'' steps to bill transactions by different account groups

In a single billing rule, you can mix these types of billing steps, as well as create separate billing rules for each type of step. A ''Time and Material'' step of a billing rule has a variety of settings, including the following:[anchor|#ul_ccd_fzk_2bb]
*The account group that is used as a filter to select the transactions for billing by the ''Time and Material'' billing steps. The system selects all the transactions that are due for billing when the billing procedure is run. Normally, you use for billing the same account group or groups that you use for accumulating the unrecognized revenue. By running billing for these account groups, you recognize the revenue.
*Formulas to define the description of the invoice and each invoice line, to make the system compose these descriptions dynamically during the billing process.
*Formulas to calculate the amount and quantity of the invoice lines created by the ''Time and Material'' billing steps. In these formulas, you can use fields and attributes from such entities as the project, project budget, project task, project transaction, customer, vendor, employee, inventory item, and account group. You can also use different sources of the project rates: those from the rate tables that can be configured on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_60_00|Rate Tables] ([~/?ScreenId=PM206000|PM206000]) form, and those from sales price lists that are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form.
*The sources of the sales account and the destination branch for each invoice line.
*:The billing process uses the originating branch from the project settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form and the destination branches from the sources according to the billing rules. When an Accounts Receivable invoice is released, the Accounts Receivable account is updated under the originating branch of the invoice, while the revenue amounts are recorded to the destination branches of the invoice lines.
*The invoice group to make the system create separate invoices for particular steps with the similar invoice group during the project billing (either pro forma invoices or Accounts Receivable invoices, depending on the billing workflow of the project).
*:During the billing process, the system groups the billable amounts into invoices by the following:[anchor|#ul_wn4_122_pbb]
**The invoice group of the steps of the billing rules to which the project tasks refer
**The customer
**The customer location
**The '''Bill Separately''' setting of each project task defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form
*Non-billable transactions that do not contribute to the amount billed to the customer and that you may decide to include in the invoice.
*Grouping criteria by date, employee, vendor, and inventory item for the invoice lines created by the ''Time and Material'' billing steps.
[anchor|#section_hpm_c4w_1bb]
==Transaction-Based Billing==
This billing workflow is provided for projects that are billed based on project transactions. The system uses the ''Time and Material'' steps of the billing rules of the project tasks to process this billing. A billing rule may have a number of ''Time and Material'' steps for different account groups of transactions that should be used to determine the invoiced amounts by different formulas. The time and material billing can be executed right after the project transactions that match the selection criteria have been provisioned in the system. The allocation process can be executed before billing, if necessary.{br}

The project setup and billing workflow proceeds as follows:[anchor|#ul_sck_rnp_1bb]
*The user runs the project billing process to create a pro forma invoice (or an Accounts Receivable invoice, depending on the selected workflow).
*The system creates the invoice based on the unbilled project transactions with amounts calculated by the billing rules of the project tasks.
*:The system considers in the billing the transactions with a date that is earlier than the billing date and does not consider the transactions with the date that is later than the billing date. The transactions with a date on the billing date are billed if ''Include Trans. created on billing date'' is selected as the '''Billing Cut-off Date''' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form.
*If the system creates a pro forma invoice, the invoice lines that are produced by the ''Time and Material'' billing steps are displayed on the '''Time and Material''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form.

If the      project is pending billing, the system creates an invoice with a date that is the same as the        Next Billing Date  of the project. For projects with the  On       Demand  billing period, the date of the invoice is the business date. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM503000|PM503000]) Run Project Billing (PM503000) form, you can run billing      for multiple projects that are pending billing, depending on the  Invoice       Date  selected in the Summary area of the form. (By default, this box contains the      business date.) The system creates invoices with a date that is the same as the        Invoice Date . The form does not show the projects with the         Next Billing Date , which is specified on the         Summary  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, is later than       the  Invoice Date , which in specified in the Selection area of the       form. On both forms, the time and material billing can be performed for only a project that is     pending billing—that is, the project has at least one unbilled transaction that is ready to be     billed on the invoice date—that is, the date of the transaction is not later than the invoice     date. The invoice date is the date of the invoice that the system creates during the billing. The     invoice date depends on the form where you run billing as follows: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, the invoice date is the  Next Billing       Date , which is specified on the  Summary  tab, for all the      projects except those that are billed on demand. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, the invoice date is the business date for all      the projects for which the  Billing Period , which is specified on the        Summary  tab, is  On Demand . On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM503000|PM503000]) Run Project Billing form, the invoice date is the        Invoice Date , which in specified in the Selection area of the      form. Whether the system uses or not the transactions with the date is equal to the invoice date     depends on the  Billing Cut-off Date  setting on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form as follows: Include Trans. created on billing date : With this setting, the unbilled transaction      is ready to be billed if its date is earlier than or the same as the invoice date. Exclude Trans. created on billing date : With this setting, the unbilled transaction      is ready to be billed if its date is earlier than the invoice date. The billing procedure in  Acumatica ERP     is straightforward and depends on the type of a step of the billing rule, which is specified for     a project task on the  Tasks  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects     form. For the  Time and Material  steps of the billing rules of project tasks, the system     selects all the outstanding allocated project transactions and generates an invoice for the     customer based on these transactions and according to the billing rule. For the billing process for a project to be run successfully, the project should meet the     following criteria: All the mandatory settings should be specified for the project and its tasks. The project status should be  Active ,  Completed , or  Suspended . The status of the project tasks should be  Active  or  Completed , and the billing      rule should be specified for these tasks. The project should have a provision for billing, such as a billable line of the revenue      budget associated with the task for a progress billing, or an unbilled project transaction      associated with the task within this billing period for a time and material billing. The steps of the billing rule should be applicable to the billing provisions. For example,      the billing rule of a task that is supposed to be billed by a cost budget line should have a        Time and Material  step. Billing Rules For each project task, the billing process is defined by billing rules, which are defined on     the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules (PM207000) form. For each billing rule, you     can create steps of the following types: A single  Progress Billing  step to bill pending invoice amounts Multiple  Time and Material  steps to bill transactions by different account      groups In a single billing rule, you can mix these types of billing steps, as well as create separate     billing rules for each type of step. A  Time and Material  step of a billing rule has a     variety of settings, including the following: The account group that is used as a filter to select the transactions for billing by the        Time and Material  billing steps. The system selects all the transactions that are due      for billing when the billing procedure is run. Normally, you use for billing the same account      group or groups that you use for accumulating the unrecognized revenue. By running billing for      these account groups, you recognize the revenue. Formulas to define the description of the invoice and each invoice line, to make the system      compose these descriptions dynamically during the billing process. Formulas to calculate the amount and quantity of the invoice lines created by the  Time       and Material  billing steps. In these formulas, you can use fields and attributes from such      entities as the project, project budget, project task, project transaction, customer, vendor,      employee, inventory item, and account group. You can also use different sources of the project      rates: those from the rate tables that can be configured on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM206000|PM206000]) Rate Tables      (PM206000) form, and those from sales price lists that are defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) Sales Prices (AR202000) form. The sources of the sales account and the destination branch for each invoice line. The       billing process uses the originating branch from the project settings on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form and the destination branches from the sources       according to the billing rules. When an Accounts Receivable invoice is released, the Accounts       Receivable account is updated under the originating branch of the invoice, while the revenue       amounts are recorded to the destination branches of the invoice lines. The invoice group to make the system create separate invoices for particular steps with the      similar invoice group during the project billing (either pro forma invoices or Accounts      Receivable invoices, depending on the billing workflow of the project). During the billing       process, the system groups the billable amounts into invoices by the following: The invoice group of the steps of the billing rules to which the project tasks refer The customer The customer location The  Bill Separately  setting of each project task defined on the            ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) Project Tasks (PM302000) form Non-billable transactions that do not contribute to the amount billed to the customer and      that you may decide to include in the invoice. Grouping criteria by date, employee, vendor, and inventory item for the invoice lines      created by the  Time and Material  billing steps. Transaction-Based Billing This billing workflow is provided for projects that are billed based on project transactions.     The system uses the  Time and Material  steps of the billing rules of the project tasks to     process this billing. A billing rule may have a number of  Time and Material  steps for     different account groups of transactions that should be used to determine the invoiced amounts     by different formulas. The time and material billing can be executed right after the project     transactions that match the selection criteria have been provisioned in the system. The     allocation process can be executed before billing, if necessary. The project setup and billing workflow proceeds as follows: The user runs the project billing process to create a pro forma invoice (or an Accounts      Receivable invoice, depending on the selected workflow). The system creates the invoice based on the unbilled project transactions with amounts      calculated by the billing rules of the project tasks. The system considers in the billing the       transactions with a date that is earlier than the billing date and does not consider the       transactions with the date that is later than the billing date. The transactions with a date       on the billing date are billed if  Include Trans. created on billing date  is selected as       the  Billing Cut-off Date  on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form. If the system creates a pro forma invoice, the invoice lines that are produced by the        Time and Material  billing steps are displayed on the  Time and       Material  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form. ]]></column>

==Story==
Suppose that the HM&rsquo;s Bakery and Cafe customer has ordered a juicer, along with the services of installation and employee training on operating the juicer. The project accountant has created the project. The juicer has been delivered and installed, and a consultant has provided the training. As the project accountant, you need to bill the customer for materials and logged work time. 
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this lesson, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Project Accounting'' feature has been enabled to support the project accounting functionality.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, the ''HMBAKERY4'' project has been created.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) form, the ''PM00000007'' batch of project transactions related to the project has been created and released.
==Process Overview==
To bill a time and material project, you first review the applicable billing rule on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form. You bill the project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, which creates a pro forma invoice. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form, you review this pro forma invoice and release it, which causes the corresponding accounts receivable invoice to be created. You then review this accounts receivable invoice and release it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form.
==System Preparation==
To sign in to the system and prepare to perform the instructions of the activity, do the following:[anchor|#_6c9e4914-0e56-4fc0-9f9d-df880dcd99b6]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the U100 dataset preloaded as Pam Brawner by using the ''brawner'' login and the ''123'' password.[anchor|#_044dac1b-7118-4693-a4a3-85a5842d45d2]
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select ''1/30/2020'' on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.

==Step 1: Billing the Project==
To bill the project, do the following:[anchor|#_9f696cdd-e903-4dd0-aac2-7488eef7a7e2]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, open the ''TM'' billing rule, and review the settings of the rule.
#:Notice that the billing rule has three steps in the left pane. The billing type of each step is ''Time and Material''. Each step is used to process project transactions related to an account group. The invoiced amount is determined by the '''Line Amount Formula''' formula, which is the same for each step, and calculated as the amount of a project transaction multiplied by 1.25.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_10_00|Project Transaction Details] ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) form, in the Summary area, select ''HMBAKERY4'' as the '''Project''', and in the table, review the project transactions. Notice that the '''Billed''' check box is cleared for the transactions, which means the transactions have not been billed yet.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''HMBAKERY4'' project, and do the following:
#*On the '''Summary''' tab ('''Billing and Allocation Settings''' section), notice that the ''TM'' billing rule has been specified for the project.
#*On the '''Tasks''' tab, notice that the ''TM'' billing rule has been specified for all of the project tasks.
#*On the '''Cost Budget''' tab, review the cost budget of the project. For each cost budget line, do the following:
#*#Click the line.
#*#On the table toolbar, click '''View Transactions'''.
#*#Review the transactions that correspond to the selected line on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_10_00|Project Transaction Details] form, which opens in a pop-up window.
#*#Close the pop-up window.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Run Project Billing'''.
#:The system creates a pro forma invoice and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form.
#On the '''Time and Material''' tab, review the invoice lines that the system has created, based on the transactions prepared for billing, by using the billing rule specified for the project tasks. For each invoice line, do the following:
##Click the line.
##On the table toolbar, click '''View Transaction Details'''.
##Review the transactions that correspond to the selected line in the '''Transaction Details''' dialog box, which opens in a pop-up window.
##Close the pop-up window.
#:Notice that the line with the ''INSTALL'' inventory item has been created based on two transactions.
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and on the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the pro forma invoice.
#:In the Summary area, notice that the system has assigned the ''Closed'' status to the pro forma invoice. The system has also created the accounts receivable invoice based on the pro forma invoice.
#On the '''Financial Details''' tab, click the link in the '''AR Ref. Nbr.''' box to open the accounts receivable invoice that was created.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]), which the system has opened in a pop-up window, notice that you cannot edit the document details. (You can edit only the corresponding pro forma invoice.)
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and on the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the accounts receivable invoice.
#On the '''Financial Details''' tab, click the link in the '''Batch Nbr.''' box to open the corresponding batch of general ledger transactions that has been created.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_30_10_00|Journal Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=GL301000|GL301000]) form, which the system has opened in a pop-up window, review the batch of general ledger transactions that correspond to the released accounts receivable invoice.
#Close the pop-up windows.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_10_00|Project Transaction Details] ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) form, in the Summary area, select ''HMBAKERY4'' as the '''Project''', and in the table, review the project transaction that has been created based on the released accounts receivable invoice. Notice that the number of the corresponding batch of general ledger transactions, which you have just reviewed, is shown in the '''GL Batch Nbr.''' column. Also notice that the transactions that was used for billing is now marked as billed—that is, the check box in the '''Billed''' column is selected.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, open the ''HMBAKERY4'' project, and do the following:
#*On the '''Revenue Budget''' tab, notice that the system has automatically created revenue budget lines and filled in the '''Actual Amount''' for the rows.
#*On the '''Balances''' tab (see the following screenshot), review the project balances.

If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and             select  1/30/2020 on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and             process all documents in the system during this business date. Step 1: Billing the Project To bill the project, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules (PM207000) form, open the  TM                      billing rule, and review the settings of the rule. Notice that the billing                         rule has three steps in the left pane. The billing type of each step is                              Time and Material . Each step is used to process project                         transactions related to an account group. The invoiced amount is determined                         by the  Line Amount Formula  formula, which is the same                         for each step, and calculated as the amount of a project transaction                         multiplied by 1.25. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) Project Transaction Details (PM401000) form, in the Summary area,                     select  HMBAKERY4  as the  Project , and in the table,                     review the project transactions. Notice that the  Billed                      check box is cleared for the transactions, which means the transactions have not                     been billed yet. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, open the                          HMBAKERY4  project, and do the following: On the  Summary  tab ( Billing and                                 Allocation Settings  section), notice that the  TM                              billing rule has been specified for the project. On the  Tasks  tab, notice that the  TM                              billing rule has been specified for all of the project tasks. On the  Cost Budget  tab, review the cost budget of                             the project. For each cost budget line, do the following: Click the line. On the table toolbar, click  View                                         Transactions . Review the transactions that correspond to the selected line on                                     the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) Project Transaction Details form, which opens in a                                     pop-up window. Close the pop-up window. On the form toolbar, click  Run Project Billing . The                         system creates a pro forma invoice and opens it on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form. On the  Time and Material  tab, review the invoice lines                     that the system has created, based on the transactions prepared for billing, by                     using the billing rule specified for the project tasks. For each invoice line,                     do the following: Click the line. On the table toolbar, click  View Transaction                                 Details . Review the transactions that correspond to the selected line in the                                  Transaction Details  dialog box, which opens                             in a pop-up window. Close the pop-up window. Notice that the line with the  INSTALL  inventory item has been                         created based on two transactions. In the Summary area, clear the  Hold  check box, and on the                     form toolbar, click  Release  to release the pro forma                         invoice. In the Summary area, notice that the system has assigned the                              Closed  status to the pro forma invoice. The system has also                         created the accounts receivable invoice based on the pro forma                     invoice. On the  Financial Details  tab, click the link in the                          AR Ref. Nbr.  box to open the accounts receivable                     invoice that was created. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000), which the system has opened                     in a pop-up window, notice that you cannot edit the document details. (You can                     edit only the corresponding pro forma invoice.) In the Summary area, clear the  Hold  check box, and on the                     form toolbar, click  Release  to release the accounts                     receivable invoice. On the  Financial Details  tab, click the link in the                          Batch Nbr.  box to open the corresponding batch of                     general ledger transactions that has been created. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL301000|GL301000]) Journal Transactions (GL301000) form, which the system has                     opened in a pop-up window, review the batch of general ledger transactions that                     correspond to the released accounts receivable invoice. Close the pop-up windows. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) Project Transaction Details (PM401000) form, in the Summary area,                     select  HMBAKERY4  as the  Project , and in the table,                     review the project transaction that has been created based on the released                     accounts receivable invoice. Notice that the number of the corresponding batch                     of general ledger transactions, which you have just reviewed, is shown in the                          GL Batch Nbr.  column. Also notice that the                     transactions that was used for billing is now marked as billed—that is, the                     check box in the  Billed  column is selected. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, open the  HMBAKERY4  project,                     and do the following: On the  Revenue Budget  tab, notice that the system                             has automatically created revenue budget lines and filled in the                                  Actual Amount  for the rows. On the  Balances  tab (see the following                             screenshot), review the project balances. The project balances ]]></column>

 Acumatica ERP provides draft (pro forma) invoice capabilities for project billing. A pro forma invoice, which you can view on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form, is isolated from the accounts receivable. You can review and modify the billable transactions and amounts of the pro forma invoice before you prepare the accounts receivable invoice that is based on this pro forma invoice. A pro forma invoice can be printed and sent to a customer as many times as is necessary until an agreement is reached.{br}

Once all the necessary changes have been applied to the pro forma invoice, it can be approved and released. When you release the pro forma invoice, the system creates an Accounts Receivable invoice with all the information copied from the pro forma invoice. With this process, you minimize corrections in the Accounts Receivable module.{br}{TOC}
==Lesson Objectives==
You will learn how to:[anchor|#ul_nwj_gch_tbb]
*Enable creating a pro forma invoice for a project
*Create a pro forma invoice
*Print the pro forma invoice
*Send the pro forma invoice as an email
*Approve the pro forma invoice

==Applicable Scenarios==
You create a pro forma invoice for a project if you need to agree the invoice with the customer. You modify the pro forma invoice as many times as it is necessary until an agreement is reached, and then prepare the AR invoice based on this pro forma invoice.
==Creating a Pro Forma Invoice==
A pro forma invoice can be created only through the project billing process (and assigned a reference number only automatically). You cannot manually enter new pro forma invoices on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form. By default, the system creates a pro forma invoice when you bill a project because the '''Create Pro Forma on Billing''' check box is initially selected on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. To disable the draft invoice workflow for a project, you can clear this check box—that is, to prevent the system from creating a pro forma invoice when you bill the project.{br}

For a pro forma invoice created for a project, the system records to the following tabs of the Pro Forma Invoices form the lines to be billed:[anchor|#ul_udg_pwc_pbb]
*'''Progress Billing''': The system creates these lines by using the ''Progress Billing'' steps of billing rules; the lines originate from the revenue budget of the project.
*'''Time and Material''' The system creates these lines by using the ''Time and Material'' steps of billing rules; the lines originate from the project transactions.
*:The ''Time and Material'' steps of billing rules support the aggregation of project transactions by date, employee, vendor, and inventory item. On the '''Time and Material''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] form, you can select a line and then click '''View Transactions Details''' on the table toolbar to drill down to the list of project transactions based on which the '''Billed Quantity''' and '''Billed Amount''' of the line have been calculated by the formula of the billing rule.

==Releasing a Pro Forma Invoice==
The release of a pro forma invoice does not generate project transactions or General Ledger transactions directly. When you release the pro forma invoice, the system creates a corresponding Accounts Receivable invoice with all information copied from the pro forma invoice. You can release the pro forma invoices one by one on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form, or you can mass-process pro forma invoices to release them and produce Accounts Receivable invoices on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_50_60_00|Process Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM506000|PM506000]) form.{br}

The pro forma invoices of a project can be released according to the following rules:[anchor|#ul_knj_rnp_1bb]
*The pro forma invoices can be released only one by one, starting from the earliest one, on the '''Invoices''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. The only exception is when multiple pro forma invoices segregated by invoice group have been generated during a single iteration of the billing process; in this case, the pro forma invoices can be released in any order.
*A pro forma invoice can be released only after the accounts receivable invoice of the preceding pro forma invoice has been released.

As a result of the release of the Accounts Receivable invoice, the General Ledger transactions are recorded, and the revenue budget of the corresponding project is changed as follows on '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form:[anchor|#ul_wcs_541_hbb]
*The '''Actual Quantity''' of the corresponding revenue budget line is increased by the line quantity of the released Accounts Receivable invoice if ''Task and Item'' is the '''Revenue Budget Level''' of the project; otherwise, the '''Actual Quantity''' is zero.
*The '''Actual Amount''' of the corresponding revenue budget line is increased by the line amount of the released Accounts Receivable invoice.
*The '''Draft Invoices Amount''' of the corresponding revenue budget line is decreased by the line amount of the released Accounts Receivable invoice.

The document details of an unreleased Accounts Receivable document that originates from a pro forma invoice are displayed in read-only mode on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form. To make a correction to the Accounts Receivable document, you need to delete this document and start over from the pro forma invoice.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, you can also navigate directly to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] form by using the '''View Pro Forma''' menu command and view the pro forma invoice from which the current accounts receivable document originates. This menu command becomes available on the '''Inquiries''' menu if the invoice being viewed has originated from a pro forma invoice.]]></column>

The pro forma invoices of a project can be released according to the following rules: The pro forma invoices can be released only one by one, starting from the earliest one,           on the  Invoices  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects           (PM301000) form. The only exception is when multiple pro forma invoices segregated by           invoice group have been generated during a single iteration of the billing process; in           this case, the pro forma invoices can be released in any order. A pro forma invoice can be released only after the accounts receivable invoice of the           preceding pro forma invoice has been released. As a result of the release of the Accounts Receivable invoice, the General Ledger         transactions are recorded, and the revenue budget of the corresponding project is changed as         follows on  Revenue Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects         form: The  Actual Quantity  of the corresponding revenue budget line is           increased by the line quantity of the released Accounts Receivable invoice if  Task and             Item  is the  Revenue Budget Level  of the project; otherwise,           the  Actual Quantity  is zero. The  Actual Amount  of the corresponding revenue budget line is           increased by the line amount of the released Accounts Receivable invoice. The  Draft Invoices Amount  of the corresponding revenue budget           line is decreased by the line amount of the released Accounts Receivable invoice. The document details of an unreleased Accounts Receivable document that originates from a         pro forma invoice are displayed in read-only mode on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos         (AR301000) form. To make a correction to the Accounts Receivable document, you need to         delete this document and start over from the pro forma invoice. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, you can also navigate directly to the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices form by using the  View Pro Forma  menu command and view         the pro forma invoice from which the current accounts receivable document originates. This         menu command becomes available on the  Inquiries  menu if the invoice         being viewed has originated from a pro forma invoice. ]]></column>

 Acumatica ERP provides draft (pro forma) invoice capabilities for project billing. A pro forma invoice, which you can view on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form, is isolated from accounts receivable. You can review and modify the billable transactions and amounts of the pro forma invoice before you prepare the AR invoice that is based on this pro forma invoice. A pro forma invoice can be printed and sent to a customer as many times as is necessary until an agreement is reached.{br}

Once all the necessary changes have been applied to the pro forma invoice, it can be approved and released. When you release the pro forma invoice, the system creates an accounts receivable invoice with all the information copied from the pro forma invoice. With this process, you minimize corrections in the Accounts Receivable module.{br}{TOC}
==Lesson Objectives==
You will learn how to:[anchor|#ul_k5h_z41_1cb]
*Add to the pro forma invoice an extra adjustment line that does not originate from project transactions
*Postpone the billing of a pro forma invoice line
*Write off a pro forma invoice line

==Applicable Scenarios==
You create a pro forma invoice for a project if you need to agree the invoice with the customer. You modify the pro forma invoice as many times as it is necessary until an agreement is reached, and then prepare the AR invoice based on this pro forma invoice.
==Creating a Pro Forma Invoice==
A pro forma invoice can be created only through the project billing process (and assigned a reference number only automatically). You cannot manually enter new pro forma invoices on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form. By default, the system creates a pro forma invoice when you bill a project because the '''Create Pro Forma on Billing''' check box is initially selected on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. To disable the draft invoice workflow for a project, you can clear this check box—that is, to prevent the system from creating a pro forma invoice when you bill the project.{br}

For a pro forma invoice created for a project, the system records to the following tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] form the lines to be billed:[anchor|#ul_udg_pwc_pbb]
*'''Progress Billing''': The system creates these lines by using the ''Progress Billing'' steps of billing rules specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form. The lines originate from the revenue budget of the project.
*'''Time and Material''' The system creates these lines by using the ''Time and Material'' steps of billing rules; the lines originate from the project transactions.
*:The ''Time and Material'' steps of billing rules support the aggregation of project transactions by date, employee, vendor, and inventory item. On the '''Time and Material''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] form, you can select a line and then click '''View Transaction Details''' on the table toolbar to drill down to the list of project transactions based on which the '''Billed Quantity''' and '''Billed Amount''' of the line have been calculated by the formula of the billing rule.

Fore more information about the billing process, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__con_Billing_Procedure|Project Billing].
==Modifying a Pro Forma Invoice==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form, you can edit a pro forma invoice when it is ''On Hold'', including the following:[anchor|#_60b61ff6-eeff-42b6-a672-d8e90f162361]
*You can delete a line of the pro forma invoice to bill it later in the full amount.
*You can modify the pro forma invoice to bill any lines on the '''Progress Billing''' and '''Time and Material''' tabs in a greater or smaller amount by changing the '''Amount to Invoice''' as desired. The '''Amount to Invoice''' is added to the Accounts Receivable invoice when the pro forma invoice is released. 
*:On the '''Time and Material''' tab, if a manually edited '''Amount to Invoice''' is less than the '''Billed Amount''', you can make a decision about the difference between the calculated '''Billed Amount''' and the corrected '''Amount to Invoice''' by selecting the needed option in the '''Status''' column of the invoice line. The difference can be postponed until the next invoice (''Hold Remainder'') or written off by this invoice (''Write off Remainder''). The whole amount of the pro forma invoice line can also be written off (''Write off''); the amount will no longer show up in future invoices.
*:((({S:Warn}For a postponed amount to be added to a pro forma invoice, the corresponding AR invoice that contains the line from which this postponed amount originates must be released. On the release of the AR invoice, the system creates an unbilled remainder transaction for such a line. The system also creates an unbilled remainder reversal transaction to eliminate the impact of the unbilled remainder transaction to the project balance.
)))
*On the '''Time and Material''' tab, you can select a line and then click '''View Transaction Details''' on the table toolbar to drill down to the list of project transactions for which the '''Billed Quantity''' and '''Billed Amount''' have been calculated by the formula of the billing rule. These values are summed to obtain the '''Billed Quantity''' and '''Billed Amount''', respectively, of the pro forma invoice line. You can remove particular transactions from this list, and they will appear in the next invoice.
*You can rearrange lines within the invoice by dragging them to the appropriate positions. If the '''Use T&M Revenue Budget Limits''' check box is selected for the project on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, and billing limit amounts are defined on the '''Revenue Budget''' of the same form, the system applies these limit amounts to the pro forma invoice lines as a running total, starting from the first line on the '''Time and Material''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] form. For each line of the invoice, the system subtracts the '''Amount to Invoice''' from the '''Max Available Amount''' and uses the reduced amount as the available limit for the next line. Invoice lines for which the '''Over Limit Amount''' becomes nonzero exceed the limit. By rearranging the lines, you can make the system apply the limit amounts to the needed lines of the invoice.
*You can add to a pro forma invoice an adjustment line that does not originate from the revenue budget or project transactions. Such lines are also included in the limit application and can decrease or increase the limit total.

==Releasing a Pro Forma Invoice==
The release of a pro forma invoice does not generate project transactions or General Ledger transactions directly. When you release the pro forma invoice, the system creates a corresponding Accounts Receivable invoice with all information copied from the pro forma invoice. You can release the pro forma invoices one by one on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form, or you can mass-process pro forma invoices to release them and produce Accounts Receivable invoices on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_50_60_00|Process Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM506000|PM506000]) form.{br}

The pro forma invoices of a project can be released according to the following rules:[anchor|#ul_knj_rnp_1bb]
*The pro forma invoices can be released only one by one, starting from the earliest one, on the '''Invoices''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. The only exception is when multiple pro forma invoices segregated by invoice group have been generated during a single iteration of the billing process; in this case, the pro forma invoices can be released in any order.
*A pro forma invoice can be released only after the Accounts Receivable invoice of the preceding pro forma invoice has been released.

If the '''Detail Total''' of a pro forma invoice is negative on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] form (for example, if you have added a negative adjustment line in an amount greater than the total amount of billable lines), the system creates an Accounts Receivable credit memo when the pro forma invoice is released.{br}

As a result of the release of the Accounts Receivable invoice, the General Ledger transactions are recorded, and the revenue budget of the corresponding project is changed as follows on '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form:[anchor|#ul_wcs_541_hbb]
*The '''Actual Quantity''' of the corresponding revenue budget line is increased by the line quantity of the released Accounts Receivable invoice if ''Task and Item'' is the '''Revenue Budget Level''' of the project; otherwise, the '''Actual Quantity''' is zero.
*The '''Actual Amount''' of the corresponding revenue budget line is increased by the line amount of the released Accounts Receivable invoice.
*The '''Draft Invoices Amount''' of the corresponding revenue budget line is decreased by the line amount of the released Accounts Receivable invoice.

The document details of an unreleased Accounts Receivable document that originates from a pro forma invoice are displayed in read-only mode on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form. To make a correction to the Accounts Receivable document, you need to delete this document and start over from the pro forma invoice.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] form, you can also navigate directly to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] form by using the '''View Pro Forma''' menu command and view the pro forma invoice from which the current Accounts Receivable document originates. This menu command becomes available on the '''Inquiries''' menu if the invoice being viewed has originated from a pro forma invoice.
==Printing Pro Forma Invoices==
You can use different formats of printable pro forma invoices, depending on the particular project. On the '''Mailing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, you can specify a custom format and an email notification template that should be used for the printing and emailing of the pro forma invoices prepared for that project.{br}

Also, in the '''Bill-to Contact''' and '''Bill-to Address''' sections of the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, you can specify the contact information of the customer to whom the pro forma invoices should be sent. This information is copied to each pro forma invoice created for the project and can be modified at the invoice level.
==Validating Budget Limits==
On the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, you can define billing limit amounts for revenue budget lines of the project if the '''Use T&M Revenue Budget Limits''' check box is selected on the '''Summary''' tab of this form. The system applies these limit amounts to the pro forma invoices of the project. If an invoice exceeds a limit, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] form, the user receives a warning or an error message, depending on the '''Validate T&M Revenue Budget Limits''' setting on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form.
==Approving Pro Forma Invoices==
You can configure an approval workflow for pro forma invoices that includes a sequence of approval steps based on a comprehensive approval map specified in the '''Pro Forma Approval Map''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form.]]></column>

Releasing a Pro Forma Invoice The release of a pro forma invoice does not generate project transactions or General Ledger     transactions directly. When you release the pro forma invoice, the system creates a     corresponding Accounts Receivable invoice with all information copied from the pro forma     invoice. You can release the pro forma invoices one by one on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form, or you can mass-process pro forma invoices to release them and produce     Accounts Receivable invoices on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM506000|PM506000]) Process Pro Forma Invoices (PM506000) form. The pro forma invoices of a project can be released according to the following rules: The pro forma invoices can be released only one by one, starting from the earliest one, on      the  Invoices  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form.      The only exception is when multiple pro forma invoices segregated by invoice group have been      generated during a single iteration of the billing process; in this case, the pro forma      invoices can be released in any order. A pro forma invoice can be released only after the Accounts Receivable invoice of the      preceding pro forma invoice has been released. If the  Detail Total  of a pro forma invoice is negative on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices form (for example, if you have added a negative adjustment line in an     amount greater than the total amount of billable lines), the system creates an Accounts     Receivable credit memo when the pro forma invoice is released. As a result of the release of the Accounts Receivable invoice, the General Ledger transactions     are recorded, and the revenue budget of the corresponding project is changed as follows on       Revenue Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form: The  Actual Quantity  of the corresponding revenue budget line is      increased by the line quantity of the released Accounts Receivable invoice if  Task and       Item  is the  Revenue Budget Level  of the project; otherwise, the        Actual Quantity  is zero. The  Actual Amount  of the corresponding revenue budget line is      increased by the line amount of the released Accounts Receivable invoice. The  Draft Invoices Amount  of the corresponding revenue budget line is      decreased by the line amount of the released Accounts Receivable invoice. The document details of an unreleased Accounts Receivable document that originates from a pro     forma invoice are displayed in read-only mode on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000)     form. To make a correction to the Accounts Receivable document, you need to delete this document     and start over from the pro forma invoice. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos form, you can also navigate directly to the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices form by using the  View Pro Forma  menu command and view the pro     forma invoice from which the current Accounts Receivable document originates. This menu command     becomes available on the  Inquiries  menu if the invoice being viewed has     originated from a pro forma invoice. Printing Pro Forma Invoices You can use different formats of printable pro forma invoices, depending on the particular     project. On the  Mailing Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, you can specify a custom format and an email notification template that     should be used for the printing and emailing of the pro forma invoices prepared for that     project. Also, in the  Bill-to Contact  and  Bill-to Address      sections of the  Summary  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form,     you can specify the contact information of the customer to whom the pro forma invoices should be     sent. This information is copied to each pro forma invoice created for the project and can be     modified at the invoice level. Validating Budget Limits On the  Revenue Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects     (PM301000) form, you can define billing limit amounts for revenue budget lines of the project if     the  Use T&M Revenue Budget Limits  check box is selected on the       Summary  tab of this form. The system applies these limit amounts to the     pro forma invoices of the project. If an invoice exceeds a limit, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices form, the user receives a warning or an error message, depending on     the  Validate T&M Revenue Budget Limits  setting on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form.

))){br}{TOC}
==Story==
Suppose that the Thai Food Restaurant customer has ordered a juicer, along with the services of installation and employee training on operating the juicer. The project accountant has created a project. The juicer has been delivered and installed, and a consultant has provided the training. The project accountant has billed the customer and sent the created pro forma invoice for approval.{br}

The following adjustments to the pro forma invoice have been agreed upon with the customer:[anchor|#_9ffe795f-aab0-4c8b-b023-b20959c83762]
*The customer will pay $2,000 of the cost of the juicer with the first invoice (this pro forma invoice) and the rest of the juicer&rsquo;s cost with the second invoice next month.
*The site review cost should be written off of the invoice, because the project manager agreed to provide the customer a free site review.
*A 50% discount will be applied to the cost of the training.
*The customer will pay $100 for an additional training session in the scope of Phase 1 of the project.

Acting as the project accountant, you will make the needed corrections to the pro forma invoice. 
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this lesson, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Project Accounting'' feature has been enabled to provide support for the project accounting functionality.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, the ''TOMYUM4'' project has been created. For the project, a pro forma invoice has been created.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) form, the ''PM00000001'' batch of project transactions related to the project has been created and released.
==Process Overview==
You make the corrections to the pro forma invoice and release the invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form, you review the accounts receivable invoice created based on the pro forma invoice and release this invoice.
==System Preparation==
Before you begin performing the steps of this activity, perform the following instructions to prepare the system:[anchor|#_6c9e4914-0e56-4fc0-9f9d-df880dcd99b6]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the U100 dataset preloaded as Pam Brawner by using the ''brawner'' login and the ''123'' password.[anchor|#_067576a5-4c56-4aa4-a923-dbee528fe93b]
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select ''1/30/2020'' on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.

==Step 1: Adjusting the Pro Forma Invoice==

##In the line with the ''PHASE1'' project task and the ''JUICER15'' inventory item, enter <tt>2,000.00</tt> as the '''Amount to Invoice'''.
##:When you enter an '''Amount to Invoice''' that is less than the '''Billed Amount''', the system clears the '''Status''' of the line.
##Select ''Hold Remainder'' as the '''Status''' of the line with the ''PHASE1'' project task and the ''JUICER15'' inventory item to bill the difference between the '''Billed Amount''' and the '''Amount to Invoice''' later.
##In the line with the ''PHASE1'' project task and the ''SITEREVIEW'' inventory item, select ''Write Off'' as the '''Status''' to write off the full amount of the line and exclude it from billing.
##In the line with the ''PHASE2'' project task and the ''TRAINING'' inventory item, enter <tt>200.00</tt> as the '''Amount to Invoice'''.
##Select ''Write Off Remainder'' as the '''Status''' of the line with the ''PHASE2'' project task and the ''TRAINING'' inventory item to write off the difference between the '''Billed Amount''' and the '''Amount to Invoice''' and exclude this difference from billing.
#Add a new line with the following settings:
#*'''Project Task''': ''PHASE1''
#* '''Inventory UD''': ''TRAINING''
#* '''Description''': <tt>An additional training session within Phase 1</tt>
#*'''Amount to Invoice''': <tt>100.00</tt>[anchor|#_065ed0f5-b49a-4191-83c8-84a5d49ae2e8][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_ProFormaAdjustment.png|popup|The adjustments to the pro forma invoice|400px]
#Save your changes to the pro forma invoice.
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and on the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the pro forma invoice.
#:The system creates the accounts receivable invoice based on the pro forma invoice and assigns the ''Closed'' status to the pro forma invoice.
#On the '''Financial Details''' tab, click the link in the '''AR Ref. Nbr.''' box to open the accounts receivable invoice that was created.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form, which the system opens in a pop-up window, in the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and on the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the accounts receivable invoice.
#Close the windows with the pop-up forms.

==Step 2: Billing the Project with the Reminder==
Now you need to bill the reminder you have held, do the following:[anchor|#_ef38352d-7940-4c9e-8753-fef50e503041]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''TOMYUM4'' project, and on the '''Cost Budget''' tab, review the updated cost budget of the project.
#Click the cost budget line with the ''PHASE1'' project task and the ''JUICER15'' inventory item, and on the table toolbar, click '''View Transactions'''.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_10_00|Project Transaction Details] ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) form, which the system opens in a pop-up window, review the list of project transactions that correspond to the selected line (see the following screenshot).
#:Review the transaction with the ''Unbilled Reminder'' original doc type. The transaction has been created on release of the AR invoice that correspond to the pro forma invoice from which the unbilled reminder originates. The identifier of the AR invoice is shown in the '''Orig. Doc. Type''' column. The transaction has the '''Billable''' check box selected and the '''Billed''' check box cleared, which means the transaction can be used as the provisioning for billing.[anchor|#_79642e93-bc4b-4e55-9c0e-50417fe91cfc][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_ProFormaAdjustment2.png|popup|The transaction with the unbilled reminder|400px]
#Close the pop-up windows.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Run Project Billing'''.

In Acumatica ERP, the billing procedure provides opportunities for grouping invoices and creating separate invoices depending on the project settings and the settings of billing rules.{br}{TOC}
==Lesson Objectives==
You will learn how to:[anchor|#ul_nwj_gch_tbb]
*Configure project billing to create a single invoice for the project or to create multiple separate invoices
*Bill the project with different billing rules assigned to the project tasks
*Bill a project task separately from the other tasks of the project
*Bill project transactions that are processed by particular steps of billing rules with a separate invoice

==Applicable Scenarios==
You bill a project with separate invoices if, for example, the customer has asked to provide a separate invoice for each project task, or you need to create a separate invoice based on the transactions of each account group.
==Grouping Invoices==
During the billing process, the system groups the billable amounts into invoices based on the following settings of project tasks specified on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Billing and Allocation Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form and settings of billing rules specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form:[anchor|#_8a99bcda-f0fc-41bb-91f2-3dc376410b41]
*The customer of a project task selected in the '''Customer''' box
*The customer&rsquo;s location of a project task selected in the '''Location''' box
*The originating branch the logic of which retrieval is described below
*The '''Bill Separately''' check box of a project task
*The '''Invoice Group''' of the billing rule, which is specified for a project task in the '''Billing Rule''' box

The system selects the originating branch for an invoice created during project billing by using the following priority:[anchor|#_75f48642-e592-4e3e-b91a-4d8645aaf5d6]
*For a pro forma invoice, the project branch specified in the '''Branch''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Billing and Allocation Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, if any. For an accounts receivable invoice, the system ignores the project branch.
*The shipping branch of the location selected in the project task, which is specified in the '''Shipping Branch''' box on the '''General Info''' tab ('''Location Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_20|Customer Locations] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303020|AR303020]) form, if any. (Therefore a number of invoices with different originating branches can be created for the same project if the project branch is not defined.)
*The shipping branch of the default location of the customer specified for the project task, if any.
*The current branch selected in the company and branch selection menu.

By default with no additional settings, the system creates a single invoice for a project even if the project tasks have different billing rules assigned.{br}

The system creates a separate invoice for a project task that has the selected '''Bill Separately''' check box in the '''Billing and Allocation Settings''' section on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form.{br}

The system also creates a separate invoice for all the billing steps of billing rules with the same '''Invoice Group''' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form. That is, if some tasks of a project have single or multiple billing rules with billing steps that have the same invoice group, during the project billing, the system creates a separate invoice for all the invoice lines created with these billing steps.]]></column>

))){br}{TOC}
==Story==
Suppose that the Thai Food Restaurant customer has ordered two juicers, along with the following services: site review, installation, and employee training on operating the juicers. The project accountant has created the project for these items and services. The juicers have been delivered and installed, and a consultant has provided the training.{br}

Acting as the project accountant, you need to bill the customer.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this lesson, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Project Accounting'' feature has been enabled to provide the support of project accounting functionality.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, the ''TOMYUM9'' project has been created.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) form, the ''PM00000005'' batch of project transactions related to the project has been created and released.
==Process Overview==
To bill a time and material project, you first review and configure project invoices with the billing rule on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form and with the project tasks on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. You then bill the project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. Finally, you review the created pro forma invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form.
==System Preparation==
Before you begin performing the steps of this activity, perform the following instructions to prepare the system:[anchor|#_6c9e4914-0e56-4fc0-9f9d-df880dcd99b6]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the U100 dataset preloaded as Pam Brawner by using the ''brawner'' login and the ''123'' password.[anchor|#_53f92860-2b07-460b-bddb-a1daf3d01d49]
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select ''1/30/2020'' on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.

==Step 1: Billing a Project with Multiple Billing Rules==
To bill the project with different billing rules assigned to the project tasks, do the following:[anchor|#_6c55e3eb-2ba3-45ea-a66f-4754be402562]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''TOMYUM9'' project.
#On the '''Cost Budget''' tab, review the cost budget of the project.
#On the '''Tasks''' tab, in the line with the ''PHASE2'' task, select the ''TM'' as the '''Billing Rule'''. When you bill the project, the system will use this billing rule to process unbilled transactions associated with this project task.
#Save your changes to the project.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Run Project Billing'''.
#:The system creates a pro forma invoice and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form.
#On the '''Time and Material''' tab, review the invoice lines and notice that lines related to all the project tasks are in the same invoice, even though the project tasks have different billing rules assigned.
#Delete the pro forma invoice, so you can bill this project again when you change the configuration of project billing.

==Step 2: Billing Project Tasks Separately==
To bill one of the project tasks separately from the other project tasks, do the following:[anchor|#_3e31345c-ad35-44c5-90a2-4d2aef197f49]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''TOMYUM9'' project.
#On the '''Tasks''' tab, do the following to add a needed table column to those displayed on the tab:
##In the table, click the Column Configuration button, the leftmost icon among the column headers. The system opens the '''Column Configuration''' dialog box in a pop-up window.
##In the '''Available Columns''' list of the dialog box, click the '''Bill Separately''' column.
##Click the Add Column button (the right arrow icon between the lists) to add the column to the '''Selected Columns''' list.
##Click '''OK''' to apply your changes to the list of columns and close the dialog box.
#In the row with the ''PHASE3'' task, select the check box in the '''Bill Separately''' column to bill the task with a separate invoice.
#Save your changes to the project.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Run Project Billing'''.
#:The system creates two pro forma invoices. One invoice includes the transactions related to the ''PHASE3'' project task, and the other invoice includes the transactions related to the other project tasks.
#Open and review each created pro forma invoice as follows:
##On the '''Invoices''' tab, click the link in the '''Pro Forma Reference Nbr.''' column to open the pro forma invoice.
##On the '''Time and Material''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form, which the system opens in a pop-up window, review the lines of the invoice.
##:Notice that one invoice has lines related to the ''PHASE1'' and ''PHASE2'' tasks, whereas the other invoice has lines related to only the ''PHASE3'' task.
##Close the pop-up window with the form.
#After you review both pro forma invoices in the previous step, delete the invoices to be able to bill the project again when you change the configuration of project invoices.

==Step 3: Grouping Invoices by Steps of Billing Rules==
To bill project transactions that are processed by particular steps of billing rules with a separate invoice, do the following:[anchor|#_6d5166ea-40e0-4605-94ac-8ea9f15e6e8f]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, open the ''TM'' billing rule.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Grouping Invoices: Process Activity The following hands-on exercise will walk you through the process of configuring                 project billing to create a single invoice for the project or to create multiple                 separate invoices. You will learn how to bill the project with different billing                 rules assigned to the project tasks, how to bill a project task separately from the                 other tasks of the project, and how to bill project transactions that are processed                 by particular steps of billing rules with a separate invoice. The following activity is based on the                  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system settings             have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the activity             and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100  dataset             to its initial state. Story Suppose that the Thai Food Restaurant customer has ordered two juicers, along with                 the following services: site review, installation, and employee training on                 operating the juicers. The project accountant has created the project for these                 items and services. The juicers have been delivered and installed, and a consultant                 has provided the training. Acting as the project accountant, you need to bill the customer. Configuration Overview For the purposes of this lesson, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000)                 form, the  Project Accounting  feature has been enabled to provide the support                 of project accounting functionality. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, the  TOMYUM9  project                 has been created. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) Project Transactions (PM304000) form, the  PM00000005  batch                 of project transactions related to the project has been created and released. Process Overview To bill a time and material project, you first review and configure project invoices                 with the billing rule on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules (PM207000) form and                 with the project tasks on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. You                 then bill the project on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form. Finally, you                 review the created pro forma invoice on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices                 (PM307000) form. System Preparation Before you begin performing the steps of this activity, perform the following                 instructions to prepare the system: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the U100 dataset preloaded as Pam                     Brawner by using the  brawner  login and the  123  password. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP             screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to  1/30/2020. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and             select  1/30/2020 on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and             process all documents in the system during this business date. Step 1: Billing a Project with Multiple Billing Rules To bill the project with different billing rules assigned to the project tasks, do                 the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, open the  TOMYUM9                      project. On the  Cost Budget  tab, review the cost budget of the                     project. On the  Tasks  tab, in the line with the  PHASE2                      task, select the  TM  as the  Billing Rule . When you                     bill the project, the system will use this billing rule to process unbilled                     transactions associated with this project task. Save your changes to the project. On the form toolbar, click  Run Project Billing . The                         system creates a pro forma invoice and opens it on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form. On the  Time and Material  tab, review the invoice lines                     and notice that lines related to all the project tasks are in the same invoice,                     even though the project tasks have different billing rules assigned. Delete the pro forma invoice, so you can bill this project again when you change                     the configuration of project billing. Step 2: Billing Project Tasks Separately To bill one of the project tasks separately from the other project tasks, do the                 following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, open the  TOMYUM9                      project. On the  Tasks  tab, do the following to add a needed table                     column to those displayed on the tab: In the table, click the Column Configuration button, the leftmost icon                             among the column headers. The system opens the  Column                                 Configuration  dialog box in a pop-up window. In the  Available Columns  list of the dialog box,                             click the  Bill Separately  column. Click the Add Column button (the right arrow icon between the lists) to                             add the column to the  Selected Columns  list. Click  OK  to apply your changes to the list of                             columns and close the dialog box. In the row with the  PHASE3  task, select the check box in the                          Bill Separately  column to bill the task with a                     separate invoice. Save your changes to the project. On the form toolbar, click  Run Project Billing . The                         system creates two pro forma invoices. One invoice includes the transactions                         related to the  PHASE3  project task, and the other invoice includes                         the transactions related to the other project tasks. Open and review each created pro forma invoice as follows: On the  Invoices  tab, click the link in the                                  Pro Forma Reference Nbr.  column to open the                             pro forma invoice. On the  Time and Material  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form, which the system opens in                             a pop-up window, review the lines of the invoice. Notice that one                                 invoice has lines related to the  PHASE1  and  PHASE2                                  tasks, whereas the other invoice has lines related to only the                                      PHASE3  task. Close the pop-up window with the form. After you review both pro forma invoices in the previous step, delete the                     invoices to be able to bill the project again when you change the configuration                     of project invoices. Step 3: Grouping Invoices by Steps of Billing Rules To bill project transactions that are processed by particular steps of billing rules                 with a separate invoice, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules (PM207000) form, open the  TM                      billing rule. In the left pane, enter  MATERIAL  as the                          Invoice Group  of the  10 - Material cost plus                         markup  step. This step of the billing rule is used for time and                         material billing of transactions associated with the  MATERIAL  account                         group. Save your changes to the billing rule. Open the  COMBINED  billing rule. In the left pane, enter  MATERIAL  as the                          Invoice Group  of the  20 - Material cost plus                         markup  step. This step of the billing rule is used for time and                         material billing of transactions associated with the  MATERIAL  account                         group. Save your changes to the billing rule. When you bill the project by using                         these billing rules, the system will group invoice lines created with the                         steps of the billing rules with the  MATERIAL  account group in a                         separate invoice. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, open the  TOMYUM9                      project. On the  Tasks  tab, make sure that the billing rule of the                          PHASE1  and  PHASE3  tasks is  COMBINED  and the billing                     rule of the  PHASE2  task is  TM . On the form toolbar, click  Run Project Billing . The                         system creates three pro forma invoices. The system has created one more                         separate invoice based on unbilled transactions with the  MATERIAL                          account group using the steps of the billing rules with the  MATERIAL                          invoice group. Open and review each created pro forma invoice as follows: On the  Invoices  tab, click the link in the                                  Pro Forma Reference Nbr.  column to open the                             pro forma invoice. On the  Time and Material  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form, which the system opens in                             a pop-up window, review the lines of the invoice. Close the pop-up window with the form. ]]></column>

For individual projects, you can configure different formats for printable pro forma invoices and Accounts Receivable invoices. The invoice format may depend on the project type; for instance, an installation project may have one invoice format, and a repair project may have a different invoice format. Also, a default invoice format can be specified for particular customers, with this format used for all projects of this customer unless the user specifies a different format. For example, a company might use a particular invoice format for government customers, or for customers who work with a particular bank to get loans for their projects (and this bank dictates the invoice format).{br}{TOC}
==Defining Printing Forms of Invoices for Projects==
On the '''Mailing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, you can specify a custom format and an email notification template that should be used for the printing and emailing of the invoices prepared for the particular project. When you create a new project, the system copies all the predefined mailing settings from the '''Mailing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form, but you can override them. You can use the following predefined mailings:[anchor|#ul_odx_jys_qbb]
*''PROFORMA'': The mailing with this identifier is used to print pro forma invoices. By default, this mailing uses the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\PM_64_20_00|Pro Forma Invoice] ([~/?ScreenId=PM642000|PM642000]) report for printing the pro forma invoice.
*''INVOICE'': The mailing with this identifier is used to print Accounts Receivable invoices that originate from the Projects module. By default, this mailing uses the ProInvoice/Memo (PM641000) report, which is a copy of the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\AR_64_10_00|Invoice/Memo] ([~/?ScreenId=AR641000|AR641000]) report, for printing the invoice.

If you need to override the printing form of pro forma invoices or Accounts Receivable invoices for a project, you edit the respective mailing setting but do not edit the mailing identifier, which is the system setting. For example, suppose you need to override the printing form of pro forma invoices for a project. For the ''PROFORMA'' mailing of this project, you select the needed report from the Projects module in the '''Report''' column of the '''Mailing''' table on the '''Mailing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form.
==Printing Invoices==
When you print a pro forma invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form, the system uses the report specified for the ''PROFORMA'' mailing of the corresponding project on the '''Mailing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. If the corresponding project has no mailing setting with the ''PROFORMA'' identifier, an error occurs.{br}

When you print an Accounts Receivable invoice that originates from the Projects module on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form, the system uses one of the following reports:[anchor|#ul_sd3_krt_qbb]
*The report specified for the ''INVOICE'' mailing, if one is specified, of the corresponding project on the '''Mailing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form.
*The report specified for the customer on the '''Mailing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form if the ''INVOICE'' mailing of the corresponding project is not active. For more information about mailing settings for customers, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__con_Predefined_Mailings_for_Customers_and_Vendors|Mailings for Customers].
*The [HelpRoot_ReportReference\AR_64_10_00|Invoice/Memo] ([~/?ScreenId=AR641000|AR641000]) report if the ''INVOICE'' mailing of the corresponding project and the customer is not active.

When you print an Accounts Receivable invoice that originates from the Projects module on the        ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form, the system uses one of the following     reports: The report specified for the  INVOICE  mailing, if one is specified, of the           corresponding project on the  Mailing Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form.

 Acumatica ERP supports the tracking of purchase orders by project as project cost commitments. These commitments affect the execution status of a project. A user can track the budget and actual amounts of a project, as well as the original commitments that remain open. When the commitments are created, the system uses them to populate the cost budget for the corresponding project, project task, inventory item, and account group.{br}{TOC}
==Lesson Objectives==
You will learn how to:[anchor|#ul_e23_hhs_3cb]
*Process a purchase order with lines that refer to a project
*Review the internal commitment created based on the purchase order

==Applicable Scenarios==
You create purchase orders related to a project if you want to update the cost budget of the project with the services and materials purchased for the project.[anchor|#section_akq_jg5_v1b]
==Tracking the Committed Cost by Purchase Order==
The system tracks the commitment cost in the base currency for the ''Normal'' and ''Drop-Ship'' lines of the purchase orders created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form and associated with a project. These commitments have the ''Internal'' type because they originate from documents created in the system, in contrast to commitments of the ''External'' type that can be imported into Acumatica ERP.{br}

The system tracks the internal commitment cost if the '''Internal Cost Commitment Tracking''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form.{br}

For a purchase order that refers to a project, when a user approves the purchase order or saves the purchase order with the ''Pending Printing'', ''Pending Email'', or ''Open'' status, the system creates a commitment record for each purchase order line in the amount of the '''Ext. Cost''' of the line. These commitments are updated when the order line is changed (for example, when the quantity or amount of the line is corrected or the order line is completed or canceled).{br}

Users can review the list of commitments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_60_00|Commitments] ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) form. The initial commitment amount is displayed in the '''Original Committed Amount''' column and the actual commitment amount is shown in the '''Revised Committed Amount''' column of each line. For a new commitment, the '''Committed Open Amount''' equals the revised committed amount.{br}

When a purchase order is received, the system updates the '''Committed Received Quantity''' and reduces the '''Committed Open Amount''' of the commitment line by an amount proportional to the received or billed quantity as follows: {{Committed Open Amount = Committed Open Amount − Revised Committed Amount * Committed Received Quantity / Revised Committed Quantity}}.{br}

The system updates the '''Committed Received Quantity''' of the commitment line depending on the type of the purchase order line as follows:[anchor|#ul_zqp_sf5_v1b]
*For the purchase order lines that are processed through a purchase receipt, the commitment lines are updated with the received quantity when the purchase receipt is released.
*For the purchase order lines that are billed directly without a purchase receipt being processed, the commitment lines are updated with the invoiced quantity when the Accounts Payable bill is released.

When an Accounts Payable bill that corresponds to the purchase order is released, the '''Committed Invoiced Amount''' is updated with the '''Ext. Cost''' of the bill line.{br}

After a purchase order has been closed, the '''Committed Open Amount''' of the commitment lines becomes zero. If a purchase order has been received partially or canceled, the incomplete amounts are also subtracted from the '''Committed Open Amount'''.{br}

The validate process on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_50_40_00|Validate Project Balances] ([~/?ScreenId=PM504000|PM504000]) form recreates internal commitment records based on the amounts and quantities in the lines of purchase orders if the tracking of project commitments is enabled.
==Updating the Document from Which a Commitment Originates==
Depending on the selection of the '''Change Order Workflow''' check box for a project in the '''Project Properties''' section ('''Summary''' tab) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, a purchase order that refers to the project can be updated in the following ways:[anchor|#ul_um2_r3j_ddb]
*If the check box is cleared—that is, the change order workflow is not enabled for the project—you update the purchase order directly on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. When you update the '''Ext. Cost''' of a purchase order line that refers to the project on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form and approve the purchase order or save the purchase order with the ''Pending Printing'', ''Pending Email'', or ''Open'' status, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_60_00|Commitments] form, the system updates the '''Original Committed Amount''' and the '''Revised Committed Amount''' of the commitment that originates from the purchase order. The '''Committed CO Amount''' of the commitment, which is the difference between the '''Revised Committed Amount''' and the '''Original Committed Amount''', is zero.
*If the check box is selected—that is, the change order workflow is enabled for the project—and the project has at least one related change order, you update a purchase order line that refers to the project with a change order created for the project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) form. When you release the change order, the system updates the purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form and the '''Revised Committed Amount''' of the commitment that originates from the purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_60_00|Commitments] form. The '''Original Committed Amount''' of the commitment remains the same. The '''Committed CO Amount''' of the commitment, which is the difference between the '''Revised Committed Amount''' and the '''Original Committed Amount''', shows the amount that was added to the commitment or subtracted from the commitment by the change order.
*If the check box is selected—that is, the change order workflow is enabled for the project—and the project has no related change orders, you still can update the purchase order directly on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. You can also update a purchase order line that refers to the project with a change order created for the project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) form.

For more information about change orders, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__con_Change_Management|Change Management].[anchor|#section_ojx_jg5_v1b]
==Aggregating Committed Data for Reports==
The commitment data aggregated by the project budget line key (project, project task, inventory item, and account group—that is, {{Project ID}}, {{Project Task ID}}, {{Inventory ID}}, and {{Account Group ID}}, respectively) is available in the analytical reports and on the following forms:[anchor|#ul_cyp_sf5_v1b]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, in the corresponding columns on the '''Cost Budget''' tab. For a selected budget line, you can click '''View Commitments''' on the table toolbar to review the detailed commitment records on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_60_00|Commitments] ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) form.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_60_10|Row Sets] ([~/?ScreenId=CS206010|CS206010]) form, in the '''Amount Type''' box of the '''Data Source''' of a row, for row sets of the ''PM'' type.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_60_20|Column Sets] ([~/?ScreenId=CS206020|CS206020]) form, in the '''Amount Type''' box of the '''Data Source''' of a column, for column sets of the ''PM'' type.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_60_30|Unit Sets] ([~/?ScreenId=CS206030|CS206030]) form, in the '''Amount Type''' box of the '''Data Source''' of a unit, for unit sets of the ''PM'' type.
[anchor|#section_dtb_kg5_v1b]
==Integrating Commitments with External Systems==
Project commitments do not necessarily have to originate from purchase orders that exist in the system. Users can import commitment records from an external system into Acumatica ERP for further analysis against budget and actual figures. These commitment records are called ''External'' in contrast to internal ones that originate from documents created in the system. After the initial import, users can update imported commitment records as the project goes on and the system changes the applicable open committed amounts and invoiced amounts. Imported commitment records have the ''External'' type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_60_00|Commitments] ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) form and are identified in Acumatica ERP by the external reference number.{br}

The selection of the '''Internal Cost Commitment Tracking''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form is not necessary for the import of external commitment records.{br}

To create an external commitment record, on the toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_60_00|Commitments] form, a user can click '''Create External Commitment''' and then populate the necessary settings of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_90_00|External Commitments] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209000|PM209000]) form, which opens. This form is also available for writing import and export scenarios and through the Web Services API.]]></column>

==Story==
Suppose that the HM&rsquo;s Bakery and Cafe customer has ordered the installation of juicers it previously purchased from your company. The project accountant has created a project. The installation, which is performed by the vendor of the juicers, has been provided for each juicer. The project accountant needs to create a purchase order to capture the installation cost on the project, and to process the accounts payable bill from the vendor. You will perform the needed actions in the system, acting as the project accountant.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this lesson, the following features have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form:[anchor|#_85ada628-bc34-4eed-817e-0247a845166b]
*''Project Accounting'' feature, which provides support for the project accounting functionality
*''Inventory'' feature, which provides the ability to maintain stock items and to create and process purchasing documents that include stock items

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, the ''HMBAKERY8'' project has been created.
==Process Overview==
To process a purchase order that will affect the cost budget of the project, you first make sure the '''Internal Cost Commitment Tracking''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form, so you can track purchase orders by project as cost commitments. You create the purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form with the ''Open'' status, selecting the project in the appropriate lines of the '''Document Details''' tab. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form, you create a bill for the purchase order and release the bill. {br}

You then review the created commitment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_60_00|Commitments] ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) form, and review the project costs on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form.
==System Preparation==
To sign in to the system and prepare to perform the instructions of the activity, do the following:[anchor|#_5e4e87f1-6fe1-4688-b21b-a3ae5c8f4117]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website and sign in as Pam Brawner using the ''brawner'' login and ''123'' password.[anchor|#_d542e25a-fc7d-4117-8b31-f648280d0340]
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select ''1/30/2020'' on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form, on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''General Settings''' section), select the '''Internal Cost Commitment Tracking''' check box to be able to track purchase orders by project as cost commitments, and save your changes to the project accounting preferences.

==Step 1: Creating Commitments for the Project==
To capture committed costs on the project, do the following:[anchor|#_a7fc6e3b-d40e-45c3-8b1a-031a0a172a9b]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''HMBAKERY8'' project, and on the '''Cost Budget''' tab, review the cost budget of the project. Notice the committed and actual values of the cost budget line, which are both zero.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, create a purchase order, and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Vendor''': ''SQUEEZO''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Purchase for HM&rsquo;s Bakery & Cafe</tt>
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, add three purchase order lines, and specify the settings shown in the following table in the lines you add.
#:{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="20%" ! '''Inventory ID'''
!width="40%" !  '''Line Description'''
!width="20%" !  '''Order Qty.'''
!width="20%" !  '''Project'''
|- 
|  ''INSTALL''
| <tt>Installation of the first juicer</tt>
| <tt>3.00</tt>
| ''HMBAKERY8''
|- 
|  ''INSTALL''
| <tt>Installation of the second juicer</tt>
| <tt>4.00</tt>
| ''HMBAKERY8''
|- 
|  ''INSTALL''
| <tt>Installation of the third juicer</tt>
| <tt>5.00</tt>
| ''HMBAKERY8''
|}
#Review the '''Ext. Cost''' of each added line, which will be the committed cost.
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box and save the purchase order, which now has the ''Open'' status.
#:When the ''Open'' status is assigned to the purchase order, the system creates commitments for the project.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, open the ''HMBAKERY8'' project, and review the updated cost budget on the '''Cost Budget''' tab. Notice that the committed values have been updated.
#Click the cost budget line, and do the following:
##On the table toolbar, click '''View Commitment Details'''.
##Review the corresponding commitments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_60_00|Commitments] ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) form, which the system opens in a pop-up window. Notice that the system has created a commitment for each purchase order line and that all the commitments correspond to one cost budget line.
##Close the pop-up window with the form.
#On the '''Commitments''' tab, where all purchase orders related to the project are listed, click the link in the '''Order Nbr.''' column to open the purchase order that you have created.
#On the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form, which the system opens in a pop-up window, click '''Actions''' > '''Enter AP Bill''' to create a bill for the purchase order.
#:The system creates an accounts payable bill and opens the bill on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form.
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, delete the line with a '''Quantity''' of ''5.00'' to bill the purchase order partially.
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and on the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the bill.
#Close the pop-up window with the form.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, open the ''HMBAKERY8'' project and review the updated cost budget on the '''Cost Budget''' tab. Notice that the billed amount and quantity of the purchase order have been subtracted from the committed open amount and quantity; they have been added to the committed invoiced amount and quantity, to the actual amount and quantity, and also to the committed received quantity, as shown in the screenshot below.
#:For an AP bill processed for a purchase order that contains a service or material of the project, the cost of the corresponding commitment moves from the open committed values to the actual ones. This continues as each such bill (with a line connected to the project) is processed, until the open committed values become zero.

In Acumatica ERP, you can enable a feature that gives employees the ability to report the time that they spend on each time activity.{br}

 Acumatica ERP also provides the time card functionality. A time card is a weekly report on the time an employee has spent on each activity. By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_50_00|Employee Time Card] ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]) form, employees can enter new time cards or view, edit, or release existing time cards.{br}{TOC}
==Lesson Objectives==
You will learn how to:[anchor|#_563146da-8465-40f9-835b-74c10a31f02a]
*Configure labor cost rates
*Specify an approver for a project task
*Enter employee time cards
*Approve and release time cards

==Applicable Scenarios==
You create a time card if you need to report on the time you have spent on some activities, including activities within projects. 
==Enabling Time Reporting==
To enable time reporting for activities, you need to enable the ''Time Reporting on Activity'' feature on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, which makes the '''Track Time''' check box available on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_10|Activity] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306010|CR306010]) form. This check box, when selected, enables a group of elements on the same form which you can use to report the total time spent on the activity. Also, by using this group of elements, you can mark the activity as billable and specify the information required for billing—that is, the amount of billable time and the earning type of the activity (for details, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CR__con_Case_Billing|Case Billing]). {br}

If you want the '''Track Time''' check box to be selected by default for activities of certain types, you need to select the corresponding check boxes in the '''Track Time''' column on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_10_20_00|Activity Types] ([~/?ScreenId=CR102000|CR102000]) form. 
==Using Earning Types==
In Acumatica ERP, you have to specify an earning type for each billable activity; the earning type determines how the system calculates the cost of employee labor.{br}

The system recognizes two classes of earning types: those defining standard working hours and those defining overtime. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_10_20_00|Earning Types] ([~/?ScreenId=EP102000|EP102000]) form, where you can add new earning types and adjust the available ones, you can also specify whether an earning type defines standard working hours or overtime by clearing or selecting the '''Overtime''' check box, respectively. On the same form, you can update the multiplier value for any overtime earning type—the system multiplies the employee rate by the multiplier value when calculating the cost of employee labor. For standard working hours, the multiplier is always ''1''.{br}

 By default, the following earning types are available in the system:[anchor|#_4df2b0c9-f1ed-4f89-80ac-cdd77301016b]
*''Regular Hours (RG)'': Standard working hours whose cost is calculated based on the standard employee rate.
*''Overtime (OT)'': Overtime working hours whose cost is calculated by multiplying the standard rate by the value of the overtime multiplier.
*''Public Holidays (HL)'': Non-working hours of public holidays, which are non-billable. You can use this earning type to indicate that certain days included in the time card are public holidays when no work is done.
*''Vacations (VL)'': Non-working hours of vacations, which are also non-billable. You can use this earning type to indicate that the employee is not working due to vacation.

==Enabling Time Cards==
Time cards are available in Acumatica ERP only if the ''Advanced Financials'' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

By default, employees are not required to fill in time cards. However, if time cards are mandatory in your company, you can make them required on a per-employee basis by selecting the '''Time Card is Required''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form.{br}

Time cards are always generated successively, which means that you cannot generate a successive time card for a particular week if no time card has been generated for the preceding week.((({S:Warn}Suppose that the latest time card was generated for an employee a considerable time ago, and now you want to resume the generation of time cards for this employee, but you don&rsquo;t need any time cards for the intervening time interval. To generate multiple empty time cards for the intervening time interval, you can select the employee on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form and then, on the '''Employment History''' tab, click '''Generate Time Cards''' on the table toolbar.
)))
==Accessing Time Activities==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_40_43_00|Activities] ([~/?ScreenId=EP404300|EP404300]) form, you can review all existing activities or invoke the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_10|Activity] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306010|CR306010]) form the creating a new one. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_10|Activity] form, you can create, view, or adjust an activity of any types specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_10_20_00|Activity Types] ([~/?ScreenId=CR102000|CR102000]) form.{br}

You can open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_10|Activity] form through various forms that have the tab with the related activities. For example, on the table toolbar of the '''Activity History''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, you can click '''Add Activity''' to open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_10|Activity] form and add an activity to the selected project.
==Accessing Time Cards==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_50_00|Employee Time Card] ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]) form, you can create, view, or adjust any of the following time cards:[anchor|#ul_mhf_xvd_jx]
*Your time cards
*Time cards of the employees for whom you are an appointed delegate
*Time cards of the employees who report to you
*Time cards assigned to you for approval
*Time cards of employees in the workgroups at lower levels in the company tree than your workgroup

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) form, you can access the following time cards:[anchor|#ul_rhy_tcy_r3]
*Those assigned to you
*Those assigned to other users in your workgroup
*Those escalated from users in workgroups at a lower level in the company tree but in your workgroup&rsquo;s node

==Processing Time Cards==
As a rule, each time card passes through several stages, which might include preparation, approval, and release. The processing stage of a time card is indicated by its status.
==Preparing Time Cards==
When preparing a time card, an employee reports work time by creating separate detail records for the following types of activities:[anchor|#ul_hmd_z2m_fq]
*Those associated with different projects or project tasks
*Those related to different earning types
*Those that are billable and those that are non-billable 

==Creating Labor Cost Rates==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_99_00|Labor Cost Rates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209900|PM209900]) form, you can view and edit the existing labor cost rates. Labor costs can be specified at particular detail levels—that is, for particular entities or groups of entities. You can create labor cost rates of the following types and detail levels:[anchor|#_12cb5eb1-8dd1-4fd2-93eb-3934cb7e894c]
*''Labor Item'': The labor item
*''Employee'': The employee and optionally the labor item
*''Project'': The project and optionally any of the following: the project task, the employee, and the labor item
*''Union Wage'': The union local and labor item
*''Prevailing Wage'': The project and labor item
((({S:Warn}You can view, edit, and create labor cost rates of the ''Union Wage'' and ''Prevailing Wage'' types if the ''Construction'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
)))
For each labor cost rate, you specify the effective date. If there are multiple labor cost rates with the same settings, the system uses the rate with the actual effective date—that is, with the most recent effective date that precedes the current date. You can also create a labor cost rate with the same settings as an existing labor cost rate but with an effective date later than the latest effective date of the existing labor cost rate.{br}

When you specify the rate for a line with a selected labor item, you specify the rate for the base unit of measure (UOM) of the labor item.{br}

For example, suppose that you have the ''TRAINING'' labor item, whose base UOM is ''UNIT''. According to the conversion rules specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) form, one unit equals four hours. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_99_00|Labor Cost Rates] form, when you add a labor cost rate with an employee and the ''TRAINING'' labor item, you should specify the rate for the base UOM, which is ''UNIT'', even if the unit consists of four hours. When the employee enters a time card on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_50_00|Employee Time Card] ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]) form and select in a time activity the ''TRAINING'' labor item, the time is reported in hours even though the base UOM of the selected item is not an hour. When the time card with the corresponding time activities is released, the system generates a project transaction with the ''TRAINING'' labor item in the base UOM of the item. If the employee has reported eight hours, the transaction contains two ''TRAINING'' units.((({S:Warn}[anchor|#_3fbeae1d-51f4-44da-91d6-b8315b62a0a0]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_99_00|Labor Cost Rates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209900|PM209900]) form, when you create a labor cost rate with a labor item with a base UOM that is not an hour, make sure that you enter the rate for the base UOM of the labor item so that the system calculates the correct amount when a time activity with this labor item is released.
*The base UOM of the labor item should be convertible into minutes so that the system can convert the base UOM to a minute and vice versa. That is, there should be the conversion rules from a minute to the base UOM on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) form.
)))
==Retrieving Labor Cost Rates==
When you create a time card on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_50_00|Employee Time Card] ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]) form, for each line, you select the employee, project, project task, labor item, date, union local, certified job, and worker compensation code.((({S:Warn}The '''Certified Job''', '''Union Local''', and '''WCC Code''' columns are shown on the '''Summary''' and '''Details''' tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_50_00|Employee Time Card] form if the ''Construction'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
)))
The system automatically selects the '''Certified Job''' check box in the time card line if for the corresponding project, the '''Certified Job''' check box is selected in the '''Project Properties''' section on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. You can clear this check box if it has been selected or select it manually, if needed.{br}

The system automatically populates the '''Union Local''' column in the time card line by using the settings of the employee and the project as follows:[anchor|#_2e5021b6-71de-4fba-84bb-887f12ec8d88]
*If the employee has a '''Union Local ID''' specified in the '''Employee Settings''' section on the '''General Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form and the project has no union local specified on the '''Union Locals''' tab of the of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the system inserts the union local of the employee into the column.
*If the employee has a '''Union Local ID''' specified in the '''Employee Settings''' section on the '''General Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] form and this union local is one of the union locals of the project specified on the '''Union Locals''' tab of the of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the system inserts the union local of the employee into the column.
*If the employee has a '''Union Local ID''' specified in the '''Employee Settings''' section on the '''General Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] form and this union local is not one of the union locals of the project specified on the '''Union Locals''' tab of the of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the system leaves the '''Union Local''' column blank.
*If the employee has no '''Union Local ID''' specified in the '''Employee Settings''' section on the '''General Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] form, the system leaves the '''Union Local''' column blank.

In the time card, you can clear a '''Union Local''' value that has been selected or select a union local manually, if needed.{br}

For each time card line, the system retrieves the cost rate for the specified employee, project, project task, labor item, date, union local, and certified job as follows:[anchor|#_067e04ad-4815-4e87-bbe6-3f2b17399431]
#Among labor cost rates of the ''Project'', ''Employee'', and ''Labor Item'' rate types, the system selects the most specific existing labor cost rate that matches all the settings specified in the time card line. The following list shows the sets of settings of the labor cost rate, from the most specific to the least specific:
#*The ''Project'' rate type, project, project task, employee, labor item, and effective date
#*The ''Project'' rate type, project, project task, employee, and effective date
#*The ''Project'' rate type, project, project task, labor item, and effective date
#*The ''Project'' rate type, project, project task, and effective date
#*The ''Project'' rate type, project, employee, labor item, and effective date
#*The ''Project'' rate type, project, employee, and effective date
#*The ''Project'' rate type, project, labor item, and effective date
#*The ''Project'' rate type, project, and effective date
#*The ''Employee'' rate type, employee, labor item, and effective date
#*The ''Employee'' rate type, employee, and effective date
#*The ''Labor Item'' rate type, labor item, and effective date
#For the time card line, if the '''Certified Job''' check box is selected and a '''Union Local''' is specified, the system selects the ''Union Wage'' and ''Prevailing Wage'' rate types that match the settings specified in the time card line. Then the system compares the most specific labor cost rate that has been found in the previous step with the selected labor cost rates of the ''Union Wage'' and ''Prevailing Wage'' rate types. Based on the comparison, the system selects the higher labor cost rate.

==Assigning Time Cards for Approval==
Depending on the company policy, time cards may need to be approved by authorized employees before they can be released. The time card approval functionality is available if the ''Approval Workflow'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

Time cards are assigned for approval automatically according to the assignment rules that are included in the assignment map, which you create on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_55_00|Assignment and Approval Maps] ([~/?ScreenId=EP205500|EP205500]) form. To apply these rules, you need to specify the created map as the time card approval map by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_10_10_00|Time and Expenses Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=EP101000|EP101000]) form; if no assignment map has been specified there or if a time card meets none of the specified map's conditions, the time card automatically becomes approved. {br}

The system assigns a time card for approval when the time card is completed and the employee changes its status from ''On Hold'' to ''Open''. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Organization\EP__con_Assignment_Automation|Managing Assignment and Approval Maps].
==Approving Time Cards==
A time card cannot be released until it has been approved (if approval is required). If you are an approver, you can approve time cards in bulk by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) form, or you can approve time cards one at a time by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_50_00|Employee Time Card] ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]) form.((({S:Warn}If the ''Time Reporting on Activity'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form, you cannot release a time card unless all the activities included in the time card have been approved (if required).
)))
==Approving Activities==
A time activity can be associated with a project task that has an approver specified. If this is the case, the time activity must be approved before it can be released for billing. Either the project task approver or the project manager can approve the time activity.{br}

You can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_70_10|Approve Time Activities] ([~/?ScreenId=EP507010|EP507010]) form to approve activities that require your approval. If you use time cards, you can approve time activities in groups by approving time card summaries on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_70_30|Approve Time Activity Summaries] ([~/?ScreenId=EP507030|EP507030]) form.{br}

When the activities are released, the system tracks costs for specific customers, cases, contracts, or projects and generates the corresponding project transactions or customer invoices.
==Using Corrective Time Cards==
If a released time card doesn&rsquo;t reflect the actual time that the employee spent on activities during the week (for example, if the employee reported 40 hours instead of actual 45 hours), the employee can create a corrective time card by opening the released time card on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_50_00|Employee Time Card] ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]) and clicking '''Actions''' &gt; '''Correct''' on the form toolbar.{br}

The data from the original time card is copied to the corrective time card, which has ''Correction'' in the '''Type''' box and the reference number of the original time card in the '''Orig. Reg. Nbr.''' read-only box. The employee can adjust the data of the corrective time card as needed before submitting it for approval (if required). After that, the original time card, because it has been replaced by the corrective time card, is no longer available on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_40_60_00|Employee Time Cards] ([~/?ScreenId=EP406000|EP406000]) inquiry form.{br}

When the corrective time card is released, new transactions are generated for only the difference in the reported hours on this card as compared to the original time card.{br}

A released corrective time card can also be corrected.((({S:Warn}You can correct equipment time cards in a similar way by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_80_00|Equipment Time Card] ([~/?ScreenId=EP308000|EP308000]) form.
)))
==Combining Time Cards and Time Activities==
In Acumatica ERP, an employee can report working hours by using time cards in combination with time activities. The reported data from a time activity instantly becomes available in one of the employee&rsquo;s time cards. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_50_00|Employee Time Card] form, the employee can view details of all time activities associated with a particular time card.{br}

A time card can be approved only if all the activities associated with the time card have been approved. When the time card is released, the associated activities are released automatically. An activity cannot be released on its own if it is associated with a time card.{br}

A project transaction may be created during time card release if any of the activities included in the time card is associated with a project. (Alternatively, the same project transaction may be generated if the activity is associated with a billable case, and the case is billed directly to the customer before the time card is released. For details about direct case billing, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CR__con_Case_Billing|Case Billing].) Such transactions can be used for tracking the project costs. (For more information about project cost tracking, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__con_Budget_Tracking|Project Budgets].)
==Using Equipment Time Cards==
By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_80_00|Equipment Time Card] ([~/?ScreenId=EP308000|EP308000]) form, employees can enter equipment time cards or update existing ones, which gives them the ability to report the time they spend using particular equipment. The processing of equipment time cards is similar to the processing of employee time cards, including the usage of corrective time cards.{br}

Equipment time cards can be associated with specific projects and project tasks. Also, you can use the approval functionality to make sure that before they are released, equipment time cards are approved by the authorized approvers. You can specify the approval map for equipment time cards on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_10_10_00|Time and Expenses Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=EP101000|EP101000]) form; however, if you have not specified the assignment map or if a time card meets none of the specified map's conditions, the time card automatically becomes approved.]]></column>

For example, on the table toolbar of the  Activity      History  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, you can click       Add Activity  to open the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR306010|CR306010]) Activity form and add an     activity to the selected project. Accessing Time Cards On the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]) Employee Time Card (EP305000) form, you can create, view, or adjust any of     the following time cards: Your time cards Time cards of the employees for whom you are an appointed delegate Time cards of the employees who report to you Time cards assigned to you for approval Time cards of employees in the workgroups at lower levels in the company tree than your      workgroup On the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) Approvals (EP503010) form, you can access the     following time cards: Those assigned to you Those assigned to other users in your workgroup Those escalated from users in workgroups at a lower level in the company tree but in your      workgroup's node Processing Time Cards As a rule, each time card passes through several stages, which might include preparation,     approval, and release. The processing stage of a time card is indicated by its status. Preparing Time Cards When preparing a time card, an employee reports work time by creating separate detail records     for the following types of activities: Those associated with different projects or project tasks Those related to different earning types Those that are billable and those that are non-billable  Creating Labor Cost Rates On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM209900|PM209900]) Labor Cost Rates (PM209900) form, you can view and edit the existing     labor cost rates. Labor costs can be specified at particular detail levels—that is, for     particular entities or groups of entities. You can create labor cost rates of the following     types and detail levels: Labor Item : The labor item Employee : The employee and optionally the labor item Project : The project and optionally any of the following: the project task, the      employee, and the labor item Union Wage : The union local and labor item Prevailing Wage : The project and labor item You can view, edit, and create labor cost rates of the  Union Wage  and  Prevailing      Wage  types if the  Construction  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. For each labor cost rate, you specify the effective date. If there are multiple labor cost     rates with the same settings, the system uses the rate with the actual effective date—that is,     with the most recent effective date that precedes the current date. You can also create a labor     cost rate with the same settings as an existing labor cost rate but with an effective date later     than the latest effective date of the existing labor cost rate. When you specify the rate for a line with a selected labor item, you specify the rate for the     base unit of measure (UOM) of the labor item. For example, suppose that you have the  TRAINING  labor item, whose base UOM is       UNIT . According to the conversion rules specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) Units of Measure (CS203100) form, one unit equals four hours. On the        ([~/?ScreenId=PM209900|PM209900]) Labor Cost Rates form, when you add a labor cost rate with an employee and the       TRAINING  labor item, you should specify the rate for the base UOM, which is  UNIT ,     even if the unit consists of four hours. When the employee enters a time card on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]) Employee Time Card (EP305000) form and select in a time activity the       TRAINING  labor item, the time is reported in hours even though the base UOM of the     selected item is not an hour. When the time card with the corresponding time activities is     released, the system generates a project transaction with the  TRAINING  labor item in the     base UOM of the item. If the employee has reported eight hours, the transaction contains two       TRAINING  units. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM209900|PM209900]) Labor Cost Rates (PM209900) form, when you create a labor cost rate       with a labor item with a base UOM that is not an hour, make sure that you enter the rate for       the base UOM of the labor item so that the system calculates the correct amount when a time       activity with this labor item is released. The base UOM of the labor item should be convertible into minutes so that the system can       convert the base UOM to a minute and vice versa. That is, there should be the conversion rules       from a minute to the base UOM on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) Units of Measure (CS203100)       form. Retrieving Labor Cost Rates When you create a time card on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]) Employee Time Card (EP305000)     form, for each line, you select the employee, project, project task, labor item, date, union     local, certified job, and worker compensation code. The  Certified Job ,  Union Local , and       WCC Code  columns are shown on the  Summary  and       Details  tabs of the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]) Employee Time Card form if     the  Construction  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features     (CS100000) form. The system automatically selects the  Certified Job  check box in the     time card line if for the corresponding project, the  Certified Job  check     box is selected in the  Project Properties  section on the       Summary  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects     (PM301000) form. You can clear this check box if it has been selected or select it manually, if     needed. The system automatically populates the  Union Local  column in the time     card line by using the settings of the employee and the project as follows: If the employee has a  Union Local ID  specified in the        Employee Settings  section on the  General Info       tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) Employees (EP203000) form and the project has no      union local specified on the  Union Locals  tab of the of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, the system inserts the union local of the      employee into the column. If the employee has a  Union Local ID  specified in the        Employee Settings  section on the  General Info       tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) Employees form and this union local is one of the      union locals of the project specified on the  Union Locals  tab of the of      the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, the system inserts the union local of      the employee into the column. If the employee has a  Union Local ID  specified in the        Employee Settings  section on the  General Info       tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) Employees form and this union local is not one of      the union locals of the project specified on the  Union Locals  tab of the      of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, the system leaves the        Union Local  column blank. If the employee has no  Union Local ID  specified in the        Employee Settings  section on the  General Info       tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) Employees form, the system leaves the        Union Local  column blank. In the time card, you can clear a  Union Local  value that has been     selected or select a union local manually, if needed. For each time card line, the system retrieves the cost rate for the specified employee,     project, project task, labor item, date, union local, and certified job as follows: Among labor cost rates of the  Project ,  Employee , and  Labor Item  rate      types, the system selects the most specific existing labor cost rate that matches all the      settings specified in the time card line. The following list shows the sets of settings of the      labor cost rate, from the most specific to the least specific: The  Project  rate type, project, project task, employee, labor item, and effective        date The  Project  rate type, project, project task, employee, and effective date The  Project  rate type, project, project task, labor item, and effective date The  Project  rate type, project, project task, and effective date The  Project  rate type, project, employee, labor item, and effective date The  Project  rate type, project, employee, and effective date The  Project  rate type, project, labor item, and effective date The  Project  rate type, project, and effective date The  Employee  rate type, employee, labor item, and effective date The  Employee  rate type, employee, and effective date The  Labor Item  rate type, labor item, and effective date For the time card line, if the  Certified Job  check box is selected      and a  Union Local  is specified, the system selects the  Union Wage       and  Prevailing Wage  rate types that match the settings specified in the time card line.      Then the system compares the most specific labor cost rate that has been found in the previous      step with the selected labor cost rates of the  Union Wage  and  Prevailing Wage       rate types. Based on the comparison, the system selects the higher labor cost rate. Assigning Time Cards for Approval Depending on the company policy, time cards may need to be approved by authorized employees     before they can be released. The time card approval functionality is available if the       Approval Workflow  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000)     form. Time cards are assigned for approval automatically according to the assignment rules that are     included in the assignment map, which you create on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP205500|EP205500]) Assignment and Approval Maps (EP205500) form. To apply these rules, you need to specify the created map as     the time card approval map by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP101000|EP101000]) Time and Expenses Preferences (EP101000)     form; if no assignment map has been specified there or if a time card meets none of the     specified map's conditions, the time card automatically becomes approved.  The system assigns a time card for approval when the time card is completed and the employee     changes its status from  On Hold  to  Open . For more information, see  Managing Assignment and Approval Maps. Approving Time Cards A time card cannot be released until it has been approved (if approval is required). If you     are an approver, you can approve time cards in bulk by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) Approvals     (EP503010) form, or you can approve time cards one at a time by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]) Employee Time Card (EP305000) form. If the  Time Reporting on Activity  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features form, you cannot release a time card unless all the activities     included in the time card have been approved (if required). Approving Activities A time activity can be associated with a project task that has an approver specified. If this     is the case, the time activity must be approved before it can be released for billing. Either     the project task approver or the project manager can approve the time activity. You can use the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP507010|EP507010]) Approve Time Activities (EP507010) form to approve activities that     require your approval. If you use time cards, you can approve time activities in groups by     approving time card summaries on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP507030|EP507030]) Approve Time Activity Summaries (EP507030) form. When the activities are released, the system tracks costs for specific customers, cases,     contracts, or projects and generates the corresponding project transactions or customer     invoices. Using Corrective Time Cards If a released time card doesn't reflect the actual time that the employee spent on activities     during the week (for example, if the employee reported 40 hours instead of actual 45 hours), the     employee can create a corrective time card by opening the released time card on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]) Employee Time Card (EP305000) and clicking  Actions  >       Correct  on the form toolbar. The data from the original time card is copied to the corrective time card, which has       Correction  in the  Type  box and the reference number of the     original time card in the  Orig. Reg. Nbr.  read-only box. The employee can     adjust the data of the corrective time card as needed before submitting it for approval (if     required). After that, the original time card, because it has been replaced by the corrective     time card, is no longer available on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP406000|EP406000]) Employee Time Cards (EP406000) inquiry     form. When the corrective time card is released, new transactions are generated for only the     difference in the reported hours on this card as compared to the original time card. A released corrective time card can also be corrected. You can correct equipment time cards in a similar way by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP308000|EP308000]) Equipment Time Card (EP308000) form. Combining Time Cards and Time Activities In  Acumatica ERP,     an employee can report working hours by using time cards in combination with time activities.     The reported data from a time activity instantly becomes available in one of the employee's time     cards. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]) Employee Time Card form, the employee can view details of all time     activities associated with a particular time card. A time card can be approved only if all the activities associated with the time card have been     approved. When the time card is released, the associated activities are released automatically.     An activity cannot be released on its own if it is associated with a time card. A project transaction may be created during time card release if any of the activities     included in the time card is associated with a project. (Alternatively, the same project     transaction may be generated if the activity is associated with a billable case, and the case is     billed directly to the customer before the time card is released. For details about direct case     billing, see  Case Billing.) Such transactions can be used for     tracking the project costs. (For more information about project cost tracking, see  Project Budgets.) Using Equipment Time Cards By using the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP308000|EP308000]) Equipment Time Card (EP308000) form, employees can enter equipment     time cards or update existing ones, which gives them the ability to report the time they spend     using particular equipment. The processing of equipment time cards is similar to the processing     of employee time cards, including the usage of corrective time cards. Equipment time cards can be associated with specific projects and project tasks. Also, you can     use the approval functionality to make sure that before they are released, equipment time cards     are approved by the authorized approvers. You can specify the approval map for equipment time     cards on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP101000|EP101000]) Time and Expenses Preferences (EP101000) form; however, if you have not specified     the assignment map or if a time card meets none of the specified map's conditions, the time card     automatically becomes approved. ]]></column>

To avoid any issues, restore the ''U100'' dataset to its initial state.
))){br}{TOC}
==Story==
Suppose that your company has provided consultation to a customer. The customer used three of your company&rsquo;s consultants: Pam Brawner, a project manager; Todd Bloom, who is a senior consultant; and Alberto Jimenez, a junior consultant. The project accountant needs to define labor cost rates to be able to capture the labor cost on the project. The employees need to create time cards to track their work time. The project accountant also needs to create the invoice for the customer. You will perform the needed actions in the system, acting as the project accountant and the employees.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this lesson, the following features have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form:[anchor|#_afb58088-fa3b-45e7-9a90-cac07cc119c3]
*''Project Accounting'', which provides support for the project accounting functionality
*''Time Reporting on Activity'', which provides the ability to track the time your employees spend on activities by including the time-tracking information in the activities

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, the ''CONSULTJR'', ''CONSULTSR'', and ''CONSULTPM'' inventory items have been created.
==Process Overview==
Before you work with time cards and activities to track work spent on projects and project tasks, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_99_00|Labor Cost Rates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209900|PM209900]) form, you define labor cost rates for employees (and optional inventory items and projects). If approval of time activities is required, you configure the approver for a project task on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. {br}

For employees whose settings require the creation of time cards, you create and view time cards on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_40_60_00|Employee Time Cards] ([~/?ScreenId=EP406000|EP406000]) form, where you can also release the time cards. You approve time cards that require approval on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_70_30|Approve Time Activity Summaries] ([~/?ScreenId=EP507030|EP507030]) form. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_10_00|Project Transaction Details] ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) form, you review the transactions created based on the released time activities.
==System Preparation==

#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select ''1/30/2020'' on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.

==Step 1: Reviewing the Configuration of Acumatica ERP for Time Tracking==
To review the settings predefined in the ''U100'' data template for time tracking, you need to review labor items—that is, non-stock items of the ''Labor'' type with the ''HOUR'' base unit of measure—and then employees associated with these items. Do the following:[anchor|#_438c172c-2e37-481c-ac37-8bf0f046253f]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, make sure that the settings of the non-stock items listed in the table below are the ones specified here.
#:{| class="checklist" | width="100%"

|- 
| <tt>CONSULTPM</tt>
| ''Project Manager''
|  ''LABOR''
|  ''HOUR''
|}
#:Based on the settings of the ''LABOR'' posting class of the items, the expense account of the items is the ''54100 - Project Labor Expense'' account, which is mapped to the ''LABOR'' expense account group, and the sales account of the items is the ''40000 - Sales Revenue'' account, which is mapped to the ''REVENUE'' income account group.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form, review the settings of the ''EP00000001 - Pam Brawner'' employee.
#:On the '''General Info''' tab, the employee has the ''CONSULTPM'' non-stock item selected as the '''Labor Item''' and the employee’s login is ''brawner'' (see the following screenshot).[anchor|#_09c2b4d9-dc3e-42a9-9bf6-84fc612d5cdf][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_Tracking_Time3.png|popup|The labor item associated with the employee|450px]
#Review the settings of the ''EP00000002 - Todd Bloom'' employee. On the '''General Info''' tab, the employee should have the ''CONSULTSR'' labor item defined and the ''bloom'' login.
#Review the settings of the ''EP00000004 - Alberto Jimenez'' employee. On the '''General Info''' tab, the employee should have the ''CONSULTJR'' labor item defined and the ''jimenez'' login.

You have reviewed the settings predefined in the ''U100'' data template that you will use in the lesson. In the next step, you will defined employee costs.
==Step 2: Configuring Labor Cost Rates==
You can define employee costs with labor cost rates. You can configure labor cost rates specific to different factors, including the employee, labor item, project, project task, and rate type. To configure labor cost rates, do the following:[anchor|#_a7fc6e3b-d40e-45c3-8b1a-031a0a172a9b]
#On the[HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_99_00|Labor Cost Rates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209900|PM209900]) form, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings to add a new labor cost rate for Alberto Jimenez:
#*'''Labor Rate Type''': ''Employee''
#* '''Employee''': ''EP00000004''
#* '''Rate''': <tt>40.00</tt>
#*'''Effective Date''': <tt>1/1/2020</tt>
#:Notice that the system has automatically selected the ''CONSULTJR'' labor item associated with the employee.
#Click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings to add a labor cost rate for Todd Bloom with the following settings:
#*'''Labor Rate Type''': ''Employee''
#* '''Employee''': ''EP00000002''

#Again click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings to add a labor cost rate for Pam Brawner with the following settings:
#*'''Labor Rate Type''': ''Employee''
#* '''Employee''': ''EP00000001''
#* '''Labor Item''': ''CONSULTPM''
#* '''Rate''': <tt>48.00</tt>
#*'''Effective Date''': <tt>1/1/2019</tt>
#:The configured labor cost rates should look like those shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_b7553cee-80d6-4941-a963-5b75219f9e73][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_Tracking_Time11.png|popup|The configured labor cost rates|450px]
#Save your changes to the labor cost rates.

You have defined employee costs. In the next step, you will create a project.
==Step 3: Creating a Project==
To create a project, do the following:[anchor|#ol_hxb_32q_wbb]

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Project Time Tracking: Process Activity The following hands-on exercise will walk you through the process of tracking                 billable hours and employees’ work time. The following activity is based on the                  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system settings             have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the activity             and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100  dataset             to its initial state. Story Suppose that your company has provided consultation to a customer. The customer used                 three of your company's consultants: Pam Brawner, a project manager; Todd Bloom, who                 is a senior consultant; and Alberto Jimenez, a junior consultant. The project                 accountant needs to define labor cost rates to be able to capture the labor cost on                 the project. The employees need to create time cards to track their work time. The                 project accountant also needs to create the invoice for the customer. You will                 perform the needed actions in the system, acting as the project accountant and the                 employees. Configuration Overview For the purposes of this lesson, the following features have been enabled on the                       ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form: Project Accounting , which provides support for the project accounting                     functionality Time Reporting on Activity , which provides the ability to track the time                     your employees spend on activities by including the time-tracking information in                     the activities On the    ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form, the  CONSULTJR ,                      CONSULTSR , and  CONSULTPM  inventory items have been created. Process Overview Before you work with time cards and activities to track work spent on projects and                 project tasks, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM209900|PM209900]) Labor Cost Rates (PM209900) form, you define                 labor cost rates for employees (and optional inventory items and projects). If                 approval of time activities is required, you configure the approver for a project                 task on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form.  For employees whose settings require the creation of time cards, you create and view                 time cards on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP406000|EP406000]) Employee Time Cards (EP406000) form, where you can                 also release the time cards. You approve time cards that require approval on the                       ([~/?ScreenId=EP507030|EP507030]) Approve Time Activity Summaries (EP507030) form. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) Project Transaction Details (PM401000) form, you review the transactions created                 based on the released time activities. System Preparation To sign in to the system and prepare to perform the instructions of the activity, do                 the following: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website and sign in as Pam Brawner using the  brawner  login and                          123  password. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP             screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to  1/30/2020. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and             select  1/30/2020 on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and             process all documents in the system during this business date. Step 1: Reviewing the Configuration of  Acumatica ERP for Time Tracking To review the settings predefined in the  U100  data template for time tracking,                 you need to review labor items—that is, non-stock items of the  Labor  type                 with the  HOUR  base unit of measure—and then employees associated with these                 items. Do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form, make sure that the                     settings of the non-stock items listed in the table below are the ones specified                         here. Inventory ID Description General                                             Settings  Tab Posting Class Base Unit CONSULTJR Junior Consultant LABOR HOUR CONSULTSR Senior Consultant LABOR HOUR CONSULTPM Project Manager LABOR HOUR Based on the settings of the  LABOR  posting class of the items,                         the expense account of the items is the  54100 - Project Labor Expense                          account, which is mapped to the  LABOR  expense account group, and the                         sales account of the items is the  40000 - Sales Revenue  account,                         which is mapped to the  REVENUE  income account group. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) Employees (EP203000) form, review the settings of                     the  EP00000001 - Pam Brawner  employee. On the  General                             Info  tab, the employee has the  CONSULTPM  non-stock                         item selected as the  Labor Item  and the employee’s                         login is  brawner  (see the following screenshot). The labor item associated with the employee Review the settings of the  EP00000002 - Todd Bloom  employee. On the                          General Info  tab, the employee should have the                          CONSULTSR  labor item defined and the  bloom  login. Review the settings of the  EP00000004 - Alberto Jimenez  employee. On the                          General Info  tab, the employee should have the                          CONSULTJR  labor item defined and the  jimenez  login. You have reviewed the settings predefined in the  U100  data template that you                 will use in the lesson. In the next step, you will defined employee costs.

In Acumatica ERP, you can create project budget forecasts and compare these forecasts with the actual project costs and incomes for each financial period.{br}

The functionality of project budget forecasts is available only if the ''Budget Forecast'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.[anchor|#section_fdf_x42_p2b]
==Creation of the Project Budget Forecast==
You can create a project budget forecast on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_96_00|Project Budget Forecast] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209600|PM209600]) form. You can forecast original and revised budget amounts and quantities for existing project budget lines for financial periods of the master calendar. Each project can have multiple revisions of the budget forecast. In a forecast revision, you can distribute the amounts and quantities of the project budget among the financial periods in the selected range to speed data entry. You can create generic inquiries and pivot tables that display forecast data.{br}

For a new project budget forecast, in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_96_00|Project Budget Forecast] form, you select the related project and enter an alphanumeric revision identifier of the budget forecast, which must be unique within the project. When you enter the revision, the system automatically fills in the table with the budget lines of the selected project.{br}

In the Summary area, you can also specify any of the following selection criteria to view in the table only the project budget lines with the selected settings:[anchor|#ul_fsf_yfs_p2b]
*'''Project Task''': The applicable project task of the selected project
*'''Type''': The account group type of the budget line, which is ''Expense'' by default
*'''Account Group''': The account group of the budget line
*'''Inventory ID''': The applicable stock or non-stock item
*'''Cost Code''': The applicable cost code; this box appears on the form only if the ''Cost Codes'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_96_00|Project Budget Forecast] form, you can also create a new revision of the project budget forecast as a copy of the selected revision by clicking '''Copy Revision''' on the form toolbar; you can then modify the created copy.[anchor|#section_xv2_f1w_mcb]
==Distribution of Budget Values for Forecast Periods==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_96_00|Project Budget Forecast] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209600|PM209600]) form, you can add financial periods for project budget lines of the selected forecast revision in any of the following ways:[anchor|#_30f2fa21-7594-4792-9c85-d4c9d04548ac]
*Click the project budget line in the table, and on the table toolbar, click '''Add Periods'''. The system opens the '''Add Periods''' dialog box, where you can manually select the range of financial periods for the selected project budget line.
*On the form toolbar, click '''Generate Periods''' to automatically add financial periods for all the project budget lines that are listed in the table based on the selection criteria specified in the Summary area. For each line, the system adds periods in the range of periods that it selects as follows:
**As the starting financial period of the range, the system selects the earliest of the following periods, subject to the additional conditions specified:
***The financial period to which the '''Planned Start Date''' of the project task, which has been specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form, belongs.
***The financial period to which the first actual or change order amount of the project budget lines related to the project task was posted.
***The financial period to which the '''Start Date''' of the project task, which has been specified on the '''Tasks''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, belongs. This option is applicable only if no planned start date is found for the project task and no actual or change order amount has been posted for the project budget lines related to the project task.
***The financial period to which the '''Start Date''' of the project, which has been specified on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, belongs. This option is applicable only if no start date is found for the project task.
**As the ending financial period of the range, the system selects the latest of the following periods:
***The financial period to which the '''Planned End Date''' of the project task, which has been specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] form, belongs
***The financial period to which the last actual or change order amount of the budget line was posted

For the project budget lines, the system adds lines with quantities and amounts of zero for the periods.{br}

You can manually specify the '''Original Budgeted Quantity''', '''Original Budgeted Amount''', '''Revised Budgeted Quantity''', and '''Revised Budgeted Amount''' values for each period line of the project budget line.{br}

You can also distribute the quantities and amounts of project budget lines among period lines automatically. To do this, on the form toolbar, you click '''Distribute'''. In the '''Distribute''' dialog box, which is opened, you do the following:[anchor|#_7bc5bb69-9e69-4762-b0ab-cf3d5a4108b7]
*In the '''Value''' section, you select one of the following option buttons to define which values the system should distribute:
**'''Distribute Total''': The system distributes the values of the project budget line between all the period lines equally. All the values that have already been specified for the period lines will be overridden.
**'''Add Delta''': The system adds the delta, which is the difference between the values of the project budget line and the total values of the period lines, to all the period lines in proportion to the values that have been already specified for period lines.
*In the '''Columns''' section, you can select the check boxes corresponding to the columns in which the system should distribute values.
*In the '''Rows''' section, you specify whether the system should distribute values for all the project budget lines in the table or only for the project budget line you have selected in the table.

When you click '''OK''' in the dialog box, the system distributes the quantities and amounts of the listed project budget lines (which are those to which the system applied the selection criteria you specified in the Summary area) among period lines. The distribution function rounds equally distributed values using the built-in logarithmic rounding algorithm.{br}

For each project budget line, in the '''Original Budgeted Quantity''', '''Original Budgeted Amount''', '''Revised Budgeted Quantity''', and '''Revised Budgeted Amount''' columns, the system calculates the following values:[anchor|#_eb8115b3-a136-4595-93c5-02e6ce127d45]
*'''Total''': The total of the period lines
*'''Delta''': The difference between the value of the project budget line and the total of the period lines

==An Example of Rounding by the Distribution Function==
When the system automatically distributes the quantities and amounts of a project budget line among period lines, the {{DistibuteRound}} distribution function rounds equally distributed values using the built-in logarithmic rounding algorithm.{br}

The {{DistibuteRound(value, rowCount)}} function has the following values as the input parameters:[anchor|#_7b2da504-7bd5-4db4-a39d-7fdf291a5970]
*{{value}}: The quantity or amount of the project budget line to be distributed divided by the {{rowCount}}
*{{rowCount}}: The number of period lines to distribute the quantity or amount of the project budget line among

Rounding on a logarithmic scale is accomplished by taking the log of the amount and doing normal rounding to the nearest value on the log scale. Using the rounded value, which has been calculated, the system calculates the leftover for the last period line.{br}

The following example shows the way the system rounds a distributed amount.{br}

Suppose that the original budgeted amount to distribute is ''1,176.00''. The number of period lines to distribute the amount among is five. Thus, {{rowCount = 5}} and {{value = 1,176.00 / rowCount = 235.2}}{br}

The {{DistributeRound}} function rounds the {{value}} and returns {{240}}, which is the nearest number on the log scale. The leftover for the last period line is {{1,176.00 - ((rowCount - 1) * 240) = 216}}.{br}

Thus, the distribution function splits the original budgeted amount among five period lines as follows: [anchor|#_4c01e0e9-65d8-4089-910c-a561e6451310]
*''240.00'': Period lines from the first one to the fourth
*''216.00'': The last period line

==Integration Between Forecasts and Projects==
From the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, you can navigate to the last modified revision of the project budget forecast on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_96_00|Project Budget Forecast] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209600|PM209600]) form by clicking '''Inquiries''' > '''Project Budget Forecast''' on the form toolbar. If the project has no budget forecast, a new budget forecast revision is created for the project.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_96_00|Project Budget Forecast] form, you can click any project budget line and then click '''Update Forecast Lines''' on the table toolbar to update the selected project budget line of the forecast revision. For this selected line, the system adds the financial periods to which actual values or change order values have been posted for the project budget line and that have been missed in the forecast revision.{br}

On the table toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_96_00|Project Budget Forecast] form, you can also click '''Update Project Budget Line''' to update the values of the corresponding project budget line on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form with the delta values of the selected line of the forecast revision. The original values of the project budget can be updated if the project budget is not locked. The revised values of the project budget can be updated if the change order workflow is disabled for the project. That is, if the '''Change Order Workflow''' check box is selected on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Project Properties''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Budget Forecasts: General Info In  Acumatica ERP, you can create project budget forecasts and compare these forecasts with the 				actual project costs and incomes for each financial period. The functionality of project budget forecasts is available only if the  Budget 					Forecast  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features 				(CS100000) form. Creation of the Project Budget Forecast You can create a project budget forecast on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM209600|PM209600]) Project Budget Forecast 				(PM209600) form. You can forecast original and revised budget amounts and quantities 				for existing project budget lines for financial periods of the master calendar. Each 				project can have multiple revisions of the budget forecast. In a forecast revision, 				you can distribute the amounts and quantities of the project budget among the 				financial periods in the selected range to speed data entry. You can create generic 				inquiries and pivot tables that display forecast data. For a new project budget forecast, in the 				 Summary  				area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM209600|PM209600]) Project Budget Forecast form, you select the related project and 				enter an alphanumeric revision identifier of the budget forecast, which must be 				unique within the project. When you enter the revision, the system automatically 				fills in the table with the budget lines of the selected project. In the Summary area, you can also specify any of the following selection criteria to 				view in the table only the project budget lines with the selected settings: Project Task : The applicable project task of the selected 					project Type : The account group type of the budget line, which is 						 Expense  by default Account Group : The account group of the budget line Inventory ID : The applicable stock or non-stock item Cost Code : The applicable cost code; this box appears on 					the form only if the  Cost Codes  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features 					(CS100000) form On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM209600|PM209600]) Project Budget Forecast form, you can also create a new revision of 				the project budget forecast as a copy of the selected revision by clicking 					 Copy Revision  on the form toolbar; you can then modify 				the created copy.

In Acumatica ERP, integration with human resource management (HRM) and payroll systems is available through the contract-based API. This can give you the following capabilities:[anchor|#ul_fdn_hcf_z2b]
*Integration with a construction-specific payroll system, including the ability to upload projects, project tasks, and cost codes from Acumatica ERP, which serves as the primary source of the project data
*Support of standard labor costs for projects along with actual labor costs, which are calculated and received from a construction-specific payroll system
*The proper calculation of union wages and prevailing wages in a construction-specific payroll system, which is possible due to users specifying additional settings when they enter employee time in Acumatica ERP
*The importing of employee time from a construction-specific payroll system to Acumatica ERP as time entries to be used for labor cost accounting in projects
{br}{TOC}
==Basic Integration Scenario==
A basic scenario for integration between Acumatica ERP 2020 R1 and a payroll system involves the following steps:[anchor|#ol_gdn_hcf_z2b]
#An employee logs his or her activity in Acumatica ERP by creating time entries on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_70_00|Employee Time Activities] ([~/?ScreenId=EP307000|EP307000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_50_00|Employee Time Card] ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]), or [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_10|Activity] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306010|CR306010]) form.
#After the time entries have been approved (if applicable) and released, they are exported to an external payroll system, where they can be processed further.
#When the entries have been processed in the external payroll system, the GL transactions created based on the entries are imported to Acumatica ERP.
#When the GL transactions have been verified in Acumatica ERP, the transactions are released and posted to the general ledger.

The following options can be used for the implementation of the integration:[anchor|#ul_idn_hcf_z2b]
*An option to not post any project transactions on release of time activities. To use this option, you select ''Do not Post'' as the '''Posting Option''' in the '''Time Reporting Settings''' section of the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_10_10_00|Time and Expenses Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=EP101000|EP101000]) form.
*An option to not create project transactions on release of general ledger transactions with the specified project. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_Import_of_GL_Transactions|Creation of a General Ledger Transaction with a Project Code That Does Not Produce a Project Transaction].

==Interfaces for Integration==
To integrate an external payroll system with Acumatica ERP, you can use the following endpoints, which are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_70_60|Web Service Endpoints] ([~/?ScreenId=SM207060|SM207060]) form, to access web services:[anchor|#ul_hdn_hcf_z2b]
*The ''TimeEntry'' endpoint of the ''18.200.001'' version for employee time entries
*The ''JournalTransaction'' endpoint of the ''18.200.001'' version for general ledger transactions
*The ''LaborCostRate'' endpoint of the ''18.200.001'' version for standard labor cost rates
*The ''Default'' endpoint of the ''18.200.001'' version for the remaining entities
