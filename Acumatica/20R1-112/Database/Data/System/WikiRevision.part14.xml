The payroll functionality of Acumatica ERP is used to set up, enter, and maintain employee payroll records and transactions.{br}

You also can use the payroll forms to complete the following tasks:[anchor|#ul_khp_v3q_zv]
*Set up employee payroll classes, which create default settings that can speed data entry of new employee records because the payroll information is grouped according to common factors, such as pay groups and work locations.
*Create batches for processing multiple employees at a time (a typical pay run process) or easily create one-time checks to handle special circumstances. Data from the Acumatica ERP time entry system could be automatically brought into payroll, along with sales commission data, if required. 
*Use predefined inquiries and reports to view current and historical payroll information and pay activity for one employee or a selected group of employees.
*For direct deposits, automatically create the ACH file for the transfer of funds directly to employee bank accounts.
*Post General Ledger activity allocated in many possible ways.
*Automatically generate tax and deduction liability invoices to the accounts payable, and payment information to the cash management forms for bank reconciliation.

This topic covers the prerequisites and preparatory steps that must be completed before you begin configuring the payroll functionality.
==Prerequisites and Dependencies==[anchor|#ol_tjd_13n_dw]
#The license for Acumatica ERP should include the ''Payroll'' feature, and the feature should be enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__How_To_Enable_Feature|To Enable or Disable a Feature].
#The initial system configuration must be completed and the General Ledger functionality must be configured before you implement payroll. The payroll functionality can be tightly integrated with other Acumatica ERP functional areas, including general ledger, accounts payable, organization structure, and time and expenses. These areas do not require any change in their configuration when payroll is implemented; however, the functionality to be integrated with payroll should be implemented before payroll. (Enabling time tracking is not needed.)

==Preparation==
You should start the implementation of the payroll functionality by collecting and analyzing the necessary information. Perform the following steps before you actually configure; these steps do not need to be done in the listed order. [anchor|#table_rlm_qln_dw]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="20%" ! Item
!width="80%" ! Description
|- 
| '''Define GL accounts'''
| 
Because payroll uses GL accounts and subaccounts for payroll-related transactions, define the necessary expense and liability accounts and subaccounts and determine which of these accounts will be used by default for records of the following:[anchor|#_257d0c76-9b62-4680-9034-9077b57d4255]
*''Earnings'': An expense account is used to record the earnings.
*''Deductions'': A liability account is used to record the deduction from employee paycheck.
*''Benefits'': An expense account is used to record the benefit to employee paycheck and a liability account to off-set the benefit expense account.
*''Taxes'': An expense account is used to record the taxes and a liability account to off-set the tax expense account.

Review the existing chart of accounts and add missing accounts (if needed) by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_20_25_00|Chart of Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=GL202500|GL202500]) form.
|- 
| '''Define payment methods and cash accounts'''
| 
Define which payment methods are to be used to generate paychecks for the employee. Mark these payment methods as available for use in payroll, by selecting the '''Use in PR''' check box in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_40_00|Payment Methods] ([~/?ScreenId=CA204000|CA204000]) form.{br}

For each payment method define a cash account to be used to generate paychecks for the employee. Mark these cash accounts as available for use in payroll, by selecting the '''Use in PR''' check box on the '''Allowed Cash Accounts''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_40_00|Payment Methods] ([~/?ScreenId=CA204000|CA204000]) form.{br}

A special export scenario, ''Export PR Payment to ACH Balanced'', was created to handle specific requirement for Payroll direct deposit.
|- 
| '''Configure vendors'''
| Define and configure vendors you will need while working with payroll, such as tax agencies, benefit providers and unions. For details on vendor configuration, see [HelpRoot_Financials\Vendor_GeneralInfo|Vendors: General Information].
|- 
| '''Design numbering sequences'''
| Design the numbering sequences to be used to numerate documents generated by payroll. We recommend using naming conventions in numbering sequences to differentiate payroll documents from other documents generated in the system. For details on creating numbering sequences, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Multiple_Numbering_Sequences|Numbering Sequence Usage].
|- 
| '''Design roles'''
| 
Design the roles you need for users who will work with the Payroll forms. We recommend configuring the following security roles: [anchor|#ul_ddb_bpn_dw]
*''PR Clerk'': Payroll clerk. This role gives the user the ability to process payroll on a recurring basis and to print reports and view inquiries; it does not grant access to change setup and configuration information in the Payroll forms. 
*''PR Manager'': Payroll manager. This role gives the user access rights to all payroll functionality.

For details on configuring user roles, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Role-Based_Access|Role-Based Access].

|  '''Set up the work calendar'''
| Use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_90_00|Work Calendar] ([~/?ScreenId=CS209000|CS209000]) form to set up the work calendar.
On the '''Calendar Settings''' tab, specify the number of work hours per day. Indicate any unpaid break time during the work day, so that if your company has a 9-hour work day with an hour off for lunch, the system calculates 8 paid hours.{br}

On the '''Exceptions''' tab, specify holidays, to define when holiday pay must be paid to employees who work instead of regular pay.
|- 
| '''3'''
|  '''Specify your preferences for the Payroll module'''
| Use the [HelpRoot_Payroll\PR_10_10_00|Payroll Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PR101000|PR101000]) form to configure the general settings of payroll.
Click the '''Update Tax Definitions''' button on the form toolbar to fetch tax information to the system by downloading the latest details from the Tax Symmetry engine. It may include adding new taxes, deleting taxes that are not used anymore, updating the tax attributes.{br}

On the '''General Info''' tab, specify the following settings:[anchor|#_474fa4c3-f6eb-4099-8757-125dbae89ec8]
*In the '''Numbering Settings''' section, select the numbering sequences you created on the preparation stage.
*In the '''Posting and Retention Settings''' section, specify default source of GL accounts, subaccount masks (if any), and other posting settings.
*Fill in the rest of the check boxes as appropriate for your requirements.

On the '''Tax Attributes''' tab, select the different settings linked to the taxes at the company level.{br}

On the '''Transaction Date Exceptions''' tab, review the list holidays, add missing exception dates, if any. The system uses the list to define when bank holidays are happening to shift transaction date when creating pay periods.
|- 
| '''4'''
|  '''Set up earning types'''
| Use the [HelpRoot_Payroll\PR_10_20_00|Earning Type Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=PR102000|PR102000]) form to set up earning types. 
Earning types are the ways in which you can pay an employee. For the predefined earning types, make sure that the settings are specified the way you want them in your organization. Also, if you want a particular earning type to be always assigned to a specific project, you can set it up on this form.
|- 
| '''5'''
|  '''Specify earning type preferences for the Payroll module'''
| Use the [HelpRoot_Payroll\PR_10_10_00|Payroll Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PR101000|PR101000]) form to configure earning type preferences.

Regular earning type for quick pay will only display the earning type code with the Salary category. The holidays earning type for quick pay will only display earning type code with the Time Off category and the commission earning type will only display earning code with the Amount-Based category. {br}

Select the Enable Piecework option as an Earning Type, if you plan to use it.
|- 
| '''6'''
|  '''Set up work locations'''
| On the [HelpRoot_Payroll\PR_10_10_40|Work Locations] ([~/?ScreenId=PR101040|PR101040]) form, for each location where work is to be performed, enter all the address information through the postal code. 
Then click '''Get Tax Codes''' in the ''Tax Location Info'' section, and the system will populate the '''Tax Location Code''' box. Then you can click the '''View Tax List''' button to see a list of taxes that may be applicable for this address. Click '''Add Tax Code''' for each tax that is applicable to add its code to the system. Also, you can use the Export to Excel button to generate a list of these taxes to use for setting up your taxes on the [HelpRoot_Payroll\PR_10_30_00|Tax Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=PR103000|PR103000]) form.
|- 
| '''7'''
|  '''Set up tax codes'''
| 
Use the [HelpRoot_Payroll\PR_10_30_00|Tax Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=PR103000|PR103000]) form to set up all of the tax codes you need. {br}

We recommend adding a tax code by using the '''Possible Taxes for this Location''' dialog box that you can open by clicking the '''View Tax List''' button available on the [HelpRoot_Payroll\PR_20_30_00|Employee Payroll Settings] ([~/?ScreenId=PR203000|PR203000]) and [HelpRoot_Payroll\PR_10_10_40|Work Locations] ([~/?ScreenId=PR101040|PR101040]) forms.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_Payroll\PR_10_30_00|Tax Codes] form, for each tax, you specify vendor (tax agency), default attribute settings, and general ledger accounts.{br}

Note that the attributes at the bottom of the form are different depending on the state.
|- 
| '''8'''
|  '''Set up deduction and benefit codes'''
| On the [HelpRoot_Payroll\PR_10_10_60|Deduction and Benefit Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=PR101060|PR101060]) form, set up your deduction and benefit codes.
You can set up each deduction or benefit code to be only a deduction, only a benefit, or both a deduction and a benefit. Also, you can specify if it is subject to all taxes, no taxes, or specific taxes, in which case you need to add the taxes that it is subject to.{br}

For health care related benefits, you will be able to set up the information related to the ACA reporting to populate the information on the '''ACA Reporting''' tab. You will also need to create one benefit code flagged as Workers’ Compensation for each state your company is operating in and assign the rate for each code on the '''Worker’s Compensation''' tab.
|- 
| '''9'''
|  '''Set up pay groups,pay calendars, and pay periods'''
| Use the [HelpRoot_Payroll\PR_20_50_00|Pay Groups] ([~/?ScreenId=PR205000|PR205000]) form to set up pay groups. 
A pay group reflects a group of people that get paid in the same frequency.{br}

For each pay group click the '''Calendar''' button on the form toolbar, which navigates to the [HelpRoot_Payroll\PR_20_60_00|Payroll Calendar] ([~/?ScreenId=PR206000|PR206000]) form. By using this form, you define pay period frequency and pay dates.{br}

For a pay group for which a calendar has been configured generate pay periods on the [HelpRoot_Payroll\PR_20_10_00|Pay Periods] ([~/?ScreenId=PR201000|PR201000]) form.
|- 
| '''10'''
|  '''Set up PTO banks'''
| 
Use the [HelpRoot_Payroll\PR_20_40_00|PTO Banks] ([~/?ScreenId=PR204000|PR204000]) form to define various PTO banks (accrual plans) for your employees.
|- 
| '''11'''
|  '''Set up unions'''
| Use the [HelpRoot_Payroll\PR_20_97_00|Union Locals] ([~/?ScreenId=PR209700|PR209700]) form to configure the different unions the employees are part of. Different earning rates can be applied to different rank inside a union and the specific benefits and deductions can be added on this form (they will be added to the paycheck)
|- 
| '''12'''
|  '''Set up certified projects (Construction Only)'''
| Use the [HelpRoot_Payroll\PR_20_99_00|Certified Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PR209900|PR209900]) form to set up the payroll related information for government linked projects. Different earning rates can be applied to different types of labor, specific benefits and deductions can be added and fringe benefit rate specified on this form (they will be added to the paycheck).
|- 
| '''13'''
|  '''Set up employee classes'''
| Use the [HelpRoot_Payroll\PR_20_20_00|Employee Class] ([~/?ScreenId=PR202000|PR202000]) form to set up payroll classes.
By using employee classes, you can specify certain information as the default settings for employees, including the employee type, pay group, location, union, and paid time off. This information can be overridden at the employee level later. Every change made at this level will propagate to the employee level if the '''Use class default value''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_Payroll\PR_20_30_00|Employee Payroll Settings] ([~/?ScreenId=PR203000|PR203000]) form.
|- 
| '''14'''
|  '''Set up employees'''
| Use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form to set up your employees. Acumatica ERP includes this general-purpose employee maintenance form to record basic setup information about employees for use in a number of different areas, such as Projects, Customer Management, and Time and Expenses. Payroll also uses this basic information, and then adds its own additional required information that is needed for processing payroll-specific transactions. 
Because of this, all employees must first be set up in the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] form; you need to fill in the general information (especially the employee’s address for tax purposes), the work calendar (to calculate the number of hours worked by the employee during a week and put the labor item to default in the payroll transactions), the employment history (including the employee’s current position and hire date; some validations will be run to prevent the user from paying an employee before start date or after end date), and the GL accounts that are required.
|- 
| '''15'''
|  '''Specify employee payroll settings'''
| On the [HelpRoot_Payroll\PR_20_30_00|Employee Payroll Settings] ([~/?ScreenId=PR203000|PR203000]) form, you will be able to create new payroll employee. When creating a new payroll employee, the system will bring up each employee that was created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] form and that are not yet payroll employee and add payroll data upon selection. Specify the following settings:[anchor|#ul_cb2_rnm_1w]
*On the '''General Info''' tab, if you need to change the defaults that were set up for the employee class, clear the '''Use class default value''' check box next to each box you need to change and then make your change.
*Once you are done setting up the other default settings, click '''Get Tax Codes'''. The tax engine will look at the employee address and get the tax location code that pertains to the location of the employee. Next, click '''View Tax List''' to display a list of taxes that may be applicable for this employee based on the employee’s tax location code. If a tax code has not been added for a particular tax, click '''Add Tax Code''' on the table toolbar. Then you can select the check box to the left of each applicable tax, and click '''Assign Selected Taxes to Employee''' to automatically set up the selected taxes for this employee. All the taxes from the home address and the work address of the employee should be added to the record. The tax engine will calculate the appropriate tax according to the tax settings.
*On the '''Tax Settings''' tab enter the social security number for the employee as well as all the items that pertain to your employee taxes.
*On the '''Taxes''' tab, make sure that all taxes that apply to this employee have been set up (home taxes and work location taxes). If you select a tax on the top panel, the system displays the attributes that belong to that tax on the bottom panel. Fill in the items that apply.
*On the '''Compensation''' tab, add the earning types that will be used as the normal earnings (wages) that apply to your employee. Select the pay rate, such as hourly or annual (or miscellaneous for Piecework). Also, you should enter a start date for each earning type. If you enter an earning type with the same code, you’ll also have to specify an end date for the previous rate.
*On the '''Deductions and Benefits''' tab, enter those items that apply to the employee that you are setting up. You can change the default settings if you clear the '''Use Deduction Defaults''' or '''Use Contribution Defaults''' check box.
*On the '''Paid Time Off''' tab, review the settings that have been copied from the employee class. You can change the default settings if you clear the corresponding '''Use PTO Banks from Employee Class''' check box.
*On the '''Payment Settings''' tab, specify a payment method and a cash account and enter the direct deposit information for the employee. Employees can distribute their pay into an unlimited number of bank accounts.
*On the '''GL Accounts''' tab, specify general lender accounts to be used for this employee.

|- 
| '''16'''
|  '''Configure overtime rules'''
| 
Use the [HelpRoot_Payroll\PR_10_40_00|Overtime Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PR104000|PR104000]) form to set up overtime rules.{br}

To use this functionality, create earning types with the ''Overtime'' option selected in the '''Earning Type Category''' box on the [HelpRoot_Payroll\PR_10_20_00|Earning Type Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=PR102000|PR102000]). For such earning types you can configure a list of overtime rules to be applied to an employee pay check.

No. Action Description 1 Configure the structure of the organization On the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP201500|EP201500]) Departments (EP201500) and   ([~/?ScreenId=EP201000|EP201000]) Positions         (EP201000) forms, make sure that departments and positions are properly configured for your          organization. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) Companies (CS101500) form, configure the          company-level data that will appear on government forms such as W-2 and ACA forms. Specify          if the taxes are filed by branches or not. If the taxes are filed by branches, on the             ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) Branches (CS102000) form, configure the company-level data that          will appear on government forms such as W-2 and ACA forms. 2 Set up the work calendar Use the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS209000|CS209000]) Work Calendar (CS209000) form to set up the work          calendar. On the  Calendar Settings  tab, specify the number of work          hours per day. Indicate any unpaid break time during the work day, so that if your company          has a 9-hour work day with an hour off for lunch, the system calculates 8 paid          hours. On the  Exceptions  tab, specify holidays, to define when          holiday pay must be paid to employees who work instead of regular pay. 3 Specify your preferences for the Payroll module Use the   ([~/?ScreenId=PR101000|PR101000]) Payroll Preferences (PR101000) form to configure the general         settings of payroll. Click the  Update Tax Definitions  button on the          form toolbar to fetch tax information to the system by downloading the latest details from          the Tax Symmetry engine. It may include adding new taxes, deleting taxes that are not used          anymore, updating the tax attributes. On the  General Info  tab,          specify the following settings: In the  Numbering Settings  section, select the numbering           sequences you created on the preparation stage. In the  Posting and Retention Settings  section, specify default           source of GL accounts, subaccount masks (if any), and other posting settings. Fill in the rest of the check boxes as appropriate for your requirements. On the  Tax Attributes  tab, select the different settings          linked to the taxes at the company level. On the  Transaction Date           Exceptions  tab, review the list holidays, add missing exception dates, if any.          The system uses the list to define when bank holidays are happening to shift transaction          date when creating pay periods. 4 Set up earning types Use the   ([~/?ScreenId=PR102000|PR102000]) Earning Type Codes (PR102000) form to set up earning types.           Earning types are the ways in which you can pay an employee. For the predefined earning          types, make sure that the settings are specified the way you want them in your          organization. Also, if you want a particular earning type to be always assigned to a          specific project, you can set it up on this form. 5 Specify earning type preferences for the Payroll module Use the   ([~/?ScreenId=PR101000|PR101000]) Payroll Preferences (PR101000) form to configure earning type          preferences. On the  General Info  tab, in the            Miscellaneous Settings  section, you will be able to define the          different earning codes used for the creation of the payroll batches when using quick pay          process.  Regular earning type for quick pay will only display the earning type code          with the Salary category. The holidays earning type for quick pay will only display earning          type code with the Time Off category and the commission earning type will only display          earning code with the Amount-Based category.  Select the Enable Piecework option as          an Earning Type, if you plan to use it. 6 Set up work locations On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PR101040|PR101040]) Work Locations (PR101040) form, for each location where work         is to be performed, enter all the address information through the postal code.  Then click            Get Tax Codes  in the  Tax Location Info  section, and the          system will populate the  Tax Location Code  box. Then you can click          the  View Tax List  button to see a list of taxes that may be          applicable for this address. Click  Add Tax Code  for each tax that is          applicable to add its code to the system. Also, you can use the Export to Excel button to          generate a list of these taxes to use for setting up your taxes on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PR103000|PR103000]) Tax Codes (PR103000) form. 7 Set up tax codes Use the   ([~/?ScreenId=PR103000|PR103000]) Tax Codes (PR103000) form to set up all of the tax codes          you need.  We recommend adding a tax code by using the  Possible Taxes for this           Location  dialog box that you can open by clicking the  View Tax           List  button available on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PR203000|PR203000]) Employee Payroll Settings (PR203000) and             ([~/?ScreenId=PR101040|PR101040]) Work Locations (PR101040) forms. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PR103000|PR103000]) Tax Codes form, for each tax, you specify vendor (tax          agency), default attribute settings, and general ledger accounts. Note that the attributes at the bottom of the form are different depending on the          state. 8 Set up deduction and benefit codes On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PR101060|PR101060]) Deduction and Benefit Codes (PR101060) form, set up your deduction and         benefit codes. You can set up each deduction or benefit code to be only a deduction, only          a benefit, or both a deduction and a benefit. Also, you can specify if it is subject to all          taxes, no taxes, or specific taxes, in which case you need to add the taxes that it is          subject to. For health care related benefits, you will be able to set up the          information related to the ACA reporting to populate the information on the  ACA           Reporting  tab.  You will also need to create one benefit code flagged as         Workers’ Compensation for each state your company is operating in and assign the rate for         each code on the  Worker’s Compensation  tab. 9 Set up pay groups,pay calendars, and pay periods Use the   ([~/?ScreenId=PR205000|PR205000]) Pay Groups (PR205000) form to set up pay groups.  A pay          group reflects a group of people that get paid in the same frequency. For each pay          group click the  Calendar  button on the form toolbar, which navigates          to the   ([~/?ScreenId=PR206000|PR206000]) Payroll Calendar (PR206000) form. By using this form, you define pay          period frequency and pay dates. For a pay group for which a calendar has been          configured generate pay periods on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PR201000|PR201000]) Pay Periods (PR201000)         form. 10 Set up PTO banks Use the   ([~/?ScreenId=PR204000|PR204000]) PTO Banks (PR204000) form to define various PTO banks          (accrual plans) for your employees. 11 Set up unions Use the   ([~/?ScreenId=PR209700|PR209700]) Union Locals (PR209700) form to configure the different         unions the employees are part of. Different earning rates can be applied to different rank         inside a union and the specific benefits and deductions can be added on this form (they will         be added to the paycheck) 12 Set up certified projects (Construction Only) Use the   ([~/?ScreenId=PR209900|PR209900]) Certified Projects (PR209900) form to set up the payroll related         information for government linked projects. Different earning rates can be applied to         different types of labor, specific benefits and deductions can be added and fringe benefit         rate specified on this form (they will be added to the paycheck). 13 Set up employee classes Use the   ([~/?ScreenId=PR202000|PR202000]) Employee Class (PR202000) form to set up payroll          classes. By using employee classes, you can specify certain information as the default          settings for employees, including the employee type, pay group, location, union, and paid          time off. This information can be overridden at the employee level later. Every change made          at this level will propagate to the employee level if the  Use class default           value  check box is selected on the    ([~/?ScreenId=PR203000|PR203000]) Employee Payroll Settings (PR203000)          form. 14 Set up employees Use the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) Employees (EP203000) form to set up your employees.  Acumatica ERP includes this general-purpose employee maintenance form to record basic setup information         about employees for use in a number of different areas, such as Projects, Customer         Management, and Time and Expenses. Payroll also uses this basic information, and then adds         its own additional required information that is needed for processing payroll-specific         transactions.  Because of this, all employees must first be set up in the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) Employees form; you need to fill in the general information (especially          the employee’s address for tax purposes), the work calendar (to calculate the number of          hours worked by the employee during a week and put the labor item to default in the payroll          transactions), the employment history (including the employee’s current position and hire          date; some validations will be run to prevent the user from paying an employee before start          date or after end date), and the GL accounts that are required. 15 Specify employee payroll settings On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PR203000|PR203000]) Employee Payroll Settings (PR203000) form, you will be able to create new         payroll employee. When creating a new payroll employee, the system will bring up each         employee that was created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) Employees form and that are not yet         payroll employee and add payroll data upon selection. Specify the following settings: On the  General Info  tab, if you need to change the defaults that           were set up for the employee class, clear the  Use class default            value  check box next to each box you need to change and then make your           change. Once you are done setting up the other default settings, click  Get Tax            Codes . The tax engine will look at the employee address and get the tax           location code that pertains to the location of the employee. Next, click  View            Tax List  to display a list of taxes that may be applicable for this employee           based on the employee’s tax location code. If a tax code has not been added for a           particular tax, click  Add Tax Code  on the table toolbar. Then you           can select the check box to the left of each applicable tax, and click  Assign            Selected Taxes to Employee  to automatically set up the selected taxes for           this employee. All the taxes from the home address and the work address of the employee           should be added to the record. The tax engine will calculate the appropriate tax according           to the tax settings. On the  Tax Settings  tab enter the social security number for the           employee as well as all the items that pertain to your employee taxes. On the  Taxes  tab, make sure that all taxes that apply to this           employee have been set up (home taxes and work location taxes). If you select a tax on the           top panel, the system displays the attributes that belong to that tax on the bottom panel.           Fill in the items that apply. On the  Compensation  tab, add the earning types that will be used           as the normal earnings (wages) that apply to your employee. Select the pay rate, such as           hourly or annual (or miscellaneous for Piecework). Also, you should enter a start date for           each earning type. If you enter an earning type with the same code, you’ll also have to           specify an end date for the previous rate. On the  Deductions and Benefits  tab, enter those items that apply           to the employee that you are setting up. You can change the default settings if you clear           the  Use Deduction Defaults  or  Use Contribution            Defaults  check box. On the  Paid Time Off  tab, review the settings that have been           copied from the employee class. You can change the default settings if you clear the           corresponding  Use PTO Banks from Employee Class  check box. On the  Payment Settings  tab, specify a payment method and a cash           account and enter the direct deposit information for the employee. Employees can           distribute their pay into an unlimited number of bank accounts. On the  GL Accounts  tab, specify general lender accounts to be           used for this employee. 16 Configure overtime rules Use the   ([~/?ScreenId=PR104000|PR104000]) Overtime Rules (PR104000) form to set up overtime rules. To use this functionality, create earning types with the  Overtime  option selected          in the  Earning Type Category  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PR102000|PR102000]) Earning Type Codes (PR102000). For such earning types you can configure a list of          overtime rules to be applied to an employee pay check. ]]></column>

You can review and modify the details of each individual paycheck on the [HelpRoot_Payroll\PR_30_20_00|Pay Checks and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=PR302000|PR302000]) form. Depending on the selected type of the payment and its current status, you can use the form for a number of different purposes, all related to the maintenance of paycheck information, as described below.{br}

You will only be able to create one ''regular'' and one ''special'' type of paycheck for an employee during a specific pay period, but you’ll be able to create as many adjustment and special documents as needed. If you open a pay period that already has a paycheck, the system will redirect you either to the paycheck or to the payroll batch if the batch is not released yet (you can remove the paycheck from the batch to create one manually for the selected pay period).{br}

For each pay period, the system will automatically calculate and fetch the right pay rate. If the employee has been assigned a yearly salary, the system will use the number of hours per week and the number of weeks worked during the year to calculate an hourly rate. If the rate is hourly, no calculation is done.{br}

Once this rate is calculated, it will be compared to rates set for the certified project if the employee worked on a certified project or to rates set for a union if the employee is part of a union. The system will select the highest rate it could find an apply it to the hours linked with the union or the project.{br}

Also, you can use this form to review and process direct deposits. The settings on this form are used for both printed checks and direct deposits; depending on the payment method selected, the system will default from the option set up on the [HelpRoot_Payroll\PR_20_30_00|Employee Payroll Settings].{br}{TOC}
==Calculation Logic==
You can use the [HelpRoot_Payroll\PR_30_20_00|Pay Checks and Adjustments] form for reviewing or modifying the details associated with a particular employee’s paycheck before it is printed or released. After changes are made, you need to click '''Actions''' > '''Calculate''' on the form toolbar. {br}

If some paycheck was created for a prior pay period, the system will prevent you from calculating the paycheck and force you to release the previous one. It ensures that the YTD, QTD and MTD information are always up to date.{br}

The calculation process will launch the overtime rules validation and create new earning lines if some rules were triggered. It will then, calculate the deduction and benefit amounts to apply to the paycheck. It will make sure the package from the unions and certified projects are applied if configured. Afterward, it will call the web service to fetch the right rate to apply to the employee taxes. Finally, it will accrue the paid time off and disburse it if an earning linked to a bank was entered in the earning details.{br}

Calculation is not automatic after each change because each time you need to invoke the '''Calculate''' action, and frequent recalculations by the tax calculation engine could slow the system down. But the system will make sure that you recalculate the paycheck every time it is needed.
==Pay Checks and Adjustments==
The [HelpRoot_Payroll\PR_30_20_00|Pay Checks and Adjustments] form may also be used to make any necessary adjustments. You can also use the form to enter employee beginning balances, typically by entering one check per employee per month or per quarter. You can enter negative amounts on the form, which may result in a negative net check if you select the ''Adjustment'' option in the '''Type''' box.{br}

You can enter the data on the '''Earnings and Hours''' tab and then click '''Actions''' > '''Calculate''' on the form toolbar to have the system populate the '''Deductions''' and '''Taxes''' tabs. You can then override any or all amounts in order to make the net check come out as you need it to.{br}

For taxes, you need to make sure the amount entered in the tax is equal to the amount entered in the tax details and tax split when using the labor item or earning type as the source of the expense accounts or if you assign the labor burden to the project (the source of the expense accounts can be specified on the [HelpRoot_Payroll\PR_10_10_00|Payroll Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PR101000|PR101000]) form).
==Voiding of Paychecks==
The [HelpRoot_Payroll\PR_30_20_00|Pay Checks and Adjustments] form may be used to void any check in the system. You can void a check once it has been released; but as soon as you create the liabilities generated from a paycheck, you will not be able to void the paycheck.{br}

When you click '''Actions''' > '''Void''' on the form toolbar, all payroll information—such as gross pay, taxable wages, taxes, deductions, benefits, and sick time and PTO accrual—is automatically updated.{br}

Upon release of the voided check record, GL posting amounts are automatically generated into a GL batch. For GL accounts and amounts, the system uses the activity previously generated for the check, reversing all amounts, rather than using the current system configuration, because the configuration may have changed since the check was originally released.{br}

The system marks the original check as being voided and keeps a record of the voided-check activity.{br}

In most cases, a voided payroll check needs to be immediately replaced by a new check that is either identical to (in the case of a lost check) the original check or very similar to (in the case of a check that contained some mistake) it. ]]></column>

Typically, employees are not paid on an individual basis but based on membership of a group. You will divide your workforce in pay groups that will have the same schedule of pay period (weekly, biweekly, monthly). By using the [HelpRoot_Payroll\PR_30_10_00|Payroll Batches] ([~/?ScreenId=PR301000|PR301000]) form, you can create paychecks for a specific pay group.{br}

First, you select the type of batch you want to create (regular, special or adjustment), specify a pay group and pay period. Note that you won’t be able to select employees that are not part of the pay group during the pay period selected. If an employee already has a regular paycheck for the pay period selected, the system will display a warning and you won’t be able to select this employee for the pay run. For special type, no restrictions apply.
==Adding Employees==
On the '''Document Details''' tab, you add employees by clicking the '''Add Employee''' button on the table toolbar. In the '''Add Employee''' dialog box you can do one of the following:[anchor|#_4c6aaf3d-d767-426f-8d72-573e24b13e57]
*Use the ''Quick Pay'' functionality which will bring hours using the calendar assigned to the employee by selecting the '''Pre-Populate with Employee Defaults (Quick Pay)''' check box. To populate the earning code, the system uses the settings specified on the [HelpRoot_Payroll\PR_10_10_00|Payroll Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PR101000|PR101000]) form.
*Import the time from the released time activities entered for the employee bringing all the details linked to them by selecting the '''Time Activities (will override defaults as applicable)''' check box.
*Import the unpaid commission by selecting the '''Sales Commissions''' check box. It will create an amount-based earning line for each employee having unpaid commissions. The check box is available if the ''Commissions'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.

You can review and modify earning details for each employee by clicking the '''Earning Details''' button on the table toolbar. {br}

You’ll now have the gross pay calculated for each employee. But you might want to exclude a specific deductions or benefits or to prevent the system from using an overtime rule for a specific batch of employees. By navigating to the '''Deductions and Benefits''' and '''Overtime Rules''' tabs, you will be able to deactivate specific item just for this payroll batch.{br}

Upon the release of the batch, the system will create a paycheck for each employee selected and you will be able to process them as normal paycheck. You will still need to calculate the paychecks to apply the taxes, deductions and benefits, print the paycheck and then release it.]]></column>

Form ID:  ([~/?ScreenId=PR101060|PR101060]){br}

You use this form to maintain deduction and benefit codes. A deduction code reduces the employee net pay and a benefit code increases the cost of payroll for the company. In Acumatica ERP, there is no actual difference between deduction and benefit codes for payroll calculation purposes—both may include an employee (deduction) and an employer (contribution) component, both may involve complex calculation methods, and both may or may not be subject to various taxes.{br}

By using this form, you can do the following: [anchor|#ul_d54_4ly_xv]
*Define deduction and benefit codes, whether it is an employee deduction, an employer contribution or both. Code settings define how the system calculates benefits and deductions at a paycheck level. Upon release of the paycheck, the system creates liabilities for each code assigned to an employee. 
*Specify the vendor that is owed the liability.
*Specify how this item affects taxes.
*Specify the information related to the health insurance plan for ACA (Affordable Care Act) reporting purpose. 
*Specify if the code is keeping track of the workers’ compensation liabilities for a specific state. You need to create a benefit code for each state. The changes you make to rate and effective date on the '''WC Code''' tab will be propagated to the [HelpRoot_Payroll\PR_20_98_00|Work Class Compensation Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=PR209800|PR209800]) form after you save the changes.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Deduction and Benefit Codes Form ID:  (PR101060)  ([~/?ScreenId=PR101060|PR101060])You use this form to maintain deduction and benefit codes. A deduction code reduces the         employee net pay and a benefit code increases the cost of payroll for the company. In  Acumatica ERP, there is no actual difference between deduction and benefit codes for payroll         calculation purposes—both may include an employee (deduction) and an employer         (contribution) component, both may involve complex calculation methods, and both may or may         not be subject to various taxes. By using this form, you can do the following:  Define deduction and benefit codes, whether it is an employee deduction, an employer           contribution or both. Code settings define how the system calculates benefits and           deductions at a paycheck level. Upon release of the paycheck, the system creates           liabilities for each code assigned to an employee.  Specify the vendor that is owed the liability. Specify how this item affects taxes. Specify the information related to the health insurance plan for ACA (Affordable Care           Act) reporting purpose.  Specify if the code is keeping track of the workers’ compensation liabilities for a           specific state. You need to create a benefit code for each state. The changes you make to           rate and effective date on the  WC Code  tab will be propagated to           the   ([~/?ScreenId=PR209800|PR209800]) Work Class Compensation Codes (PR209800) form after you save the changes.

But the                   code stays on the paycheck for the YTD information. Is Garnishment A check box that indicates (if selected) that the code is to be used for a                 garnishment. Garnishments require additional settings at the employee level and are                 subject to special calculation rules. That is, you need to specify details on the                    Deductions and Benefits  tab on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PR203000|PR203000]) Employee Payroll Settings form.

|- 
| '''Earning Type'''
| The unique identifier used to specify the type of earnings that this employee is eligible for. Only earning codes with the category ''Piecework'' or ''Salary'' are available. 
|- 
| '''Description'''
| The name of the earning type.
|- 
| '''Active'''
| A check box that indicates (if selected) that the system will process this earning type during the paycheck calculation process.
|- 
| '''Pay Rate'''
| The rate of pay for this specific employee, based on the unit of pay specified in the next column. For salaried employees, this may be an annual salary amount. 
|- 
| '''Unit of Pay'''
| The way the pay rate is applied. The following options are available:[anchor|#ul_wtw_wgp_wv]
*''Hour'': For all earnings paid by the hour
*''Year'': For salaries
*''Miscellaneous'': For such items as piecework, commissions or bonuses

|- 
| '''Start Date'''
| The date when this earning type came (or comes, if it is a future date) into effect for this employee. This date can serve two possible purposes:[anchor|#ul_qmr_jyn_zw]
*To pre-enter future pay rates, such as raises that take effect on a certain date
*To establish a historical record of raises (for instance, rather than just changing the rate when a pay increase occurs, to deactivate the current record and create a new record with a new starting date)

If there is more than one active record per earning type, the system uses the start date to determine which rate to use based on the date the work occurred (not the payment date). The start date must be unique for each employee and earning type; for example, the employee cannot have two different records, both of type ''NT'', that have the same start date.
|- 
| '''End Date'''
| The date when this earning type became inactive for this employee. This date serves to establish a historical record of raises (for instance, when the record is deactivated, to record the date when this took effect).
Specifying the end date is required when you clear the '''Active''' check box.{br}

This box is available if the '''Active''' check box is cleared.

| The method used if multiple deductions have the same sequence in order to determine what to do if there are not enough wages left to cover all of the equal-sequence deductions. The following options are available:[anchor|#_3a3dd688-69ff-402a-8899-8f0235f775e7]
*''Even'': The remaining amount is divided evenly between the deductions.
*''Pro-Rata'': The remaining amount is divided through proration. For example, if deduction A is $300 and deduction B is $100, then A is 75% of the total of the two deductions; therefore, A receives 75% of the remaining amount, and B receives 25%, as opposed to the ''Even'' method, in which case both A and B would receive 50%.

|- 
| '''Maximum Percent of Net Pay for all Garnishments'''
| The maximum percent of net pay that can go to garnishments.
|- 
| '''Use Class Default Value'''
| 
A check box that indicates (if selected) that the value is not stored directly in the employee record; it instead is always copied from the employee class record.{br}

If the '''Use Class Default Value''' check box is cleared, the applicable employee class default value is copied to the employee record, from which it can then be modified as needed. In this case, subsequent changes to the box&rsquo;s value at the employee class level no longer affect this specific employee’s setting for that box.

|- 
| '''Start'''
| 
The date when this deduction or benefit came (or comes) into effect for this employee. This date serves two possible purposes:[anchor|#ul_y3r_1k4_zw]
*To pre-enter future codes (that is, codes that take effect at a certain point in time)
*To establish a historical record of deductions and benefits (for instance, rather than just changing the rate when a pay increase occurs, to deactivate the current record and create a new record with a new starting date)

If there is more than one active record per code, the system uses the start date to determine which code to use based on the payment date. The start date must be unique for each employee and each code; for example, the employee cannot have two different records, both of type ''401K'', that have the same start date. The system compares the transaction date on the paycheck and the start date to define when to apply the code.

If the particular  Use Class Default Value  check box is cleared, the         applicable employee class default value is copied to the employee record, from which it can         then be modified as needed. In this case, subsequent changes to the box's value at the         employee class level no longer affect this specific employee’s setting for that box. Address Info Section If you update the address information for the employee on this form             the system automatically updates this information on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) Employees             (EP203000) form. The opposite is true, if you update the address information on the                 ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) Employees (EP203000) form the system updates it in the payroll             record. Element Description Address Line 1 The home address of the employee. Address Line 2 The second line of the home address (if needed). City The city of the employee address. Country The country of the employee address. Select the country from the list of                 two-letter country codes, which are defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS204000|CS204000]) Countries/States (CS204000) form. State The state of the employee address. If a list is available, select the state                 from the list of states in the country you selected above. If no list is available,                 you can modify the list of states by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS204000|CS204000]) Countries/States form. Postal Code The postal code for the employee address. Tax Location Info Section Element Description Get Tax Codes A button you click to automatically populate the three boxes below in this                 section. The system uses the employee’s home address to identify the applicable                 local tax codes. In most cases, the  Tax Municipal Code  and                    Tax School Code  boxes remain blank after you click this                 button because very few locations have taxes at this level.  An error message is                   displayed if the employee address has not been entered or a tax location code                   cannot be generated. Tax Location Code The unique identifier for the location where the employee lives. The meaningful                 description of the code is displayed to the right of the code by the Tax Engine                 program. Tax Municipal Code The code used for local taxes at the municipal level. (Most locations do not                 have this type of tax.) Tax School Code The code used for local taxes at the school district level. (Most locations do                 not have this type of tax.) View Tax List A button you click to view a list of all taxes that apply to this location, as                 described in the section below. If the applicable taxes have been configured on the                     ([~/?ScreenId=PR103000|PR103000]) Tax Codes (PR103000) form, they can be assigned to the                 employee on the current form. Employment Info Section Element Description Hire Date The date when the employee was appointed to this position. It displays the                 latest start date from the employment history. Termination Date The date when the employee was appointed to another position or the employee's                 employment in the company was terminated. View Tax List Pop-Up Panel This pop-up panel is displayed when you click the  View Tax List            button. Element Description Assign Taxes to Employee A button that you click to assign the taxes you have selected to the employee.                 When you click the button, the system checks if the current employee has each                 selected tax, and if not, the tax (including the appropriate tax attributes) is                 added for the employee.  If the tax has not yet been set up in  Acumatica ERP, the  Payroll Tax Code  column displays  <not set                     up>  and you cannot select that row. Included A check box that you select to indicate to the system that the tax is to be                 assigned to the employee when you click the  Assign Taxes to                   Employee  button. State The state of the tax. All federal taxes (that is, taxes with the location code                 set to 00-000-0000) are excluded from the list because they are automatically                 specified for all employees. Tax Location Code The location code returned by the tax engine for this tax. Tax Type Code The code extracted from the longer code that is returned from the tax engine.                 (It is the middle portion between the dashes after the location code; for instance,                 in the code  53-000-000-ER_SDI-000-*  the  ER_SDI  portion is                 extracted.)  This tax type must match the  PRTaxType.PrTaxTypeCD  record                   in the  PRTaxType  table; if not, then this indicates that the software is                   out of sync with the Symmetry Tax engine and a correction must be made. In this                   case, the values of the  Jurisdiction  and                      Category  columns are displayed as  <missing>                    rather than the applicable values from the  PRTaxType                  table. Description The description of the tax type code returned from the Tax Engine. Jurisdiction The tax jurisdiction, which can be one of the following:  State ,                    Local ,  Municipal , or  School District . Tax Category The tax category, which can be one of the following:  Employer Tax  or                    Employee Withholding . Tax Unique ID The unique tax identifier returned from the Tax Engine. Code The tax previously specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PR103000|PR103000]) Tax Codes form that                 matches the tax unique identifier specified in this row.  There may be more                   than one matching tax code; in this case, the system generates a record in the                   table for each matching tax code. This is very likely to occur for items such as                   workers compensation taxes where there are many different possible codes. If there                   is no matching tax code set up in the Payroll module, this column (and the next)                   displays  <not set up> . The lack of a matching tax code in the module                   does not necessarily indicate a setup issue, however, because many taxes may not                   be applicable to certain employers and so do not need to be set up. Tax Name The description specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PR103000|PR103000]) Tax Codes form for the                 tax code displayed above. Although in most cases this tax name is very similar to                 the description returned from the Tax Engine, this tax name is useful when multiple                 tax codes are displayed for the same tax type. General Info Section Element Description Class ID The identifier of the payroll class, which is used as a source of default                 values for the remainder of the boxes on this tab. A payroll class is used to group                 together certain types of employees; it may be used to establish certain default                 settings or for use in GL account postings.  Employee Type The type of employee employment, which determines the way the employee is                 compensated. The following options are available: Salaried Exempt : The employee is compensated based on salary, which is                     typically paid once or twice a month. Salaried Non-Exempt : The employee is compensated based on his or her                     salary, with overtime hours paid additionally. Hourly : The employee is paid (usually weekly or biweekly) based on                     hourly rate for hours worked. Other – piecework, commission only, etc. : The employee is compensated                     based on some other principle (for example, per item produced). Use Class Default Value Multiple check boxes. For each box with the corresponding  Use Class                   Default Value  check box selected, the box value is not stored directly                 in the employee record; instead, the value is always copied from the employee class                 record. Pay Group The employee pay group, which is a group that includes employees paid on the                 same pay period cycle. Calendar The work calendar to be used by default to import the hours to the payroll                 batch for quick pay and to calculate the number of hours worked during the week. You                 define work calendars by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS209000|CS209000]) Work Calendar (CS209000)                 form. Working Hours per Week The employee's standard number of working hours per week, which is used in                 combination with the work calendar to create standard earnings transactions for the                 quick pay functionality. Working Weeks per Year The employee's standard number of working weeks per year, which is used to                 calculate the number of working hours per year. Working Hours per Year The standard number of working hours per year, which is used to calculate                 hourly pay rates of salaried employees for some kinds of proration                 calculations. Exempt from Over time Rules A check box that indicates (if selected) that employee is not a subject to                 overtime rules. Net Pay Minimum The amount to be used when deductions and garnishments are applied. Net pay is                 not allowed to drop below this level (except on adjustments, which can go                 negative). Default Work Location The work location to be used as the default work location when transactions are                 entered if no specific work location is specified. The work location may be used to                 establish GL accounts for posting payroll transactions, as well as for state and                 local tax calculations. Default Union The union to be used as a default union when a transaction is entered if no                 specific union is specified. Unions may be used to override multiple different data                 entry parameters. You use the   ([~/?ScreenId=PR209700|PR209700]) Union Locals (PR209700) form to                 define unions. Default WC Code The work compensation code to be used as a default code when a transaction is                 generated on creation of a payroll batch and a paycheck if no specific code is                 specified. You use the   ([~/?ScreenId=PR209800|PR209800]) Work Class Compensation Codes (PR209800) form to define the                 codes. Tax Settings Tab The table on this tab includes all attributes loaded from the Tax Symmetry engine for tax         codes assigned to the employee. You can view the list of configured tax codes on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PR103000|PR103000]) Tax Codes (PR103000) form. The whole list of the attributes can be viewed         on the  Tax Attributes  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PR101000|PR101000]) Payroll Preferences         (PR101000) form. The table toolbar includes only standard buttons. For the list of standard buttons, see  Table Toolbar. Table Columns Column Description Description Read only. The description of the attribute. State Read only. The state in which the tax applies. For federal taxes, FED is                 displayed in the column. Value The value for this attribute.  This column is unavailable and displays the                   value specified at the payroll preferences level if the  Use                     Default  check box is selected. Use Default For each attribute with the  Use Default  check box selected                   in the row, the value is not stored directly in the employee record; it instead is                   always copied from the record in the payroll preferences. If the particular  Use Default  check box is cleared, the                   applicable default value is copied to the employee record, from which it can then                   be modified as needed. In this case, subsequent changes to the box's value at the                   payroll preferences level no longer affect this specific employee’s setting for                   that box. Taxes Tab In the table on this tab, you can specify all taxes that the employee is subject to.  The table toolbar includes only standard buttons. For the list of standard buttons, see  Table Toolbar. Table Columns Column Description Tax Code The unique identifier of the specific tax to be applied to this                 employee. Name The description of the selected tax code. Active A check box that indicates (if selected) that this tax code is available for                 use for this employee in the Payroll module. Tax Attributes Table In this table, you specify the values for the attributes required for the tax that is           currently selected in the table above. The table toolbar includes only standard buttons. For the list of standard buttons, see  Table Toolbar. Column Description Description The description of the attribute. Value The value for this attribute.  If the  Use Default                    check box (in the next column) is selected, this column is read-only and displays                   the value specified for the selected tax code. Use Default A check box that indicates (if selected) that the value for this attribute is                 not stored directly in the employee record but is always derived from the tax code                 record.  If the  Allow Employee Override  check box is                   cleared for the tax on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PR103000|PR103000]) Tax Codes (PR103000) form, then                   this check box is selected and read-only and the  Value  box                   displays the tax code and is also read-only. Required A check box that indicates (if selected) that an entry in the box is                 required. Compensation Tab In the table on this tab, the earning types are specified that may be used to capture hours         or pay rates for the employee. The table toolbar includes only standard buttons. For the list of standard buttons, see  Table Toolbar. Table Columns Column Description Earning Type The unique identifier used to specify the type of earnings that this employee                 is eligible for. Only earning codes with the category  Piecework  or                    Salary  are available.  Description The name of the earning type. Active A check box that indicates (if selected) that the system will process this                 earning type during the paycheck calculation process. Pay Rate The rate of pay for this specific employee, based on the unit of pay specified                 in the next column. For salaried employees, this may be an annual salary amount.                  Unit of Pay The way the pay rate is applied. The following options are available: Hour : For all earnings paid by the hour Year : For salaries Miscellaneous : For such items as piecework, commissions or bonuses Start Date The date when this earning type came (or comes, if it is a future date) into                 effect for this employee. This date can serve two possible purposes: To pre-enter future pay rates, such as raises that take effect on a certain                     date To establish a historical record of raises (for instance, rather than just                     changing the rate when a pay increase occurs, to deactivate the current record                     and create a new record with a new starting date) If there is more than one active record per earning type, the system uses                   the start date to determine which rate to use based on the date the work occurred                   (not the payment date). The start date must be unique for each employee and                   earning type; for example, the employee cannot have two different records, both of                   type  NT , that have the same start date. End Date The date when this earning type became inactive for this employee. This date                 serves to establish a historical record of raises (for instance, when the record is                 deactivated, to record the date when this took effect). Specifying the end date is                   required when you clear the  Active  check box. This                   box is available if the  Active  check box is                 cleared. Deductions and Benefits Tab In the table on this tab, you can specify any deductions and benefits that may be used for         the employee.  Summary Area Element Description Split Method The method used if multiple deductions have the same sequence in order to                 determine what to do if there are not enough wages left to cover all of the                 equal-sequence deductions. The following options are available: Even : The remaining amount is divided evenly between the                     deductions. Pro-Rata : The remaining amount is divided through proration. For                     example, if deduction A is $300 and deduction B is $100, then A is 75% of the                     total of the two deductions; therefore, A receives 75% of the remaining amount,                     and B receives 25%, as opposed to the  Even  method, in which case both A                     and B would receive 50%. Maximum Percent of Net Pay for all Garnishments The maximum percent of net pay that can go to garnishments. Use Class Default Value A check box that indicates (if selected) that the value is not stored directly in                   the employee record; it instead is always copied from the employee class                   record. If the  Use Class Default Value  check box is cleared, the                   applicable employee class default value is copied to the employee record, from                   which it can then be modified as needed. In this case, subsequent changes to the                   box's value at the employee class level no longer affect this specific employee’s                   setting for that box. Table Toolbar The table toolbar includes standard buttons and             buttons that are specific to this table. For the list of standard buttons, see  Table Toolbar. The table-specific buttons are             listed below. Button Description Garnishment Details Opens the Garnishment Details dialog box, where you can specify garnishment                 details of a particular employee and then view progress of its payment. Garnishment Details Dialog Box Column Description Vendor The unique identifier of a vendor to whom the garnishment is paid. Vendor Invoice Description The description of the vendor invoice. Court Name The name of the court that ordered the garnishment. Document ID The official government document  Court Date The court name assigned to the garnishment order. Original Amount The total amount that you enter if the garnishment is for a lump-sum amount                 that is eventually paid down by the garnishment withholding. If the garnishment is a                 regular, recurring type, enter zero. Amount Paid The life-to-date amount withheld for this garnishment for this                 employee. Table Columns Column Description Deduction Code The unique identifier for this deduction or benefit. Description The description of the deduction or benefit. Active A check box that indicates (if selected) that the system will process this code                 during the paycheck calculation process.. Deduction Amount The amount to be used for calculation if the calculation method for this                 deduction is set to  Fixed Amount  or  Amount per Hour .  Deduction Percent The percentage to be used for calculation if the calculation method for this                 deduction is set to  Percent of Gross  or  Percent of Net .  The                   read-only value in this column is derived from the deduction and benefit code                   record if the  Use Deduction Defaults  check box is                   selected. Deduction Max The deduction amount cap.  The read-only value in this column is derived from                   the deduction and benefit code record if the  Use Deduction                     Defaults  check box is selected. ACA Min. The amount that represents the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Minimum Individual                 Cost figure (see IRS ACA instructions for definition).  This column is available                   only if the deduction or benefit code is identified as an ACA type. Use Deduction Defaults A check box that indicates (if selected) that the values for this row are not                 stored directly in the employee record but are always derived from the deduction and                 benefit code record. Contribution Amount The amount to be used for calculation if the calculation method for the                 employer contribution is set to  Fixed Amount  or  Amount per Hour .                    The value of this read-only column is derived from the deduction and benefit                   code record if the  Use Contribution Defaults  check box is                   selected. Contribution Percent The percentage to be used for calculation if the calculation method for the                 employer contribution is set to  Percent of Gross  or  Percent of Net .                    The value of this read-only column is derived from the deduction and benefit                   code record if the  Use Contribution Defaults  check box is                   selected. Contribution Max The contribution amount cap.  The read-only value in this column is derived                   from the deduction and benefit code record if the  Use Contribution                     Defaults  check box is selected. Use Contribution Defaults A check box that indicates (if selected) that the values for this line are not                 stored directly in the employee record, but are always derived from the deduction                 and benefit code record. Is Garnish A read-only check box that indicates (if selected) that the elements in the                    Garnishment Details  dialog box are available for entry and                 maintenance when this line is selected in the table. Sequence The sequence in which the deduction is taken. This number need not be unique.                 If two deductions have the same sequence number, they are considered to be equal,                 and in that case, the split method must be specified in the  Split                   Method  box in the Summary area. Start The date when this deduction or benefit came (or comes) into effect for this                   employee. This date serves two possible purposes: To pre-enter future codes (that is, codes that take effect at a certain point                     in time) To establish a historical record of deductions and benefits (for instance,                     rather than just changing the rate when a pay increase occurs, to deactivate the                     current record and create a new record with a new starting date) If there is more than one active record per code, the system uses the start date                   to determine which code to use based on the payment date. The start date must be                   unique for each employee and each code; for example, the employee cannot have two                   different records, both of type  401K , that have the same start date. The                   system compares the transaction date on the paycheck and the start date to define                   when to apply the code. End The date when this deduction or benefit became inactive for this employee. This                 date serves to establish a historical record of deductions and benefits (for                 instance, when the record is deactivated, to record the date when this took effect).                    The system requires entering of the end date if you add the same code twice.                  Payment Settings Tab In the Summary area of the tab you specify a payment method and a cash account to be used         for the payment. In the  Direct Deposit  table on this tab, you specify         each bank account that receives direct deposit amounts for the employee.

Form ID:  ([~/?ScreenId=PR103000|PR103000]){br}

Each payroll-related tax (whether it is of the employee withholding type or the employer type) is represented by a payroll tax code. The tax code describes the type of tax, the jurisdiction it is associated with, the tax agency that receives the tax payments, and the specific tax location information necessary for the calculation of the tax by the Symmetry Tax Engine software. Many taxes require additional detailed information, as mandated by the specific government entity, and these details are entered and maintained through attributes associated with the specific tax code.{br}

We recommend adding a tax code by using the '''Possible Taxes for this Location''' dialog box that you can open by clicking the '''View Tax List''' button available on the [HelpRoot_Payroll\PR_20_30_00|Employee Payroll Settings] ([~/?ScreenId=PR203000|PR203000]) and [HelpRoot_Payroll\PR_10_10_40|Work Locations] ([~/?ScreenId=PR101040|PR101040]) forms.
By using this form, you can do the following: [anchor|#ul_p5s_p5y_xv]
*Specify default settings for attributes associated with the tax and default GL accounts
*Assign the vendor ID, for which a liability (and a subsequent Accounts Payable invoice) will be created for this tax

| '''Code'''
| The unique identifier of the tax. This code either represents a federal tax or is specific to a state or location. Thus, there would not be a tax code such as ''ST-WH'' (State Income Tax Withholding); something state-specific, such as ''AK-WH'' (Alaska State Income Tax Withholding), would be used instead.
|- 
| '''Name'''
| The description of the tax code.
|-

| The tax category, which determines whether the tax is on the employer (a liability only) or it is withheld from the employee’s paycheck (a deduction and a liability). The following options are available: ''Employer Contribution'' and ''Employee Withholding''.
|- 
| '''Employer Govt. Tax ID'''
| The specific government-issued identification code that the employer uses on tax returns and payments for this particular tax. Any previously entered employer government tax IDs on any other tax records are available so that you can copy the federal tax ID from one federal tax to another without having to retype it.
|-

| The specific type of tax with respect to the tax definitions in the Symmetry Tax Engine. The list of tax types available for selection is filtered based on the tax category selected above.
|- 
| '''Jurisdiction Level'''
| The jurisdiction level. When you select the tax type, the system displays one of the following options: ''Federal'', ''State'', ''Local'', ''Municipal'', or ''School District''. This setting determines whether the '''Tax Municipality Code''' and '''Tax School District Code''' boxes are available.
|- 
| '''Wage Base Inclusion'''
| The following options are available: ''State Specific'', ''Location Specific'', and ''All Wages''. This setting is validated to ensure that it is in sync with the jurisdiction level of the tax type; that is, you cannot select ''State Specific'' or ''Location Specific'' on a federal tax, and you cannot select ''Location Specific'' on a state tax. Local taxes and taxes at lower levels can use any setting.
|- 
| '''Tax State'''
| For federal jurisdiction taxes, the state is irrelevant, and for local jurisdiction taxes, a more specific location identifier in the form of the tax location code is required (see below).
This box is available and required for all state jurisdiction taxes. 
|- 
| '''Get Tax Codes'''
| A button that you click to automatically populate the '''Tax Unique ID''' box, which is a combination of the particular tax type and its location.
|- 
| '''Tax Unique ID'''
| A unique identifier that is generated when you click the '''Get Tax Codes''' button; this ID is a combination of the particular tax type and its tax location code. Every payroll tax in the United States is represented as a unique identifier in this box. The population of this box, which is required for the Symmetry Tax Engine to properly calculate the associated payroll tax, serves as validation that the Tax Engine recognizes the setup on this form as a valid tax. In some cases, the tax engine may return more than one possibility to choose from (for instance, where there are a number of identical tax types within a small geographic area); in this case, the selector is populated with the available options, and you must select and save one of the unique IDs from the list.

==Attributes Tab==
This tab contains a list of the payroll attributes that are required for the specific tax being set up. This attribute list varies from state to state and from one tax to the next. For many typical taxes, the system automatically populates the required attributes. For others, especially for many types of local and municipal taxes, you need to determine the attributes that are required. See the Symmetry Tax Engine documentation for the attributes required for a specific local tax.[anchor|#_9d669b48-35f7-4147-b4c6-d91771df2aa6]{br}

The tax code describes the type of tax, the         jurisdiction it is associated with, the tax agency that receives the tax payments, and the         specific tax location information necessary for the calculation of the tax by the Symmetry         Tax Engine software. Many taxes require additional detailed information, as mandated by the         specific government entity, and these details are entered and maintained through attributes         associated with the specific tax code. We recommend adding a tax code by using the  Possible Taxes for this           Location  dialog box that you can open by clicking the  View Tax           List  button available on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PR203000|PR203000]) Employee Payroll Settings (PR203000) and             ([~/?ScreenId=PR101040|PR101040]) Work Locations (PR101040) forms. By using this form, you can do the following:  Specify default settings for attributes associated with the tax and default GL           accounts Assign the vendor ID, for which a liability (and a subsequent Accounts Payable invoice)           will be created for this tax Form Toolbar The form toolbar includes only standard buttons. For the list of standard buttons, see  Form Toolbar. Summary Area Element Description Code The unique identifier of the tax. This code either represents a federal tax or                 is specific to a state or location. Thus, there would not be a tax code such as                    ST-WH  (State Income Tax Withholding); something state-specific, such as                    AK-WH  (Alaska State Income Tax Withholding), would be used instead. Name The description of the tax code. Tax Category The tax category, which determines whether the tax is on the employer (a                 liability only) or it is withheld from the employee’s paycheck (a deduction and a                 liability). The following options are available:  Employer Contribution  and                    Employee Withholding . Employer Govt. Tax ID The specific government-issued identification code that the employer uses on                 tax returns and payments for this particular tax. Any previously entered employer                 government tax IDs on any other tax records are available so that you can copy the                 federal tax ID from one federal tax to another without having to retype it. Vendor The identifier of the entity to receive the tax liability payments for this                 tax. Only a vendor with the  Vendor is Tax Agency  check box                 selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors (AP303000) form can be selected,                 although any valid vendor ID may be typed. Invoice Descr. Source The way the invoice description is generated, which also determines whether the                    Vendor Invoice Description  box is available. The following                 options are available:  Code Code Name Payment Date Payment Date + Code Payment Date + Code Name <Free Format Entry>  (If this option is selected, the                        Vendor Invoice Description  box is available.) Vendor Invoice Description The description for the vendor invoice. This box is available only if the                    <Free Format Entry>  option is selected in the  Invoice                   Description Source  box. Tax Engine Info Section Element Description Type The specific type of tax with respect to the tax definitions in the Symmetry                 Tax Engine. The list of tax types available for selection is filtered based on the                 tax category selected above. Jurisdiction Level The jurisdiction level. When you select the tax type, the system displays one                 of the following options:  Federal ,  State ,  Local ,                    Municipal , or  School District . This setting determines whether the                    Tax Municipality Code  and  Tax School District                   Code  boxes are available. Wage Base Inclusion The following options are available:  State Specific ,  Location                   Specific , and  All Wages . This setting is validated to ensure that it is                 in sync with the jurisdiction level of the tax type; that is, you cannot select                    State Specific  or  Location Specific  on a federal tax, and you cannot                 select  Location Specific  on a state tax. Local taxes and taxes at lower                 levels can use any setting. Tax State For federal jurisdiction taxes, the state is irrelevant, and for local                 jurisdiction taxes, a more specific location identifier in the form of the tax                 location code is required (see below). This box is available and required for all                   state jurisdiction taxes.  Get Tax Codes A button that you click to automatically populate the  Tax Unique                   ID  box, which is a combination of the particular tax type and its                 location. Tax Unique ID A unique identifier that is generated when you click the  Get Tax                   Codes  button; this ID is a combination of the particular tax type and                 its tax location code. Every payroll tax in the United States is represented as a                 unique identifier in this box. The population of this box, which is required for the                 Symmetry Tax Engine to properly calculate the associated payroll tax, serves as                 validation that the Tax Engine recognizes the setup on this form as a valid tax. In                 some cases, the tax engine may return more than one possibility to choose from (for                 instance, where there are a number of identical tax types within a small geographic                 area); in this case, the selector is populated with the available options, and you                 must select and save one of the unique IDs from the list. Attributes Tab This tab contains a list of the payroll attributes that are required for the specific tax         being set up. This attribute list varies from state to state and from one tax to the next.         For many typical taxes, the system automatically populates the required attributes. For         others, especially for many types of local and municipal taxes, you need to determine the         attributes that are required. See the Symmetry Tax Engine documentation for the attributes         required for a specific local tax. The table toolbar includes only standard buttons. For the list of standard buttons, see  Table Toolbar. Table Columns Column Description Description The description of the attribute. Allow Employee Override A check box that indicates (if selected) that the value of this attribute may                 be overridden at the employee level. Value The default value for this attribute, which may be overridden at the employee                 level if the  Allow Employee Override  check box is                 selected. Required A check box that indicates (if selected) that the attribute value is a required                 entry for this tax. If the attribute is required, either this value must be entered                 on this form or the  Allow Employee Override  check box must be                 selected, to ensure that the attribute will contain a value. Sort Order The order when the attribute appears on input forms. By default, the sort order                 is sequential in the order in which the attributes are entered, but you can modify                 the sort order. GL Accounts Tab The settings on this tab determine GL accounts to be used to record tax related         transactions. The table toolbar includes only standard buttons. For the list of standard buttons, see  Table Toolbar. Table Columns Column Description Expense Account An expense account used by default to record the taxes. Expense Sub. The corresponding subaccount used with the tax account. The box is displayed if                 the  Subaccounts  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features                 (CS100000) form. Liability Account A liability account used to off-set the tax expense account. Liability Sub. The corresponding subaccount used with the liability account. The box is                 displayed if the  Subaccounts  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. ]]></column>

A work location includes the address and other information pertaining to a physical location where work is performed. This may be a business location of the employer, or it may be a job site where work is being carried out. Work locations can be used to assign hours worked (and their associated amounts) for GL purposes, and may also be used in calculating state and local taxes where applicable. All work locations where taxes may need to be withheld need to be set up, and the work associated with them needs to be tracked in payroll.{br}
