This topic will guide you through the process of configuring the integration between Acumatica ERP and nationwide carriers. Such integration is available if the ''Shipping Carrier Integration'' feature is enabled in your system. {br}

In Acumatica ERP, you can use predefined plug-ins to configure integration with nationwide carriers. Each plug-in supports integration with a specific carrier: FedEx, or UPS. By using integration with any of these carriers, you can get up-to-date freight rates for each shipment your company&rsquo;s employees handle, print actual carrier labels, and track shipments by actual tracking numbers provided by the carrier. ((({S:Hint}The integration of Acumatica ERP with the carriers (such as UPS, or FedEx) does not support international shipments.

!width="80%" ! Description
|- 
| '''Get a carrier account and a signed service agreement'''
| 
Integration with each carrier is supported by a plug-in that was developed for this integration. For the particular plug-in, you specify parameters that are specific to the carrier. With the carrier account, you will get company&rsquo;s account number and password for authorization with the carrier&rsquo;s system. Make sure that the currency of your UPS or FedEx account matches your base currency in Acumatica ERP.{br}

The carriers provide multiple service methods, each with its own rates and delivery time frame. Such services as ''FedEx SmartPost'' and ''UPS SurePost'' require additional service contracts to be signed with the respective carriers. 
|- 
| '''Make sure the ''Shipping Carrier Integration'' feature is included in your license'''
| 
To enable this integration, make sure that your license includes ''Shipping Carrier Integration'' feature. 
|- 
| '''Validate addresses'''
| 
Make sure that addresses for your organization&rsquo;s branches, warehouses, and customers are valid. Carriers can process shipments only if the recipient and sender addresses are valid. You can validate addresses manually, or by using an external address validation service that is integrated with Acumatica ERP. (If your organization is integrated with Avalara&rsquo;s AvaTax, you can enable the ''Address Validation'' feature and use the predefined address validation plug-in for Avalara online service.)
|- 
| '''Set up integration with the integrated carrier or carriers'''
| 
Set up integration with each needed carrier on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_77_00|Carriers] ([~/?ScreenId=CS207700|CS207700]) form, which is available only if the ''Shipping Carrier Integration'' feature is enabled. On this form, you specify a name to be used for this carrier in your system, select the appropriate plug-in, and enter the values for the plug-in parameters. Some parameters are used for authentication with the carrier&rsquo;s system, while others are used to print carrier labels or to set up notification of recipients. For detailed instructions on configuring specific carriers, see the following topics:[anchor|#ul_bwm_wrc_ss]
*[HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Integrate_FedEx|To Set Up Integration with FedEx]
*[HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Integrate_UPS|To Set Up Integration with UPS]

|- 
| '''Define packages'''
| 
Define the boxes to be used for shipments sent via each integrated carrier by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_76_00|Boxes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS207600|CS207600]) form.
|- 
| '''Define ship via codes'''
| 
Define multiple ship via codes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_75_00|Ship via Codes] form, each of which denotes a different service method of each carrier to be used by your organization. The service method defines the time frame for delivery and the associated rates. Also, for each ship via code, specify the packages to be used with the carrier method.
|- 
| '''Define boxes for stock items'''
| 
For each stock item in inventory, you need to specify its weight, volume and packaging options.
|- 
| '''Set up label printing'''
| Register the label file extension and configure a thermal printer.

By using integration with any of     these carriers, you can get up-to-date freight rates for each shipment your company's employees     handle, print actual carrier labels, and track shipments by actual tracking numbers provided by     the carrier.  The integration of  Acumatica ERP     with the carriers (such as UPS, or FedEx) does not support international shipments. Task  Description Get a carrier account and  a signed service agreement Integration with each carrier is supported by a plug-in that was developed for this          integration. For the particular plug-in, you specify parameters that are specific to the          carrier. With the carrier account, you will get company's account number and password for          authorization with the carrier's system. Make sure that the currency of your UPS or FedEx          account matches your base currency in  Acumatica ERP. The carriers provide multiple service methods, each with its own rates and delivery time          frame. Such services as  FedEx SmartPost  and  UPS SurePost  require additional          service contracts to be signed with the respective carriers.  Make sure the  Shipping Carrier Integration  feature is included in your          license To enable this integration, make sure that your license includes  Shipping Carrier           Integration  feature.  Validate addresses Make sure that addresses for your organization's branches, warehouses, and customers are          valid. Carriers can process shipments only if the recipient and sender addresses are valid.          You can validate addresses manually, or by using an external address validation service          that is integrated with  Acumatica ERP. (If your organization is integrated with Avalara's AvaTax, you can enable the            Address Validation  feature and use the predefined address validation plug-in for          Avalara online service.) Set up integration with the integrated carrier or carriers Set up integration with each needed carrier on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS207700|CS207700]) Carriers (CS207700) form, which is available only if the            Shipping Carrier Integration  feature is enabled. On this form, you specify a name          to be used for this carrier in your system, select the appropriate plug-in, and enter the          values for the plug-in parameters. Some parameters are used for authentication with the          carrier's system, while others are used to print carrier labels or to set up notification          of recipients. For detailed instructions on configuring specific carriers, see the          following topics: To Set Up Integration with FedExTo Set Up Integration with UPSDefine packages Define the boxes to be used for shipments sent via each integrated carrier by using the             ([~/?ScreenId=CS207600|CS207600]) Boxes (CS207600) form. Define ship via codes Define multiple ship via codes on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]) Ship via Codes form,          each of which denotes a different service method of each carrier to be used by your          organization. The service method defines the time frame for delivery and the associated          rates. Also, for each ship via code, specify the packages to be used with the carrier          method. Define boxes for stock items For each stock item in inventory, you need to specify its weight, volume and packaging          options. Set up label printing Register the label file extension and configure a thermal printer. ]]></column>

|  Decide which predefined order types you will use and which you will not use.
|

|- 
| '''2'''
|  '''Review order type settings'''
|  Use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form to review settings of each predefined order type you will use, and write down the necessary changes to settings. In particular, note the following elements: [anchor|#_ebb8ab95-25b5-49e1-91f2-a0221a6d4432]
*'''Order Numbering Sequence''': Which sequence the system uses to give a reference number to an order of the type. Numbering sequences can be unique to each order type or shared by multiple types. 
*'''Days to Keep''': How many days an order of this type may be kept in the system before it can be deleted. 
*'''Hold Orders on Entry''': Whether all new sales orders of the type are created with the status ''On Hold''. 
*'''Hold Document on Failed Credit Check''': Whether on order creation, the customer’s credit status is checked. If the customer exceeds the credit limit or has overdue invoices, the order can be put on hold (depending on customer settings). 
*'''Require Control Total''': Whether the user needs to enter a control total for each order. The order can be processed only when the system-calculated total equals the manually entered control total. 
*'''Bill Separately''': Whether multiple orders of the type for the same customer will be billed separately by default. 
*'''Ship Separately''': Whether multiple orders of this type for the same customer will be shipped separately by default. 
*'''Calculate Freight''': Whether freight charges should be calculated for an order automatically. 
*'''Recalculate Discount on Partial Shipment''': Whether the discount for partial shipment should be recalculated anew based on shipped quantities. 
*'''Copy Notes/Attachments To Shipment/Invoice''': Whether, when a shipment or invoice is created for an order, notes or attachments of order lines are copied to the respective shipment or invoice lines.
*'''Allow Quick Processing''': Whether new orders of this order type can be quickly processed from the entry form.

| 
| 
|- 
| '''3'''
|  '''Review order type&rsquo;s Accounts Receivable settings'''
|  Review the settings in the '''Accounts Receivable Settings''' section (on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] form). Note any that should be changed.
| 
| 
|- 
| '''4'''
|  '''Review posting settings of order types'''
|  For each order type you will use, review the settings in the '''Posting Settings''' section. Posting settings define which General Ledger accounts and subaccounts are updated by the orders of this type: [anchor|#_b11a3474-4670-4f6f-8548-33751fc36989]
* The sales revenue account and subaccount are credited by the gross invoice amount, minus taxes, volume discounts, and freight and miscellaneous charges. 
* The miscellaneous charges account and subaccount are credited by the order&rsquo;s miscellaneous charges. 
* The freight charges account and subaccount are credited by the order&rsquo;s freight amount that you bill to the customer. 
* The discount account and subaccount are debited by volume discounts applied to the whole order. Line discounts are deducted from order line amounts, which are posted to the revenue account. 

The posting settings for the order type refer to the record from which the account should be sourced. Available options can include the following: customer location, inventory item, non-stock item, warehouse, posting class, reason code, carrier, and order type. Similarly, the order type indicates the source for each segment of subaccounts: your company location, the customer location, the inventory item, the warehouse, the posting class, the carrier, the reason code, the salesperson, the employee, or the company branch. Review the General Ledger accounts and subaccounts of the chosen master records that serve as sources of accounts and subaccounts.
| 
| 
|- 
| '''5'''
|  '''Plan shipment settings'''
|  Decide upon the settings that control processing of shipments (regardless of the order or orders they are created for). These settings include the following: [anchor|#_b483f366-432a-49c8-a64b-de7aafdbbb0c]
*'''Shipment Numbering Sequence''': This numbering sequence is used to assign each shipment a unique number. 
*'''Freight Allocation on Partial Shipping''': Freight charges are represented in a sales order as a single figure. If an order has multiple partial shipments, freight can be allocated to shipments (and consequently to invoices) in one of two ways, based on this setting: with the first shipment getting the full freight amount, or with each shipment getting part of the total freight (proportionally to the billing amount of the shipped goods). 
*'''Hold Shipments on Entry''': The option indicates whether new shipment should be put on Hold to prevent accidental confirmation. 
*'''Validate Shipments Total on Confirmation''': If this option is selected, the system will require independent input of shipment total quantity to verify it against shipment details. 
*'''Add Zero Lines for Items Not in Stock''': This option indicates whether sales order items should be added in the shipment even though they have no available quantity. 

| 
| 
|- 
| '''6'''
|  '''Plan global settings'''
|  Decide upon the global settings specific to the Sales Order Management module, including the following: [anchor|#_906cab7d-68db-41bd-9c1c-68a9c9d17621]
*'''Default Sales Order Type''': The most common (most frequently used) order type. 
*'''Hold Invoices on Failed Credit Check''': A customer credit check is performed when each sales order is created. If it fails, the order will be put on hold and no shipment will be possible until it is released from credit hold. If the time between placement of the order and actual shipment is long, the customer’s credit situation may change. If this is a concern in your business, select this check box, and invoices created for a confirmed shipment will be automatically put on hold if the credit check fails. 
*'''Automatically Release IN Documents''': This option indicates whether the respective documents should be released automatically in the Inventory module. 

| 
| 
|- 
| '''7'''
|  '''Review relevant delivery settings for customers'''
|  Review the delivery settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form for each customer; if the customer has multiple locations, review the settings of each location. Look at the following settings and note any that should be changed: [anchor|#_2c0bd164-0797-44ae-a5d0-9a22bcc09365]
*'''Ship Via''': The carrier to handle shipments to this customer location. The carrier record serves as the source of the freight account and subaccount and can be used for automated calculation of the freight amount. 
*'''Shipping Terms''': The terms governing delivery of goods. 
*'''FOB Point''': The port where the title of shipped goods is transferred to the customer. 
*'''Ship Complete''': How the shipment should be generated if the quantity is insufficient: only in full, in multiple partial shipments, or shipped partially with cancellation of the quantity remaining after the first shipment. 
*'''Order Priority''': The relative &ldquo;weight&ldquo; of the customer&rsquo;s orders in allocating the inventory in mass order processing. Orders with a higher priority are processed first. 
*'''Warehouse''': The preferred warehouse for sales to the customer.

|  '''Review relevant delivery settings for customer classes'''
|  Analyse the delivery settings of customers considering how customers are grouped in customer classes. Review the following settings in [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_10_00|Customer Classes] (R201000) form: [anchor|#_93e93115-6c7d-4290-8fdb-06990a82edfb]

|- 
| '''1'''
|  '''Decide on integration with Active Directory or another system'''
| 
Consider whether you want to integrate Acumatica ERP with Microsoft Active Directory (AD) or Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).{br}

Review any user groups to be mapped to user roles in Acumatica ERP, and identify any domain users that do not need access to Acumatica ERP.
| 
| 
|- 
| '''2'''
|  '''Develop a convention for logins (usernames)'''
| 
If integration with Active Directory (AD) is planned, consider using users&rsquo; domain logins as their logins to Acumatica ERP.{br}

If no integration is planned, develop a convention for creating logins in Acumatica ERP.
| 
| 
|- 
| '''3'''
|  '''Prepare a list of users'''
| 
Prepare a list of individuals who will need to access and use Acumatica ERP. For each user, list the following information:[anchor|#ul_ggn_cls_jt]
*The name of the user.
*The login to be used to access the system.
*The email address of the user.
*The initial password.
*Password options. Decide whether to apply the following options for the user:
**Allow password recovery if the user provides an answer to a question maintained in his or her profile.
**Allow password changes. When users change their passwords regularly, their accounts are more secure.
**Permit the user to have a never-expiring password.
**Force the user to change the password on the next login. 
*The user&rsquo;s regular job responsibilities, such as creating invoices, generating statements, and collecting payments.
*Optional: IP addresses from which the user may access the system.

| 
| 
|- 
| '''4'''
|  '''Design user roles'''
| 
For each identified role, plan the following: [anchor|#ul_fjn_cls_jt]
*Role name.
*Description.
*List of users who will be assigned to the role.
*List of Acumatica ERP modules, forms, and reports that the users with the role may access. Also, note the level of access to modules (''Granted'', ''View Only'', or ''Revoked'') and to forms (''Delete'', ''Edit'', ''View Only'', or ''Revoked'') that should be assigned.

| 
| 
|- 
| '''5'''
|  '''Plan user types'''
| 
If you are going to implement Self-Service Portal, create user types to group the default roles created for internal users and the default roles intended for external users (the users of Self-Service Portal). {br}

Identifiers for user types can be unicode strings of up to 50 characters. 
| 
| 
|- 
| '''6'''
|  '''Redefine security and audit policies'''
| 
If no AD integration is planned, review your security and audit options, which will affect all local users, as follows: [anchor|#ul_amn_cls_jt]
*Decide whether to require password complexity. Complex passwords include at least three of these four features: 
**Uppercase letters
**Lowercase letters
**Numbers
**Special symbols
*Decide whether to force users to change passwords and how often.
*Determine whether to apply a mask in addition to other password restrictions. This mask involves excluding characters that may not be supported by the involved systems. Use this option only when it&rsquo;s absolutely necessary. If you decide to use this mask, develop a message text to be displayed to the user when the password violates the validation mask.
* Determine whether to set up an account lock time and how many unsuccessful login attempts users can perform before their accounts will be locked.
*Decide how long you want to keep security audit logs and which of these security events should be logged: 
** Successful login attempt 
** Failed login attempt (this event should always be audited, because it helps you detect possible break-ins to the system)
** Logout 
** Session expiration 
** Screen access (the log will grow very fast if you log this event, so we recommend that you not do so)
** Successful sending of email 
** Failure sending email 

| 
| 
|- 
| '''7'''
|  '''Review the security preferences'''
| 
Review the following security preferences: [anchor|#ul_lpn_cls_jt]
*'''Password Policy''': Decide on the maximum lifetime for user passwords, minimum password length, password complexity (whether it is required), additional validation mask (if required), and tip that the user will see if a new password doesn&rsquo;t meet the complexity requirements.
*'''Account Lockout Policy''': Decide on the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts, lockout time, and lockout counter reset time. 
*'''Audit policy''': Decide on the audited operations and the time to keep the audit history 
*'''Security Certificates:''' If you have not done this, decide on the default certificate to be used for PDF signing and on the certificate to be used for encryption of the database.

|  '''Decide on user access to branches'''
| 
This task is needed only if the ''Multiple Branch Support'' feature is enabled in your system on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. {br}
