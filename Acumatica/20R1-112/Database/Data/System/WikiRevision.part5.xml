			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
The Inventory module provides real-time access to stock item availability data configured in accordance with your company&rsquo;s policies. By using the Inventory module, you can maintain a perpetual inventory system while also performing physical inventories as full inventory counts and counts by cycles. In Acumatica ERP, you can track items by either lot or serial numbers, as well as by expiration dates. By using multiple valuation methods, you can accurately maintain item costs and trace cost flows. By using flexible posting settings, you can meet any regulatory requirements.{br}

The full functionality of the Inventory module is available only if the ''Inventory'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}{TOC}
==Stock and Non-Stock Inventory Items==
Inventory items are the goods, products, services, and component parts recorded to and tracked in your system database. Inventory items can be divided into two major categories, stock and non-stock items, based on how they are handled and accounted for. By using functionality of restriction groups, you can control visibility of particular inventory items to employees. For more information, see the following topics: 
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Inventory_Items|Inventory Items]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Stock_Items_GeneralInfo|Stock Items: General Information]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Non-Stock_Item_Support|Non-Stock Items in Sales and Purchases]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Restriction_Groups_for_Subitems|Inventory Item Security]

==Flexible Item Identifiers and Support of Alternative IDs==
By using configurable inventory IDs, you can uniquely identify inventory items. If you use subitems in your system, you can further subdivide items by size, color, material, and other criteria that apply to your business. You can easily gather additional business-specific data about inventory items by configuring custom fields, called ''attributes''. Also, on purchase and sales orders, you can use barcodes or vendor or customer alternative IDs to find items or record item information. For more information, see the following topics: 
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Inventory_IDs_and_Subitem_Codes|Inventory Subitems]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Inventory_Item_Attributes|Inventory Item Attributes]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Item_Cross-References|Item Cross-References]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\PO__con_Barcode_Support|Barcode Support]

==Global and Item-Specific UOMs==
You can use an unlimited number of units of measure (UOMs) in your system. Commonly used units of measure—liters, gallons, pounds, and kilograms—can be defined globally and then used as base units of measure for specific item classes or particular products. You can define conversion rules between UOMs (such as pounds and kilograms).{br}

You can specify UOMs and conversion rules at the item-class and item level—cases or boxes intended for different products can be of different capacities. Once you have defined conversion rules, the system automatically makes conversions to the correct unit of measure when necessary.{br}

If the ''Multiple Units of Measure'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, for each item you can define, in addition to the base unit, the purchase UOM to be used to measure item quantity on purchase orders and receipts and the sales unit to measure the item quantities on sales orders and invoices. Prices for base UOMs and sales UOMs can be set as independent prices, if needed. {br}

For more information, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\UOMs_GeneralInfo|Units of Measure: General Information].
==Multiple Warehouses and Locations==
In Acumatica ERP, you can maintain a complex warehouse structure, defining multiple warehouses with multiple locations within each. This functionality is available if you enable the ''Multiple Warehouses'' and ''Multiple Warehouse Locations'' features on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

By configuring segmentation for location identifiers, you can maintain a hierarchy of rooms, rows, levels, shelves, bins, and other divisions. For each location, you can define which inventory operations can be performed there. You can also specify a primary inventory item or primary item class, and set up validation so that if a preferred item is specified and the validation is turned on, only the preferred item can be received at the location.{br}

By using security functionality, you can restrict the visibility of warehouse information to groups of authorized users. For more information, see the following topics:
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\InvMgmt_con_Warehouses|Warehouses in Acumatica ERP]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Warehouses_GeneralInfo|Warehouses: General Information]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Warehouse_Locations_GeneralInfo|Warehouse Locations and Single-Step Transfers: General Information]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Inventory_and_Warehouse_Security|Warehouse Security]

==Flexible Posting Settings==
You can set up the system to automatically update the General Ledger on release of inventory documents. Posting classes assigned to inventory items define the rules for selecting particular General Ledger accounts and subaccounts to be updated when transactions with the items are performed. Reason codes for inventory transactions provide the offset accounts to be updated, depending on the type of inventory transactions. For more information, see the following topics:
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_GL_Accounts_Inventory|Posting Settings in the Inventory Module]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Posting_Classes_GeneralInfo|Posting Classes: General Information]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Reason_Codes_GeneralInfo|Reason Codes: General Information]

==Inventory Transactions==
The Inventory module supports the following types of documents, recording the same-name inventory transactions: receipt, issue, adjustment, transfer, and kit assembly. Inventory documents facilitate accounting for transactions that result in changing inventory quantities and costs.{br}

For more information about inventory transactions, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Inventory_Transactions|Inventory Transactions].
==Availability Calculation==
 Acumatica ERP provides real-time visibility into the available inventory levels. The way availability data is calculated can be configured in accordance with the policies set in your company. Availability calculation rules are specified for item classes. You can create multiple rules with different calculation settings and assign them to different item classes. The availability data of items is shown on sales orders, purchase orders, and kit assemblies. For more information, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Availability_Calculation_Rules_GeneralInfo|Availability Calculation: General Information].
==Lot and Serial Number Tracking==
With the Inventory module, you can track stock items by lot or serial numbers and by expiration dates if the ''Lot and Serial Tracking'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form. Acumatica ERP provides flexible numbering schemes for lot and serial numbers, and the ability to track different products differently. For more information about the use of lot and serial numbers, see the following topics:
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Lot_and_Serial_Numbers_GeneralInfo|Items with Lot and Serial Numbers: General Information]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Lot_and_Serial_Numbers_Class_Settings|Items with Lot and Serial Numbers: Tracking Settings]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Lot_and_Serial_Numbers_Autonumbering_Settings|Items with Lot and Serial Numbers: Numbering Settings]

==Kit Assembling==
Some stock or non-stock items may be kits made up of other inventory items. Non-stock kits can include both non-stock and stock components and are not recorded in the Inventory module. Stock components of non-stock kits are processed as if they are managed separately not within a kit. Stock kits also can include both stock and non-stock components but are recorded in the Inventory module and are regarded as individual items.{br}

For more information about kits, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Accounting_for_Kits|Inventory Item Kits].
==Inventory Valuation==
By using a perpetual inventory system, which Acumatica ERP enables, your company can estimate the total cost of its inventory at any moment, because on-hand quantities and inventory account balances are updated with every transaction, purchase, or sale. Periodic revision of standard costs for items with standard cost valuation methods results in the revaluation of the cost of inventory. Periodic updates of base prices can be performed automatically. For more information on inventory valuation, see the following topics:
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_The_Cost_of_Inventory|The Cost of Inventory]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Item_Costs_and_Valuation_Methods|Item Costs and Valuation Methods]
*[HelpRoot_PricesAndDiscounts\PriceDiscount_Reviewing_Sales_Prices_GeneralInfo|Sales Prices: General Information]

==Physical Inventories==
By using Acumatica ERP, your company can maintain a perpetual inventory system with the combination of full physical inventory and cycle counting that best fits the company policies and goals. Count data can be imported from Excel files or entered manually by multiple employees working simultaneously on multiple computers. The information from these counts provides company managers with exact values of stock levels. For more information, see the following topics:
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Planning_for_Physical_Inventory|Configuration of Physical Inventory]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Physical_Inventory_Types|Types of Physical Inventory]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Cycle_Counting_Configuration|Cycle Counting Configuration]

*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Physical_Inventory_Counts|Physical Inventory Counts]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Preparation_for_Physical_Count|Preparation for Physical Count]

==Automated Replenishment==
In Acumatica ERP, you can configure automated replenishment of stock items. Flexible, automated replenishment ensures that for items requiring replenishment, the right quantities will be calculated and listed on automatically generated purchase orders. Moreover, you can use the predicted average daily demand, calculated with the help of demand forecasting methods, to periodically update the values of replenishment parameters (such as maximum quantity, reorder point, and safety stock) to more precisely calculate the quantities required for replenishment. For more information, see the following topics: 
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Configuration_of_Automated_Replenishment|Configuration of Automated Replenishment]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Automated_Replenishment|Automated Replenishment]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Replenishment_Parameters|Replenishment Methods and Their Parameters]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Replenishment_Based_on_Demand_Forecast_Model|Replenishment Parameters Based on Demand Forecast ]

==Financial Period Closing in the Inventory module==
When accountants close financial periods in the system, they must close periods in all modules that your Acumatica ERP instance uses. Before closing periods in the Inventory module you have to review all unprocessed transactions and process or delete them. For more information, see the following topics:[anchor|#_7efc7bae-f476-4776-a556-7edeb5ecca0e]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Financial_Period_Closing_Inventory|Financial Period Closing in the Inventory Module]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Reconciliation_IN_Account_GL_Account|Reconciliation of the Cost of Inventory with the Account Balance]

==Other Features and Options==
The Inventory module also provides the following features:
*The ability to quickly add product images to the inventory item record.
*Tracking of items by product workgroup or product manager.
*Item availability data displayed when you create a sales or a purchase order.
*The ability to print count sheets, tags, and item and location labels, to facilitate the counting process.
*For perishable items, tracking of expiration dates, with alerts displayed about expired items.
*The ability to set up the automatic issue of items by expiration date.
*Segmented identifiers for locations, to make it easier to locate stock. By using segments, you can define further detail levels of locations, such as rooms, shelves, and bins.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
If your organization keeps any physical items on site that are currently unused but expected to be used or sold, it uses storage for these items. Your storage can be as small as a shelf with dozens of office supplies in a back office or as large as multiple physical warehouses with billions of goods situated in different regions or even countries.{br}

If you want to track your stored items in Acumatica ERP, you can use the functionality of warehouses and locations and choose the approach that best fits your business. You can configure a single warehouse or multiple warehouses. Within each warehouse, you can define a single location or multiple locations. In this topic, you will find general information about warehouses in Acumatica ERP.{br}{TOC}
==Warehouses and Locations in Acumatica ERP==
In Acumatica ERP, a warehouse does not necessarily represent a physical building where your inventory is stocked. You can divide a large physical storage space into multiple areas and define each area as a warehouse in Acumatica ERP. A warehouse can even be virtual: for example, you might want to treat all goods that are on the way from the supplier to you as though they are located in a goods-in-transit warehouse.{br}

You can use any of the following structures of warehouses and locations and define these entities accordingly in Acumatica ERP:[anchor|#_35f885f0-c5df-4081-a57a-d30d433baf0c]
*One warehouse with one location: You use this structure when you have a small number of inventory items and it’s not important for you to track in which room or on which shelf these items are stored. For more information, see [[#_97deb92b-0ac5-4a9e-8bd1-7c38e8471e63|Basic Warehouse Structure].
*One warehouse with multiple locations: You use this structure when you have one physical space and need to track the locations within it and the items in these locations. For example, you might have one physical room with many numbered shelves (to be defined as locations). Or you might have multiple rooms with shelves and boxes (and each location will be defined by the room, shelf, and box). With multiple locations defined you are able to register in the system the exact placement of each inventory item.
*Multiple warehouses with one location in each warehouse: You use this structure when you store items in multiple physical rooms or buildings (each of which will be defined as a warehouse in the system), and each storage place (to be defined as a location) holds a small number of items, which warehouse employees can easily find without needing more specific details.
*Multiple warehouses with multiple locations in each warehouse: You use this structure when you have a distributed network of warehouses that hold a variety of goods in different locations.
*Multiple warehouses, which can have any number of locations: You use this structure when you have multiple warehouses, which vary in terms of whether they have multiple locations within them or just one location. For example, this structure might be used if you have a large distribution center from where goods are sent to multiple small warehouses.

For more information, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Warehouses_GeneralInfo|Warehouses: General Information] and [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Warehouse_Locations_GeneralInfo|Warehouse Locations and Single-Step Transfers: General Information].[anchor|#_97deb92b-0ac5-4a9e-8bd1-7c38e8471e63]
==Basic Warehouse Structure==
When you have just a few items to keep in a small storage area, you can use the basic warehouse functionality in Acumatica ERP. The basic functionality is available when you have the following license settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form:[anchor|#_087c12ff-cd47-43b9-b861-ada15b13d190]
*The ''Inventory'' feature is enabled.
*The ''Multiple Warehouses'' and ''Multiple Warehouse Locations'' features (which provide more advanced functionality) are disabled.

When you specify and save the inventory settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form (as described in [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\config_InvMgmt_Basic_Implem_Activity|Order Management with Inventory Configuration: Implementation Activity]), the system creates the default warehouse and assigns ''MAIN'' as the warehouse ID. ((({S:Warn}With the features noted above enabled and disabled, the ID of the only warehouse, ''MAIN'', is not displayed on data entry forms for simplicity. However, this warehouse ID will be used automatically in all inventory transactions.
))){br}

If needed, you can change the identifier of the ''MAIN'' warehouse on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form by selecting this warehouse on the form, clicking '''Actions''' > '''Change ID''' on the form toolbar, and specifying a new identifier in the dialog box that opens.{br}

When the ''Multiple Warehouses'' feature is not enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form, the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] form displays the '''Warehouse ID''' box and no other elements. The following settings are specified for the default warehouse but are hidden from this form:[anchor|#_884ee7a7-e307-4ed8-be29-931132a439e8]
*'''Replenishment Class''': ''Purchase''
* '''Default Cost of Returns''': ''Average''

For the default warehouse, the system creates a default location that the goods will be received to and issued from and assigns ''MAIN'' as the location ID. If the ''Multiple Warehouse Locations'' feature is disabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form, the ''MAIN'' location has the following settings, although they are not displayed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] form: [anchor|#_a06ea460-5902-413c-996d-eb2b2835f3b5]

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Warehouses in  Acumatica ERPIf your organization keeps any physical items on site that are currently unused but         expected to be used or sold, it uses storage for these items. Your storage can be as small         as a shelf with dozens of office supplies in a back office or as large as multiple physical         warehouses with billions of goods situated in different regions or even countries. If you want to track your stored items in  Acumatica ERP, you can use the functionality of warehouses and locations and choose the approach that         best fits your business. You can configure a single warehouse or multiple warehouses. Within         each warehouse, you can define a single location or multiple locations. In this topic, you         will find general information about warehouses in  Acumatica ERP. Warehouses and Locations in  Acumatica ERPIn  Acumatica ERP, a warehouse does not necessarily represent a physical building where your inventory is         stocked. You can divide a large physical storage space into multiple areas and define each         area as a warehouse in  Acumatica ERP. A warehouse can even be virtual: for example, you might want to treat all goods that are         on the way from the supplier to you as though they are located in a goods-in-transit         warehouse. You can use any of the following structures of warehouses and locations and define these         entities accordingly in  Acumatica ERP: One warehouse with one location: You use this structure when you have a small number of           inventory items and it’s not important for you to track in which room or on which shelf           these items are stored. For more information, see  Basic Warehouse Structure Basic Warehouse Structure. One warehouse with multiple locations: You use this structure when you have one physical           space and need to track the locations within it and the items in these locations. For           example, you might have one physical room with many numbered shelves (to be defined as           locations). Or you might have multiple rooms with shelves and boxes (and each location           will be defined by the room, shelf, and box). With multiple locations defined you are able           to register in the system the exact placement of each inventory item. Multiple warehouses with one location in each warehouse: You use this structure when you           store items in multiple physical rooms or buildings (each of which will be defined as a           warehouse in the system), and each storage place (to be defined as a location) holds a           small number of items, which warehouse employees can easily find without needing more           specific details. Multiple warehouses with multiple locations in each warehouse: You use this structure           when you have a distributed network of warehouses that hold a variety of goods in           different locations. Multiple warehouses, which can have any number of locations: You use this structure when           you have multiple warehouses, which vary in terms of whether they have multiple locations           within them or just one location. For example, this structure might be used if you have a           large distribution center from where goods are sent to multiple small warehouses. For more information, see  Warehouses: General Information and  Warehouse Locations and Single-Step Transfers: General Information. Basic Warehouse Structure When you have just a few items to keep in a small storage area, you can use the basic         warehouse functionality in  Acumatica ERP. The basic functionality is available when you have the following license settings on the             ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form: The  Inventory  feature is enabled. The  Multiple Warehouses  and  Multiple Warehouse Locations  features (which           provide more advanced functionality) are disabled. When you specify and save the inventory settings on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences         (IN101000) form (as described in  Order Management with Inventory Configuration: Implementation Activity),         the system creates the default warehouse and assigns  MAIN  as the warehouse ID.            With the features noted above enabled and disabled, the ID of the only warehouse,              MAIN , is not displayed on data entry forms for simplicity. However, this           warehouse ID will be used automatically in all inventory transactions. If needed, you can change the identifier of the  MAIN  warehouse on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses (IN204000) form by selecting this warehouse on the form,         clicking  Actions Change ID  on the form toolbar, and specifying a new identifier in the dialog box that         opens. When the  Multiple Warehouses  feature is not enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features form, the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses form displays the            Warehouse ID  box and no other elements. The following settings are         specified for the default warehouse but are hidden from this form: Replenishment Class :  Purchase Default Cost of Returns :  Average For the default warehouse, the system creates a default location that the goods will be         received to and issued from and assigns  MAIN  as the location ID. If the  Multiple           Warehouse Locations  feature is disabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features form,         the  MAIN  location has the following settings, although they are not displayed on the             ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses form:  Active : Selected Include in Qty. Available : Selected Cost Separately : Cleared Sales Allowed : Selected Receipts Allowed : Selected Transfers Allowed : Selected Assembly Allowed : Selected ]]></column>

When your organization has multiple buildings, storage rooms, or other facilities for storing inventory items, you can create multiple warehouses in Acumatica ERP to process and track inventory appropriately for each warehouse.{br}

With the ''Multiple Warehouses'' feature enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can create any number of warehouses, even virtual warehouses, in the way that best fits your business, with the needed settings for each warehouse. In the following sections, you will read about multiple warehouses in Acumatica ERP.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#_c2a619d3-2413-451e-980b-eee54172584d]
*Prepare the system for the creation of warehouses
*Create warehouses
*Specify warehouse-specific settings for stock items and prices
*Use a warehouse as a source of GL accounts for posting classes

==Applicable Scenarios==
You create warehouses in any of the following cases:[anchor|#_d5d6e791-c6de-47d1-94ef-a6d344c2d011]
*When you initially configure inventory with multiple warehouses in Acumatica ERP
*When your organization adds a new physical or virtual warehouse

==Multiple Warehouses in Acumatica ERP==
In Acumatica ERP, you can implement any of the following typical use cases with multiple warehouses:[anchor|#_a6e70e73-5206-4f9f-b6e9-b801e72f3629]
*In each warehouse, you store a specific set of goods, which is not stored in other warehouses. Each warehouse receives purchased goods directly from vendors. You do not need to transfer goods between warehouses. 
*:As an example of this use case, suppose that your organization sells fruits and juicers. You may have a separate warehouse with refrigeration facilities for fruits and a separate warehouse with no special storage conditions for juicers.
*You store goods of the same type (as well as goods of different types) in multiple warehouses, which can receive purchased goods directly from vendors. Also, you can perform transfers between warehouses, relocating stock items as needed. 
*:As an example of this use case, suppose that your organization sells fruits to wholesale and retail customers. You have a wholesale center with a large warehouse, and multiple small shops with local warehouses. The shops can either transfer fruits from the wholesale warehouse or buy fruits directly from local vendors.
*You use one warehouse as a distribution center and transfer its goods to other warehouses. Only the distribution center directly receives goods from vendors. 
*:As an example of this use case, suppose that your organization has a wide network of supermarkets. You have a distribution center with a large warehouse and each supermarket has its own warehouse. You purchase items only in the distribution center and then transfer these items to supermarkets.

You can implement any other use cases where multiple warehouses are involved.
==Functionality Related to Multiple Warehouses==
When you enable the ''Multiple Warehouses'' feature on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the following functionality becomes available in the system:[anchor|#_3fb0b663-ab17-421a-8d3d-b26bafb65378]
*Warehouse-specific settings for stock items: If the details of stocking a particular inventory item vary in different warehouses, you can specify separate details for the item at each warehouse (that is, specify details for the item–warehouse pair) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form. You can view these warehouse-specific settings of a selected item on the '''Warehouse Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. For more information, see the [[#_791cba04-cbe4-4c52-9276-367062c23229|Warehouse-Specific Settings for Stock Items] section of this topic.
*The warehouse as a source for general ledger accounts: If you store inventory items of the same category in multiple warehouses and each warehouse has specific general ledger accounts specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form, you can use the warehouse as a source of default GL accounts for any inventory item. For details, see the [[#_9b3bd03a-75f0-4f61-8bd4-94c7821a26a3|Warehouse as a Source of GL Accounts for Posting Classes] section of this topic.
*The ''TR'' order type for sales with transfers: If you use multiple warehouses, you can implement a sales process that involves transferring items between warehouses. To reflect this process in documents, you need to activate the ''TR'' order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. 
*Warehouse-specific vendor and sales prices: You can define warehouse-specific sales prices and vendor prices for items. For more information, see the [[#_96175577-31ab-4484-93a3-73c33d548a8c|Warehouse-Specific Prices] section of this topic.
*Inventory transfers: If your organization has multiple warehouses, you can transfer items between warehouses. To track these movements of items, you can use inventory transfers, which you create on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_40_00|Transfers] ([~/?ScreenId=IN304000|IN304000]) form. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\InvMgmt_2Step_Transfers_GeneralInfo|Two-Step Transfers: General Information].
[anchor|#_791cba04-cbe4-4c52-9276-367062c23229]
==Warehouse-Specific Settings for Stock Items==
For each stock item at a particular warehouse (that is, for each item–warehouse pair), you can specify the following on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form:[anchor|#_70a75297-0c49-4d13-a94f-9362dcfde769]
*The default locations for issuing and receiving the item at this warehouse (if you use multiple locations)
*The inventory account to be used for the stock item at this warehouse
*The ABC code and movement class assigned to the item when it is at this warehouse
*The replenishment settings for the item when it is stocked in this warehouse

The system also creates an entity for an item–warehouse pair on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] form in the following cases:[anchor|#_7b50a17c-9c56-4974-b283-843a50add4b8]
*When any user specifies or changes the default warehouse for an inventory item on the '''Warehouse Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form.
*When any user releases the first inventory receipt of a particular item coming to the new warehouse (or another transaction that brings an item to a warehouse for the first time, such as the receiving part of an inventory transfer).
[anchor|#_9b3bd03a-75f0-4f61-8bd4-94c7821a26a3]
==Warehouse as a Source of GL Accounts for Posting Classes==
A posting class, which is specified for each stock item, is a group of settings that provide the default values for the purchase, sales, and inventory transactions with the item and define how these transactions will be posted to the general ledger. One of these default values is the source of general ledger accounts to be used for the item, and you can use a warehouse as a source of default GL accounts for an inventory item. You define the source of accounts that the system should use in a posting class by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) form.{br}

For example, suppose that you have a separate inventory account for each warehouse. In this case, you can specify the needed inventory account in the warehouse settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form and specify a warehouse as the source of the inventory account in the posting class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] form.{br}

For more information about posting classes, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Posting_Classes_GeneralInfo|Posting Classes: General Information].[anchor|#_96175577-31ab-4484-93a3-73c33d548a8c]
==Warehouse-Specific Prices==
In Acumatica ERP, you can define vendor and sales prices of an item and select a warehouse for these prices. If no warehouse is specified for a price on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_20_10|Vendor Price Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=AP202010|AP202010]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) forms, this price is applied to all warehouses that are defined in the system. A price that has a warehouse specified has a higher priority than a price of the same type with no warehouse selected. For example, a promotional customer price that is specific to a warehouse has a higher priority than a promotional customer price with no warehouse specified. For more information, see [HelpRoot_PricesAndDiscounts\PriceDiscount_Reviewing_Sales_Prices_GeneralInfo|Sales Prices: General Information] and [HelpRoot_PricesAndDiscounts\PriceDiscount_Reviewing_Vendor_Prices_GeneralInfo|Vendor Prices: General Information].((({S:Warn}The system does not use warehouse-specific prices in accounts payable and accounts receivable documents, because these documents do not include warehouse information.
)))]]></column>

For more information, see the  Warehouse-Specific Settings for Stock Items Warehouse-Specific Settings for Stock Items section of this topic. The warehouse as a source for general ledger accounts: If you store inventory items of           the same category in multiple warehouses and each warehouse has specific general ledger           accounts specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses (IN204000) form, you can use the           warehouse as a source of default GL accounts for any inventory item. For details, see the              Warehouse as a Source of GL Accounts for Posting Classes Warehouse as a Source of GL Accounts for Posting Classes section of this topic. The  TR  order type for sales with transfers: If you use multiple warehouses, you           can implement a sales process that involves transferring items between warehouses. To           reflect this process in documents, you need to activate the  TR  order type on the               ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form.            Warehouse-specific vendor and sales prices: You can define warehouse-specific sales           prices and vendor prices for items. For more information, see the  Warehouse-Specific Prices Warehouse-Specific Prices section of this topic. Inventory transfers: If your organization has multiple warehouses, you can transfer           items between warehouses. To track these movements of items, you can use inventory           transfers, which you create on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN304000|IN304000]) Transfers (IN304000) form. For           details, see  Two-Step Transfers: General Information. Warehouse-Specific Settings for Stock Items For each stock item at a particular warehouse (that is, for each item–warehouse         pair), you can specify the following on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details (IN204500)         form: The default locations for issuing and receiving the item at this warehouse (if you use           multiple locations) The inventory account to be used for the stock item at this warehouse The ABC code and movement class assigned to the item when it is at this warehouse The replenishment settings for the item when it is stocked in this warehouse The system also creates an entity for an item–warehouse pair on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details form in the following cases: When any user specifies or changes the default warehouse for an inventory item on the              Warehouse Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items           (IN202500) form. When any user releases the first inventory receipt of a particular item coming to the           new warehouse (or another transaction that brings an item to a warehouse for the first           time, such as the receiving part of an inventory transfer). Warehouse as a Source of GL Accounts for Posting Classes A posting class, which is specified for each stock item, is a group of settings that         provide the default values for the purchase, sales, and inventory transactions with the item         and define how these transactions will be posted to the general ledger. One of these default         values is the source of general ledger accounts to be used for the item, and you can use a         warehouse as a source of default GL accounts for an inventory item. You define the source of         accounts that the system should use in a posting class by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) Posting Classes (IN206000) form. For example, suppose that you have a separate inventory account for each warehouse. In this         case, you can specify the needed inventory account in the warehouse settings on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses (IN204000) form and specify a warehouse as the source of the         inventory account in the posting class on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) Posting Classes form. For more information about posting classes, see  Posting Classes: General Information. Warehouse-Specific Prices In  Acumatica ERP, you can define vendor and sales prices of an item and select a warehouse for these         prices. If no warehouse is specified for a price on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP202010|AP202010]) Vendor Price Worksheets         (AP202010) or   ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) Sales Prices (AR202000) forms, this price is applied to all         warehouses that are defined in the system. A price that has a warehouse specified has a         higher priority than a price of the same type with no warehouse selected. For example, a         promotional customer price that is specific to a warehouse has a higher priority than a         promotional customer price with no warehouse specified. For more information, see  Sales Prices: General Information and  Vendor Prices: General Information. The system does not use warehouse-specific prices in accounts payable and accounts         receivable documents, because these documents do not include warehouse information. ]]></column>

==Story==
Suppose that the SweetLife company is going to open a new retail shop in Miami, Florida, with a small warehouse in it for keeping fruits and jams. The warehouse will contain one location where all items will be stored. Organizationally, the shop will be part of the SweetLife Head Office branch. This store will specialize in purchasing, storing, and selling exotic fruits (such as dragon fruit and guavas) from Mexico. To track item costs in the new warehouse, you will create a separate inventory account.{br}

To prepare the system to process documents for the new retail shop, you, as an implementation manager, will create a new warehouse, specify warehouse-specific settings for the needed stock items, and specify other warehouse-related settings to support the changes in the company&rsquo;s operations.
==Process Overview==
As you create a warehouse and specify the related settings in the system, you do the following:[anchor|#_b9c34a74-29ca-41f5-acda-b76ca810e5d2]
#Use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_20_25_00|Chart of Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=GL202500|GL202500]) form to create the inventory account that you will use for the new warehouse.
#Create the warehouse for the new retail shop on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form.
#Change the settings of the posting class to be assigned to items moving to and from the warehouse on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) form so that the inventory account of the warehouse is used when an item with this posting class specified is included in an inventory transaction.
#Specify warehouse-specific settings for the items that are stored in multiple warehouses on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form.
#Process a purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form and the related purchase receipt on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, and make sure that the correct inventory account is used in the transactions generated on release of the inventory transaction.

==System Preparation==
Before you start creating a warehouse, you need to launch the Acumatica ERP website and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded. To sign in as a system administrator, use the ''gibbs'' login and ''123'' password.
==Step 1: Adding the Inventory Account==
Before you start creating the warehouse for the new shop, you will create the inventory account that you will later specify in the settings of this warehouse. Do the following:[anchor|#_e3c34138-3b13-4033-a3bc-bb46c06f3583]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_20_25_00|Chart of Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=GL202500|GL202500]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add Row'''.
#Specify the following settings in the row:
#*'''Account''': <tt>12200</tt>
#*'''Account Class''': ''WAREHOUSE''
#* '''Type''': ''Asset''
#* '''Active''': Selected
#*'''Description''': <tt>Inventory Asset for FLORETAIL warehouse</tt>
#*'''Control Account Module''': ''IN''
#* '''Allow Manual Entry''': Cleared
#*'''Post Option''': ''Summary''
#* '''Cash Account''': Cleared
#*'''Secured''': Cleared[anchor|#_843d6ccd-3f9d-4a5c-9f6e-96e35fdf3883]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

You have created the account that will be specified as the inventory account for the new warehouse. The inventory account for a warehouse is the asset account to be used to maintain the balance of the inventory at this warehouse.
==Step 2: Creating the Warehouse==
To create the warehouse with one location for the new shop, perform the following instructions:[anchor|#_4329a1d2-42a6-45fa-bc00-bc10dbba024a]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record'''.
#In the Summary area, specify the following settings:
#*'''Warehouse ID''': <tt>FLORETAIL</tt>
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Active''': Selected
#*'''Description''': <tt>Retail warehouse in Florida</tt>
#On the '''Location Table''' table of the '''Location Table''' tab, add the location as follows:
##On the form toolbar, click '''Add Row'''.
##In the '''Location ID''' column, enter <tt>MAIN</tt>.
##In the '''Description''' column, enter <tt>Location in the Floretail warehouse</tt>.
##Keep default values in all other columns.
#In the '''Receiving Location''' box of the same tab, select ''MAIN''. The system will copy this location to purchase and inventory receipts by default.
#On the '''GL Accounts''' tab, specify the following settings:
#*'''Override Inventory Account''': Selected
#*'''Inventory Account''': ''12200 - Inventory Asset for FLORETAIL warehouse''
#* '''Sales Account''': ''40000 - Sales Revenue''
#* '''COGS/Expense Account''': ''50000 - COGS - Inventory''
#* '''Standard Cost Variance Account''': ''52100 - Standard Cost Adjustments''
#* '''Standard Cost Revaluation Account''': ''52110 - Standard Cost Revaluation Account''
#* '''PO Accrual Account''': ''20100 - Inventory Purchase Accrual''
#* '''Purchase Price Variance Account''': ''52300 - Purchase Price Variance''
#* '''Landed Cost Variance Account''': ''52400 - Landed Cost Variance''
#On the '''Address Information''' tab, specify the following settings:
#*'''Company Name''': <tt>SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center</tt>
#*'''City''': <tt>Miami</tt>
#*'''Country''': ''US''
#* '''State''': ''FL''[anchor|#_ec5a2e07-6311-4bdb-915c-fe533ee11a1f]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

You have created a warehouse for the new retail shop.
==Step 3: Changing the Posting Class Settings==
To track items in the <tt>FLORETAIL</tt> warehouse, you have created a separate inventory account and specified it in the warehouse settings. Because fruits will be sold from the Wholesale, Retail, and Floretail warehouses, you need to track costs of fruit items specifically for each warehouse. For fruit items, the ''FDI'' posting class is used. For this posting class, you will specify that the system must use an inventory account from warehouse settings in transactions with fruit items. You change the settings of the ''FDI'' posting class as follows:[anchor|#_b36a8915-43d3-42c5-946c-fdf6b456d1c5]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) form, select the ''FDI'' class ID.
#In the '''Use Inventory/Accrual Account from''' box on the '''Posting Settings''' tab, select ''Warehouse''.[anchor|#_c9a177e6-1d8a-42b3-815d-221357f787a6]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

With this setting, when an item with this posting class specified is included in an inventory transaction, the system will use the inventory account specified in the settings of the warehouse involved in the transaction.
==Step 4: Specifying Item–Warehouse Settings==
Because dragon fruit and guava items purchased in the Floretail warehouse will have Mexico as a country of origin and these items will be typically purchased, stored, and sold from the Floretail warehouse, you need to specify the item settings specific to the new warehouse. The system will use warehouse-specific settings with the higher priority than general settings specified for the items when you process documents with the items. You specify the settings of the dragon fruit and guava stock items in the new warehouse as follows:[anchor|#_9a4e32a8-44e4-40c9-90f2-b50daee0938a]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form.
#Specify the settings for dragon fruit in the ''FLORETAIL'' warehouse as follows:
##In the '''Inventory ID''' box, select ''DRAGONFR''.
##On the table toolbar of the '''Warehouse Details''' tab, click '''Add Warehouse Detail'''.
##On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form, which opens, select ''FLORETAIL'' in the '''Warehouse''' box. Notice that in the '''Inventory Account''' box of the '''General Settings''' tab, the system has inserted the ''12200'' account.
##In the '''Country of Origin''' box, select ''MX''.
##Save your changes.
##Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form with the ''DRAGONFR'' stock item selected.
##On the '''Warehouse Details''' tab, make sure that the ''FLORETAIL'' warehouse is listed and the ''12200'' inventory account is specified for it.
##In the '''Default''' column, select the check box for the ''FLORETAIL'' warehouse.[anchor|#_894e45aa-b5e2-45c2-8f1e-321ef4fccf79]
##On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.
#Specify the settings for guavas in the ''FLORETAIL'' warehouse as follows:
##In the '''Inventory ID''' box, select ''GUAVAS''.
##On the table toolbar of the '''Warehouse Details''' tab, click '''Add Warehouse Detail'''.
##On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form, which opens, select ''FLORETAIL'' in the '''Warehouse''' box. Notice that in the '''Inventory Account''' box of the '''General Settings''' tab, the system has inserted the ''12200'' account.
##In the '''Country of Origin''' box, select ''MX''.
##Save your changes.
##Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form with the ''GUAVAS'' stock item selected.
##On the '''Warehouse Details''' tab, make sure that the ''FLORETAIL'' warehouse is listed and the ''12200'' inventory account is specified for it.
##In the '''Default''' column, select the check box for the ''FLORETAIL'' warehouse.[anchor|#_0dca9241-649b-4380-bea2-fce6e12f0ba8]
##On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

For dragon fruit and guavas (that existed in the system), you have specified settings specific for the new warehouse.
==Step 5: Processing a Purchase in the New Warehouse==
To make sure that the amounts of the ''DRAGONFR'' and ''GUAVAS'' inventory items are posted to the correct inventory account for the ''FLORETAIL'' warehouse, you will create and process a purchase order and purchase receipt containing one of the items. (You have specified the inventory account the same way for both items, so it is not necessary to test both.) You will then view the details of the generated transaction to be sure the inventory account you specified is used. Do the following:[anchor|#_bd3469c0-4f28-48e4-8fe2-d954af694ef9]
#On the company and branch selection menu, on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure the ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center'' branch is selected.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, create a purchase order for 20 pounds of guavas as follows:
##On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record'''.
##In the '''Vendor''' box of the Summary area, select ''GLORYFRUIT''.
##In the '''Description''' box, type <tt>Purchase of 20 lb of dragon fruit</tt>.
##On the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab, click '''Add Row'''.
##Make sure that in the '''Branch''' column of the new row, ''HEADOFFICE'' is specified.
##In the '''Inventory ID''' column, select ''DRAGONFR''.
##In the '''Warehouse''' column, make sure that ''FLORETAIL'' is specified.
##In the '''Order Qty.''' column, type <tt>20</tt>.
##In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box.[anchor|#_369e62aa-8311-4952-b45c-d255794f17b1]
##On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.
#Create and process a purchase receipt for the order you have just created as follows:
##While still viewing the purchase order, on the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Enter PO Receipt'''. The [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form opens with the relevant details copied from the purchase order. The purchase receipt has the ''Balanced'' status, so it can be released.
##On the form toolbar, click '''Release'''.
##On the '''Other Information''' tab, click the link in the '''IN Ref. Nbr.''' box. The system opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) form with the inventory receipt that has been created (and automatically released upon creation) for the purchase receipt.
##On the '''Financial Details''' tab of this form, click the link in the '''Batch Nbr.''' box. The system opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_30_10_00|Journal Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=GL301000|GL301000]) form.
#:In the table, you can see that the system has debited the ''12200'' account for this transaction. This means that the system has used an inventory account specified in the ''FLORETAIL'' warehouse settings.

On the form toolbar, click  Add New Record . In the Summary area, specify the following settings: Warehouse ID :                              FLORETAIL Branch :  HEADOFFICE Active : Selected Description :  Retail warehouse in                                 Florida On the  Location Table  table of the  Location                         Table  tab, add the location as follows: On the form toolbar, click  Add Row . In the  Location ID  column, enter                                  MAIN . In the  Description  column, enter                                  Location in the Floretail warehouse . Keep default values in all other columns. In the  Receiving Location  box of the same tab, select                          MAIN . The system will copy this location to purchase and inventory                     receipts by default. On the  GL Accounts  tab, specify the following                         settings: Override Inventory Account : Selected Inventory Account :  12200 - Inventory Asset for                                 FLORETAIL warehouse Sales Account :  40000 - Sales Revenue COGS/Expense Account :  50000 - COGS -                                 Inventory Standard Cost Variance Account :  52100 -                                 Standard Cost Adjustments Standard Cost Revaluation Account :  52110 -                                 Standard Cost Revaluation Account PO Accrual Account :  20100 - Inventory Purchase                                 Accrual Purchase Price Variance Account :  52300 -                                 Purchase Price Variance Landed Cost Variance Account :  52400 - Landed                                 Cost Variance On the  Address Information  tab, specify the following                         settings: Company Name :  SweetLife Head Office                                 and Wholesale Center City :  Miami Country :  US State :  FL On the form toolbar, click  Save . You have created a warehouse for the new retail shop. Step 3: Changing the Posting Class Settings To track items in the  FLORETAIL  warehouse, you have created a                 separate inventory account and specified it in the warehouse settings. Because                 fruits will be sold from the Wholesale, Retail, and Floretail warehouses, you need                 to track costs of fruit items specifically for each warehouse. For fruit items, the                      FDI  posting class is used. For this posting class, you will specify that                 the system must use an inventory account from warehouse settings in transactions                 with fruit items. You change the settings of the  FDI  posting class as                 follows: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) Posting Classes (IN206000) form, select the  FDI                      class ID. In the  Use Inventory/Accrual Account from  box on the                          Posting Settings  tab, select  Warehouse . On the form toolbar, click  Save . With this setting, when an item with this posting class specified is included in an                 inventory transaction, the system will use the inventory account specified in the                 settings of the warehouse involved in the transaction. Step 4: Specifying Item–Warehouse Settings Because dragon fruit and guava items purchased in the Floretail warehouse will have                 Mexico as a country of origin and these items will be typically purchased, stored,                 and sold from the Floretail warehouse, you need to specify the item settings                 specific to the new warehouse. The system will use warehouse-specific settings with                 the higher priority than general settings specified for the items when you process                 documents with the items. You specify the settings of the dragon fruit and guava                 stock items in the new warehouse as follows: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form. Specify the settings for dragon fruit in the  FLORETAIL  warehouse as                         follows: In the  Inventory ID  box, select                              DRAGONFR . On the table toolbar of the  Warehouse Details                              tab, click  Add Warehouse Detail . On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details (IN204500) form, which opens,                             select  FLORETAIL  in the  Warehouse  box.                             Notice that in the  Inventory Account  box of the                                  General Settings  tab, the system has inserted                             the  12200  account. In the  Country of Origin  box, select                              MX . Save your changes.

Notice that in the  Inventory Account  box of the                                  General Settings  tab, the system has inserted                             the  12200  account. In the  Country of Origin  box, select                              MX . Save your changes. Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form with the  GUAVAS                              stock item selected. On the  Warehouse Details  tab, make sure that the                                  FLORETAIL  warehouse is listed and the  12200  inventory                             account is specified for it. In the  Default  column, select the check box for                             the  FLORETAIL  warehouse. On the form toolbar, click  Save . For dragon fruit and guavas (that existed in the system), you have specified settings                 specific for the new warehouse. Step 5: Processing a Purchase in the New Warehouse To make sure that the amounts of the  DRAGONFR  and  GUAVAS  inventory                 items are posted to the correct inventory account for the  FLORETAIL                  warehouse, you will create and process a purchase order and purchase receipt                 containing one of the items. (You have specified the inventory account the same way                 for both items, so it is not necessary to test both.) You will then view the details                 of the generated transaction to be sure the inventory account you specified is used.                 Do the following: On the company and branch selection menu, on the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP screen, make sure the  SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center                      branch is selected. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form, create a purchase order                     for 20 pounds of guavas as follows: On the form toolbar, click  Add New Record . In the  Vendor  box of the Summary area, select                                  GLORYFRUIT . In the  Description  box, type  Purchase                                 of 20 lb of dragon fruit . On the table toolbar of the  Document Details  tab,                             click  Add Row . Make sure that in the  Branch  column of the new                             row,  HEADOFFICE  is specified. In the  Inventory ID  column, select                                  DRAGONFR . In the  Warehouse  column, make sure that                                  FLORETAIL  is specified. In the  Order Qty.  column, type                                  20 . In the Summary area, clear the  Hold  check                             box. On the form toolbar, click  Save . Create and process a purchase receipt for the order you have just created as                         follows: While still viewing the purchase order, on the form toolbar, click  Actions Enter PO Receipt . The   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form                             opens with the relevant details copied from the purchase order. The                             purchase receipt has the  Balanced  status, so it can be                             released. On the form toolbar, click  Release . On the  Other Information  tab, click the link in                             the  IN Ref. Nbr.  box. The system opens the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) Receipts (IN301000) form with the inventory receipt                             that has been created (and automatically released upon creation) for the                             purchase receipt. On the  Financial Details  tab of this form, click                             the link in the  Batch Nbr.  box. The system opens                             the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL301000|GL301000]) Journal Transactions (GL301000) form. In the table, you can see that the system has debited the  12200                          account for this transaction. This means that the system has used an                         inventory account specified in the  FLORETAIL  warehouse                     settings. ]]></column>

In Acumatica ERP, you can create multiple locations in each warehouse and configure them to best fit the logistics that have been established in your company. You can reserve specific locations for sales, receipts, transfers, goods to be returned to vendors, and goods returned by customers. You can assign different pick priorities to locations, to empty certain locations more quickly while using others less frequently.{br}

The functionality of multiple locations is available in the system if the ''Multiple Warehouse Locations'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

When you have multiple locations, you can register and process ''single-step transfers'' in the system, which involve moving items between locations of the same warehouse. (In Acumatica ERP, you can also register and process ''two-step transfers'', which are transfers between locations in different warehouses; see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\InvMgmt_2Step_Transfers_GeneralInfo|Two-Step Transfers: General Information] for more information.){br}

In the following sections, you will find information about warehouse locations and single-step transfers in Acumatica ERP.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#_73a3e4c8-1810-41a2-bd1b-910bf76f9952]
*Create and configure warehouse locations
*Perform single-step transfers between warehouse locations
*View item availability by location

==Applicable Scenarios==
You may need to create warehouse locations in the following cases:[anchor|#ul_env_32l_fhb][anchor|#_713bd4b4-3ebc-473d-b27c-c58fd13119bd]
*When you are initially configuring inventory entities and settings
*When you reorganize the physical locations within an existing warehouse and would like to track items in these places.

You create single-step transfers when you need to move items from one location to another location within the same warehouse and to track this movement in the system.
==Default Warehouse Location==
When a warehouse is created in the system where the ''Multiple Warehouse Locations'' feature is disabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the system automatically creates a default location (with the ''MAIN'' location ID) that the goods will be received to and issued from. The ''MAIN'' location has the following settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form:[anchor|#_7550d797-3671-4129-a5b7-6f79118fa38b]
*'''Active''': Selected
*'''Include in Qty. Available''': Selected
*:This means that the system adds the number of items stored in the location to the available quantity.
*'''Cost Separately''': Cleared
*:The default cost is used for items in this location.
*'''Sales Allowed''': Selected
*:With this setting, users can sell items from this location.
*'''Receipts Allowed''': Selected
*:This setting indicates that new items can be received to this location.
*'''Transfers Allowed''': Selected
*:This indicates that users can move items to and from this location.
((({S:Warn}These location settings are displayed on the '''Location Table''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] form only if the ''Multiple Warehouse Locations'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form; if it is not enabled, the tab is not shown on the form, but the settings listed above are used internally.
)))
When you create a warehouse in the system where the ''Multiple Warehouse Locations'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form, the default location is not created automatically, and you need to create at least one location for the warehouse.
==Configuration of Warehouse Locations==
You can define multiple locations for each warehouse on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form. You can also view and change existing locations of the warehouse and their settings, including the default location.{br}

You do the following to create and configure the locations of a particular warehouse in Acumatica ERP:[anchor|#_d7c2f705-dd65-491b-af60-a7261263a4c8]
#Optional: On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form, you review the structure of the ''INLOCATION'' segmented key, which defines the identifiers for warehouse locations. 
#:If you want to create a hierarchy of locations (site, aisle, pallet, bin, and so forth), you can configure location identifiers that consist of multiple segments, with each segment denoting a specific level in this hierarchy. For example, suppose that you have three racks, each with four shelves, in a warehouse. A location identifier can have the ''Rn-SHm'' format, where ''Rn'' is the number of the rack (such as ''R2'') and ''SHm'' is the number of the shelf in the rack (such as ''SH4''). 
#:For more information about segmented keys, see[HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Identifier_Segmentation|Segmented Identifiers].
#Open the warehouse on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] form. On the '''Location Table''' tab, you add the needed locations to the table and specify the settings of each.
#:((({S:Warn}To create a similar configuration of locations in multiple warehouses, you can export the location table of one of these warehouses to an Excel file and then import the settings from the file to another warehouse, changing the settings as needed. For details on importing the settings from an Excel file, see[HelpRoot_GettingStarted\Exporting_to_Excel|Integration with Excel].
)))
#Optional: In the boxes above the table of locations, you select the following default locations for inventory operations (which simplify data entry on purchase receipts and sales orders):
#*'''Receiving Location''': The default receiving location for stock items in the warehouse.
#*'''Shipping Location''': The default shipping location for the warehouse.
#*'''RMA Location''': The location used for all operations involving return merchandise authorization (RMA). The returned goods will be delivered to the location specified in this box, regardless of the warehouse location selected by default for the receipt of these goods.
#*'''Drop-Ship Location''': The location used for drop-ship orders and inventory issues that are automatically generated for drop-ship orders. This box is displayed only if the ''Drop Shipment'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
#Optional: In the '''Location Entry''' box in the Summary area, you specify the option that indicates whether you want to allow users to add new locations on the fly when they are entering inventory documents. If an option that allows these additions is selected, user-added locations can be viewed (and edited, if needed) along with other locations on the '''Location Table''' tab of the form.
[anchor|#_27f3e0da-101a-4d89-9d75-1a7434d3a115]
==Priorities of Warehouse Locations==
If any inventory items with the same inventory ID in the system are stored in multiple locations of the same warehouse, the system has to find the appropriate warehouse location from which to issue the items when a user creates a shipment for a sales order. Thus, for each location, on the '''Location Table''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form, in the '''Pick Priority '''column, you can specify the pick priority. If the system finds multiple locations that have the item, the system selects the location with the highest pick priority: In this column, ''1'' indicates the highest priority, ''2'' the next highest, and so forth to the lowest priority; 0 means that the pick priority is not defined.{br}

For example, suppose that you store a dairy product that can be kept for one week. You purchase this dairy product every day and store it in two locations of the warehouse: A and B. In Location A, you store a variant of the dairy product that can be kept from five to seven days. In Location B, you store a variant of the dairy product that can be kept from two to four days. You can assign the highest pick priority to Location B so that dairy products with an earlier expiration date are shipped first.{br}

If for the majority of stock items, you specify a warehouse location in the '''Default Issue From''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form for an item, you can include this location in search for appropriate locations by selecting the '''Use Item Default Location for Picking''' check box on the '''Location Table''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] form. {br}

When this check box is selected, the system treats the location specified in the '''Default Issue From''' box as having a higher priority than the location with the highest possible pick priority. That is, the system searches for locations in the following order until it finds a match:[anchor|#_e78506ca-1af0-439a-a6b8-bd6da1bea66e]
#The warehouse location specified for the item in the '''Default Issue From''' box.
#The warehouse location with the highest pick priority specified on the '''Location Table''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] form. (The value ''1'' indicates the highest priority, ''2'' the next highest, and so forth; ''0'' means that the pick priority is not defined.)

==Single-Step Transfers==
Your organization can use single-step inventory transfers to record stock item movements between locations within the same warehouse. For a single-step transfer, you should specify the following information on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_40_00|Transfers] ([~/?ScreenId=IN304000|IN304000]) form:[anchor|#ul_gjn_fjp_nv]
*The source warehouse (in the '''Warehouse''' box).
*The destination warehouse (in the '''To Warehouse''' box). For a single-step transfer, select the same warehouse as the source warehouse.
*Transaction details of the stock item to be moved: the source location, the destination location, inventory ID, UOM, and quantity.

You can release a particular inventory transfer by clicking '''Release''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_40_00|Transfers] form. Also, you can release multiple transfers at the same time by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_10_00|Release IN Documents] ([~/?ScreenId=IN501000|IN501000]) form. No GL transactions are generated for a single-step transfer that records item movement from one location to another within the same warehouse.{br}

When a transfer performed between locations within the same warehouse is released, the system updates the allocations and the availability data for the transferred items but does not change the item costs.]]></column>

A location identifier can have the  Rn-SHm  format, where  Rn              is the number of the rack (such as  R2 ) and  SHm  is the number of the shelf             in the rack (such as  SH4 ).  For more information about segmented keys,  see Segmented Identifiers. Open the warehouse on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses form. On the              Location             Table  tab, you add the needed locations to the table and           specify the settings of each. To create a similar configuration of locations in             multiple warehouses, you can export the location table of one of these warehouses to an             Excel file and then import the settings from the file to another warehouse, changing the             settings as needed. For details on importing the settings from an Excel file,  see Integration with Excel. Optional: In the boxes above the table of locations, you select the following default           locations for inventory operations (which simplify data entry on purchase receipts and           sales orders): Receiving Location : The default receiving location for stock               items in the warehouse. Shipping Location : The default shipping location for the               warehouse. RMA Location : The location used for all operations involving               return merchandise authorization (RMA). The returned goods will be delivered to the               location specified in this box, regardless of the warehouse location selected by               default for the receipt of these goods. Drop-Ship Location : The location used for drop-ship orders               and inventory issues that are automatically generated for drop-ship orders. This box               is displayed only if the  Drop Shipment  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. Optional: In the  Location Entry  box in the Summary area, you           specify the option that indicates whether you want to allow users to add new locations on           the fly when they are entering inventory documents. If an option that allows these           additions is selected, user-added locations can be viewed (and edited, if needed) along           with other locations on the  Location Table  tab of the form. Priorities of Warehouse Locations If any inventory items with the same inventory ID in the system are stored in multiple         locations of the same warehouse, the system has to find the appropriate warehouse location         from which to issue the items when a user creates a shipment for a sales order. Thus, for         each location, on the  Location Table  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses (IN204000) form, in the  Pick Priority          column, you can specify the pick priority. If the system finds multiple         locations that have the item, the system selects the location with the highest pick         priority: In this column,  1  indicates the highest priority,  2  the next         highest, and so forth to the lowest priority; 0 means that the pick priority is not         defined. For example, suppose that you store a dairy product that can be kept for one week. You         purchase this dairy product every day and store it in two locations of the warehouse: A and         B. In Location A, you store a variant of the dairy product that can be kept from five to         seven days. In Location B, you store a variant of the dairy product that can be kept from         two to four days. You can assign the highest pick priority to Location B so that dairy         products with an earlier expiration date are shipped first. If for the majority of stock items, you specify a warehouse location in the            Default Issue From  box on the  General           Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500)         form for an item, you can include this location in search for appropriate locations by         selecting the  Use Item Default Location for Picking  check box on the            Location Table  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses form.  When this check box is selected, the system treats the location specified in the            Default Issue From  box as having a higher priority than the         location with the highest possible pick priority. That is, the system searches for locations         in the following order until it finds a match: The warehouse location specified for the item in the  Default Issue             From  box. The warehouse location with the highest pick priority specified on the              Location Table  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses form. (The value  1  indicates the highest           priority,  2  the next highest, and so forth;  0  means that the pick priority           is not defined.) Single-Step Transfers Your organization can use single-step inventory transfers to record stock item movements         between locations within the same warehouse. For a single-step transfer, you should specify         the following information on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN304000|IN304000]) Transfers (IN304000) form: The source warehouse (in the  Warehouse  box). The destination warehouse (in the  To Warehouse  box). For a           single-step transfer, select the same warehouse as the source warehouse. Transaction details of the stock item to be moved: the source location, the destination           location, inventory ID, UOM, and quantity. You can release a particular inventory transfer by clicking  Release          on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN304000|IN304000]) Transfers form. Also, you can         release multiple transfers at the same time by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN501000|IN501000]) Release IN Documents         (IN501000) form. No GL transactions are generated for a single-step transfer that records         item movement from one location to another within the same warehouse. When a transfer performed between locations within the same warehouse is released, the         system updates the allocations and the availability data for the transferred items but does         not change the item costs. ]]></column>

==Story==
Suppose that the SweetLife company has organized separate storage areas for spices and write-off items (such as fruits that spoiled and damaged jam jars) in the retail warehouse and needs to track these items by warehouse locations. You will create two warehouse locations for spices and write-off items. (A third location of the warehouse is the default location, ''MAIN'', which is where items are initially received and items not stored in the other areas are stored.)
==Process Overview==
In this activity, as you create locations for spices and write-off items for the retail warehouse by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form, you will specify a location identifier and appropriate settings for each location.
==System Preparation==
Before you start creating warehouse locations, you need to launch the Acumatica ERP website and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded. To sign in as a system administrator, use the ''gibbs'' login and ''123'' password.
==Step: Creating Warehouse Locations==
You will leave the settings of the ''MAIN'' location as they are because ''MAIN'' is a default location for all stock items in the retail warehouse. You create locations for spices and write-off items as follows:[anchor|#_e5c653b6-58ea-4f46-8d83-ba63f9cce0db]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form.
#In the '''Warehouse ID''' box of the summary area, select ''RETAIL''.
#On the '''Location Table''' tab, create a location for spices as follows:
##On the toolbar of the '''Location Table''' table, click '''Add Row'''.
##In the '''Location ID''' column, type <tt>SPICES</tt>.
##In the '''Description''' column, type <tt>Location for spices</tt>.
#Create a location for write-off items as follows:
##On the toolbar of the '''Location Table''' table, click '''Add Row'''.
##In the '''Location ID''' column, type <tt>WRITEOFF</tt>.
##In the '''Description''' column, type <tt>Location for write-off items</tt>.
##In the '''Include in Qty. Available''' column, clear the check box, because items stored in this location will not be sold (thus should not be considered available).
##
##In the '''Sales Allowed''' column, clear the check box.[anchor|#_d6be9a56-0171-4d2d-b02d-7974cba7da43]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

==Story==
Suppose that the SweetLife company has decided to move cinnamon and ginger from the default location of the retail warehouse (to which the items have been received) to the location of this warehouse that is dedicated to spices. You need to reflect these changes in inventory. Acting as a warehouse manager, you will create a single-step inventory transfer.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, the following features have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form: [anchor|#_de016f84-6b54-499c-a7ad-dc116afe37b2]
*''Inventory''
* ''Multiple Warehouse Locations''

The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in the system:[anchor|#_6d8179f1-5cd5-4721-b0ee-22897adbb5a6]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form, the ''RETAIL'' warehouse and the ''MAIN'' location in this warehouse
*The following items on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form: ''CINNAMON'' and ''GINGER''.

==Process Overview==
To create and process a single-step transfer in this activity, you will do the following:[anchor|#_463c74c7-8155-4acb-a797-d9294c5dc407]
#View the item availability in the source and destination locations on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_90_10|Storage Summary] ([~/?ScreenId=IN409010|IN409010]) form.
#Create a single-step transfer on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_40_00|Transfers] ([~/?ScreenId=IN304000|IN304000]) form.
#Make sure that the items are available in the destination locations on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_90_10|Storage Summary] ([~/?ScreenId=IN409010|IN409010]) form.

==System Preparation==
Before you start processing transfers between warehouse locations, you perform the following instructions:[anchor|#_1920f95c-9a2f-459d-9b77-2ee5a71573dc]
*Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded. To sign in as a warehouse manager, use the ''lam'' login and the ''123'' password.
*Make sure that the ''SPICES'' and ''WRITEOFF'' warehouse locations have been created in the ''RETAIL'' warehouse, as described in [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Warehouse_Locations_Implem_Activity|Warehouse Locations and Single-Step Transfers: Implementation Activity].

==Step 1: Viewing Item Availability==
To check the availability of cinnamon and ginger in the default (''MAIN'') location, do the following:[anchor|#_9ac0501c-d7f6-4e14-b3dd-dc5eb094449d]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_10_00|Inventory Summary] ([~/?ScreenId=IN401000|IN401000]) form.
#In the '''Inventory ID''' box, select ''CINNAMON''.
#In the '''Warehouse''' box, select ''RETAIL''.
#In the table, make sure that the on-hand quantity in the ''MAIN'' location is positive. Notice that the ''SPICES'' location is not displayed in the table, which means that it does not contain any cinnamon.
#In the '''Inventory ID''' box, select ''GINGER''.
#In the table, make sure that the on-hand quantity in the ''MAIN'' location is positive. Notice that the ''SPICES'' location is not displayed in the table, which means that it does not contain any ginger.

==Step 2: Transferring Items Between Warehouse Locations==
Suppose that you have moved the cinnamon and ginger to the ''SPICES'' location. Further suppose that when you were moving the packages with cinnamon, you realized that two packages were broken and you moved these packages to the ''WRITEOFF'' location. The rest of the cinnamon packages were moved to the ''SPICES'' location. To record the movement of the items between these locations within the retail warehouse, do the following:[anchor|#_eb5de1e1-25ad-4c94-840a-65126e0ee94a]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_40_00|Transfers] ([~/?ScreenId=IN304000|IN304000]) form.[anchor|#_65d2c704-786a-4d34-a81f-be36c8c97df4]

#In the '''Transfer Type''' box of the Summary area, make sure that ''1-Step'' is selected.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record'''.
#In the '''Warehouse ID''' box, select ''RETAIL''.
#In the '''To Warehouse ID''' box, select ''RETAIL''.
#In the '''Description''' box, type <tt>Moving ginger and cinnamon to the SPICES and WRITEOFF locations</tt>.
#Add the items to be transferred between the ''MAIN'' and ''SPICES'' locations as follows:
##On the table toolbar of the '''Transaction Details''' tab, click '''Add Item'''. The '''Inventory Lookup''' dialog box opens.
##In the '''Inventory''' box, type <tt>GINGER</tt>. The system searches for items with this string in the inventory ID and lists in the table the one item it finds with this ID.
##In the row with the ''GINGER'' item, select the check box in the unlabeled column.
##In the '''Qty. Selected''' column of this row, make sure that the same value that is in the '''Qty. On Hand''' column is specified.
##In the '''Inventory''' box, type <tt>CINNAMON</tt>. The system again searches for items with this string in the inventory ID and lists the item with this ID in the table, where the already-selected row is still listed.
##In the row with the ''CINNAMON'' item, select the check box in the unlabeled column.
##In the '''Qty. Selected''' column of the ''CINNAMON'' row, type the value of the '''Qty. On Hand''' column minus 2 to account for the damaged packages.
##Click the '''Add & Close''' button to add the selected items to the transfer and close the dialog box.
##In the '''To Location ID''' column, in each line, select ''SPICES''.
#Add the items to be transferred between the ''MAIN'' and ''WRITEOFF'' locations ad follows:[anchor|#_b05a1e5e-93a5-4f29-8952-01640d4d4f46]

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Warehouse Locations and Single-Step Transfers: Process Activity In the following process activity, you will learn how to move stock items between                 warehouse locations within the same warehouse by using a single-step transfer. The following activity is based on the                  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system settings             have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the activity             and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100  dataset             to its initial state. Story Suppose that the SweetLife company has decided to move cinnamon and ginger from the                 default location of the retail warehouse (to which the items have been received) to                 the location of this warehouse that is dedicated to spices. You need to reflect                 these changes in inventory. Acting as a warehouse manager, you will create a                 single-step inventory transfer. Configuration Overview For the purposes of this activity, the following features have been enabled on the                       ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS101000) form:  Inventory Multiple Warehouse Locations The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in                 the system: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses (IN204000) form, the                              RETAIL  warehouse and the  MAIN  location in this                         warehouse The following items on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items                         (IN202500) form:  CINNAMON  and  GINGER . Process Overview To create and process a single-step transfer in this activity, you will do the                 following: View the item availability in the source and destination locations on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN409010|IN409010]) Storage Summary (IN409010) form. Create a single-step transfer on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN304000|IN304000]) Transfers (IN304000)                     form. Make sure that the items are available in the destination locations on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN409010|IN409010]) Storage Summary (IN409010) form. System Preparation Before you start processing transfers between warehouse locations, you perform the                 following instructions: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the  U100  dataset preloaded. To                     sign in as a warehouse manager, use the  lam  login and the  123                      password. Make sure that the  SPICES  and  WRITEOFF  warehouse locations have                     been created in the  RETAIL  warehouse, as described in  Warehouse Locations and Single-Step Transfers: Implementation Activity. Step 1: Viewing Item Availability To check the availability of cinnamon and ginger in the default ( MAIN )                 location, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN401000|IN401000]) Inventory Summary (IN401000) form. In the  Inventory ID  box, select  CINNAMON . In the  Warehouse  box, select  RETAIL . In the table, make sure that the on-hand quantity in the  MAIN  location is                     positive. Notice that the  SPICES  location is not displayed in the table,                     which means that it does not contain any cinnamon. In the  Inventory ID  box, select  GINGER . In the table, make sure that the on-hand quantity in the  MAIN  location is                     positive. Notice that the  SPICES  location is not displayed in the table,                     which means that it does not contain any ginger. Step 2: Transferring Items Between Warehouse Locations Suppose that you have moved the cinnamon and ginger to the  SPICES  location.                 Further suppose that when you were moving the packages with cinnamon, you realized                 that two packages were broken and you moved these packages to the  WRITEOFF                  location. The rest of the cinnamon packages were moved to the  SPICES                  location. To record the movement of the items between these locations within the                 retail warehouse, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN304000|IN304000]) Transfers (IN304000) form. On the form toolbar, click  Add New Record . In the  Transfer Type  box of the Summary area, make sure                     that  1-Step  is selected. On the form toolbar, click  Add New Record . In the  Warehouse ID  box, select  RETAIL . In the  To Warehouse ID  box, select  RETAIL . In the  Description  box, type  Moving ginger and                         cinnamon to the SPICES and WRITEOFF locations . Add the items to be transferred between the  MAIN  and  SPICES                      locations as follows: On the table toolbar of the  Transaction Details                              tab, click  Add Item . The  Inventory                                 Lookup  dialog box opens. In the  Inventory  box, type                                  GINGER . The system searches for items with                             this string in the inventory ID and lists in the table the one item it                             finds with this ID. In the row with the  GINGER  item, select the check box in the                             unlabeled column. In the  Qty. Selected  column of this row, make                             sure that the same value that is in the  Qty. On                                 Hand  column is specified. In the  Inventory  box, type                                  CINNAMON . The system again searches for items                             with this string in the inventory ID and lists the item with this ID in                             the table, where the already-selected row is still listed. In the row with the  CINNAMON  item, select the check box in the                             unlabeled column. In the  Qty. Selected  column of the                                  CINNAMON  row, type the value of the  Qty. On                                 Hand  column minus 2 to account for the damaged                             packages. Click the  Add & Close  button to add the                             selected items to the transfer and close the dialog box. In the  To Location ID  column, in each line,                             select  SPICES . Add the items to be transferred between the  MAIN  and  WRITEOFF                      locations ad follows: On the table toolbar, click  Add Row . In the  Inventory ID  column of the new row, select                                  CINNAMON . In the  Location  column, select  MAIN . In the  To Location ID  column, select                                  WRITEOFF . In the  Quantity  column, type                                  2 . On the form toolbar, click  Save . On the form toolbar, click  Release  to release the                     transfer. Step 3: Viewing the Availability of Moved Items Now that you have moved items to the appropriate locations, you will make sure that                 cinnamon and ginger are available in the appropriate locations. Do the                 following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN401000|IN401000]) Inventory Summary (IN401000) form. In the  Inventory ID  box, select  GINGER . In the  Warehouse  box, select  RETAIL . In the table, make sure that the on-hand quantity in the  SPICES  location                     is positive. Notice that the  MAIN  location is not displayed in the table,                     which means that it does not contain any ginger. In the  Inventory ID  box, select  CINNAMON . In the table, make sure that the on-hand quantity in the  SPICES  and                          WRITEOFF  locations is positive. Notice that the  MAIN  location                     is not displayed in the table, which means that it does not contain any                     cinnamon. You have successfully recorded movement of the items to appropriate locations. ]]></column>

If your organization uses multiple warehouses to store items, you may need to transfer stock items between warehouses. To record stock movements between warehouses in Acumatica ERP, you use a two-step transfer—that is, you first issue the required quantity of items from a source warehouse, and you then receive the items in the destination warehouse.{br}

The following sections describe two-step transfers.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#_ed7a5550-d3ee-4b19-af28-ec1eb333294b]
*Record the movement of stock items between warehouses by using a two-step transfer
*Find information about items in transit

==Applicable Scenarios==
You use two-step transfers when you need to track movements of items between warehouses. A two-step transfer can reflect a movement between warehouses in different towns (which may take up to multiple days) or a movement between warehouses that are close to each other (which may take up to several hours).
==Two-Step Transfer Process==
For a two-step transfer, you create both of the following documents:[anchor|#ol_o4y_c2g_4v]
#Transfer of the ''2-Step'' type: You create this document by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_40_00|Transfers] ([~/?ScreenId=IN304000|IN304000]) form. When this document is released, the on-hand quantity of the items in the source warehouse is decreased.
#Transfer receipt: When the transferred items are received, you create an inventory receipt for this transfer on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) form by selecting the reference number of the transfer in the '''Transfer Nbr.''' box. When you do, the relevant settings of the transfer, including the detail lines, will be inserted in the transfer receipt. When the receipt is released, the on-hand quantity of the items in the destination warehouse is increased.

==Workflow of a Two-Step Inventory Transfer==
For a transfer of items between warehouses, the typical processing involves the actions and generated documents and transactions shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#_0d20f0cf-965a-4757-bbc1-3847bfeb3324][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_InvMgmt_TwoStep_Inventory_Transfer.png|popup|400px]
==Costs of Transferred Items==
Moving stock items between warehouses usually requires some time. Items that have been issued from a source warehouse and have not been delivered to a destination warehouse are regarded as being in transit. The costs of items in transit are recorded temporarily to the In-Transit account, which is specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form. When the items are received at the destination warehouse, their costs are transferred to the appropriate inventory account. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\InvMgmt_2Step_Transfers_Transactions|Two-Step Transfers: Generated Transactions].{br}

The costs the transferred items will have in the destination warehouse depend on the valuation methods assigned to the items. For items with the ''Average'' and ''Standard cost'' valuation methods, the cost of an item in the destination warehouse will be the same as the cost of the item at the source warehouse. For an item with the ''FIFO'' or ''Specific'' valuation method, a transfer receipt creates a new cost layer with the transferred quantity of the item and with the number and date of this transfer receipt.]]></column>

==Story==
Suppose that you as a purchasing manager in the retail shop of the SweetLife company ordered 50 pounds of apples directly from a supplier. When the apples were delivered to the warehouse of the retail shop, you realized that the warehouse has space only for 30 pounds of apples. To address this problem, you have decided to send 20 pounds of these apples to the Wholesale warehouse. You will create all required documents in Acumatica ERP to register in the system these transactions, from the purchase of the apples through the transfer to the other warehouse.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, the following features have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form: [anchor|#_de016f84-6b54-499c-a7ad-dc116afe37b2]

==System Preparation==
Before you start processing two-step transfers, you perform the following instructions:[anchor|#_1920f95c-9a2f-459d-9b77-2ee5a71573dc]
*Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded. To sign in as a purchasing manager, use the ''wiley'' login and the ''123'' password.
*On the company and branch selection menu, on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure the ''SweetLife Store'' branch is selected.

==Step 1: Ordering and Receiving Items in a Source Warehouse==
Before you can transfer apples from the ''RETAIL'' warehouse to the ''WHOLESALE'' warehouse, you need to process the purchasing documents. You do the following:[anchor|#_a92e09f6-0b2a-4514-83fc-24fae627433e]
#As a preliminary action, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_20_00|Inventory Allocation Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) form, do the following:
##In the '''Inventory ID''' box of the Summary area, select ''APPLES''.
##In the '''Warehouse''' box, select ''RETAIL''.
##Make a note of the initial value of the '''On Hand''' box. You will use it later to make sure that the quantity increases after receiving items in the warehouse.
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form.[anchor|#_59921091-d4e9-4f88-9ed7-63fa1b3193fd]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record'''.
#In the '''Vendor''' box of the Summary area, select ''GLORYFRUIT''.
#In the '''Description''' box, type <tt>Order of 50 pounds of apples from Glory Fruit Case</tt>.
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, do the following:
##On the table toolbar, click '''Add Row'''.
##In the '''Branch''' column, select ''RETAIL''.
##In the '''Inventory ID''' column, select ''APPLES''.
##In the '''Warehouse''' box, select ''RETAIL''.
##In the '''Order Qty.''' column, type <tt>50</tt>.
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''. The system saves the purchase order with the ''Open'' status.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Enter PO Receipt'''. The system opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form with the new purchase receipt (which has the data copied from the linked purchase order; it also has the ''Balanced'' status).
#In the '''Location''' column of the '''Document Details''' tab, select ''MAIN''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Release'''. The system creates and releases the inventory receipt. On the '''Other Information''' tab, you can view the reference number of the created inventory receipt; you can also click the reference number link to view the inventory receipt on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) form. The system changes the status of the purchase receipt to ''Released''.

You have processed the documents for ordering the apples from the vendor and receiving the apples to the Retail warehouse.
==Step 2: Reviewing the Availability of Items in the Source Warehouse==
To make sure that the ordered apples have become available in the Retail warehouse, you do the following:[anchor|#_2fa5a92c-dc74-4e01-8702-0ccf76c522d7]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_20_00|Inventory Allocation Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) form.
#In the '''Inventory ID''' box of the Summary area, select ''APPLES''.
#In the '''Warehouse''' box, select ''RETAIL''.
#Make sure that the value in the '''On Hand''' box has increased by 50.

==Step 3: Creating a Two-Step Transfer==
Now you need to register the movement of 20 pounds of the purchased apples to the Wholesale warehouse. You do the following:[anchor|#_486602a6-071d-4cad-80a6-b6f8b9b017ed]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_40_00|Transfers] ([~/?ScreenId=IN304000|IN304000]) form.[anchor|#_42f5b9c0-1750-4a97-a93b-7657ffe43025]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record'''.
#In the '''Transfer Type''' box of the Summary area, select ''2-Step''.
#In the '''Warehouse ID''' box, select ''RETAIL''.
#In the '''To Warehouse ID''' box, select ''WHOLESALE''.
#In the '''Description''' box, type <tt>Transfer of 20 pounds of apples from Retail to Wholesale</tt>.
#On the '''Transaction Details''' tab, do the following:[anchor|#_d45da627-1ec6-4030-b78e-093f61f1d198]
##On the table toolbar, click '''Add Row'''.
##In the '''Inventory ID''' column, select ''APPLES''.
##In the '''Location''' box, select ''MAIN''.
##In the '''Quantity''' column, type <tt>20</tt>.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Release'''. The system releases the transfer and changes its status to ''Released''.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_20_00|Inventory Allocation Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) form, do the following:
##In the '''Inventory ID''' box of the Summary area, select ''APPLES''.
##In the '''Warehouse''' box, clear the selected warehouse.
##On the '''Item Plans''' tab, make sure that a row with the ''In-Transit'' allocation type is displayed. This means that the apples have been issued from the ''RETAIL'' warehouse and have not been received in the ''WHOLESALE'' warehouse.

So far, you have processed the documents for registering movement of 20 pounds of apples from the Retail warehouse. Now you will register their receipt in the Wholesale warehouse.
==Step 4: Creating an Inventory Receipt==
Suppose that apples have been delivered to the Wholesale warehouse. Before processing the document to record this receipt, you need to view the initial on-hand quantity of apples in the Wholesale warehouse so that you can later make sure that this quantity is increased by the transferred quantity. Do the following to review this quantity and create the receipt:[anchor|#_41f4baa8-0ef1-4112-8822-71ad3afad992]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_20_00|Inventory Allocation Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) form, do the following:
##In the '''Inventory ID''' box of the Summary area, select ''APPLES''.
##In the '''Warehouse''' box, select ''WHOLESALE''.
##Make a note of the initial value of the '''On Hand''' box.
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) form.[anchor|#_4a59f31d-7b74-47ed-a8a5-3730202b6240]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record'''.
#In the '''Transfer Nbr.''' box, select the reference number of the two-step transfer you created in the previous step. The system copies the line for the ''APPLES'' item from the selected transfer to the '''Transaction Details''' tab.
#On the '''Transaction Details''' tab, in the '''Location''' box of the only row, make sure that ''MAIN'' is selected (which is the location to which you will receive the items in the ''WHOLESALE'' warehouse).
#On the form toolbar, click '''Release'''. The system releases the receipt and adds the item quantity from the receipt to the on-hand quantity of the ''APPLES'' item in the ''WHOLESALE'' warehouse (which you will verify in the next step).

==Step 5: Reviewing Availability of Items in the Destination Warehouse==
To make sure that the moved quantity of apples is now available in the Wholesale warehouse, do the following:[anchor|#_e1be6345-5eef-4375-b7fd-a0188dadd7b1]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_20_00|Inventory Allocation Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) form.
#In the '''Inventory ID''' box of the Summary area, select ''APPLES''.
#In the '''Warehouse''' box, select ''WHOLESALE''.
#Make sure that the value of the '''On Hand''' box has increased by 20.
#In the '''Warehouse''' box, clear the selected warehouse.
#Notice that, in the table on the '''Item Plans''' tab, the row with the ''In-Transit'' allocation type is not displayed any more. This means that the transfer that included the ''APPLES'' item has been released.

You will use it later to make sure that the quantity increases                             after receiving items in the warehouse. Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form. On the form toolbar, click  Add New Record . In the  Vendor  box of the Summary area, select                          GLORYFRUIT . In the  Description  box, type  Order of 50                         pounds of apples from Glory Fruit Case . On the  Document Details  tab, do the following: On the table toolbar, click  Add Row . In the  Branch  column, select  RETAIL . In the  Inventory ID  column, select                              APPLES . In the  Warehouse  box, select  RETAIL . In the  Order Qty.  column, type                                  50 . In the Summary area, clear the  Hold  check box. On the form toolbar, click  Save . The system saves the                     purchase order with the  Open  status. On the form toolbar, click  Actions Enter PO Receipt . The system opens the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000)                     form with the new purchase receipt (which has the data copied from the linked                     purchase order; it also has the  Balanced  status). In the  Location  column of the  Document                         Details  tab, select  MAIN . On the form toolbar, click  Release . The system creates                     and releases the inventory receipt. On the  Other                         Information  tab, you can view the reference number of the                     created inventory receipt; you can also click the reference number link to view                     the inventory receipt on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) Receipts (IN301000) form.                     The system changes the status of the purchase receipt to  Released . You have processed the documents for ordering the apples from the vendor and                 receiving the apples to the Retail warehouse. Step 2: Reviewing the Availability of Items in the Source Warehouse To make sure that the ordered apples have become available in the Retail warehouse,                 you do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) Inventory Allocation Details (IN402000) form. In the  Inventory ID  box of the Summary area, select                          APPLES . In the  Warehouse  box, select  RETAIL . Make sure that the value in the  On Hand  box has increased                     by 50. Step 3: Creating a Two-Step Transfer Now you need to register the movement of 20 pounds of the purchased apples to the                 Wholesale warehouse. You do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN304000|IN304000]) Transfers (IN304000) form. On the form toolbar, click  Add New Record . In the  Transfer Type  box of the Summary area, select                          2-Step . In the  Warehouse ID  box, select  RETAIL . In the  To Warehouse ID  box, select  WHOLESALE . In the  Description  box, type  Transfer of 20                         pounds of apples from Retail to Wholesale . On the  Transaction Details  tab, do the following: On the table toolbar, click  Add Row . In the  Inventory ID  column, select                              APPLES . In the  Location  box, select  MAIN . In the  Quantity  column, type                                  20 . On the form toolbar, click  Release . The system releases                     the transfer and changes its status to  Released . On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) Inventory Allocation Details (IN402000) form, do the following: In the  Inventory ID  box of the Summary area,                             select  APPLES . In the  Warehouse  box, clear the selected                             warehouse. On the  Item Plans  tab, make sure that a row with                             the  In-Transit  allocation type is displayed. This means that the                             apples have been issued from the  RETAIL  warehouse and have not                             been received in the  WHOLESALE  warehouse. So far, you have processed the documents for registering movement of 20 pounds of                 apples from the Retail warehouse. Now you will register their receipt in the                 Wholesale warehouse. Step 4: Creating an Inventory Receipt Suppose that apples have been delivered to the Wholesale warehouse. Before processing                 the document to record this receipt, you need to view the initial on-hand quantity                 of apples in the Wholesale warehouse so that you can later make sure that this                 quantity is increased by the transferred quantity. Do the following to review this                 quantity and create the receipt: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) Inventory Allocation Details (IN402000) form, do the following: In the  Inventory ID  box of the Summary area,                             select  APPLES . In the  Warehouse  box, select                              WHOLESALE . Make a note of the initial value of the  On Hand                              box. Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) Receipts (IN301000) form. On the form toolbar, click  Add New Record . In the  Transfer Nbr.  box, select the reference number of                     the two-step transfer you created in the previous step. The system copies the                     line for the  APPLES  item from the selected transfer to the                          Transaction Details  tab. On the  Transaction Details  tab, in the                          Location  box of the only row, make sure that                          MAIN  is selected (which is the location to which you will receive the                     items in the  WHOLESALE  warehouse). On the form toolbar, click  Release . The system releases                     the receipt and adds the item quantity from the receipt to the on-hand quantity                     of the  APPLES  item in the  WHOLESALE  warehouse (which you will                     verify in the next step). Step 5: Reviewing Availability of Items in the Destination Warehouse To make sure that the moved quantity of apples is now available in the Wholesale                 warehouse, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) Inventory Allocation Details (IN402000) form. In the  Inventory ID  box of the Summary area, select                          APPLES . In the  Warehouse  box, select  WHOLESALE . Make sure that the value of the  On Hand  box has increased                     by 20. In the  Warehouse  box, clear the selected warehouse. Notice that, in the table on the  Item Plans  tab, the row                     with the  In-Transit  allocation type is not displayed any more. This means                     that the transfer that included the  APPLES  item has been released. You have successfully transferred apples from the Retail to the Wholesale                 warehouse. ]]></column>

An important part of the configuration of the Inventory module is to specify the posting settings—that is, the General Ledger accounts and subaccounts for inventory entities (such as stock items) and the rules determining how the system will select an account in specific transactions. In Acumatica ERP, you can create posting classes and reason codes that provide the default General Ledger accounts and subaccounts, or you can use warehouse- or item-specific accounts and subaccounts. In this topic, you will find information about the types of accounts used in the Inventory module, the system entities for which you can define accounts and subaccounts, and the posting settings.{br}{TOC}
==Configuration of Posting Settings==
Before you start configuring the Inventory module, you must create all necessary General Ledger accounts and subaccounts that the system will use for inventory transactions. For the description of the accounts and subaccounts used in inventory, see [[#section_bgv_c1j_jhb|General Ledger Accounts in Inventory].{br}

During the configuration of the Inventory module, you specify the following posting settings:[anchor|#_a955560f-9e2d-48f0-bed9-ad4918177d48]
*Reason codes: Reason codes are used with manually entered inventory transactions to track the reasons for these transactions. Reason codes provide offset accounts (with offset subaccounts if they are used in your system) to be used to post the transactions to General Ledger. For details, see [[#_012fc657-1b5b-4f2b-9d51-aa8a0c199ee4|Reason Codes].
*Posting classes: Posting classes are used to provide default General Ledger accounts and subaccounts for inventory items. For details, see [[#_6fb00522-8970-4d8f-b296-13f2039bafa8|Posting Classes].
*Integration settings between General Ledger and Inventory: The settings used to configure the level of integration between the Inventory and General Ledger modules. For details, see [[#_e4d70d48-be97-4c5d-a1d5-79dd9a9054e7|Inventory–General Ledger Integration Settings].

We recommend that you thoroughly plan inventory accounts during the initial configuration of the Inventory module. But in rare situations you may need to change the accounts after users have started processing inventory documents. For more information, see [[#_f8432eca-f9bd-44a4-a381-4c2f736aa305|Change of an Inventory Account for an Item].[anchor|#section_bgv_c1j_jhb]
==General Ledger Accounts Used by Inventory Entities==
You can specify GL accounts in the settings of the following inventory entities: warehouses (if you use multiple warehouses in the system), posting classes (which can be specified for stock and non-stock items), stock items, and non-stock items. The specified GL accounts are used by the system to record inventory transactions that involve the respective entities. You specify the following GL accounts in the settings of inventory entities:[anchor|#_78c0e217-4371-47d2-89b5-1a00470a9f5a]
*Inventory/Accrual account (specified in the settings of a stock item, warehouse, non-stock item, or posting class for non-stock items): An account that is one of the following:
**If specified for a stock item or warehouse: An asset account to keep the inventory balance resulting from transactions with the stock item or transactions that involve the specific warehouse. The cost of the applicable items will be debited to the Inventory account when the items are received, and credited when the items are issued from inventory.
**If specified for a non-stock item or a posting class to be used for non-stock items: A liability account to be used for non-stock items as the Accrual account. The cost of purchased non-stock items will be credited to this account, and when an AP bill is created for any of these purchased non-stock items, the cost will be debited to this account.
*Sales account (specified for each warehouse, stock item, non-stock item, and posting class): The income account to record sales for the entity.
*:((({S:Warn}A sales account can also be specified in settings of an order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. In a sales order of a type with a sales account specified, this sales account has a higher priority than the setting specified in the item settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form.
)))
*COGS/Expense account (specified for each warehouse, stock item, non-stock item, and posting class): An account that is one of the following:
**If specified for a warehouse, stock item, or posting class for stock items: The expense account used as the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) account. This account will accrue the cost of goods sold once a sales order that includes the applicable item or warehouse is released. The cost of items sold is debited to the account when items are issued for sale from inventory.
**If specified for a non-stock item or for a posting class to be used for non-stock items or labor items: The Expense account used for transactions with these items.
*Standard Cost Variance account (specified for each warehouse, stock item, and posting class for stock items): The expense account to be used to record any differences between the currently effective standard cost and the cost on a bill for the specified quantities of items. 
*:This account is used only for transactions associated with stock items to which the ''Standard'' valuation method is assigned.
*Standard Cost Revaluation account (specified for each warehouse, stock item, and posting class for stock items): The expense account to be used to record the differences in inventory value estimated by using the pending standard cost and the currently effective standard cost for the quantities on hand of a stock item. Revaluation is performed at the moment when standard costs are updated—that is, when the currently effective standard cost becomes the last standard cost, and the pending cost becomes the effective standard cost.
*:This account is used only for transactions associated with stock items to which the ''Standard'' valuation method is assigned.
*PO Accrual account (specified for each warehouse, stock item, and posting class): The liability account to be used to accrue amounts on purchase orders related to the warehouse or stock item for which the account is specified. Whenever receipts linked to purchase orders are released, the system generates transactions between the PO Accrual account and the inventory account.
*Purchase Price Variance account (specified for each warehouse, stock item, non-stock item, and posting class for stock or non-stock items): The expense account to be used to record any differences between the extended price on the purchase receipt and the extended price on the AP bill. 
*:This account is used for transactions that involve inventory items for which any of the valuation methods is assigned.
*Landed Cost Variance account (specified for each warehouse, stock item, and posting class for stock items): The expense account to be used to record any differences in landed costs between the landed cost amounts specified on purchase receipts and the landed cost amounts on inventory receipts.
*Deferral account (specified for each stock item, non-stock item, and posting class): The account to be used to hold the deferred amount until it is fully recognized. You select an account of one of the following types: 
**A liability account for a deferral code of the ''Revenue'' type
**An asset account for a deferral code of the ''Expense'' type
[anchor|#_012fc657-1b5b-4f2b-9d51-aa8a0c199ee4]
==Reason Codes==
If inventory transactions are generated from the Purchase Orders or Sales Orders module, the system will use the PO Accrual account (for purchase receipts) or the COGS account (for sales orders). The offset account and subaccount for a receipt, issue, adjustment, or transfer are determined by the document&rsquo;s reason code, which is selected depending on the specific transaction being performed. For different types of inventory transactions, different types of offset accounts should be selected. Reason codes also can be used to gather statistics about specific inventory transactions.{br}

You define reason codes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_21_10_00|Reason Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS211000|CS211000]) form. Each reason code is associated with the type of inventory transaction for which it will be used. For each type of inventory transaction, you can create multiple reason codes, if necessary, to further categorize transactions within their types. By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form, you can define the reason codes used most frequently with each type of transaction as the default reason code for this type of transactions.{br}

For more information on using reason codes, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Reason_Codes_GeneralInfo|Reason Codes: General Information].[anchor|#_6fb00522-8970-4d8f-b296-13f2039bafa8]
==Posting Classes==
In Acumatica ERP, you can use posting classes to provide the default accounts and subaccounts for items of the class; in this case, the accounts specified in the posting class are used for assigning the default General Ledger accounts for items. You create posting classes for stock and non-stock items by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) form.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form, you can assign a posting class to an item class; the system will use this posting class as the default posting class for inventory items of this item class. If needed, you can assign a specific posting class (instead of the default one) to a particular stock item by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, and to a particular non-stock item by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. For more information on managing item classes, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Item_Classes_GeneralInfo|Item Classes for Stock Items: General Information].{br}

A posting class defines the rules for selecting General Ledger accounts and subaccounts to be used for transactions with items assigned to the posting class. When a transaction with an inventory item is created, multiple similar accounts are involved. For example, when a stock item is received at a particular warehouse, its cost (a debit amount) can be recorded to either the inventory account associated with the warehouse or the inventory account associated with the inventory item. Subaccounts for various types of transactions can be combined from multiple involved subaccounts, depending on the policies established in your organization. You can select General Ledger accounts and subaccount segment values from the following sources:[anchor|#_ecb0992b-8938-4e9d-b6d4-fe28e506955a]
*Inventory item
*Warehouse
*Posting class

The posting class also provides the account and subaccount to be used if the source of General Ledger accounts for a transaction is a posting class itself.{br}

For more details about using posting classes, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Posting_Classes_GeneralInfo|Posting Classes: General Information].[anchor|#_e4d70d48-be97-4c5d-a1d5-79dd9a9054e7]
==Inventory–General Ledger Integration Settings==
The settings used to configure the integration between the Inventory and General Ledger modules are located on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form. The following check boxes are available: [anchor|#_329ae256-431a-4bc3-8dc4-a9fd85958fac]
*'''Update GL''': If this check box is selected, transactions originating in the Inventory module will update the General Ledger module. If this check box is cleared, inventory transactions do not update the General Ledger module, and the inventory can be maintained independently from the General Ledger module.
*'''Post Summary on Updating GL''': If this check box is selected, the system will include in the batch only summary information (for the account–subaccount pair). If this check box is cleared, the detailed information for each document line will be included in the batch generated for the document.

==Change of an Inventory Account for an Item==
We recommend that you carefully plan inventory accounts and avoid changing the inventory account for an item after you have started processing transactions with the item. ((({S:Warn}If you change the posting class for an item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, the General Ledger accounts are repopulated in the item from the new posting class, which may affect the inventory account that is used for transaction processing with the item if the source of the inventory account is set to ''Inventory Item'' for the posting class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) form.
)))
If you decide to define a specific inventory account for some item-warehouse combinations, we also recommend that you do this during initial configuration.{br}

If you need to change the inventory account for an item after you have started processing transactions, the following will happen to inventory transactions after you change the inventory account in an item&rsquo;s settings:[anchor|#_b1bf217a-66f8-4ab2-b747-4da71633ad77]
*Inventory receipts, as well as other transactions that increase inventory, will start to process to the new inventory account retrieved from settings.
*Inventory issues will continue to clear the old inventory account until its balance is zero.
*Inventory adjustments will be processed to the new inventory account retrieved from settings.

If you want to transfer the item&rsquo;s balance to the new inventory account, we recommend that you do the following:[anchor|#_0739da8f-7689-4521-94ee-4d6ef8f68a9d]
#You create a temporary clearing asset account in the General Ledger module.
#You create an issue reason code for the old inventory account and a receipt reason code for the new inventory account.
#Keeping the old inventory account in the item settings, you clear the item balance from the old inventory account by doing the following: issue all quantity and cost of the item with the issue reason code that you have defined earlier to clear the balance of the old inventory account, and record the balance to the temporary account.
#You specify the new inventory account in the settings of the item.
#You process a receipt with the item quantity you issued earlier (and at the previously specified cost) with the receipt reason code that you have defined earlier. When you do, the balance is recorded back to the new inventory account and the balance of the temporary account is cleared.
#You make sure the temporary account balance is zero, and deactivate the account on the chart of accounts.

After you have performed these steps, the balance is transferred to the new inventory account, and the item is ready for processing additional inventory transactions.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Posting Settings in the Inventory Module An important part of the configuration of the Inventory module is to specify the posting     settings—that is, the General Ledger accounts and subaccounts for inventory entities (such     as stock items) and the rules determining how the system will select an account in specific     transactions. In  Acumatica ERP,     you can create posting classes and reason codes that provide the default General Ledger accounts     and subaccounts, or you can use warehouse- or item-specific accounts and subaccounts. In this     topic, you will find information about the types of accounts used in the Inventory module, the     system entities for which you can define accounts and subaccounts, and the posting settings. Configuration of Posting Settings Before you start configuring the Inventory module, you must create all necessary General     Ledger accounts and subaccounts that the system will use for inventory transactions. For the     description of the accounts and subaccounts used in inventory, see  General Ledger      Accounts in Inventory General Ledger Accounts in Inventory. During the configuration of the Inventory module, you specify the following posting     settings: Reason codes: Reason codes are used with manually entered inventory transactions to track      the reasons for these transactions. Reason codes provide offset accounts (with offset      subaccounts if they are used in your system) to be used to post the transactions to General      Ledger. For details, see  Reason Codes Reason Codes. Posting classes: Posting classes are used to provide default General Ledger accounts and      subaccounts for inventory items. For details, see  Posting Classes Posting Classes. Integration settings between General Ledger and Inventory: The settings used to configure      the level of integration between the Inventory and General Ledger modules. For details, see        Inventory–General Ledger Integration Settings Inventory–General Ledger Integration Settings. We recommend that you thoroughly plan inventory accounts during the initial configuration of     the Inventory module. But in rare situations you may need to change the accounts after users     have started processing inventory documents. For more information, see  Change of an Inventory Account for an Item Change of an Inventory Account for an Item. General Ledger Accounts Used by Inventory Entities You can specify GL accounts in the settings of the following inventory entities:                 warehouses (if you use multiple warehouses in the system), posting classes (which                 can be specified for stock and non-stock items), stock items, and non-stock items.                 The specified GL accounts are used by the system to record inventory transactions                 that involve the respective entities. You specify the following GL accounts in the                 settings of inventory entities: Inventory/Accrual account (specified in the settings of a stock item, warehouse,                     non-stock item, or posting class for non-stock items): An account that is one of                     the following: If specified for a stock item or warehouse: An asset account to keep the                             inventory balance resulting from transactions with the stock item or                             transactions that involve the specific warehouse. The cost of the                             applicable items will be debited to the Inventory account when the items                             are received, and credited when the items are issued from                             inventory. If specified for a non-stock item or a posting class to be used for                             non-stock items: A liability account to be used for non-stock items as                             the Accrual account. The cost of purchased non-stock items will be                             credited to this account, and when an AP bill is created for any of                             these purchased non-stock items, the cost will be debited to this                             account. Sales account (specified for each warehouse, stock item, non-stock item, and                     posting class): The income account to record sales for the entity. A sales                         account can also be specified in settings of an order type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form. In a sales order                         of a type with a sales account specified, this sales account has a higher                         priority than the setting specified in the item settings on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form. COGS/Expense account (specified for each warehouse, stock item, non-stock item,                     and posting class): An account that is one of the following: If specified for a warehouse, stock item, or posting class for stock                             items: The expense account used as the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)                             account. This account will accrue the cost of goods sold once a sales                             order that includes the applicable item or warehouse is released. The                             cost of items sold is debited to the account when items are issued for                             sale from inventory. If specified for a non-stock item or for a posting class to be used for                             non-stock items or labor items: The Expense account used for                             transactions with these items. Standard Cost Variance account (specified for each warehouse, stock item, and                     posting class for stock items): The expense account to be used to record any                     differences between the currently effective standard cost and the cost on a bill                     for the specified quantities of items.  This account is used only for                         transactions associated with stock items to which the  Standard                          valuation method is assigned. Standard Cost Revaluation account (specified for each warehouse, stock item, and                     posting class for stock items): The expense account to be used to record the                     differences in inventory value estimated by using the pending standard cost and                     the currently effective standard cost for the quantities on hand of a stock                     item. Revaluation is performed at the moment when standard costs are                     updated—that is, when the currently effective standard cost becomes the last                     standard cost, and the pending cost becomes the effective standard cost. This                         account is used only for transactions associated with stock items to which                         the  Standard  valuation method is assigned. PO Accrual account (specified for each warehouse, stock item, and posting                     class): The liability account to be used to accrue amounts on purchase orders                     related to the warehouse or stock item for which the account is specified.                     Whenever receipts linked to purchase orders are released, the system generates                     transactions between the PO Accrual account and the inventory account. Purchase Price Variance account (specified for each warehouse, stock item,                     non-stock item, and posting class for stock or non-stock items): The expense                     account to be used to record any differences between the extended price on the                     purchase receipt and the extended price on the AP bill.  This account is used                         for transactions that involve inventory items for which any of the valuation                         methods is assigned. Landed Cost Variance account (specified for each warehouse, stock item, and                     posting class for stock items): The expense account to be used to record any                     differences in landed costs between the landed cost amounts specified on                     purchase receipts and the landed cost amounts on inventory receipts. Deferral account (specified for each stock item, non-stock item, and posting                     class): The account to be used to hold the deferred amount until it is fully                     recognized. You select an account of one of the following types:  A liability account for a deferral code of the  Revenue  type An asset account for a deferral code of the  Expense  type Reason Codes If inventory transactions are generated from the Purchase Orders or Sales Orders module, the     system will use the PO Accrual account (for purchase receipts) or the COGS account (for sales     orders). The offset account and subaccount for a receipt, issue, adjustment, or transfer are     determined by the document's reason code, which is selected depending on the specific     transaction being performed. For different types of inventory transactions, different types of     offset accounts should be selected. Reason codes also can be used to gather statistics about     specific inventory transactions. You define reason codes on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS211000|CS211000]) Reason Codes (CS211000) form.     Each reason code is associated with the type of inventory transaction for which it will be used.     For each type of inventory transaction, you can create multiple reason codes, if necessary, to     further categorize transactions within their types. By using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences     (IN101000) form, you can define the reason codes used most frequently with each type of     transaction as the default reason code for this type of transactions. For more information on using reason codes, see  Reason Codes: General Information. Posting Classes In  Acumatica ERP,     you can use posting classes to provide the default accounts and subaccounts for items of the     class; in this case, the accounts specified in the posting class are used for assigning the     default General Ledger accounts for items. You create posting classes for stock and non-stock     items by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) Posting Classes (IN206000) form. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000) form, you can assign a posting class to an     item class; the system will use this posting class as the default posting class for inventory     items of this item class. If needed, you can assign a specific posting class (instead of the     default one) to a particular stock item by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form, and to a particular non-stock item by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form. For more information on managing item     classes, see  Item Classes for Stock Items: General Information. A posting class defines the rules for selecting General Ledger accounts and subaccounts to be     used for transactions with items assigned to the posting class. When a transaction with an     inventory item is created, multiple similar accounts are involved. For example, when a stock     item is received at a particular warehouse, its cost (a debit amount) can be recorded to either     the inventory account associated with the warehouse or the inventory account associated with the     inventory item. Subaccounts for various types of transactions can be combined from multiple     involved subaccounts, depending on the policies established in your organization. You can select     General Ledger accounts and subaccount segment values from the following sources: Inventory item Warehouse Posting class The posting class also provides the account and subaccount to be used if the source of General     Ledger accounts for a transaction is a posting class itself. For more details about using posting classes, see  Posting Classes: General Information. Inventory–General Ledger Integration Settings The settings used to configure the integration between the Inventory and General Ledger     modules are located on the  General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000) form. The following check boxes are     available:  Update GL : If this check box is selected, transactions originating in      the Inventory module will update the General Ledger module. If this check box is cleared,      inventory transactions do not update the General Ledger module, and the inventory can be      maintained independently from the General Ledger module. Post Summary on Updating GL : If this check box is selected, the      system will include in the batch only summary information (for the account–subaccount      pair). If this check box is cleared, the detailed information for each document line will be      included in the batch generated for the document. Automatically Post on Release : If this check box is cleared,      inventory transactions will not be automatically posted to the General Ledger module on release      of nventory documents; the inventory transactions should be posted through the General Ledger      module. If this check box is selected, inventory transactions will be posted on the release of      inventory documents. Change of an Inventory Account for an Item We recommend that you carefully plan inventory accounts and avoid changing the inventory     account for an item after you have started processing transactions with the item.  If you change the posting class for an item on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items     (IN202500) form, the General Ledger accounts are repopulated in the item from the new posting     class, which may affect the inventory account that is used for transaction processing with the     item if the source of the inventory account is set to  Inventory Item  for the posting     class on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) Posting Classes (IN206000) form. If you decide to define a specific inventory account for some item-warehouse combinations, we     also recommend that you do this during initial configuration. If you need to change the inventory account for an item after you have started processing     transactions, the following will happen to inventory transactions after you change the inventory     account in an item's settings: Inventory receipts, as well as other transactions that increase inventory, will start to      process to the new inventory account retrieved from settings. Inventory issues will continue to clear the old inventory account until its balance is      zero. Inventory adjustments will be processed to the new inventory account retrieved from      settings. If you want to transfer the item's balance to the new inventory account, we recommend that you     do the following: You create a temporary clearing asset account in the General Ledger module. You create an issue reason code for the old inventory account and a receipt reason code for      the new inventory account. Keeping the old inventory account in the item settings, you clear the item balance from the      old inventory account by doing the following: issue all quantity and cost of the item with the      issue reason code that you have defined earlier to clear the balance of the old inventory      account, and record the balance to the temporary account. You specify the new inventory account in the settings of the item. You process a receipt with the item quantity you issued earlier (and at the previously      specified cost) with the receipt reason code that you have defined earlier. When you do, the      balance is recorded back to the new inventory account and the balance of the temporary account      is cleared. You make sure the temporary account balance is zero, and deactivate the account on the chart      of accounts. After you have performed these steps, the balance is transferred to the new inventory account,     and the item is ready for processing additional inventory transactions.

When a carrier is used to deliver products from your organization to a customer, the carrier can charge your company specific freight amounts that depend on the weights or volumes of the packages in shipments. The carrier may also set restrictions on the weight or volume of packages. Landed costs incurred for shipments delivered from vendors to your company can be calculated by the weight or volume of the items in the shipment.{br}

In Acumatica ERP, you can select the base units of measure (UOMs) for weight and volume and set up the automatic calculation of weights and volumes for sales and purchase orders. In this topic, you will read about weight and volume UOMs.{br}{TOC}
==The Base Weight and Volume UOMs==
You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) form to specify the base UOMs for weight and volume.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) form, you should first create a unit of measure (UOM) to be used in your system as the base UOM for weight. The weights of all sales and purchase orders will be calculated in this UOM. However, if the items differ in weight significantly, you can create other UOMs for measuring the weights of the base units of stock and non-stock items. For each additional weight UOM, you must specify the rules for converting this UOM to the base weight UOM. {br}

For example, suppose that you need to create weight UOMs for a gram (''GRAM'') and pound (''LB'') and define conversion rules to convert the weights measured in pounds to weights measured in grams and to convert the weights measured in grams to weights measured in pounds. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] form, you would do the following:[anchor|#_a5ab2ac2-b52c-47ce-9003-5f196a10952f]
#Create the <tt>GRAM</tt> UOM for grams.
#Create the <tt>LB</tt> UOM for pounds.
#Create a conversion rule from grams to pounds with the ''Multiply'' conversion type and <tt>453.5923</tt> conversion factor
#Create a conversion rules from pounds to grams with the ''Multiply'' conversion type and <tt>0.0022046</tt> conversion factor
#:((({S:Warn}Here you specify the conversion factor as 0.0022046 with 7 decimal places. This value shows how many pounds one gram contains. In your system, the decimal precision is defined in the '''Quantity Decimal Places''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) form. Make sure that the selected decimal precision does not cut off any meaningful digits. For instance, if you set the number of decimal places for quantities to 2, this would result in incorrect conversions from grams to pounds.
)))

For an activity that describes how to create UOMs and conversion rules, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\UOMs_Implem_Activity|Units of Measure: Implementation Activity].{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] form, you should define a UOM that will be used in your system to measure the volume of specific quantities of the items listed on sales and purchase orders. You should also define all other UOMs that may be used to measure the volumes that the base units of various items can take and specify the conversion factors with respect to the base volume UOM.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form, select the base weight UOM in the '''Weight UOM''' box and select the base volume UOM in the '''Volume UOM''' box.
==Weight and Volume of Stock Items==
For each stock item, you can specify the weight and the volume (measured in a specific volume UOM) of its base unit on the '''Packaging''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. For non-stock items, you can specify these values (if applicable) by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form.{br}

For the item-specific weight and volume UOMs, you must specify rules for conversion to the appropriate base UOMs either on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form or on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) form.{br}

If the ''Multiple Units of Measure'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, make sure that rules for converting each sales and purchase unit to the base UOM selected for the item are defined in the system. Also, if the '''Use a Price Adjustment Multiplier''' check box is selected on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form, you can specify a price adjustment multiplier for the item. For more information on adjusting prices, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\UOMs_GeneralInfo|Units of Measure: General Information].
==Weight and Volume Calculation for Purchase Receipts==
The system can calculate the weight and volume of the received quantities of stock and non-stock items for each purchase receipt.{br}

The landed cost specified for each purchase receipt can be split among the items listed in the receipt in proportion to the item weights or volumes (among other options). For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_Landed_Cost_Tracking|Processing Landed Cost Documents].

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Units of Weight and Volume When a carrier is used to deliver products from your organization to a customer, the carrier         can charge your company specific freight amounts that depend on the weights or volumes of         the packages in shipments. The carrier may also set restrictions on the weight or volume of         packages. Landed costs incurred for shipments delivered from vendors to your company can be         calculated by the weight or volume of the items in the shipment. In  Acumatica ERP,     you can select the base units of measure (UOMs) for weight and volume and set up the automatic     calculation of weights and volumes for sales and purchase orders. In this topic, you will read     about weight and volume UOMs. The Base Weight and Volume UOMs You use the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) Companies (CS101500) form to specify the base UOMs for         weight and volume. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) Units of Measure (CS203100) form, you should first create a unit of         measure (UOM) to be used in your system as the base UOM for weight. The weights of all sales         and purchase orders will be calculated in this UOM. However, if the items differ in weight         significantly, you can create other UOMs for measuring the weights of the base units of         stock and non-stock items. For each additional weight UOM, you must specify the rules for         converting this UOM to the base weight UOM.  For example, suppose that you need to create weight UOMs for a gram ( GRAM ) and pound           ( LB ) and define conversion rules to convert the weights measured in pounds to         weights measured in grams and to convert the weights measured in grams to weights measured         in pounds. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) Units of Measure form, you would do the following: Create the  GRAM  UOM for grams. Create the  LB  UOM for pounds. Create a conversion rule from grams to pounds with the  Multiply  conversion type           and  453.5923  conversion factor Create a conversion rules from pounds to grams with the  Multiply  conversion type           and  0.0022046  conversion factor Here you specify the             conversion factor as 0.0022046 with 7 decimal places. This value shows how many pounds             one gram contains. In your system, the decimal precision is defined in the                Quantity Decimal Places  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) Companies (CS101500) form. Make sure that the selected decimal             precision does not cut off any meaningful digits. For instance, if you set the number of             decimal places for quantities to 2, this would result in incorrect conversions from             grams to pounds. For an activity that describes how to create UOMs and conversion rules, see  Units of Measure: Implementation Activity. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) Units of Measure form, you should define a UOM that will be used in         your system to measure the volume of specific quantities of the items listed on sales and         purchase orders. You should also define all other UOMs that may be used to measure the         volumes that the base units of various items can take and specify the conversion factors         with respect to the base volume UOM. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000) form, select the base weight UOM in the            Weight UOM  box and select the base volume UOM in the            Volume UOM  box. Weight and Volume of Stock Items For each stock item, you can specify the weight and the volume (measured in a specific volume         UOM) of its base unit on the  Packaging  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form. For non-stock items, you can specify these         values (if applicable) by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form. For the item-specific weight and volume UOMs, you must specify rules for conversion to the         appropriate base UOMs either on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form or on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) Units of Measure (CS203100) form. If the  Multiple Units of Measure  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS101000) form, make sure that rules for converting each sales         and purchase unit to the base UOM selected for the item are defined in the system. Also, if         the  Use a Price Adjustment Multiplier  check box is selected on the            General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences         (SO101000) form, you can specify a price adjustment multiplier for the item. For more         information on adjusting prices, see  Units of Measure: General Information. Weight and Volume Calculation for Purchase Receipts The system can calculate the weight and volume of the received quantities of stock and     non-stock items for each purchase receipt. The landed cost specified for each purchase receipt can be split among the items listed in the         receipt in proportion to the item weights or volumes (among other options). For more         information, see  Processing Landed Cost Documents.  ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) ]]></column>

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
Many businesses consider inventory to be an important asset. Inventory includes ''stock items'': the finished goods and raw materials that cost money, have value, and are stored. Along with stock items, businesses may sell ''non-stock items'': usually non-physical goods, such as services and warranties, that are not stocked. Stock and non-stock items, which are processed differently in Acumatica ERP, are both referred to as ''inventory items''.{br}

For each inventory item, you create a record in the database that provides information about the type of the item, its identifier, its description, the General Ledger accounts allocated for the item, its price and cost information, the various units of measure (UOMs) that apply to it, and the conversions between UOMs. The records for stock items contain additional information required to track the items in the system.{br}

This topic highlights general information about inventory items, the major differences between stock and non-stock items, and the processing of inventory items in Acumatica ERP.{br}{TOC}[anchor|#_38038e84-0869-4440-b1d5-5f91ce3f2719]
==Inventory IDs==
Each inventory item is tracked in the system by its inventory ID. This unique identifier can be just a number, or you can configure it to provide basic information about the item type, brand, or use. Inventory IDs can be designed to help you sort and group items for reports. {br}

As with other identifiers in Acumatica ERP, inventory IDs can be configured on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form. Identifiers for stock and non-stock items are configured by using the same segmented key: ''INVENTORY''. For the key, you can define how many segments it will have, what values may be used, whether they should be validated, and whether auto-numbering should be used for generating inventory IDs. To have inventory IDs automatically generated on creating new inventory items, you can configure the ''INVENTORY'' segmented key as having a single segment with the '''Auto-Number''' option selected for this segment and a numbering sequence specified in the '''Numbering ID''' box. {br}

If users will enter inventory IDs manually, you can configure the ''INVENTORY'' key as having a single segment with non-validated values. If the type of items should be indicated by their IDs, consider configuring the ''INVENTORY'' key with two segments and creating a list of predefined values for one of the segments. For details on segmented keys, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Identifier_Segmentation|Segmented Identifiers].{br}

When configuring the ''INVENTORY'' segmented key, decide whether you will use alternate IDs for stock and non-stock items. If you enter alternate IDs (item identifiers used by the vendors and customer of the items), users will be able to specify items by typing their alternate IDs as well as inventory IDs in the '''Inventory ID''' boxes on sales and purchase orders without the system generating errors. For more information on using alternate IDs and on how to configure the ''INVENTORY'' segmented key in this case, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Item_Cross-References|Item Cross-References].{br}

If required, you can change the inventory ID for any non-stock or stock item manually by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Change ID''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, respectively, and by specifying the new inventory ID in the dialog box that opens.{br}

Your company might want to use ''subitems'' to further categorize otherwise-identical stock items with properties such as colors or sizes that are important to customers. Thus, under the same inventory ID, you may have a number of subitems—products that share all the settings of the inventory item&rsquo;s record but have additional properties that differ. If your company has decided to use subitems, all stock items will be identified by a combination of inventory ID and subitem code. For more details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Inventory_IDs_and_Subitem_Codes|Inventory Subitems].
==Stock Items==
If the ''Inventory'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can create stock items on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. Stock items are usually physical goods that you purchase or manufacture and sell to your customers. Examples of stock items include computers, cell phones, cables, and auto parts. Stock items may have lot or serial numbers that you can use to track the items in your system.{br}

You can create a stock item of any of the following types: ''Finished Good'', ''Component Part'', or ''Subassembly''. The type of a stock item is intended for informational purposes and does not affect processing.{br}

The system automatically tracks stock items and maintains availability data. You can track stock items by their cost value.{br}

For more information on stock items, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Stock_Items_GeneralInfo|Stock Items: General Information].
==Non-Stock Items==
Non-stock items are typically non-physical goods (such as labor, services, or warranties), or items with very low values that might be hard to track. Examples might include labor and repair charges, warranties, and small repair or installation parts.{br}

You enter each non-stock item on the (IN202000) form and specify one of the following types: ''Non-Stock Item'', ''Labor'', ''Service'', ''Charge'', or ''Expense''.{br}

Available quantities of non-stock items are not tracked by the system; they are treated as if they are available in any quantity at any time. A line on a sales order that features a non-stock item cannot be back ordered.{br}

For more information on non-stock items, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Non-Stock_Item_Support|Non-Stock Items in Sales and Purchases]. 
==Posting Classes for Item Classes and Inventory Items==
Posting classes facilitate specifying General Ledger accounts for multiple new inventory items assigned to specific item classes. Each item class has a posting class assigned. When a user creates a new stock item by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, the item is assigned to an item class and, hence, to a specific posting class. If necessary, the user can select another posting class for the item.{br}

Once the posting class is selected, the General Ledger accounts and subaccounts for the item on the '''GL Accounts''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form will be filled in based on the accounts and subaccounts specified on the '''GL Accounts''' tab of the posting class (the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] form). When you create new non-stock items by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, posting classes are also used to provide the default accounts and subaccounts for these items.{br}

For more information about posting classes, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Posting_Classes_GeneralInfo|Posting Classes: General Information].

Non-stock items, which are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, may be “products” that are not physical entities and thus cannot be stocked in warehouses. Many organizations sell items that can’t be found on their shelves, such as product warranties, or services such as product assembly, installation, or customization.{br}

Whereas some items are obviously non-stock, such as labor rates and services, other items that are physical entities (such as gift-wrapping) can be either stock or non-stock. The decision about whether to consider physical entities stock or non-stock depends on the company&rsquo;s inventory policies and other conditions.{br}

In the system, non-stock items are handled differently from stock items that are kept in warehouses (and tracked accordingly). For stock items, the system maintains all cost, quantity, sales, and cost-of-goods-sold information. Because non-stock items do not require the tracking of quantities, the system maintains only standard costs and base price information for them.((({S:Warn}If the ''Inventory and Order Management'' group of features is not included in your Acumatica ERP license, you will be able to create non-stock items and use them in the Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable documents. However, you will not be able to define posting classes for them or to update their prices and costs in bulk. 
If the ''Inventory and Order Management'' group of features is enabled but the ''Inventory'' feature is not enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can still use non-stock items in sales orders, purchase orders, and purchase requisitions with some limitations. (Some elements you use for non-stock items, such as the '''Require Receipt''' and '''Require Shipment''' boxes, are unavailable. For more information about settings that depend on this feature, see the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form reference.)
))){br}{TOC}
==Types of Non-Stock Items==
 Acumatica ERP supports the following types of non-stock items, one of which can be selected in the '''Type''' box of the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form: 
*''Non-Stock Item'': A general type of a non-stock item. You can use it for any unspecific type of non-physical items or for physical items that you don&rsquo;t need to register in inventory.
*''Labor'' or ''Labor Item'': A non-stock item mostly used as a source of General Ledger accounts for recording sales of labor.
*''Service'': A non-stock item to designate service fees.
*''Charge'': A non-stock item that represents charges of a specific type.
*''Expense'': A non-stock item that represents expenses of a specific type.

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form, you can create item classes for non-stock items to provide default settings for each type of non-stock item used in your business. With these classes defined, users can specify an item class when they use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form to define a new non-stock item, and the system fills in common values, thus saving time and increasing accuracy.
==Settings for Non-Stock Items==
Information about non-stock items and their properties is maintained on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. The list below describes some of the settings you can provide for a non-stock item by using this form: 
*Inventory ID: Every non-stock item is assigned an unique identifier based on the ''INVENTORY'' segmented key. For details on the ways the identifier can be configured, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Inventory_Items|Inventory Items]. For material non-stock items, you can specify a default warehouse and specify whether the items require shipping and receipts on purchase. 
*:((({S:Hint}If subitems are used in your system, they do not apply to non-stock items. 
)))
*Units of measure and conversion rules: For each non-stock item, you can select the units of measure (UOMs) used as base, sales, and purchase units for the item and specify conversion rules for them and for other UOMs used for the item. You can select global UOMs or enter new UOMs on the fly. Every conversion rule is specified with respect to the UOM selected as the item&rsquo;s base unit. For details, see [[#_66f9e91b-830c-410d-94a1-6058161d6d46|UOMs for Non-Stock Items].
*Packaging options: If the non-stock item requires shipping, specify the weight of the base unit and the UOM used to measure the weight.
*General Ledger accounts and subaccounts (if subaccounts are applicable in your system): Purchases and sales of non-stock items do not affect companies&rsquo; assets, so the General Ledger accounts and subaccounts used for non-stock items are limited to sales accounts, expense accounts, and accounts required for posting transactions related to kit assembly if the item is a kit or a kit component. You can use subaccounts to detail records within each account. 
*:((({S:Warn}If a receipt is required for a non-stock item, a price variance account and a purchase accrual account must be specified to record purchases of this non-stock item. When the receipt is matched to the invoice, any price variance for the non-stock item is recorded to the specified price variance account.
)))
*Posting class: If the ''Inventory'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can create posting classes to provide default sales or expense accounts and subaccounts for non-stock items. If no posting class is specified for a non-stock item, the default expense subaccount is generated according to the rule specified in the '''Combine Expense Sub. From''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_10_10_00|Accounts Payable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AP101000|AP101000]) form and the default sales subaccount is specified in the '''Combine Sales Sub. From''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) form.
*Price information: For non-stock items of all types, you can specify price classes and assign prices that become effective on specific dates.
((({S:Warn}Only the standard cost valuation method applies to non-stock items.

If the ''Multiple Units of Measure'' feature is not enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can use one UOM for each non-stock item. This UOM is called the ''base UOM'', and the system uses it to track item quantities in the system and calculate item costs. The base UOM is a required setting for a stock item and is specified in the '''Units of Measure''' section of the '''General Settings''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form.{br}

If the ''Multiple Units of Measure'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form, you can add multiple UOMs that can be applied to the same non-stock item, and users can specify item quantities in these UOMs in sales and purchase documents. If your organization typically sells the item in a particular UOM, in the '''Units of Measure''' section on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, you can specify this UOM in the '''Sales Unit''' box, and the system will use this UOM by default on sales documents. If your organization typically purchases the item in a particular UOM, in the '''Units of Measure''' section on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form, you can specify this UOM in the '''Purchase Unit''' box, and the system will use this UOM by default on purchase documents.{br}

If sales or purchase UOMs differ from the base UOM, you have to specify conversion rules in the '''Units of Measure''' section on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form so that the system can recalculate the item quantities specified in sales and purchase documents to the base UOM.{br}

You can add specific prices for items measured in sales and purchase UOMs. For details, see [HelpRoot_PricesAndDiscounts\PriceDiscount_Reviewing_Sales_Prices_GeneralInfo|Sales Prices: General Information] and [HelpRoot_PricesAndDiscounts\PriceDiscount_Reviewing_Vendor_Prices_GeneralInfo|Vendor Prices: General Information].{br}

If the item can be sold or purchased in UOMs that are not base, sales, or purchase, you should make sure that these UOMs have been added to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) form and conversion rules between the base UOM and these UOMs have been added to this form before you use the item with these UOMs in transactions. For more information about conversion rules, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\UOMs_GeneralInfo|Units of Measure: General Information].{br}

You can configure units of measure (UOMs) for items that can be measured only in quantities that are integers as described in the next section.[anchor|#_c1b7c532-39a8-4f1c-a1d0-0bd5b1b71e58]
==Units of Measure That Are Not Divisible==
To specify that a UOM is not divisible, you clear the '''Divisible Unit''' check box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) for the non-stock item. If the ''Multiple Units of Measure'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can manage the value of this check box for base, sales, and purchase UOMs of the item separately.{br}

Users can add decimal quantities of the item to sales and purchase documents when the check box is selected for all three UOMs (if the ''Multiple Units of Measure'' feature is enabled) or for the base UOM (if the ''Multiple Units of Measure'' feature is disabled).{br}

For the base UOM, when the '''Divisible Unit''' check box is cleared on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form for the non-stock item, the system validates the quantities of this item in the following documents:[anchor|#_96fab066-6293-4ea1-bc90-0030c12d3b55]
*Shipments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form (if the '''Require Shipment''' box is selected on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form)
*SO invoices on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form 
*Purchase receipts on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form (if the '''Require Receipt''' box is selected on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form)

When the '''Divisible Unit''' check box is cleared for the sales UOM of the item, users can specify only integer quantities of the item in the sales UOM in sales documents (sales orders, shipments, and invoices). If the item can be sold in other UOMs, the system validates the quantity of each item converted to the sales UOM, making sure it is an integer.{br}

When the '''Divisible Unit''' check box is cleared for the purchase UOM of the item, users can specify only integer quantities of the item in the purchase UOM in purchase documents (purchase orders and receipts). If the item can be purchased in other UOMs, the system does not validate the quantity of the item converted to the purchase UOM to make sure it is an integer.
==Non-Stock Item Costs==
Non-stock items do not affect the company&rsquo;s inventory balance. However, to make it possible to enter the non-stock item cost and use it in the non-stock item price calculation, you can maintain standard costs for non-stock items.{br}

The standard costs are determined outside of the system, and the values should include some of the indirect and direct costs allocated. You can specify the standard cost for a non-stock item as a pending cost on the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. Along with the pending cost, you can specify a date when the cost will become effective. Standard costs are defined with respect to the base unit of the stock item. {br}

If you want to update standard costs for non-stock items, use the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form. You enter a pending cost and the date for the new cost and then click '''Actions &gt; Update Cost''' on the form toolbar. The system displays only the last cost and the current cost. The historical costs that were effective before the last cost are not stored in the database.{br}

If you want to make similar changes to many or all non-stock (and possibly stock) items, use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_20_00|Update Standard Costs] ([~/?ScreenId=IN502000|IN502000]) form. On this form, you can enter new costs and compare current and pending costs side by side for all items that you select. If you are satisfied with the changes, you can update the current standard costs with the pending standard costs for all items or only selected ones. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Item_Costs_and_Valuation_Methods|Item Costs and Valuation Methods].
==Accruing the Item Cost to the Expense Account==
If you want to accrue the cost of the non-stock item to the expense account, you can select the '''Accrue Cost''' check box for the non-stock item on the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, and specify which accrued amount the system will post. The accrued amount may be calculated based on the standard cost, markup percentage, or sale price percentage. For a non-stock item with the '''Accrue Cost''' check box selected, the system does the following:[anchor|#_cbfe98c7-80e5-4f1f-9ec4-afae4371ca70]
*When the non-stock item is added to a purchase receipt or an AP bill, on release of the document, the Expense Accrual account is debited in the corresponding GL transaction.
*When an SO invoice that includes the non-stock item is released, on release of the document, the Expense Accrual account is credited and the Expense account is debited in the corresponding GL transaction.
((({S:Warn}If a purchase return or sales return with a non-stock item is processed, the system generates a batch of transactions opposite to those mentioned in the list above.
)))
==Including Taxes in the Cost of Non-Stock Items==
You can configure the system to include use taxes, sales taxes of the ''Input'' group, and partially deductible VATs in the cost of non-stock items with the '''Require Receipt''' check box selected on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''Item Defaults''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. For tax amounts to be included in the costs of items in purchase orders, the following actions must be completed in the system:[anchor|#_ddb0a59a-4b7e-4638-bb69-615e81152c5a]
*A tax reason code of the ''Adjustment'' type must be defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_21_10_00|Reason Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS211000|CS211000]) form and specified as the '''Tax Reason Code''' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form.
*In the tax settings, the '''Use Tax Expense Account''' check box must be cleared on the '''GL Accounts''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\TX_20_50_00|Taxes] ([~/?ScreenId=TX205000|TX205000]) form.

The system calculates the taxes and accrues them in the '''COGS/Expense Account''' specified for the purchase receipt line on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form. On release of the AP bill related to the purchase receipt, the following GL transactions are generated and posted:[anchor|#_4c6bc25f-ba99-4b0c-b824-d23eb48eadac]
*Tax Reason Code account, Dr, Tax Amount
*PO Accrual account, Cr, Tax Amount

For more information about configuring taxes for inclusion in the item cost, see [HelpRoot_Financials\Taxes_Including_Tax_to_Item_Cost_GeneralInfo|Taxes Included in the Cost of Items: General Information].
==Prices for Non-Stock Items==
You can enter default prices for non-stock items individually by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form and update the prices at any time. Default prices have no expiration dates and cannot be specified as based on the items' quantities. For more information, see [HelpRoot_PricesAndDiscounts\PriceDiscount_Reviewing_Sales_Prices_GeneralInfo|Sales Prices: General Information] and [HelpRoot_PricesAndDiscounts\PriceDiscount_Reviewing_Vendor_Prices_GeneralInfo|Vendor Prices: General Information]

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Non-Stock Items in Sales and Purchases Non-stock items, which are defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) 				form, may be “products” that are not physical entities and thus cannot be stocked in 				warehouses. Many organizations sell items that can’t be found on their shelves, such 				as product warranties, or services such as product assembly, installation, or 				customization. Whereas some items are obviously non-stock, such as labor rates and services, other 				items that are physical entities (such as gift-wrapping) can be either stock or 				non-stock. The decision about whether to consider physical entities stock or 				non-stock depends on the company's inventory policies and other conditions. In the system, non-stock items are handled differently from stock items that are kept 				in warehouses (and tracked accordingly). For stock items, the system maintains all 				cost, quantity, sales, and cost-of-goods-sold information. Because non-stock items 				do not require the tracking of quantities, the system maintains only standard costs 				and base price information for them. If the  Inventory and Order Management  group of features is not included in 				your  Acumatica ERP license, you will be able to create non-stock items and use them in the Accounts 				Receivable and Accounts Payable documents. However, you will not be able to define 				posting classes for them or to update their prices and costs in bulk.  If the 						 Inventory and Order Management  group of features is enabled but the 						 Inventory  feature is not enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, you can still use non-stock items in sales orders, purchase 					orders, and purchase requisitions with some limitations. (Some elements you use 					for non-stock items, such as the  Require Receipt  and 						 Require Shipment  boxes, are unavailable. For more 					information about settings that depend on this feature, see the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form reference.) Types of Non-Stock Items  Acumatica ERP supports the following types of non-stock items, one of which can be selected in 				the  Type  box of the  General Settings  				tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form:  Non-Stock Item : A general type of a non-stock item. You can use it for 					any unspecific type of non-physical items or for physical items that you don't 					need to register in inventory. Labor  or  Labor Item : A non-stock item mostly used as a source of 					General Ledger accounts for recording sales of labor. Service : A non-stock item to designate service fees. Charge : A non-stock item that represents charges of a specific type. Expense : A non-stock item that represents expenses of a specific 					type. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000) form, you can create item classes 				for non-stock items to provide default settings for each type of non-stock item used 				in your business. With these classes defined, users can specify an item class when 				they use the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items form to define a new non-stock item, 				and the system fills in common values, thus saving time and increasing accuracy. Settings for Non-Stock Items Information about non-stock items and their properties is maintained on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form. The list below 				describes some of the settings you can provide for a non-stock item by using this 				form:  Inventory ID: Every non-stock item is assigned an unique identifier based on the 						 INVENTORY  segmented key. For details on the ways the identifier can 					be configured, see  Inventory Items. For material 					non-stock items, you can specify a default warehouse and specify whether the 					items require shipping and receipts on purchase.  If subitems 						are used in your system, they do not apply to non-stock items.  Units of measure and conversion rules: For each non-stock item, you can select 					the units of measure (UOMs) used as base, sales, and purchase units for the item 					and specify conversion rules for them and for other UOMs used for the item. You 					can select global UOMs or enter new UOMs on the fly. Every conversion rule is 					specified with respect to the UOM selected as the item's base unit. For details, 					see  UOMs 				for Non-Stock Items UOMs for Non-Stock Items. Packaging options: If the non-stock item requires shipping, specify the weight 					of the base unit and the UOM used to measure the weight. General Ledger accounts and subaccounts (if subaccounts are applicable in your 					system): Purchases and sales of non-stock items do not affect companies' assets, 					so the General Ledger accounts and subaccounts used for non-stock items are 					limited to sales accounts, expense accounts, and accounts required for posting 					transactions related to kit assembly if the item is a kit or a kit component. 					You can use subaccounts to detail records within each account.  If a 						receipt is required for a non-stock item, a price variance account and a 						purchase accrual account must be specified to record purchases of this 						non-stock item. When the receipt is matched to the invoice, any price 						variance for the non-stock item is recorded to the specified price variance 						account. Posting class: If the  Inventory  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, you can create posting classes to 					provide default sales or expense accounts and subaccounts for non-stock items. 					If no posting class is specified for a non-stock item, the default expense 					subaccount is generated according to the rule specified in the 						 Combine Expense Sub. From  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP101000|AP101000]) Accounts Payable Preferences (AP101000) form and the default sales subaccount 					is specified in the  Combine Sales Sub. From  box on the 						  ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) Accounts Receivable Preferences (AR101000) form. Price information: For non-stock items of all types, you can specify price 					classes and assign prices that become effective on specific dates. Only the standard cost valuation method applies to non-stock items. UOMs 				for Non-Stock Items If the  Multiple Units of Measure  feature is not enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, you can use one UOM for each 				non-stock item. This UOM is called the  base UOM , and the system uses it to 				track item quantities in the system and calculate item costs. The base UOM is a 				required setting for a stock item and is specified in the  Units of 					Measure  section of the  General Settings  tab 				on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form. If the  Multiple Units of Measure  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features form, you can add multiple UOMs that can be applied to 				the same non-stock item, and users can specify item quantities in these UOMs in 				sales and purchase documents. If your organization typically sells the item in a 				particular UOM, in the  Units of Measure  section on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form, you can specify this 				UOM in the  Sales Unit  box, and the system will use this UOM 				by default on sales documents. If your organization typically purchases the item in 				a particular UOM, in the  Units of Measure  section on the 					  ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items form, you can specify this UOM in the 					 Purchase Unit  box, and the system will use this UOM by 				default on purchase documents. If sales or purchase UOMs differ from the base UOM, you have to specify conversion 				rules in the  Units of Measure  section on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items form so that the system can recalculate the item 				quantities specified in sales and purchase documents to the base UOM. You can add specific prices for items measured in sales and purchase UOMs. For 				details, see  Sales Prices: General Information 				and  Vendor Prices: General Information. If the item can be sold or purchased in UOMs that are not base, sales, or purchase, 				you should make sure that these UOMs have been added to the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) Units of Measure (CS203100) form and conversion rules 				between the base UOM and these UOMs have been added to this form before you use the 				item with these UOMs in transactions. For more information about conversion rules, 				see  Units of Measure: General Information. You can configure units of measure (UOMs) for items that can be measured only in 				quantities that are integers as described in the next section. Units of Measure That Are Not 				 Divisible To specify that a UOM is not divisible, you clear the  Divisible 					Unit  check box on the  General Settings  tab of 				the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) for the non-stock item. 				If the  Multiple Units of Measure  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, you can manage the value 				of this check box for base, sales, and purchase UOMs of the item separately. Users can add decimal quantities of the item to sales and purchase documents when the 				check box is selected for all three UOMs (if the  Multiple Units of Measure  				feature is enabled) or for the base UOM (if the  Multiple Units of Measure  				feature is disabled). For the base UOM, when the  Divisible Unit  check box is cleared 				on the  General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items form for the non-stock item, the system 				validates the quantities of this item in the following documents: Shipments on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) form 					(if the  Require Shipment  box is selected on the 						 General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items form) SO invoices on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form  Purchase receipts on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) 					form (if the  Require Receipt  box is selected on the 						 General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items form) When the  Divisible Unit  check box is cleared for the sales UOM 				of the item, users can specify only integer quantities of the item in the sales UOM 				in sales documents (sales orders, shipments, and invoices). If the item can be sold 				in other UOMs, the system validates the quantity of each item converted to the sales 				UOM, making sure it is an integer. When the  Divisible Unit  check box is cleared for the purchase 				UOM of the item, users can specify only integer quantities of the item in the 				purchase UOM in purchase documents (purchase orders and receipts). If the item can 				be purchased in other UOMs, the system does not validate the quantity of the item 				converted to the purchase UOM to make sure it is an integer. Non-Stock Item Costs Non-stock items do not affect the company's inventory balance. However, to make it 				possible to enter the non-stock item cost and use it in the non-stock item price 				calculation, you can maintain standard costs for non-stock items. The standard costs are determined outside of the system, and the values should 				include some of the indirect and direct costs allocated. You can specify the 				standard cost for a non-stock item as a pending cost on the  Price/Cost 					Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) 				form. Along with the pending cost, you can specify a date when the cost will become 				effective. Standard costs are defined with respect to the base unit of the stock 				item.  If you want to update standard costs for non-stock items, use the 					 Price/Cost Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items form. You enter a pending cost and the date for the 				new cost and then click  Actions > Update Cost  on the form toolbar. The system displays only the last cost and the 				current cost. The historical costs that were effective before the last cost are not 				stored in the database. If you want to make similar changes to many or all non-stock (and possibly stock) 				items, use the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN502000|IN502000]) Update Standard Costs (IN502000) form. On 				this form, you can enter new costs and compare current and pending costs side by 				side for all items that you select. If you are satisfied with the changes, you can 				update the current standard costs with the pending standard costs for all items or 				only selected ones. For details, see  Item Costs and Valuation Methods. Accruing the Item Cost to the Expense Account If you want to accrue the cost of the non-stock item to the expense account, you can 				select the  Accrue Cost  check box for the non-stock item on 				the  Price/Cost Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form, and specify which accrued amount the 				system will post. The accrued amount may be calculated based on the standard cost, 				markup percentage, or sale price percentage. For a non-stock item with the 					 Accrue Cost  check box selected, the system does the 				following: When the non-stock item is added to a purchase receipt or an AP bill, on release 					of the document, the Expense Accrual account is debited in the corresponding GL 					transaction. When an SO invoice that includes the non-stock item is released, on release of 					the document, the Expense Accrual account is credited and the Expense account is 					debited in the corresponding GL 					 transaction . If a purchase return or sales return with a non-stock item is processed, the 				system generates a batch of transactions opposite to those mentioned in the list 				above. Including Taxes in the Cost of Non-Stock Items You can configure the system to include use taxes, sales taxes of the  Input  group, and 				partially deductible VATs in the cost of non-stock items with the  Require 					Receipt  check box selected on the  General 					Settings  tab ( Item Defaults  section) of the 					  ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form. For tax amounts to 				be included in the costs of items in purchase orders, the following actions must be 				completed in the system: A tax reason code of the  Adjustment  type must be defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS211000|CS211000]) Reason Codes (CS211000) form and specified as the 						 Tax Reason Code  on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) Purchase Orders Preferences (PO101000) form. In the tax settings, the  Use Tax Expense Account  check 					box must be cleared on the  GL Accounts  tab on the   ([~/?ScreenId=TX205000|TX205000]) Taxes (TX205000) form. The system calculates the taxes and accrues them in the  COGS/Expense 					Account  specified for the purchase receipt line on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form. On release of the AP 				bill related to the purchase receipt, the following GL transactions are generated 				and posted: Tax Reason Code account, Dr, Tax Amount PO Accrual account, Cr, Tax Amount For more information about configuring taxes for inclusion in the item cost, see  Taxes Included in the Cost of Items: General Information. Prices for Non-Stock Items You can enter default prices for non-stock items individually by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form and update the prices at any time. 				Default prices have no expiration dates and cannot be specified as based on the 				items' quantities.

The majority of transactions with inventory items are performed when the items are purchased or sold, and the respective inventory receipts or issues are generated by other documents, such as purchase receipts and sales orders from which financial documents, such as AP bills and AR invoices, are generated. Because direct inventory transactions (that is, inventory transactions that are not based on any sales or purchase documents) do not contain information about why inventory items are being moved, users should specify reason codes for them. When a reason code is specified for each direct inventory transaction, your organization can track why the particular inventory transaction was performed.{br}

Also, a reason code should be created for vendor returns. In this case, a reason code indicates that when the system creates an inventory issue that corresponds to a vendor return the system copies GL accounts from a receipt for which a purchase return is prepared. For details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\OrderMgmt_Purchase_Return_Original_Cost_GeneralInfo|Purchase Returns at the Original Cost: General Information].{br}

In the following sections, you will read about the creation and use of reason codes in inventory.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_mrl_zdz_3hb]
*Prepare the system for the creation of reason codes
*Create reason codes for inventory operations
*Create reason codes for vendor returns

==Applicable Scenarios==
You create reason codes when you initially configure inventory and order management in Acumatica ERP. You will use reason codes are used in the direct inventory operations of issuing, receiving, adjusting, and counting physical inventory and in vendor returns.
==Creation of Reason Codes for Inventory==
Before you start configuring the inventory settings in Acumatica ERP, you need to create all necessary reason codes to be used in inventory transactions. You define reason codes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_21_10_00|Reason Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS211000|CS211000]) form.{br}

For each reason code, you should specify the following:[anchor|#_16dbe470-3b5a-42f3-8b81-e2bbe2d0ff72]
*Identifier: Identifiers of reason codes may have up to 10 characters and should clearly designate the reason for the transaction, as with ''DAMAGE'', ''EXPIRATION'', ''SHRINKAGE'', and ''RETURNS''.
*Usage: You specify with what type of inventory transaction this reason code will be used, which can be any of the following:
**''Receipt''
** ''Issue''
** ''Vendor Return''
** ''Adjustment''
** ''Transfer''
*GL account: You select the GL account that the system will use as an offset account for transactions with this reason code specified.

After you have created all required reason codes, you can specify default reason codes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form. For details, see [[#_1414824c-da76-46ff-9904-bbc42e55a993|Default Reason Codes for Inventory Transactions].{br}{TOC}[anchor|#_1414824c-da76-46ff-9904-bbc42e55a993]
==Default Reason Codes for Inventory Transactions==
When an inventory document is created directly on a form such as [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000])—that is, when the inventory document is not based on a sales or purchase document—the reason code defines what account will be used as a default offset account. On release of the transaction, the inventory account (which is copied from the stock item) and the offset account (which is copied from the reason code) will be updated with the amount of the transaction.{br}

For the following types of inventory transactions, you should specify the default reason code on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form:[anchor|#_66e8af39-269a-4e89-94e7-760ca973fb7b]
*Receipts
*Issues
*Adjustment
*Physical inventory adjustments

When you create one of these inventory documents, the system automatically inserts the specified default reason code. Users can replace the default reason code with another reason code defined for the transaction type, if necessary. If users change the reason code, the corresponding account or accounts will be inserted into the appropriate boxes for the document.
==Reason Code for Vendor Returns==
When you configure order management preferences, you specify the default reason code of the ''Vendor Return'' usage type for vendor returns on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form. The system inserts this reason code for inventory issues that are generated during the processing of purchase returns, which are documents of the ''Return'' type created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form. Users can change the default reason code in the inventory issue, which is created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form.{br}

In the following implementation activity, you will learn how to create reason codes.
==Story==
Suppose that you, as an implementation manager, need to configure inventory and order management for a company. Before you start specifying the inventory and order management preferences on the appropriate Acumatica ERP forms, you must create reason codes for the direct inventory operations of issuing, receiving, adjusting, and counting physical inventory. You also need to create a reason code for vendor returns, which are not inventory operations but do involve the movement of goods in inventory.
==System Preparation==
Before you start creating these reason codes, you perform the following instructions:[anchor|#_140fbc65-18b3-407a-b9ea-828e26b0a4d2]
#In a new tenant, prepare the company with the basic settings, as described in the [HelpRoot_Implement\config_Basic_Company_GeneralInfo|Company Without Branches: General Information].
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, enable the ''Inventory and Order Management'' and ''Inventory'' features.

==Step 1: Creating Reason Codes for Inventory Operations==
To create reason codes for direct inventory operations, do the following:[anchor|#_07fdc60d-e72a-4307-b9b1-76c49a69b215][anchor|#_f62df246-0559-417e-b6c6-183066b70ab3]
#Sign in to the company you have prepared with the ''admin'' login.
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_21_10_00|Reason Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS211000|CS211000]) form.
#Create a reason code for direct inventory receipts as follows:
##On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record'''.
##Specify the following settings:
##*'''Reason Code''': <tt>INRECEIPT</tt>
##*'''Description''': <tt>Direct Receipts</tt>
##*'''Usage''': ''Receipt''
##* '''Account''': ''20100 - Inventory Purchase Accrual''
##Save the reason code.
# Create a reason code for direct inventory issues as follows:
##On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record'''.
##Specify the following settings:
##*'''Reason Code''': <tt>INISSUE</tt>
##*'''Description''': <tt>Direct Issues</tt>
##*'''Usage''': ''Issue''
##* '''Account''': ''11010 - AR Accrual Account''
##Save the reason code.
#Create a reason code for direct inventory adjustments as follows:
##On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record'''.
##Specify the following settings:
##*'''Reason Code''': <tt>INADJUST</tt>
##*'''Description''': <tt>Direct Adjustments</tt>
##*'''Usage''': ''Adjustment''
##* '''Account''': ''52000 - Physical Inventory Adjustments''
##Save the reason code.
#Create a reason code for physical inventory as follows:
##On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record'''.
##Specify the following settings:
##*'''Reason Code''': <tt>PHYINVADJ</tt>
##*'''Description''': <tt>Physical Inventory Adjustment</tt>
##*'''Usage''': ''Adjustment''
##* '''Account''': ''52000 - Physical Inventory Adjustments''
##Save the reason code.

Now that you have created reason codes for direct inventory operations, you can configure basic inventory preferences, as described in [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\config_InvMgmt_Basic_Implem_Activity|Order Management with Inventory Configuration: Implementation Activity].
==Step 2: Creating a Reason Code for Vendor Returns==
You create a reason code for vendor returns as follows:[anchor|#_520770b5-b0ae-4303-9c6d-6ca2167694fb]
#On the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_21_10_00|Reason Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS211000|CS211000]) form, click '''Add New Record'''.
#Specify the following settings:
#*'''Reason Code''': <tt>VENDORRET</tt>
#*'''Description''': <tt>Vendor Return</tt>
#*'''Usage''': ''Vendor Return''
#Save the reason code.

Now that you have created a reason code for vendor returns, you can configure sales order types as the next stage in preparing the system to configuration of order management. For details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\config_Sales_Order_Types_Mapref|Configuring Sales Order Types].]]></column>

Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS211000|CS211000]) Reason Codes (CS211000) form. Create a reason code for direct inventory receipts as follows: On the form toolbar, click  Add New Record . Specify the following settings: Reason Code :  INRECEIPT Description :  Direct Receipts Usage :  Receipt Account :  20100 - Inventory Purchase Accrual Save the reason code.  Create a reason code for direct inventory issues as follows: On the form toolbar, click  Add New Record . Specify the following settings: Reason Code :  INISSUE Description :  Direct Issues Usage :  Issue Account :  11010 - AR Accrual Account Save the reason code. Create a reason code for direct inventory adjustments as follows: On the form toolbar, click  Add New Record . Specify the following settings: Reason Code :  INADJUST Description :  Direct                   Adjustments Usage :  Adjustment Account :  52000 - Physical Inventory                   Adjustments Save the reason code. Create a reason code for physical inventory as follows: On the form toolbar, click  Add New Record . Specify the following settings: Reason Code :  PHYINVADJ Description :  Physical Inventory                     Adjustment Usage :  Adjustment Account :  52000 - Physical Inventory                   Adjustments Save the reason code. Now that you have created reason codes for direct inventory operations, you can configure         basic inventory preferences, as described in  Order Management with Inventory Configuration: Implementation Activity. Step 2: Creating a Reason Code for Vendor Returns You create a reason code for vendor returns as follows: On the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS211000|CS211000]) Reason Codes (CS211000) form, click              Add New Record . Specify the following settings: Reason Code :  VENDORRET Description :  Vendor Return Usage :  Vendor Return Save the reason code. Now that you have created a reason code for vendor returns, you can configure sales order         types as the next stage in preparing the system to configuration of order management. For         details, see  Configuring Sales Order Types. ]]></column>

The primary inventory entity defined in Acumatica ERP is ''stock items'': the finished goods and raw materials that cost money, have value, and are stored. For each stock item, you create a record on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form that holds the settings of the item, such as the GL accounts assigned to the item and the rules for calculating the item's availability calculation. {br}

Before you start creating stock items in the system, you need to create the entities that are used in the item settings, as described in this topic.
==Inventory Entities to Be Created==
You need to create the following entities before users can start processing documents related to inventory in Acumatica ERP:[anchor|#_e153756e-f2d7-4f8f-9f6f-3fb0ba37b502]
*Posting classes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) form: You must create posting classes before you start creating item classes. For details about these classes and their implementation, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Posting_Classes_Mapref|Creating Posting Classes]. 
*Units of measure on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) form (optional): If you need to create units of measure for item classes or stock items beyond those preconfigured in the system, that should be done before you start creating item classes. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\UOMs_Mapref|Creating Units of Measure]. 
*Availability calculation rules on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_15_00|Availability Calculation Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201500|IN201500]) form: For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Availability_Calculation_Rules_Mapref|Creating Availability Calculation Rules]. You must create availability calculation rules before you start creating item classes.
*Item classes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form: For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Item_Classes_Mapref|Creating Item Classes for Stock Items]. You must create item classes before you start creating stock items.
*Stock items on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form: For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Stock_Items_Mapref|Creating Stock Items].

Thus, the order in which you create entities is important, because some entities derive settings from other entities or use them in other ways. You first create posting classes, units of measure, and availability calculation rules in any order; you then create the item classes for which these entities will be used as settings. After item classes have been created, you create the stock items that will belong to these item classes and will derive settings from them. (See the following diagram.)[anchor|#_75a774b2-fba8-42e6-a906-e551bd984868][anchor|#_69ef858f-b1da-447f-891f-d8107c63078b][image:UserGuide/Images/InvMgmt_Inventory_Entities.png|popup|The use of settings in inventory entities|300px]]]></column>

Every inventory transaction creates an appropriate posting to the general ledger, depending on the particular inventory item, the type of transaction, the warehouse where the item is stocked, and other conditions. A posting class, which is a required setting for stock items, defines which accounts should be used to post specific transactions to the general ledger. Also, posting classes are used to provide the default GL accounts to be assigned to stock items that are created.{br}

During the configuration of Acumatica ERP, you create posting settings and then assign posting classes to item classes, which group items and provide settings for them. When you create each stock item, you specify an item class, which causes the system to insert default settings for the item, including the posting class (which in turn causes the system to insert the accounts of the posting class for the item). The insertion of these default accounts streamlines data entry.((({S:Warn}In this chapter, posting classes are described in terms of accounts specified for them but not subaccounts; subaccounts are beyond the scope of this chapter. That is, these topics describe how the system works when the ''Subaccounts'' feature is disabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
)))
In the following sections, you will read about posting classes in Acumatica ERP.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_mrl_zdz_3hb]
*Prepare the system for the creation of posting classes
*Create posting classes for stock items

==Applicable Scenarios==
You create posting classes in the following cases:[anchor|#ul_vhz_n2z_3hb]
*When you are initially configuring inventory in Acumatica ERP, before you create item classes and stock items
*When you need to create a new class of inventory items with specific posting settings

==Creation of Posting Classes==
You can create posting classes by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) form.((({S:Warn}Before you start creating posting classes, you should make sure that all necessary GL accounts have been created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_20_25_00|Chart of Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=GL202500|GL202500]) form.
)))
During the creation of a posting class, you specify the following:[anchor|#ol_wrq_ftf_3hb]
*Class ID: You type the unique identifier that defines the posting class, which is an alphanumeric string of up to 10 characters.
*GL accounts: You specify the general ledger accounts assigned to the posting class. The exact set of accounts you need to select depends on the items for which you are creating a posting class. For details, see [[#_5a666cd1-022d-4ffb-9b39-36b47e5d5e96|General Ledger Accounts of a Posting Class].
*Posting settings for transactions: You specify which GL account the system must use for which type of transaction, as described in see [[#_ed9bd946-a9da-4535-a300-e89b86e26515|Posting Settings for General Ledger Accounts].
*'''Phys. Inventory Reason Code''': You specify the reason code that the system will use by default for physical inventory involving items associated with this posting class. For more information, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Reason_Codes_GeneralInfo|Reason Codes: General Information].
[anchor|#_55172280-2505-41b7-9563-dd54902e18a4]
==General Ledger Accounts Used by Inventory Entities==
You can specify GL accounts in the settings of the following inventory entities: warehouses (if you use multiple warehouses in the system), posting classes (which can be specified for stock and non-stock items), stock items, and non-stock items. The specified GL accounts are used by the system to record inventory transactions that involve the respective entities. You specify the following GL accounts in the settings of inventory entities:[anchor|#_dc379bba-5db0-4e6e-be7b-4683360c2bc4]
*Inventory/Accrual account (specified in the settings of a stock item, warehouse, non-stock item, or posting class for non-stock items): An account that is one of the following:
**If specified for a stock item or warehouse: An asset account to keep the inventory balance resulting from transactions with the stock item or transactions that involve the specific warehouse. The cost of the applicable items will be debited to the Inventory account when the items are received, and credited when the items are issued from inventory.
**If specified for a non-stock item or a posting class to be used for non-stock items: A liability account to be used for non-stock items as the Accrual account. The cost of purchased non-stock items will be credited to this account, and when an AP bill is created for any of these purchased non-stock items, the cost will be debited to this account.
*Sales account (specified for each warehouse, stock item, non-stock item, and posting class): The income account to record sales for the entity.
*:((({S:Warn}A sales account can also be specified in settings of an order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. In a sales order of a type with a sales account specified, this sales account has a higher priority than the setting specified in the item settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form.
)))
*COGS/Expense account (specified for each warehouse, stock item, non-stock item, and posting class): An account that is one of the following:
**If specified for a warehouse, stock item, or posting class for stock items: The expense account used as the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) account. This account will accrue the cost of goods sold once a sales order that includes the applicable item or warehouse is released. The cost of items sold is debited to the account when items are issued for sale from inventory.
**If specified for a non-stock item or for a posting class to be used for non-stock items or labor items: The Expense account used for transactions with these items.
*Standard Cost Variance account (specified for each warehouse, stock item, and posting class for stock items): The expense account to be used to record any differences between the currently effective standard cost and the cost on a bill for the specified quantities of items. 
*:This account is used only for transactions associated with stock items to which the ''Standard'' valuation method is assigned.
*Standard Cost Revaluation account (specified for each warehouse, stock item, and posting class for stock items): The expense account to be used to record the differences in inventory value estimated by using the pending standard cost and the currently effective standard cost for the quantities on hand of a stock item. Revaluation is performed at the moment when standard costs are updated—that is, when the currently effective standard cost becomes the last standard cost, and the pending cost becomes the effective standard cost.
*:This account is used only for transactions associated with stock items to which the ''Standard'' valuation method is assigned.
*PO Accrual account (specified for each warehouse, stock item, and posting class): The liability account to be used to accrue amounts on purchase orders related to the warehouse or stock item for which the account is specified. Whenever receipts linked to purchase orders are released, the system generates transactions between the PO Accrual account and the inventory account.
*Purchase Price Variance account (specified for each warehouse, stock item, non-stock item, and posting class for stock or non-stock items): The expense account to be used to record any differences between the extended price on the purchase receipt and the extended price on the AP bill. 
*:This account is used for transactions that involve inventory items for which any of the valuation methods is assigned.
*Landed Cost Variance account (specified for each warehouse, stock item, and posting class for stock items): The expense account to be used to record any differences in landed costs between the landed cost amounts specified on purchase receipts and the landed cost amounts on inventory receipts.
*Deferral account (specified for each stock item, non-stock item, and posting class): The account to be used to hold the deferred amount until it is fully recognized. You select an account of one of the following types: 
**A liability account for a deferral code of the ''Revenue'' type
**An asset account for a deferral code of the ''Expense'' type
[anchor|#_5a666cd1-022d-4ffb-9b39-36b47e5d5e96]
==General Ledger Accounts of a Posting Class==
You specify the default general ledger accounts assigned to a posting class on the '''GL Accounts''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) form. These default GL accounts simplify data entry on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) forms. When a posting class is assigned to an item class, the system copies the GL accounts from the posting class to the item class. In the settings of the item class or item, you can override any of the default accounts, if needed.{br}

If you change the posting class for an item class or item, the system updates the GL accounts on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form with the accounts from the new posting class.[anchor|#_ed9bd946-a9da-4535-a300-e89b86e26515]
==Posting Settings for General Ledger Accounts==
The GL accounts to be used for inventory transactions related to sales, purchases, and valuation of inventory items can be obtained from multiple sources, depending on the business processes established in your organization. On the '''Posting Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) form, for each type of account, you specify from which source the system will use this account for the posting class.{br}

In Acumatica ERP, you can select one of the following sources, which determine the GL accounts the system will use:[anchor|#ul_xrq_ftf_3hb]
*''Inventory item'': The Inventory account for all transactions of the item will be the one specified in the item settings, regardless of at what warehouse the inventory transaction occurs.
*''Warehouse'': The Inventory account will vary depending on the warehouse where the inventory transaction is made. You select this source if you use multiple warehouses in the system and each warehouse has a specific Inventory account assigned.
*''Posting class'': The Inventory account assigned to the posting class itself (as specified on the '''GL Accounts''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] form) will be used. You select this source when you need to replace the Inventory account in item settings with a new account.

==Basic Scenarios of Configuring Posting Classes==
When you create posting classes, you can configure the following basic scenarios:[anchor|#ul_yrq_ftf_3hb]
*Posting transactions for multiple items to the same GL account: Suppose that you have a single warehouse, and the majority of inventory transactions should be posted to the same GL account. You do the following:
**You create a posting class and specify for it the inventory account that the system should use for posting inventory transactions.
**You select ''Posting Class'' as the source of the inventory account in the settings of the posting class.
**You specify the created posting class in the settings of each item class and inventory item.
*Posting transactions to item-specific GL accounts: Suppose that you have high cost items for which you want to allocate specific General Ledger accounts. You do the following:
**You specify a separate GL account in the settings of each item class for especially valuable items or each inventory item that is considered particularly valuable.
**You create a posting class; in its settings, you select ''Inventory Item'' as the source of the inventory account.
**You specify the created posting class in the settings of the inventory items that have separate GL accounts assigned to them.
*Posting transactions to warehouse-specific GL accounts: Suppose that you have multiple warehouses and you have separate accounts for each warehouse. You do the following:
**You assign an individual inventory account to each warehouse.
**You create a posting class and select ''Warehouse'' as the source of the inventory account.
**You assign item classes or items to the created posting class.

You can combine these basic scenarios to post transactions according to business processes of your organization.]]></column>

The specified GL accounts are used by the system to record inventory transactions                 that involve the respective entities. You specify the following GL accounts in the                 settings of inventory entities: Inventory/Accrual account (specified in the settings of a stock item, warehouse,                     non-stock item, or posting class for non-stock items): An account that is one of                     the following: If specified for a stock item or warehouse: An asset account to keep the                             inventory balance resulting from transactions with the stock item or                             transactions that involve the specific warehouse. The cost of the                             applicable items will be debited to the Inventory account when the items                             are received, and credited when the items are issued from                             inventory. If specified for a non-stock item or a posting class to be used for                             non-stock items: A liability account to be used for non-stock items as                             the Accrual account. The cost of purchased non-stock items will be                             credited to this account, and when an AP bill is created for any of                             these purchased non-stock items, the cost will be debited to this                             account.

In a sales order                         of a type with a sales account specified, this sales account has a higher                         priority than the setting specified in the item settings on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form. COGS/Expense account (specified for each warehouse, stock item, non-stock item,                     and posting class): An account that is one of the following: If specified for a warehouse, stock item, or posting class for stock                             items: The expense account used as the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)                             account. This account will accrue the cost of goods sold once a sales                             order that includes the applicable item or warehouse is released. The                             cost of items sold is debited to the account when items are issued for                             sale from inventory. If specified for a non-stock item or for a posting class to be used for                             non-stock items or labor items: The Expense account used for                             transactions with these items. Standard Cost Variance account (specified for each warehouse, stock item, and                     posting class for stock items): The expense account to be used to record any                     differences between the currently effective standard cost and the cost on a bill                     for the specified quantities of items.  This account is used only for                         transactions associated with stock items to which the  Standard                          valuation method is assigned. Standard Cost Revaluation account (specified for each warehouse, stock item, and                     posting class for stock items): The expense account to be used to record the                     differences in inventory value estimated by using the pending standard cost and                     the currently effective standard cost for the quantities on hand of a stock                     item. Revaluation is performed at the moment when standard costs are                     updated—that is, when the currently effective standard cost becomes the last                     standard cost, and the pending cost becomes the effective standard cost. This                         account is used only for transactions associated with stock items to which                         the  Standard  valuation method is assigned. PO Accrual account (specified for each warehouse, stock item, and posting                     class): The liability account to be used to accrue amounts on purchase orders                     related to the warehouse or stock item for which the account is specified.                     Whenever receipts linked to purchase orders are released, the system generates                     transactions between the PO Accrual account and the inventory account. Purchase Price Variance account (specified for each warehouse, stock item,                     non-stock item, and posting class for stock or non-stock items): The expense                     account to be used to record any differences between the extended price on the                     purchase receipt and the extended price on the AP bill.  This account is used                         for transactions that involve inventory items for which any of the valuation                         methods is assigned. Landed Cost Variance account (specified for each warehouse, stock item, and                     posting class for stock items): The expense account to be used to record any                     differences in landed costs between the landed cost amounts specified on                     purchase receipts and the landed cost amounts on inventory receipts. Deferral account (specified for each stock item, non-stock item, and posting                     class): The account to be used to hold the deferred amount until it is fully                     recognized. You select an account of one of the following types:  A liability account for a deferral code of the  Revenue  type An asset account for a deferral code of the  Expense  type General Ledger Accounts of a Posting Class You specify the default general ledger accounts assigned to a posting class on the       GL Accounts  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) Posting Classes     (IN206000) form. These default GL accounts simplify data entry on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000) and   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) forms. When     a posting class is assigned to an item class, the system copies the GL accounts from the posting     class to the item class. In the settings of the item class or item, you can override any of the     default accounts, if needed. If you change the posting class for an item class or item, the system updates the GL accounts     on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes or   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form with the accounts     from the new posting class. Posting Settings for General Ledger Accounts The GL accounts to be used for inventory transactions related to sales, purchases, and     valuation of inventory items can be obtained from multiple sources, depending on the business     processes established in your organization. On the  Posting Settings  tab     of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) Posting Classes (IN206000) form, for each type of account,     you specify from which source the system will use this account for the posting class. In  Acumatica ERP,     you can select one of the following sources, which determine the GL accounts the system will     use: Inventory item : The Inventory account for all transactions of the item will be the      one specified in the item settings, regardless of at what warehouse the inventory transaction      occurs. Warehouse : The Inventory account will vary depending on the warehouse where the      inventory transaction is made. You select this source if you use multiple warehouses in the      system and each warehouse has a specific Inventory account assigned. Posting class : The Inventory account assigned to the posting class itself (as      specified on the  GL Accounts  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) Posting Classes form) will be used. You select this source when you need to replace the      Inventory account in item settings with a new account. Basic Scenarios of Configuring Posting Classes When you create posting classes, you can configure the following basic scenarios: Posting transactions for multiple items to the same GL account: Suppose that you have a      single warehouse, and the majority of inventory transactions should be posted to the same GL      account. You do the following: You create a posting class and specify for it the inventory account that the system should        use for posting inventory transactions. You select  Posting Class  as the source of the inventory account in the settings of        the posting class. You specify the created posting class in the settings of each item class and inventory        item. Posting transactions to item-specific GL accounts: Suppose that you have high cost items for      which you want to allocate specific General Ledger accounts. You do the following: You specify a separate GL account in the settings of each item class for especially        valuable items or each inventory item that is considered particularly valuable. You create a posting class; in its settings, you select  Inventory Item  as the        source of the inventory account. You specify the created posting class in the settings of the inventory items that have        separate GL accounts assigned to them. Posting transactions to warehouse-specific GL accounts: Suppose that you have multiple      warehouses and you have separate accounts for each warehouse. You do the following: You assign an individual inventory account to each warehouse. You create a posting class and select  Warehouse  as the source of the inventory        account. You assign item classes or items to the created posting class. You can combine these basic scenarios to post transactions according to business processes of     your organization. ]]></column>

By performing the following implementation activity, you will learn how to create a posting class.
==Story==
Suppose that you, as an implementation manager, are configuring inventory for the SweetLife company, which produces and sells bottled juice. Before you can start creating stock items for juice in the system, you need to create a posting class that will provide default posting settings for juice items.
==System Preparation==
Before you start creating a posting class, you perform the following instructions:[anchor|#_140fbc65-18b3-407a-b9ea-828e26b0a4d2]
#In a new tenant, prepare the company with the basic settings, as described in the [HelpRoot_Implement\config_Basic_Company_GeneralInfo|Company Without Branches: General Information].
#Specify the appropriate inventory settings, as described in [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\config_InvMgmt_Basic_Implem_Activity|Order Management with Inventory Configuration: Implementation Activity].
((({S:Warn}If you have not configured a company with basic settings and you want to practice creating a posting class, you can perform the activity in this topic by using the ''U100'' data set.
)))[anchor|#_380514f6-2ca4-4e1b-aeb3-8d62648613b6]
==Step: Creating a Posting Class==
You create a posting class for jams as follows:[anchor|#_5b2e2169-f968-4e16-a577-02b6f1853e1b][anchor|#_7b7e82aa-d905-428b-91d5-afcf0ef19edd]

Some inventory items can be purchased, tracked, or sold by your company in multiple ways: by the piece, or in storage containers (such as boxes, packages, or creates) into which they have been packaged. In Acumatica ERP, you can define and maintain any number of different units of measure (UOMs) to account for and express these quantities of the items. You can also define conversion rules, so that for different UOMs of the same items, the system can calculate the prices of items to your specifications.{br}

Some units of measure apply to many items and, as such, are defined at the system level. Other units of measure are used only for particular items or for item classes (which group similar items). In Acumatica ERP, you can define UOMs and conversion rules at all of these levels, as described in the following sections.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#_a4e59abb-2869-4616-97d5-3dcf636d5c56]
*Create units of measure that can be used systemwide
*Create conversion rules for systemwide units of measure

==Applicable Scenarios==
You create systemwide units of measure in the following cases:[anchor|#ul_vhz_n2z_3hb]
*When you are initially configuring inventory in Acumatica ERP
*When you need to measure stock items in specific units that are not defined among the systemwide UOMs

==Systemwide Units of Measure==
When you deploy a tenant from scratch, the tenant already contains predefined units of measure, which you can view on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) form. If you need to define additional units of measure, you use the same form. Units of measure defined on this form can be used systemwide, for example, for all inventory items and item classes. You can add new units of measure to the unit conversion reference table on this form.{br}

In the table, you can also specify how UOMs are converted to units already defined in the table, if applicable. For more information on conversion rules, see [[#_acc02a9f-a7a2-4c9e-aeb2-34611b38a72b|Conversion Rules].{br}

In addition to systemwide UOMs, you can create UOMs when you are creating an item class or inventory item. For details, see [[#_005ac844-6b2d-4e09-b509-f0b24a053e46|UOMs for Item Classes and Stock Items].[anchor|#_005ac844-6b2d-4e09-b509-f0b24a053e46]
==UOMs for Item Classes and Stock Items==
You specify UOMs for item classes or stock items in the '''Units of Measure''' section of the '''General Settings''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, respectively. The UOMs specified in the settings of an item class are copied to the corresponding boxes of a new stock item of this class created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form. For both item classes and stock items, you can select systemwide UOMs or type new item class-specific or item-specific UOMs.((({S:Warn}[anchor|#_1ae48a2f-c607-4300-a910-ee8fc3505958]
*New UOMs added on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] form are not copied automatically to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) form. If you want to use these units globally, you must manually add the units to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] form.
*New UOMs added by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form are copied automatically to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] form.
)))
If the ''Multiple Units of Measure'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, for each item class defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] form and for each stock item defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form, you can specify the following units:[anchor|#ul_j3p_zvz_sh]
*'''Base Unit''' (required): The unit of measure used to calculate unit costs and to maintain availability data for stock items (that is, the system counts the quantities of each stock item at warehouses by using the UOM specified as its base unit). For recommendations on selecting base units, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Stock_Items_UOMs|Stock Items: Units of Measure].
*'''Sales Unit''' (optional): The unit of measure typically used when your company sells the item.
*'''Purchase Unit''' (optional): The unit of measure typically used when your company purchases the item.
((({S:Hint}If you need to change any UOM of an item class or item, make sure that rules for conversion between the current and new UOM are specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] (for systemwide units), [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] (for item class-specific units), or [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] (for item-specific units) form before you use the item with the new UOM in any new transaction.
)))
If the ''Multiple Units of Measure'' feature is not enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form, you can specify only base units for item classes and for individual stock items.{br}

When you enter a sales transaction and specify the quantity and UOM of the inventory item, the system converts the specified UOM to the base unit for cost-of-sold-goods calculation and to the default sales unit for finding the proper price (or to any other unit of the item for which a price can be found).{br}

For stock items, you can configure units of measure (UOMs) for items that can be measured only in quantities that are integers. This helps to eliminate the number of errors in inventory, sales, and purchase documents. For more information, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Stock_Items_Not_Divisible_UOMs|Stock Items: Units of Measure That Are Not Divisible].{br}

For more information about UOMs for stock items, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Stock_Items_UOMs|Stock Items: Units of Measure].[anchor|#_acc02a9f-a7a2-4c9e-aeb2-34611b38a72b]
==Conversion Rules==
If the same item can be measured in multiple UOMs, you should define conversion rules between these UOMs so that the system can recalculate item quantities to the base UOM of the item. For global UOMs, you add conversion rules to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) form. If you specify different UOMs for base, sales, and purchase units for an item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, you need to add conversion rules for the sales and purchase UOMs with respect to the base UOM on this form.{br}

Before you define conversion rules for UOMs, you must make sure that the decimal precision specified in the '''Decimal Precision''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) form corresponds to your organization's rounding policy for the base currency.{br}

In conversion rules, you use the operations of multiplication and division and the conversion factor, which is a number the system uses to convert one UOM to another UOM. For example, suppose that your organization purchases bottled lemonade in containers and sells lemonade by boxes and containers. The base UOM for lemonade is ''BOTTLE''. The ''BOX'' UOM contains 10 bottles. The ''CONTAINER'' UOM includes six boxes or 60 bottles. The conversion rules between these UOMs are listed in the following table.[anchor|#_a5e0c2c4-8b2e-49a7-985d-9eb64e15d5be]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%"

|}
The conversion rules are not reversible—that is, the system cannot use the rule in the first row of the table above to recalculate the quantity specified in bottles to the quantity specified in containers. To convert bottles to boxes and containers, you need to add the conversion rules listed in the following table.[anchor|#_2c0d677e-2b34-464c-be75-ffaadaac01f9]

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Units of Measure: General Information Some inventory items can be purchased, tracked, or sold by your company in multiple ways: by     the piece, or in storage containers (such as boxes, packages, or creates) into which they have     been packaged. In  Acumatica ERP,     you can define and maintain any number of different units of measure (UOMs) to account for and     express these quantities of the items. You can also define conversion rules, so that for     different UOMs of the same items, the system can calculate the prices of items to your     specifications. Some units of measure apply to many items and, as such, are defined at the system level. Other     units of measure are used only for particular items or for item classes (which group similar     items). In  Acumatica ERP,     you can define UOMs and conversion rules at all of these levels, as described in the following     sections. Learning Objectives In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following: Create units of measure that can be used systemwide Create conversion rules for systemwide units of measure Applicable Scenarios You create systemwide units of measure in the following cases: When you are initially configuring inventory in  Acumatica ERPWhen you need to measure stock items in specific units that are not defined among the      systemwide UOMs Systemwide Units of Measure When you deploy a tenant from scratch, the tenant already contains predefined units of     measure, which you can view on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) Units of Measure (CS203100)     form. If you need to define additional units of measure, you use the same form. Units of measure     defined on this form can be used systemwide, for example, for all inventory items and item     classes. You can add new units of measure to the unit conversion reference table on this     form. In the table, you can also specify how UOMs are converted to units already defined in the     table, if applicable. For more information on conversion rules, see  Conversion Rules Conversion Rules. In addition to systemwide UOMs, you can create UOMs when you are creating an item class or     inventory item. For details, see  UOMs for Item Classes and Stock Items UOMs for Item Classes and Stock Items. UOMs for Item Classes and Stock Items You specify UOMs for item classes or stock items in the  Units of      Measure  section of the  General Settings  tab on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000) or   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form, respectively. The UOMs specified in the settings of an item     class are copied to the corresponding boxes of a new stock item of this class created on the        ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form. For both item classes and stock items, you     can select systemwide UOMs or type new item class-specific or item-specific UOMs. New UOMs added on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes form are not copied       automatically to the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) Units of Measure (CS203100) form. If you       want to use these units globally, you must manually add the units to the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) Units of Measure form. New UOMs added by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form are copied       automatically to the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) Units of Measure form. If the  Multiple Units of Measure  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, for each item class defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes form and for each stock item defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form, you can specify the following units: Base Unit  (required): The unit of measure used to calculate unit      costs and to maintain availability data for stock items (that is, the system counts the      quantities of each stock item at warehouses by using the UOM specified as its base unit). For      recommendations on selecting base units, see  Stock Items: Units of Measure. Sales Unit  (optional): The unit of measure typically used when your      company sells the item. Purchase Unit  (optional): The unit of measure typically used when      your company purchases the item. If you need to change any UOM of an item class or item, make sure that rules     for conversion between the current and new UOM are specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) Units of Measure (for systemwide units),   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (for item class-specific units), or   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (for item-specific units) form before you use the item with the new UOM in any new     transaction. If the  Multiple Units of Measure  feature is not enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features form, you can specify only base units for item classes and for     individual stock items. When you enter a sales transaction and specify the quantity and UOM of the inventory item, the     system converts the specified UOM to the base unit for cost-of-sold-goods calculation and to the     default sales unit for finding the proper price (or to any other unit of the item for which a     price can be found). For stock items, you can configure units of measure (UOMs) for items that can be measured only     in quantities that are integers. This helps to eliminate the number of errors in inventory,     sales, and purchase documents. For more information, see  Stock Items: Units of Measure That Are Not Divisible. For more information about UOMs for stock items, see  Stock Items: Units of Measure. Conversion Rules If the same item can be measured in multiple UOMs, you should define conversion rules between                 these UOMs so that the system can recalculate item quantities to the base UOM of the                 item. For global UOMs, you add conversion rules to the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) Units of Measure (CS203100) form. If you                 specify different UOMs for base, sales, and purchase units for an item on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form, you need                 to add conversion rules for the sales and purchase UOMs with respect to the base UOM                 on this form. Before you define conversion rules for UOMs, you must make sure that the decimal precision                 specified in the  Decimal Precision  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) Companies (CS101500) form corresponds to your                 organization's rounding policy for the base currency. In conversion rules, you use the operations of multiplication and division and the conversion                 factor, which is a number the system uses to convert one UOM to another UOM. For                 example, suppose that your organization purchases bottled lemonade in containers and                 sells lemonade by boxes and containers. The base UOM for lemonade is  BOTTLE .                 The  BOX  UOM contains 10 bottles. The  CONTAINER  UOM includes six boxes                 or 60 bottles. The conversion rules between these UOMs are listed in the following                 table. From Unit Multiply/Divide Conversion Factor To Unit  BOX Multiply 10 BOTTLE CONTAINER Multiply 60 BOTTLE CONTAINER Multiply 6 BOX The conversion rules are not reversible—that is, the system cannot use the rule in the first row                 of the table above to recalculate the quantity specified in bottles to the quantity                 specified in containers. To convert bottles to boxes and containers, you need to add                 the conversion rules listed in the following table. From Unit Multiply/Divide Conversion Factor To Unit  BOTTLE Divide 10 BOX BOTTLE Divide 60 CONTAINER ]]></column>

In the following implementation activity, you will learn how to create global units of measure and conversion rules.
==Story==
Suppose that you, as an implementation manager, are configuring inventory for the SweetLife company, which produces and sells bottled juice. The company sells juice in 0.5-liter and 1-liter bottles. For wholesale customers, the company sells juice in boxes: a box that contains 12 0.5-liter bottles, and a box that contains 8 1-liter bottles. {br}

Before you can start creating stock items for juice in the system, you need to create the units of measure and conversion rules that will provide default settings for juice items.
==System Preparation==
Before you start creating global units of measure, in a new tenant, prepare the company with the basic settings, as described in the [HelpRoot_Implement\config_Basic_Company_GeneralInfo|Company Without Branches: General Information].((({S:Warn}If you have not configured a company with basic settings and you want to practice creating units of measure and conversion rules, you can perform the activity in this topic by using the ''U100'' data set.

In Acumatica ERP, you can configure the way availability data is calculated in accordance with your company&rsquo;s policies. You define the availability calculation rules on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_15_00|Availability Calculation Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201500|IN201500]) form. For each item class, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form, you need to specify the particular availability calculation rule, which defines the availability calculation options for this item class. (These calculations cannot be overridden for individual stock items.){br}

In the following sections, you will read about availability calculation of stock items.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to configure the availability calculation settings that apply to inventory items.
==Applicable Scenarios==
You create availability calculation rules in the following cases:[anchor|#ul_vhz_n2z_3hb]
*When you are initially configuring inventory in Acumatica ERP
*When you need to add an item class or inventory item with specific availability calculation settings

==Types of Quantities Calculated==
 Acumatica ERP automatically updates the on-hand quantities of items at warehouses only when the documents that record inventory transactions have been released. On-hand quantities usually differ from the quantities that are actually available because documents may be processed after the actual operations with items have been performed in such cases as the following:[anchor|#_f666d1ad-24ef-4251-98be-026e172e0424]
* Certain quantities of items may be booked onsales orders that are on hold.
*Some items may be picked for shipping but not yet shipped.
*Items may be returned from customers before the corresponding returns are created.
*Items may be received from vendors before the corresponding receipts are released.
{br}

When you select a stock item in a on an entry form of Acumatica ERP, in the table footer of the form, you can see the quantities of the item in inventory that are on-hand, available, available for shipping, and available for issue. The system maintains these quantities according to the following rules (also displayed on the diagram below):[anchor|#ul_ufh_4tj_2s]
*On-hand quantity: This is the on-hand or book quantity of items in inventory. This quantity is stored in the Acumatica ERP database and updated with every released inventory transaction.
*Quantity available for shipping: This estimated quantity is calculated by using the following formula: the on-hand quantity minus the quantity on issues (''IN Issues'' in the diagram) that haven&rsquo;t been released yet, minus the quantity allocated for shipping (''SO Allocated''), minus the shipped quantity (''SO Shipped''). Thus, the quantity available for shipping can be less than the on-hand quantity. The system verifies the quantity available for shipping every time a new shipment is created.
*Quantity available for issue: This is an estimated quantity of the items that can be issued from inventory, which is calculated as the on-hand quantity minus the shipped quantity (''SO Shipped'' in the diagram). The system checks this quantity to prevent a user from issuing unavailable stock directly from a warehouse; that is, if the issued quantity of an inventory issue, a transfer, or an adjustment with a negative quantity is greater than the quantity available for issue, the document cannot be released.
*Available quantity: You can configure the way this estimated quantity is calculated by using availability calculation rules. The available quantity may include anticipated transactions and therefore may be less than or greater than the on-hand quantity. Anticipated transactions correspond to the documents and transactions that have been entered in the system but not yet processed to the end. (In the diagram, these documents and transactions are indicated by ''Sum of Deductions'', which is subtracted from the on-hand quantity, and ''Sum of Additions'', which is added to the on-hand quantity.) In the availability calculation settings of an item class, you specify which anticipated transactions affect the available quantity. Thus, the available quantity may include goods on purchase orders (''Purchase Orders ''in the diagram) and exclude the goods allocated for sales orders (''SO Allocated''). For details, see [[#_87027d64-139d-474d-b097-379b2d80ab70|Plan Types].
*:You can use the available quantity as a leading indicator of demand for the automated inventory replenishment process (see[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Automated_Replenishment|Automated Replenishment]). Also, salespersons might want to consider the available quantity rather than the on-hand quantity when adding items to sales orders and overselling items to a controlled extent, which might be dictated by the company&rsquo;s sales policy.

The quantities shown in the following diagram, such as ''IN Issues'', represent ''plan types'' that you can view on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_20_00|Inventory Allocation Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) form. A plan type is an item's status, which reflects a combination of actions that could affect the item's availability in stock and that the system will apply to the item during the next processing stage. A plan of a particular type is related to unreleased documents that contain the item. The availability calculation rule applied to the item (which is the rule specified for the item class) determines the combination of plan types that affect the item availability in stock.{br}

Dotted lines around an entry in the diagram indicate plan types that are used to calculate a particular quantity.[anchor|#_50bf0726-7c82-4701-ad00-b3fc2387ed2a][anchor|#_52341c5c-0693-4155-ae02-a466543f9cc7][image:UserGuide/Images/InvMgmt_Item_Availability.png|popup|Item availability calculation|450px][anchor|#_87027d64-139d-474d-b097-379b2d80ab70]
==Plan Types==
For each item class, you select an availability calculation rule to define how you want the system to calculate the available quantities for items of the class. Each availability calculation rule, which you create on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_15_00|Availability Calculation Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201500|IN201500]) form, defines the plan types that affect the available quantities of items of the class. Documents with the ''Released'' and ''Posted'' statuses do not affect calculation of these quantities.{br}

When you configure an availability calculation rule, you select the plan types that increase the available quantity of items of the class and the plan types that decrease the available quantity of these items. (Plan types that you do not select will not be included in availability calculations for items of the class.){br}

The plan types that correspond to the following documents decrease the available quantity of a stock item if the plan types are selected for the availability calculation rule selected for the applicable item class:[anchor|#_2ad3c47d-f3ef-40ec-8ca3-08ac5a58aa3f]
*Inventory issues: The system will deduct the quantities of the item included in issues from the available quantity of the item. The issues with the ''On Hold'' and ''Balanced'' statuses are used for availability calculation.
*:The item plan that corresponds to these documents is ''IN Issues''.
*Prepared sales orders: The system will deduct the quantities of the item included in sales orders (of the ''SO'', ''IN'', and ''CS'' types) with the ''On Hold'', ''Credit Hold'',''Pending Approval'', and ''Rejected'' statuses from the available quantity of the item.
*:The item plan that corresponds to these documents is ''SO Prepared''.
*Sales orders: The system will deduct the quantities of the item included in open sales orders (of the ''SO'' type) from the available quantity of the item.
*:The item plan that corresponds to these documents is ''SO Booked''.
*Confirmed shipments and sales orders without shipments: The system will deduct the quantities of the item included in confirmed shipments and open orders of the ''CS'' and ''IN'' types from the available quantity of the item.
*:The item plan that corresponds to these documents is ''SO Shipped''.
*Unconfirmed shipments and sales orders with specific allocations: The system will deduct all of the following quantities from the available quantity of an item:
**The quantities of the item included in unconfirmed shipments
**The quantities of the item included in sales orders of the ''SA'' type with any status
**Any specifically allocated (reserved) quantities of the item included in sales orders of the ''SO'' type with the ''On Hold'', ''Credit Hold'',''Pending Approval'', ''Rejected'', and ''Open'' statuses
*:The item plan that corresponds to these documents is ''SO Allocated''.
*Kit assembly documents (for kit items): The system will deduct the quantities of the item used for kit production (according to unreleased kit assembly documents) from the available quantity of the item. If items are listed on disassembly documents, their quantities (with disassembly coefficients taken into account) will be added to the available quantities.
*:The item plan that corresponds to these documents is ''Kit Assembly Demand''.
*Back orders: The system will deduct the following from the available quantity of an item:
**The quantities of the item included in sales orders with the ''Back Order'' status 
**The unallocated quantities of the item (those that are unavailable at the specified warehouses or warehouse locations) included in ''On Hold'', ''Credit Hold'', ''Rejected'', ''Pending Approval'', and ''Open'' sales orders of the ''SA'' order type
*:The item plan that corresponds to these documents is ''SO Back Ordered''.

The plan types that correspond to the following documents increase the available quantity of a stock item if the plan types are selected for an availability calculation rule selected for the applicable item class:[anchor|#_db03cc5e-2833-422e-82cb-b3005bbaffd2]
*Inventory receipts: The system will add the quantities of the item included in unreleased inventory receipts to the available quantity of the item.
*:The item plan that corresponds to these documents is ''IN Receipts''.
*Two-step inventory transfers: The system will add the quantities of the item included in unreleased incoming two-step inventory transfers (that are not yet received at the destination warehouses) to the available quantity of the item.
*:The item plan that corresponds to these documents is ''In-Transit''.
*Purchase receipts: The system will add the quantities of the item included in unreleased purchase receipts to the available quantity of the item.
*:The item plan that corresponds to these documents is ''PO Receipts''.
*Prepared purchase orders: The system will add the quantities of the item included in purchase orders with the ''On Hold'' or ''Pending Approval'' status to the available quantity of the item.
*:The item plan that corresponds to these documents is ''Purchase Prepared''.
*Purchase orders: The system will add the quantities of the item included in open purchase orders to the available quantity of the item.
*:The item plan that corresponds to these documents is ''Purchase Orders''.
*Kit assembly documents (for kit items): The system will add the quantities of the kits assembled and included in the unreleased kit assembly documents to the available quantity of the item. The quantities of disassembled kits (according to the kit assembly documents) will be deducted from the quantity available.
*:The item plan that corresponds to these documents is ''Kit Assembly Supply''.

Suppose that you, as an implementation manager, are configuring inventory for the SweetLife company, which produces and sells bottled juice. Before adding inventory items to the system, you need to create item classes for all items and specify availability calculation policies for each class of items. {br}

Further suppose that for juice, your company does not use kit assemblies and back orders, so you do not need to deduct these quantities from an available quantity of juice. Also, the company treats quantities on prepared sales orders (that is, sales orders that are not open yet) as available quantities. Additionally, your company provides its customers with the ability to return unused bottles of juice and you regard these bottles as available quantities. {br}

You will create an availability calculation rule that will reflect this availability calculation policy.
==System Preparation==
Before you start creating an availability calculation rule, you perform the following instructions:[anchor|#_908e2f15-c5b7-449c-96c5-90a38d5afca5]
#In a new tenant, create a company and specify basic settings, as described in [HelpRoot_Implement\config_Basic_Company_GeneralInfo|Company Without Branches: General Information].
#Specify the appropriate inventory settings, as described in [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\config_InvMgmt_Basic_Implem_Activity|Order Management with Inventory Configuration: Implementation Activity].
((({S:Warn}If you have not configured a company with basic settings and you want to practice creating an availability calculation rule, you can perform the activity in this topic by using the ''U100'' data set.
)))
==Step: Creating an Availability Calculation Rule==
To create an availability calculation rule that meets the criteria described above, you do the following:[anchor|#_98706806-bc32-420c-85e5-443cd895f74d][anchor|#_813c0f8d-d813-4b4b-881c-624898029e16]
#Sign in to the company you have prepared with the ''admin'' login.
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_15_00|Availability Calculation Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201500|IN201500]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record'''.
#Specify the following settings:
#*'''Availability Calculation Rule''': ''JUICE''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Juice Availability</tt>
#*'''Deduct Qty. on Issues''': Selected
#*'''Deduct Qty. on Sales Prepared''': Selected
#*'''Deduct Qty. on Sales Orders''': Selected
#*'''Deduct Qty. Shipped''': Selected
#*'''Deduct Qty. Allocated''': Selected
#*'''Include Qty. on Sales Returns''': Selected
#Clear all other check boxes.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save''' to save the availability calculation rule.

Now that you have created the availability calculation rule, you can create any number of item classes, as described in [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Item_Classes_Implem_Activity|Item Classes for Stock Items: Implementation Activity]. For the full list of inventory entities to be created, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\InvMgmt_con_Preparing_Inventory|Preparing Inventory Entities].]]></column>

Some of these default values can be overridden for individual items, if needed. The item class is a required setting for a stock item.{br}

In the following sections, you will read about item classes for stock items in Acumatica ERP.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_vs3_n5b_hhb]
*Prepare the system for the creation of item classes
*Create item classes for stock items

==Applicable Scenarios==
You create item classes in the following cases:[anchor|#ul_ug3_s5b_hhb]
*When you are initially configuring inventory in Acumatica ERP
*When your organization is going to sell a new type of goods whose shared settings are different than those specified in existing item classes

==Information Provided by an Item Class==
Each item class created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form can include information about the following:[anchor|#_65212b60-1b91-4af1-b2da-e30cd724a24a]
*The default settings that the item class provides to items of the class, most of which you can change later by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form. For details, see [[#_9e658006-b406-451d-bed2-ad6ea6d0aca4|Default Settings for Inventory Items].
*The availability calculation rule that applies to the items of the item class, if the item class groups stock items. For details, see [[#_63b3a549-060a-441e-a27f-9f82fdecfdeb|Availability Calculation Rules in an Item Class].
*The method of demand calculation for the replenishment of items that are grouped by the item class. For more information, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Automated_Replenishment|Automated Replenishment].
*The configuration of custom attributes that items might have, such as color and size. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Inventory_Item_Attributes|Inventory Item Attributes].

You can specify a default item class for stock items in the '''Default Stock Item Class''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form. If you do, the system will copy the settings of the default item class to newly created stock item classes and stock items. You can override any of these settings.[anchor|#_9e658006-b406-451d-bed2-ad6ea6d0aca4]
==Default Settings for Inventory Items==
When you select an item class for a stock item you are creating, the system copies the following default settings from the item class:[anchor|#_99dba38b-2c3c-4943-a520-f4600d13ea2a]
*Item type
*Valuation method
*Tax category
*Posting class
*Lot/Serial class
*Default warehouse
*Units of measure
*Attributes
*Replenishment settings

You can plan item classes so that they aggregate as much information as possible about groups of similar inventory items, including the posting classes. If you configure the item classes in this way, you may be able to specify a minimum of information for individual inventory items during manual data entry or import—for example, only '''Inventory ID''', '''Description''', and '''Item Class'''—while the rest of the information will be automatically populated based on the selected item class.[anchor|#_63b3a549-060a-441e-a27f-9f82fdecfdeb]
==Availability Calculation Rules in an Item Class==
The system tracks the on-hand quantity of items in inventory and calculates the available quantities of items, which can be used for inventory planning and replenishment. In the availability calculation settings, you can include in the available quantity (or exclude from the available quantity) goods in various stages of the purchasing or sales process. The availability calculation rule is defined at the item class level and cannot be changed for particular items. For more information, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Availability_Calculation_Rules_GeneralInfo|Availability Calculation: General Information].]]></column>

In the following implementation activity, you will learn how to create an item class with basic settings.
==Story==
Suppose that you, as an implementation manager, are configuring inventory for the SweetLife company, which produces and sells bottled juice. All juice items will have similar settings, so you will create an item class to provide these settings to the items (which you will create later).
==System Preparation==
Before you start creating an item class for a stock item, perform the following instructions:[anchor|#_3ee87808-e0f0-41b7-8bf6-c7193b24b807]
#In a new tenant, create a company and specify its basic settings, as described in [HelpRoot_Implement\config_Basic_Company_GeneralInfo|Company Without Branches: General Information].
#Make sure that the ''EXEMPT'' tax category has been created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\TX_20_55_00|Tax Categories] ([~/?ScreenId=TX205500|TX205500]) form or create this tax category as described in &lt;Topic&gt;.
#Specify the appropriate inventory settings, as described in [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\config_InvMgmt_Basic_Implem_Activity|Order Management with Inventory Configuration: Implementation Activity].
#Create the ''JUICE'' posting class, as described in [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Posting_Classes_Implem_Activity|Posting Classes: Implementation Activity].
#Create units of measure and conversion rules, as described in [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\UOMs_Implem_Activity|Units of Measure: Implementation Activity].
#Create the ''JUICE'' availability calculation rule, as described in [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Availability_Calculation_Rules_Implem_Activity|Availability Calculation Rules: Implementation Activity].
((({S:Warn}If you have not configured a company with basic settings and you want to practice creating an item class, you can perform the activity in this topic by using the ''U100'' data set. If you do this, you should use the ''FDI'' posting class and the ''FOOD'' availability calculation rule instead of the ''JUICE'' posting class and the ''JUICE'' availability calculation rule.
)))
==Step: Creating an Item Class==
You create an item class for juices as follows:[anchor|#_bf70e707-ed63-4b02-bec4-ad53976acf03][anchor|#_f3c0cc55-e8f5-4b5d-907e-f016e76dd1dd]
#Sign in to the company you have prepared with the ''admin'' login.
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record'''.
#In the Summary area, specify the following settings:
#*'''Class ID''': <tt>BOTJUICE</tt>
#*'''Description''': <tt>Bottled Juice</tt>
#On the '''General Settings''' tab, in the '''General Settings '''section, specify the following settings:
#*'''Stock Item''': Selected
#*'''Item Type''': ''Finished Good''
#* '''Valuation Method''': ''Average''
#* '''Tax Category''': ''EXEMPT''
#* '''Posting Class''': ''JUICE''
#* '''Availability Calculation Rule''': ''JUICE''
#In the '''Units of Measure''' section of the tab, in the '''Base Unit''' box, select ''LITER''.
#Make sure that the '''Divisible Unit''' to the right of the '''Base Unit''' box is selected.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

Now that you have created the item class for juice, you can create stock items to which the item class will be assigned, as described in [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Stock_Items_Implem_Activity|Stock Items: Implementation Activity].

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Item Classes for Stock Items: Implementation Activity In the following implementation activity, you will learn how to create an item class                 with basic settings. Story Suppose that you, as an implementation manager, are configuring inventory for the                 SweetLife company, which produces and sells bottled juice. All juice items will have                 similar settings, so you will create an item class to provide these settings to the                 items (which you will create later). System Preparation Before you start creating an item class for a stock item, perform the following                 instructions: In a new tenant, create a company and specify its basic settings, as described                     in  Company Without Branches: General Information. Make sure that the  EXEMPT  tax category has been created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=TX205500|TX205500]) Tax Categories (TX205500) form or create this tax category as                     described in <Topic>. Specify the appropriate inventory settings, as described in  Order Management with Inventory Configuration: Implementation Activity. Create the  JUICE  posting class, as described in  Posting Classes: Implementation Activity. Create units of measure and conversion rules, as described in  Units of Measure: Implementation Activity. Create the  JUICE  availability calculation rule, as described in  Availability Calculation Rules: Implementation Activity. If you have not configured a company with basic settings and you want to practice                 creating an item class, you can perform the activity in this topic by using the                      U100  data set. If you do this, you should use the  FDI  posting                 class and the  FOOD  availability calculation rule instead of the  JUICE                  posting class and the  JUICE  availability calculation rule. Step: Creating an Item Class You create an item class for juices as follows: Sign in to the company you have prepared with the                  admin  login. Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000) form. On the form toolbar, click  Add New Record . In the Summary area, specify the following settings: Class ID :  BOTJUICE Description :  Bottled                             Juice On the  General Settings  tab, in the  General                         Settings  section, specify the following settings: Stock Item : Selected Item Type :  Finished Good Valuation Method :  Average Tax Category :  EXEMPT Posting Class :  JUICE Availability Calculation Rule :  JUICE In the  Units of Measure  section of the tab, in the                          Base Unit  box, select  LITER . Make sure that the  Divisible Unit  to the right of the                          Base Unit  box is selected. On the form toolbar, click  Save . Now that you have created the item class for juice, you can create stock items to                 which the item class will be assigned, as described in  Stock Items: Implementation Activity. For the full list of inventory                 entities to be created, see  Preparing Inventory Entities. ]]></column>

Stock items are goods that you either purchase from vendors or manufacture, and then sell to customers. In Acumatica ERP, you create stock items by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, which is available if the ''Inventory'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

In the following sections, you can find information about stock items in Acumatica ERP.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_g52_qqf_ghb]
*Prepare the system for the creation of stock items
*Create stock items

==Applicable Scenarios==
You may need to create a stock item in the following cases:[anchor|#ul_env_32l_fhb]
*When you are initially configuring inventory entities and settings
*When you are going to sell or purchase new goods that have not been defined in the system

==Item Classes for Stock Items==
Before you start creating stock items in the system, you need to create item classes that group items with similar settings by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form. The system copies the following settings from an item class when you create a stock item and select this item class:[anchor|#_99dba38b-2c3c-4943-a520-f4600d13ea2a]
*Item type
*Valuation method
*Tax category
*Posting class
*Lot/Serial class
*Default warehouse
*Units of measure
*Attributes
*Replenishment settings

You can change any of these settings for a particular stock item.{br}

For more information about item classes, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Item_Classes_GeneralInfo|Item Classes for Stock Items: General Information].
==Types of Stock Items==
When you are creating a stock item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, you specify an item type, which is used for informational purposes only. The type can be one of the following:[anchor|#ul_kxz_55f_wr]
*''Finished Good'': You use this type for finished goods that you sell to customers.
*''Component Part'': You can use this type for component items from which intermediate assemblies and finished goods are produced during kit assembly processes.
*''Subassembly'': You can use this type for intermediate assemblies from which finished goods are produced during kit assembly processes.

==Transactions with Stock Items==
After you have created stock items in the system and configured their settings, you can start processing transactions. As you process documents, the system generates the proper inventory transactions and the corresponding AP and AR documents.{br}

Stock items cannot be manually selected in AR invoices. In AP bills, you can select stock items; however, the AP documents can be released only after all lines with stock items have been linked to the corresponding lines of the purchase receipts that have been released.((({S:Warn}You cannot delete a stock item in the system if there are any completed transactions with the item, any unreleased documents that include this item, or any nonzero quantity of the item at any warehouse location.
)))
==Stock Item Tracking==
The system automatically tracks stock items and maintains availability data: how many base units (that is, units in the base unit of measure selected for the particular stock item) are on hand, how many are ordered from vendors, and how many are booked to sales orders and shipments. To configure how exactly this availability data is computed you create an availability calculation rule and specify the rule in the settings of an item class. Availability of all items of the same class is calculated by using the same rule. (That is, you cannot change an availability calculation rule for a particular item.) For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Availability_Calculation_Rules_GeneralInfo|Availability Calculation: General Information].{br}

Stock items are also tracked by their cost. Various valuation methods are available for tracking item costs (for details, see[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Item_Costs_and_Valuation_Methods|Item Costs and Valuation Methods]). Typically, a stock item is an asset until it is sold; its cost then becomes an expense.{br}

Also, the system automatically monitors when the stock level of the item falls below the defined minimum and automatically calculates the quantities required to replenish the stock, based on the demand for the item and the inventory information you have defined for the stock item. For details, see[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Automated_Replenishment|Automated Replenishment].]]></column>

When you define each stock item in the system, you should specify the units of measure (UOMs) in which the item will be tracked in a warehouse and specified in documents. In the following sections, you can find information about units of measure for stock items.{br}{TOC}
==UOMs for Stock Items==
If the ''Multiple Units of Measure'' feature is not enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can use one UOM for each stock item. The system uses this UOM, called the ''base UOM'', to track item quantities in the system and calculate item costs. The base UOM, which is a required setting for a stock item, is specified in the '''Units of Measure''' section of the '''General Settings''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form.{br}

If the ''Multiple Units of Measure'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form, you can add multiple UOMs that can be applied to the same stock item, and users can specify item quantities in these UOMs in sales and purchase documents. If your organization typically sells the item in a particular UOM, in the '''Units of Measure''' section on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form, you can specify this UOM in the '''Sales Unit''' box, and the system will use this UOM by default on sales orders. If your organization typically purchases the item in a particular UOM, in the '''Units of Measure''' section on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form, you can specify this UOM in the '''Purchase Unit''' box, and the system will use this UOM by default on purchase documents.{br}

If sales or purchase UOMs differ from the base UOM, you have to specify conversion rules in the '''Units of Measure''' section on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form so that the system can recalculate the item quantities specified in sales and purchase documents to the base UOM.{br}

You can add specific prices for sales and purchase UOMs of an item. For details, see [HelpRoot_PricesAndDiscounts\PriceDiscount_Reviewing_Sales_Prices_GeneralInfo|Sales Prices: General Information] and [HelpRoot_PricesAndDiscounts\PriceDiscount_Reviewing_Vendor_Prices_GeneralInfo|Vendor Prices: General Information].{br}

If the item can be sold or purchased in UOMs that are not the base, sales, or purchase units, you should make sure that these UOMs have been added to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) form and that conversion rules between the base UOM and these UOMs have been added to this form before you use the item with these UOMs in transactions. For more information about conversion rules, see [[#_2b2f0ac2-a287-4a74-8eb4-70dbea077777|Conversion Rules].{br}

You can configure units of measure (UOMs) for items that can be measured only in quantities that are integers. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Stock_Items_Not_Divisible_UOMs|Stock Items: Units of Measure That Are Not Divisible].
==Basic Process of UOM Configuration==
When the ''Multiple Units of Measure'' feature is disabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the process of configuring UOMs for stock items is the following:[anchor|#_d58d5610-3afd-420b-a23b-df0bf18a6a61]
#You add system-wide UOMs by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) form if these UOMs will be used for multiple items.
#You specify the default base UOM when creating each item class for items on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form by selecting a system-wide UOM or by entering a new UOM that is specific to the item class.
#:((({S:Warn}If you enter a new UOM on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] form, the system does not copy this UOM to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] form.
)))
#Optional: You change the default base UOM when creating an item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form by selecting a system-wide UOM or by entering a new UOM that is specific to the item.
#:((({S:Warn}If you enter a new UOM on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form, the system copies this UOM to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] form.
)))
[anchor|#_788b67e9-65bb-4801-b40c-34dff40b2cc9]
==Base Unit Selection==
When the ''Multiple Units of Measure'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can sell or purchase a stock item in multiple UOMs. In this case, you need to select the appropriate base UOM to simplify calculations of the item quantities in the system. For each item, we recommend that you select a base UOM that is the smallest unit you would ever use when tracking, buying, or selling the item, so that you can avoid any data inconsistencies caused by rounding.{br}

For example, suppose that your organization purchases and stores canned juice in boxes of 12 cans, and you select a box as the base unit for this item. If sales managers then decided to sell juice by cans, they would need to specify quantities in decimals or define the sales unit as 0.0833333 (one-twelfth) of the base unit.{br}

Further suppose that two customers want to buy 5 cans each. In both cases, the sales order would specify 0.417 units (5 &#42; 0.0833333), and each customer would get 5 cans. However, the remaining 0.166 units don&rsquo;t equate to two cans actually left in the box. During a financial period, in a warehouse, these rounding problems could cause a significant discrepancy between the quantities on the books and the physical quantities.{br}

Inappropriately selected base UOMs may cause incorrect situations during physical inventory because counting is performed in base units. If the base unit for the product is not the smallest UOM applicable to the item, employees involved in counting may encounter difficulties. In the example with the canned juice, counting only boxes can result in an incorrect total number of cans because some of the boxes may not be full. In this example, we recommend that you select a can as the base UOM for the canned juice item.[anchor|#_2b2f0ac2-a287-4a74-8eb4-70dbea077777]
==Conversion Rules==
If the same item can be measured in multiple UOMs, you should define conversion rules between these UOMs so that the system can recalculate item quantities to the base UOM of the item. For global UOMs, you add conversion rules to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) form. If you specify different UOMs for base, sales, and purchase units for an item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, you need to add conversion rules for the sales and purchase UOMs with respect to the base UOM on this form.{br}

Before you define conversion rules for UOMs, you must make sure that the decimal precision specified in the '''Decimal Precision''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) form corresponds to your organization's rounding policy for the base currency.{br}

In conversion rules, you use the operations of multiplication and division and the conversion factor, which is a number the system uses to convert one UOM to another UOM. For example, suppose that your organization purchases bottled lemonade in containers and sells lemonade by boxes and containers. The base UOM for lemonade is ''BOTTLE''. The ''BOX'' UOM contains 10 bottles. The ''CONTAINER'' UOM includes six boxes or 60 bottles. The conversion rules between these UOMs are listed in the following table.[anchor|#_6c4b685f-f291-4242-a5f6-3de5d1c2c738]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="25%" ! From Unit
!width="25%" ! Multiply/Divide
!width="25%" ! Conversion Factor
!width="25%" ! To Unit 
|- 
| ''BOX''
|  ''Multiply''
| <tt>10</tt>
| ''BOTTLE''

|  ''Multiply''
| <tt>60</tt>
| ''BOTTLE''
|- 
|  ''CONTAINER''
|  ''Multiply''
| <tt>6</tt>
| ''BOX''
|}
The conversion rules are not reversible—that is, the system cannot use the rule in the first row of the table above to recalculate the quantity specified in bottles to the quantity specified in containers. To convert bottles to boxes and containers, you need to add the conversion rules listed in the following table.[anchor|#_2853510f-eb56-46c1-9e37-75b6f867ac7c]

If your organization typically sells the item in a particular UOM, in the            Units of Measure  section on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form, you can specify this UOM in the  Sales Unit          box, and the system will use this UOM by default on sales orders. If your organization         typically purchases the item in a particular UOM, in the  Units of           Measure  section on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form, you         can specify this UOM in the  Purchase Unit  box, and the system will         use this UOM by default on purchase documents. If sales or purchase UOMs differ from the base UOM, you have to specify conversion rules in         the  Units of Measure  section on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form so that the system can recalculate the item quantities specified in         sales and purchase documents to the base UOM. You can add specific prices for sales and purchase UOMs of an item. For details, see  Sales Prices: General Information and  Vendor Prices: General Information. If the item can be sold or purchased in UOMs that are not the base, sales, or purchase         units, you should make sure that these UOMs have been added to the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) Units of Measure (CS203100) form and that conversion rules between         the base UOM and these UOMs have been added to this form before you use the item with these         UOMs in transactions. For more information about conversion rules, see  Conversion Rules Conversion Rules. You can configure units of measure (UOMs) for items that can be measured only in quantities         that are integers. For details, see  Stock Items: Units of Measure That Are Not Divisible. Basic Process of UOM Configuration When the  Multiple Units of Measure  feature is disabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, the process of configuring UOMs for stock items         is the following: You add system-wide UOMs by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) Units of Measure           (CS203100) form if these UOMs will be used for multiple items. You specify the default base UOM when creating each item class for items on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000) form by selecting a system-wide UOM or           by entering a new UOM that is specific to the item class. If you enter a new UOM on             the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes form, the system does not copy this UOM             to the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) Units of Measure form. Optional: You change the default base UOM when creating an item on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form by selecting a system-wide UOM           or by entering a new UOM that is specific to the item. If you enter a new UOM on the                 ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form, the system copies this UOM to the                 ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) Units of Measure form. Base Unit Selection When the  Multiple Units of Measure  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, you can sell or purchase a stock item in         multiple UOMs. In this case, you need to select the appropriate base UOM to simplify         calculations of the item quantities in the system. For each item, we recommend that you         select a base UOM that is the smallest unit you would ever use when tracking, buying, or         selling the item, so that you can avoid any data inconsistencies caused by rounding. For example, suppose that your organization purchases and stores canned juice in boxes of         12 cans, and you select a box as the base unit for this item. If sales managers then decided         to sell juice by cans, they would need to specify quantities in decimals or define the sales         unit as 0.0833333 (one-twelfth) of the base unit. Further suppose that two customers want to buy 5 cans each. In both cases, the sales order         would specify 0.417 units (5 * 0.0833333), and each customer would get 5 cans. However, the         remaining 0.166 units don't equate to two cans actually left in the box. During a financial         period, in a warehouse, these rounding problems could cause a significant discrepancy         between the quantities on the books and the physical quantities. Inappropriately selected base UOMs may cause incorrect situations during physical inventory         because counting is performed in base units. If the base unit for the product is not the         smallest UOM applicable to the item, employees involved in counting may encounter         difficulties. In the example with the canned juice, counting only boxes can result in an         incorrect total number of cans because some of the boxes may not be full. In this example,         we recommend that you select a can as the base UOM for the canned juice item. Conversion Rules If the same item can be measured in multiple UOMs, you should define conversion rules between                 these UOMs so that the system can recalculate item quantities to the base UOM of the                 item. For global UOMs, you add conversion rules to the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) Units of Measure (CS203100) form. If you                 specify different UOMs for base, sales, and purchase units for an item on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form, you need                 to add conversion rules for the sales and purchase UOMs with respect to the base UOM                 on this form. Before you define conversion rules for UOMs, you must make sure that the decimal precision                 specified in the  Decimal Precision  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) Companies (CS101500) form corresponds to your                 organization's rounding policy for the base currency. In conversion rules, you use the operations of multiplication and division and the conversion                 factor, which is a number the system uses to convert one UOM to another UOM. For                 example, suppose that your organization purchases bottled lemonade in containers and                 sells lemonade by boxes and containers. The base UOM for lemonade is  BOTTLE .                 The  BOX  UOM contains 10 bottles. The  CONTAINER  UOM includes six boxes                 or 60 bottles. The conversion rules between these UOMs are listed in the following                 table. From Unit Multiply/Divide Conversion Factor To Unit  BOX Multiply 10 BOTTLE CONTAINER Multiply 60 BOTTLE CONTAINER Multiply 6 BOX The conversion rules are not reversible—that is, the system cannot use the rule in the first row                 of the table above to recalculate the quantity specified in bottles to the quantity                 specified in containers. To convert bottles to boxes and containers, you need to add                 the conversion rules listed in the following table. From Unit Multiply/Divide Conversion Factor To Unit  BOTTLE Divide 10 BOX BOTTLE Divide 60 CONTAINER ]]></column>

For stock items, you can configure units of measure (UOMs) for items that can be measured only in integer quantities, as described in the following sections. Defining of UOMs that are not divisible helps to eliminate errors in inventory, sales, and purchase documents.{br}{TOC}
==Units of Measure That Are Not Divisible==
To specify that a UOM of a stock item is not divisible, you clear the '''Divisible Unit''' check box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]). If the ''Multiple Units of Measure'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can manage the value of this check box for base, sales, and purchase UOMs of the stock item separately.{br}

Users can add decimal quantities of the item to inventory, sales, and purchase documents when the check box is selected for all three UOMs (if the ''Multiple Units of Measure'' feature is enabled) or for the base UOM (if the ''Multiple Units of Measure'' feature is disabled).
==Base UOMs That Are Not Divisible==
For a stock item, when the '''Divisible Unit''' check box is cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form for the base UOM, users can specify only integer quantities of this item in the base UOM in the following documents:[anchor|#_4fc8a03f-6992-4d82-8bf5-824ad7884f50]
*Inventory documents (issues, receipts, transfers, and adjustments)
*Shipments
*SO invoices
*Purchase receipts

The system validates the quantities in these documents, making sure that they are integers, anddisplays an error message if they are not. A document with decimal quantities cannot be saved until the user corrects the quantity.{br}

When a user attempts to create a shipment from a sales order in which stock item quantities are specified in non-base UOMs and the base UOM is not divisible, the system converts these UOMs to the base UOM and checks whether each quantity is an integer. If a quantity is not an integer, an error message is displayed, and the shipment is not created or is created on hold, depending on the state of the '''Hold Shipments on Entry''' check box specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form. {br}

When a user attempts to create a receipt for a purchase order and the base UOM is not divisible, the system checks whether each quantity in the base UOM is an integer (in the same way as it does for shipments). If a quantity is not an integer, an error message is displayed, and the receipt is created with the ''On Hold'' or ''Balanced'' status, depending on the state of the '''Hold Receipts On Entry''' check box specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form.{br}

The system performs validation of quantities in base UOMs on the following forms:[anchor|#_586d0ed3-7406-4778-90da-8c867b8dddb7]
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_30_00|Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=IN303000|IN303000])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000])

*[HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000])

==Sales UOMs That Are Not Divisible==
For a stock item, when the '''Divisible Unit''' check box is cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form for the sales UOM, users can specify only integer quantities of the item in the sales UOM in sales orders, shipments, and SO invoices. If the item can be sold in other UOMs, the system validates the quantity of each item converted to the sales UOM to be sure that it is an integer.{br}

For drop-ship sales, the system does not validate each item quantity to be sure that it is an integer if the '''Divisible Unit''' check box is cleared for any of the UOMs.{br}

The system performs validation of quantities in sales UOMs on the following forms:[anchor|#_4e0a19c9-03ab-4421-b002-2ddf8b330056]
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000])

As an example of the use of a sales UOM that is not divisible, suppose that an organization sells lemonade wholesale by boxes of 10 bottles. Sales managers cannot sell less than a box of lemonade (even if they specify the quantity in bottles when entering a sales order). Suppose also that on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, the sales UOM for lemonade is ''BOX10'' and the '''Divisible Unit''' check box for this UOM is cleared. Further suppose that a sales manager has received an order from a customer for 15 bottles of lemonade. The manager creates a sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form and adds 1.5 boxes of lemonade to the document. The system displays an error message, and the sales manager cannot save this sales order without specifying a quantity that is an integer.
==Purchase UOMs That Are Not Divisible==
For a stock item, when the '''Divisible Unit''' check box is cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form for the purchase UOM, users can specify only integer quantities of the item in the purchase UOM in purchase orders and receipts. If the item can be purchased in other UOMs, the system does not validate the quantity of the item converted to the purchase UOM to be sure that it is an integer.{br}

The system performs validation of quantities in purchase UOMs on the following forms:[anchor|#_d4d4c75e-9ed3-46ce-b475-cff81fb68e16]
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000])

==Story==
Suppose that in Acumatica ERP, you, as an implementation manager, are configuring inventory for the SweetLife company, which produces and sells bottled juice. The company sells orange juice in bottles of 0.5 liter and 1 liter. You will create two stock items for these bottles of orange juice.
==System Preparation==
Before you start creating stock items, you perform the following instructions:[anchor|#_78e5a932-29ad-42b2-ae9e-d175142134d5]
#In a new tenant, create a company and specify its basic settings, as described in [HelpRoot_Implement\config_Basic_Company_GeneralInfo|Company Without Branches: General Information].
#Specify the appropriate inventory settings, as described in [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\config_InvMgmt_Basic_Implem_Activity|Order Management with Inventory Configuration: Implementation Activity].
#Create the ''BOTJUICE'' item class, as described in [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Item_Classes_Implem_Activity|Item Classes for Stock Items: Implementation Activity].
((({S:Warn}If you have not configured a company with basic settings and you want to practice creating a stock item, you can perform the activity in this topic by using the ''U100'' data set. In this case, you should create the <tt>ORJUICE</tt> stock item instead of the two stock items mentioned in the activity and use the ''JAM'' item class instead of the ''BOTJUICE'' item class.
)))
==Step: Creating Stock Items==
To create the stock items for both bottles of orange juice, do the following:[anchor|#ol_tdn_zp5_rr][anchor|#_a1c92ef6-377c-4948-a4b1-b2300009ed67]
#Sign in to the company you have prepared with the ''admin'' login.
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form.
#Do the following to create a stock item for the smaller bottle of orange juice:
##On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record'''.
##In the Summary area, specify the following settings:
##*'''Inventory ID''': <tt>ORJUICE05</tt>
##*'''Item Status''': ''Active''
##* '''Description''': <tt>Orange juice in bottles of 0.5L</tt>
##On the '''General Settings''' tab, do the following:
###In the '''Item Class''' box, select ''BOTJUICE''.
###In the '''Base Unit''' box, select ''BTL05''.
###Make sure that the '''Divisible Unit''' to the right of the '''Base Unit''' box is selected.
###Make sure that the following settings have been copied from the item class: the item type, the valuation method, the tax category, and the posting class.
##On the '''GL Accounts''' tab, make sure that the accounts have been copied from the ''JUICE'' posting class.
##On the form toolbar, click '''Save''' to save this item.
#Do the following to create a stock item for the larger bottle of juice:
##On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record'''.
##In the Summary area, specify the following settings:
##*'''Inventory ID''': <tt>ORJUICE1L</tt>
##*'''Item Status''': ''Active''
##* '''Description''': <tt>Orange juice in bottles of 1L</tt>
##On the '''General Settings''' tab, do the following:
###In the '''Item Class''' box, select ''BOTJUICE''.
###In the '''Base Unit''' box, select ''BTL1L''.
###Make sure that the '''Divisible Unit''' to the right of the '''Base Unit''' box is selected.
###Make sure that the following settings have been copied from the item class: the item type, the valuation method, the tax category, and the posting class.
##On the '''GL Accounts''' tab, make sure that accounts have been copied from the ''JUICE'' posting class.
##On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

Now that you have created the stock items for orange juice, you can include the juice bottles in documents.]]></column>

Lot numbers and serial numbers are used to track certain types of inventory items as they are received, stored, manufactured, and shipped. Some products, such as food products and chemical compounds, are tracked by lot because they have expiration dates, while other products, such as medications, are tracked because laws require manufacturers to keep accurate records about their distribution. Still other products—such as electronics, appliances, and cars—must be tracked individually from the manufacturer to the consumer because of safety and warranty issues, so serial numbers are used for tracking them.{br}

If the ''Lot and Serial Tracking'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can set up the tracking of stock items by lot or serial number, as well as by expiration date.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#_9b6a93b8-5cdb-43f8-a3a3-d976ae046fc4]
*Configure the tracking of items with lot and serial numbers
*Process purchase and sales documents that contain lot- and serial-tracked items

==Applicable Scenarios==
You may need to use items with lot or serial numbers in the following cases:[anchor|#_ae21df4c-0c47-4502-8dc8-66f4a2a1262b]
*When your organization purchases items with serial numbers provided by vendors and you need to track these items by the serial numbers in a warehouse
*When your organization accepts returns or replacements of serialized items that it has sold
*When your organization provides services (such as installation or repair) for serialized items that it has sold
*When a vendor from which your organization buys items sells them in lots and provides lot numbers and expiration dates for each lot, which you want to track for the items
*When your organization sells items in lots and it is important to keep the assigned lot number tracked in the sales documents
*When your organization sells items with an expiration date and issues items based on this date

==Items with Serial Numbers==
A serial number is a unique number that identifies a single item of stock, such as a camera, DVD player, or bicycle.{br}

Serial numbers can be generated by the system. This can be useful if items to be assigned to serial numbers are produced by your organization or are supplied by a vendor and the items do not have serial numbers assigned by the vendor.{br}

Alternatively, you can manually assign a serial number to each item so that the system reflects the numbers provided by a vendor. The settings that control the tracking of a serialized item are specified by the serial class assigned to the item.
==Items with Lot Numbers==
A lot number is a unique identification code assigned to a specific quantity or ''lot'' of items. The same lot number is assigned to every item of the particular lot.((({S:Hint}Lot numbers can be tracked only for quantities of items in base units.
)))
You can either enter a lot number manually (if it is provided by a vendor) or configure the automatic generation of lot numbers for items that are produced by your organization or are not supplied by vendor&rsquo;s lot numbers. The settings that control the tracking of items by lots are specified by the lot class assigned to the items.[anchor|#_cd533b55-15b4-4587-a4bd-28d8caa23753]
==Lot and Serial Classes==
The settings that control the tracking of items by lot and serial numbers are specified for a lot or serial class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_70_00|Lot/Serial Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) form. When the ''Lot and Serial Tracking'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the preconfigured ''DEFAULT'' class is displayed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_70_00|Lot/Serial Classes] form. This item class is used for items that are not tracked by lot and serial numbers. For item classes and items that have been created before the feature was enabled, the system inserts this class automatically.{br}

When you are creating a lot or serial class, you specify the following:[anchor|#_ede18b8d-3dd3-4610-952a-5d795fee26fb]
*Tracking method: This method defines whether the class provides settings for non-tracked items, for serialized items, or for items tracked by lot numbers.
*Whether an expiration date must be tracked: You can configure the system so that it requires an expiration date to be entered for an item of the class when it is received.
*Assignment method: This method defines when the lot or serial number should be assigned to an item of the class: on item receipt or on item issue.
*Issue method: This method defines the order in which items of the class must be issued from a warehouse.
*Settings for the generation of lot or serial numbers: You can configure the system so that it generates lot or serial numbers automatically for items of the class; you can also specify the structure of automatically generated numbers.

For more information on the settings of a lot or serial class, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Lot_and_Serial_Numbers_Class_Settings|Items with Lot and Serial Numbers: Tracking Settings] and [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Lot_and_Serial_Numbers_Autonumbering_Settings|Items with Lot and Serial Numbers: Numbering Settings].
==Assignment of a Lot or Serial Class to Item Classes and Stock Items==
After you have configured lot and serial classes according to the business processes of your organization, you need to assign these classes to item classes. You also need to assign them to stock items if the items were created before you assigned lot or serial classes to the item classes assigned to the items.{br}

You specify a lot or serial class for each item class in the '''Lot/Serial Class''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form. When you create stock items and select a particular item class for which a lot or serial class is assigned, the system will copy the lot or serial class specified for the item class to the settings of the stock item. It will also insert the appropriate settings that have been specified for both the item class and the lot or serial class.{br}

If you want to change a lot or serial class for a stock item, you select another class in the '''Lot/Serial Class''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form.]]></column>

If the  Lot and Serial Tracking  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, you can set up the tracking of stock items by lot or serial number, as well     as by expiration date. Learning Objectives In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following: Configure the tracking of items with lot and serial numbers Process purchase and sales documents that contain lot- and serial-tracked items Applicable Scenarios You may need to use items with lot or serial numbers in the following cases: When your organization purchases items with serial numbers provided by vendors and you need      to track these items by the serial numbers in a warehouse When your organization accepts returns or replacements of serialized items that it has      sold When your organization provides services (such as installation or repair) for serialized      items that it has sold When a vendor from which your organization buys items sells them in lots and provides lot      numbers and expiration dates for each lot, which you want to track for the items When your organization sells items in lots and it is important to keep the assigned lot      number tracked in the sales documents When your organization sells items with an expiration date and issues items based on this      date Items with Serial Numbers A serial number is a unique number that identifies a single item of stock, such as a camera,     DVD player, or bicycle. Serial numbers can be generated by the system. This can be useful if items to be assigned to     serial numbers are produced by your organization or are supplied by a vendor and the items do     not have serial numbers assigned by the vendor. Alternatively, you can manually assign a serial number to each item so that the system     reflects the numbers provided by a vendor. The settings that control the tracking of a     serialized item are specified by the serial class assigned to the item. Items with Lot Numbers A lot number is a unique identification code assigned to a specific quantity or  lot  of     items. The same lot number is assigned to every item of the particular lot. Lot numbers can be tracked only for quantities of items in base units. You can either enter a lot number manually (if it is provided by a vendor) or configure the     automatic generation of lot numbers for items that are produced by your organization or are not     supplied by vendor's lot numbers. The settings that control the tracking of items by lots are     specified by the lot class assigned to the items. Lot and Serial Classes The settings that control the tracking of items by lot and serial numbers are specified for a     lot or serial class on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) Lot/Serial Classes (IN207000) form. When     the  Lot and Serial Tracking  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features     (CS100000) form, the preconfigured  DEFAULT  class is displayed on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) Lot/Serial Classes form. This item class is used for items that are not     tracked by lot and serial numbers. For item classes and items that have been created before the     feature was enabled, the system inserts this class automatically. When you are creating a lot or serial class, you specify the following: Tracking method: This method defines whether the class provides settings for non-tracked      items, for serialized items, or for items tracked by lot numbers. Whether an expiration date must be tracked: You can configure the system so that it requires      an expiration date to be entered for an item of the class when it is received. Assignment method: This method defines when the lot or serial number should be assigned to      an item of the class: on item receipt or on item issue. Issue method: This method defines the order in which items of the class must be issued from      a warehouse. Settings for the generation of lot or serial numbers: You can configure the system so that      it generates lot or serial numbers automatically for items of the class; you can also specify      the structure of automatically generated numbers. For more information on the settings of a lot or serial class, see  Items with Lot and Serial Numbers: Tracking Settings and  Items with Lot and Serial Numbers: Numbering Settings. Assignment of a Lot or Serial Class to Item Classes and Stock Items After you have configured lot and serial classes according to the business processes of your     organization, you need to assign these classes to item classes. You also need to assign them to     stock items if the items were created before you assigned lot or serial classes to the item     classes assigned to the items. You specify a lot or serial class for each item class in the  Lot/Serial      Class  box on the  General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000) form. When you create stock items and select a particular     item class for which a lot or serial class is assigned, the system will copy the lot or serial     class specified for the item class to the settings of the stock item. It will also insert the     appropriate settings that have been specified for both the item class and the lot or serial     class. If you want to change a lot or serial class for a stock item, you select another class in the       Lot/Serial Class  box on the  General Settings  tab     of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form. ]]></column>

A lot or serial class contains settings that define the tracking method, the method of assignment of the number, and the issue method, as well as an indicator of whether items of this class must be tracked by an expiration date.{br}{TOC}
==Tracking Methods==
With regard to lot and serial numbers, your company may track different items differently. Some stock items may not need to be tracked by a lot or serial number, other items may be tracked by lot number, and still other items may be tracked by serial number. To specify which method of tracking you will use for a lot or serial class, you select the method in the '''Tracking Method''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_70_00|Lot/Serial Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) form as follows:[anchor|#_b1ed892b-7a2a-4bba-99f2-9ca31ae53f47]
*If you are creating a class for items that should not be tracked by lot number or serial number and you do not need to track an expiration date, you select the ''Not Tracked'' method. For a class with this method selected, the system ignores all other settings of the lot/serial class. The ''DEFAULT'' class, which has this tracking method, is predefined in the system and can be used for all non-tracked items.
*If you are creating a class for tracking items by lot numbers, you select the ''Track Lot Numbers'' method.
*If you are creating a class for items that should be tracked by serial numbers, you select the ''Track Serial Numbers'' method.
((({S:Warn}You cannot change the tracking method of a lot or serial class after the class has been assigned to at least one item class or stock item.
)))
==Assignment Methods==
The assignment method of a lot or serial class defines when the lot or serial number is assigned to a stock item of the class; it can be assigned manually by a user or automatically by the system based on the lot or serial class setting). You select an assignment method in the '''Assignment Method''' box of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_70_00|Lot/Serial Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) form as follows:[anchor|#_9d2cc267-8980-4b63-8a2c-29025f1764b7]
*To begin tracking items of the class by lot or serial numbers as soon as they enter a warehouse, you select the ''When Received'' assignment method. With this method, lot or serial numbers should be assigned to items on receipt.
*To begin tracking items of the class by lot or serial numbers when the items are issued or shipped from a warehouse, you select the ''When Used'' assignment method. On the issue or shipment of an item of the class, a lot or serial number is assigned to all units of the items in the inventory issue or shipment.
((({S:Warn}You cannot change the assignment method selected for the lot or serial class to another assignment method in any of the following cases:[anchor|#_78b10085-9949-401c-b2a4-f3d9e959722d]
*If any historical transactions include any item of the class in the system
*If any unreleased documents include an item of the class in the system
*If a nonzero quantity of any item of the class is stored in a warehouse
)))
==Issue Methods==
If you have selected the ''When Received'' assignment method for a lot or serial class, you need to specify the order in which the system issues items of this class by selecting an issue method. You specify this setting in the '''Issue Method''' box of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_70_00|Lot/Serial Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) form as follows:[anchor|#_3fcd62e6-89bc-418f-90ca-eb6e95c0a698]
*If items should be picked for issue by receipt date so that the item in the warehouse the most time is picked first, you select the ''FIFO'' (first-in-first-out) method.
*If items should be picked for issue by a receipt date so that the item in the warehouse the least time is picked first, you select the ''LIFO'' (last-in-first-out) method.
*If items should be picked for issue in sequential order of their lot or serial numbers, you select the ''Sequential'' method.
*If items should be picked for issue by expiration date (earliest date first), you select the ''Expiration'' method.
*If a user should select items for issue manually, you select the ''User-Enterable'' method.

==Tracking the Expiration Date of Items==
If you need to track items in a warehouse along with their expiration date (for example, to ship or issue items expiring soonest first), you can select the '''Track Expiration Date''' check box for a lot or serial class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_70_00|Lot/Serial Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) form. (This check box is cleared and unavailable for classes with the ''Not Tracked'' tracking method.) When this check box is selected, a user who enters a receipt with the item of this class must specify an expiration date in the receipt.]]></column>

Your organization may assign lot and serial numbers to the items that it stores and sells. As such, the organization may have internal requirements for the structure of the lot and serial numbers to be assigned. In Acumatica ERP, these requirements can be supported through the use of lot and serial classes. When lot and serial numbers are provided by vendors and entered by users, the appropriate settings need to be specified for the applicable lot or serial classes.{br}

The rules for assigning lot and serial numbers are specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_70_00|Lot/Serial Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) form, as described in this topic. The appropriate lot or serial class is then assigned to each inventory item whose units have lot or serial numbers, and the class provides the default numbering settings for new items of the class.{br}{TOC}
==Structure of Lot or Serial Numbers==
For each lot or serial class, in the table of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_70_00|Lot/Serial Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) form, you can specify the structure to be used for lot or serial numbers for items of the class, so that the numbers correspond to the numbering policies of your organization. The number may consist of multiple segments, each of which can be any of the following:[anchor|#_f3a7ea00-3f68-4f3a-b478-3c814cacf33f]
*Constant: This segment is a predefined alphanumeric string to be used in all lot or serial numbers generated for items of the class.
*Date: A date-related segment is generated based on the relevant date (of receipt or usage). The part of the date to be used may be the day, the month number, the month name, a two- or four-digit year value (that is, the last two digits or all four), or a date in a custom format.
*Auto-incremental value: This segment is automatically generated when a new lot or serial number is assigned to an item. You can specify settings for the generation of the automatically incremented values, as described in the following section.

==Auto-Incremental Values==
If you want to ensure the uniqueness of lot and serial numbers in the system, we recommend that in the table on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_70_00|Lot/Serial Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) form, you add a segment of the ''Auto-Incremental Value'' type to the structure of the lot or serial numbers to be used for the lot or serial class. When segments with auto-incremental value are used, you can specify the initial number to be used.{br}

You can configure the uniqueness of the initial auto-incremental value of a lot or serial number as follows:[anchor|#_309be53b-b7e5-4928-a3d2-ba2c7dbeba26]
*To make the initial value shared by all items assigned to the lot or serial class: In the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_70_00|Lot/Serial Classes]form, you select the '''Share Auto-Incremental Value Between All Class Items''' check box; you also specify in the '''Auto-Incremental Value''' box the initial value to be used for generating new values (incremented by 1) in the segment.
*To make the initial value specific for each stock item of the lot or serial class (that is, the initial value can be the different for stock items of this class): You clear the '''Share Auto-Incremental Value Between All Class Items''' check box in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_70_00|Lot/Serial Classes] form. Then on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form for each item of the class, you specify the lot or serial class in the '''Lot/Serial Class''' box and the specific initial value for the item in the '''Auto-Incremental Value''' box.

==Assignment of Lot or Serial Numbers==
For the items of a particular lot or serial class, the lot or serial numbers can be assigned to items in any of the following ways:[anchor|#_68764d61-4634-4d64-bae3-58a628e61c5b]
*When items are received or issued, users enter numbers manually for each serialized item or for each quantity of items in a lot. This way is used when the lot or serial numbers are provided by the vendors from which your organization purchases the items, and it is important to track these items along with the assigned lot or serial numbers in the warehouse where they are stored and in the documents that track their sales and any sales returns. 
*:To configure a lot or serial class so that users enter lot or serial numbers manually for items of the class, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_70_00|Lot/Serial Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) form, you make sure that the '''Auto-Generate Next Number''' check box is cleared in the Summary area and that no segments are added to the table.
*When items are received or issued, users generate numbers manually, based on a predefined structure. 
*:To configure a lot or serial class so that users can generate lot or serial numbers manually on a receipt or shipment (depending on the class settings) for items of the class, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_70_00|Lot/Serial Classes]form, you make sure that the '''Auto-Generate Next Number''' check box is cleared in the Summary area, and you add the segments of the lot or serial number to the table. 
*:With these settings, users will be able to generate numbers in the '''Allocations''' dialog box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form (for items being received) or the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form (for items being shipped). On both forms, users invoke this dialog box by clicking '''Allocations''' on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab.
*The system generates lot or serial numbers when a user releases a purchase receipt or a shipment that includes items of the class. 
*:To configure a lot or serial class so that the system generates lot or serial numbers for items of the class, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_70_00|Lot/Serial Classes] form, you select the '''Auto-Generate Next Number''' check box in the Summary area and add the segments of the number to the table. 
*:Additionally, in the Summary area of the form, you can specify the maximum number of lot or serial numbers to be assigned at once in the '''Max. Auto-Generate Numbers''' box. If a larger quantity of the item is specified in a document, only the maximum number of lot or serial numbers will be generated, with the excess quantity remaining with unassigned numbers.

)))
==Story==
Suppose that managers in the Service and Equipment Sales Center branch of the SweetLife company have decided to track the parts for juicers that the branch purchases from the Squeezo Inc. vendor by the parts’ serial numbers in the warehouse used for equipment storage. These parts are used internally by service engineers for repairing juicers.{br}

To prepare the system for the tracking of these parts by serial numbers, you will create a serial class for tracking juicer parts, specify this class in the appropriate item class and stock item settings, and test the processing of documents with these stock items. You will also review the settings of a predefined serial class for tracking juicers, a lot class for fruits, and a lot class for jams.
==Configuration Overview==
In the ''U100'' data set, the ''Inventory'' feature in the ''Inventory and Order Management'' group of features has been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in the system:[anchor|#ul_ghb_r2d_pfb]
*Warehouse on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form: ''EQUIPHOUSE''
*An item class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form: ''OTHERPARTS''
*A stock item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form: ''EJECTOR05''
*Lot and serial classes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_70_00|Lot/Serial Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) form: ''SRNJCR'', ''LTFRT'', and '' LTJAM''

==Process Overview==
In this activity, you will do the following:[anchor|#_a91888a5-a3f1-40a2-9f13-e7a9652895e3]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, enable the ''Lot and Serial Tracking'' feature.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_70_00|Lot/Serial Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) form, create a serial class to be used for the ''EJECTOR05'' stock item.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form, select the created serial class for the ''OTHERPARTS'' item class.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, select the serial class that you have created for the ''EJECTOR05'' stock item.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) form, test the creation of an inventory receipt with the serialized items to make sure that the serial class has been defined correctly.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form, test the creation of an inventory issue with the serialized item to make sure that the serial class has been defined correctly.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_70_00|Lot/Serial Classes] form, review the settings of the ''SRNJCR'' serial class.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_70_00|Lot/Serial Classes] form, review the settings of the ''LTFRT'' lot class.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_70_00|Lot/Serial Classes] form, review the settings of the ''LTJAM'' lot class.

==System Preparation==
Before you start working with lot and serial classes, you need to launch the Acumatica ERP website and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded. To sign in as a system administrator, use the ''gibbs'' login and ''123'' password.
==Step 1: Enabling the Feature==
To be able to configure tracking of items by lot or serial classes, you enable the ''Lot and Serial Tracking'' feature as follows:[anchor|#_71fceabc-3bf7-453e-a27e-0b1b6fea8fb9]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Modify'''.
#In the ''Inventory and Order Management'' group of features, select '''Lot and Serial Tracking'''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Enable'''.

==Step 2: Creating a Serial Class==
The serial class you are creating will be used for tracking juicer parts by serial numbers from the time they are received in the warehouse. The serial numbers are provided by the vendors that supply the parts; therefore, purchasing managers will enter the numbers manually in the inventory receipt. These parts do not have an expiration date, and staff members who will use and issue the parts must select the exact part manually in documents. To create this serial class, you do the following:[anchor|#_1aa2e446-9571-445b-aedd-de37b28b45fe]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_70_00|Lot/Serial Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) form.[anchor|#_b564570b-a016-4ff0-8000-7e276fb41c4a]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record'''.
#In the Summary area, specify the following settings:
#*'''Class ID''': <tt>SRNPARTS</tt>
#*'''Description''': <tt>Class for tracking juicer parts by serial numbers</tt>
#*'''Tracking Method''': ''Track Serial Numbers''
#* '''Track Expiration Date''': Cleared
#*'''Required for Drop-ship''': Cleared
#*'''Assignment Method''': ''When Received''
#* '''Issue Method''': ''User-Enterable''
#* '''Share Auto-Incremental Value Between All Class Items''': Cleared
#*'''Auto-Generate Next Number''': Cleared[anchor|#_9a693472-2a10-45af-8abb-a982a1c69cbc]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

You have created the serial class for tracking juicer parts, and now you can specify this serial class in the settings of the item class that provides default settings for items that are juicer parts.
==Step 3: Specifying the Serial Class in the Item Class Settings==
To specify the created serial class in the settings of the ''OTHERPARTS'' item class so that all new juicer part items have this setting by default, perform the following instructions:[anchor|#_b8801052-9488-4088-b9d7-8704a460fb02]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form.
#In the '''Item Class Tree''' pane, click the ''OTHERPARTS'' item class.
#In the '''Lot/Serial Class''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the right pane, select ''SRNPARTS''.[anchor|#_2d82cc15-707e-4340-8655-714989fe511d]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

You have specified the new serial class in the settings of the item class.
==Step 4: Specifying the Serial Class in the Item Settings==
Although specifying the ''SRNPARTS'' serial class in the item class settings will cause the system to insert the serial class for all new juicer part items of the ''OTHERPARTS'' item class, the serial class must be specified in the settings of all existing items that must be tracked according to the settings of this serial class. For simplicity, you will specify the serial class in the settings of only the ''EJECTOR05'' item; all other items can be modified similarly. Do the following:[anchor|#_c0388c13-d225-42b3-bc71-f36b6e59b548]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form.
#In the '''Inventory ID''' box, select ''EJECTOR05''.
#In the '''Lot/Serial Class''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab, select ''SRNPARTS''.[anchor|#_d99ea0fc-d172-4fbb-bbb6-e8e617951031]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

==Step 5: Creating an Inventory Receipt with the Serialized Item==
To make sure that users are able to add an item of the serial class you defined to an inventory receipt and that serial numbers can be added for each unit of the item, create an inventory receipt with the serialized item as follows:[anchor|#_320894f6-a2da-48c4-987e-0628d8a733b9]
#On the company and branch selection menu, on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, select the ''Service and Equipment Sales Center'' branch.
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) form.[anchor|#_ebc90ef0-c69d-43f1-a408-535d2709a968]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record'''.
#In the '''Description''' box of the Summary area, type <tt>Receipt of serialized parts</tt>.
#On the '''Transaction Details''' tab, do the following:[anchor|#_ecc9b7de-5c1f-404b-9234-47f1d0ed4f57]
##On the table toolbar, click '''Add Row'''.
##In the '''Branch''' column, make sure that ''SWEETEQUIP'' is selected.
##In the '''Inventory ID''' box, select ''EJECTOR05''.
##In the '''Quantity''' box, type <tt>2</tt> and press Ctrl+Enter to confirm the row. The system displays a warning message.
##On the table toolbar, click '''Allocations'''.
##In the '''Allocations''' dialog box, which opens, do the following:[anchor|#_f189691b-32e2-46bc-aa11-5a06b26994bc]
###On the table toolbar, click '''Add Row'''.
###In the '''Lot/Serial Nbr.''' column, type <tt>EJ0000327</tt>.
###Press Ctrl+Enter to confirm the line.[anchor|#_f256e1f1-d3e1-4465-9c32-c8f83db177b8]
###On the table toolbar, click '''Add Row'''.
###In the '''Lot/Serial Nbr.''' column, type <tt>EJ0000330</tt>.
###Press Ctrl+Enter to confirm the line.
###In the '''Unassigned Qty.''' box of the Summary area, make sure that the value is ''0.00''. This means that you have entered serial numbers for all units of the line being allocated.
###Click '''OK''' to save your changes and close the dialog box.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the inventory receipt you have created.

You have tested the creation of an inventory receipt that includes the item with a serial number. In the next step, you will test the creation of an inventory issue that includes this item.
==Step 6: Creating an Inventory Issue with the Serialized Item==
To test whether users will be able to manually add to an inventory issue an item of the ''SRNPARTS'' serial class and that you can select its serial number from the list of previously entered numbers, perform the following instructions:[anchor|#_be9ab415-e366-489b-82db-37f992168205]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form.[anchor|#_c8dd3c7d-d7f7-41f8-9eab-eba6a222f73f]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record'''.
#In the '''Description''' box of the Summary area, type <tt>Issue of an ejector</tt>.
#On the '''Transaction Details''' tab, do the following:[anchor|#_99ba6a21-399b-45d8-8372-1269e4bb9549]
##On the table toolbar, click '''Add Row'''.
##In the '''Branch''' column, make sure that ''SWEETEQUIP'' is selected.
##In the '''Tran. Type''' column, make sure that ''Issue'' is selected.
##In the '''Inventory ID''' box, select ''EJECTOR05''.
##In the '''Quantity''' box, type <tt>1</tt>.
##In the '''Lot/Serial Nbr.''' column, select <tt>EJ0000330</tt>.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Release'''.

You have successfully issued the ejector with the ''EJ0000330'' serial number.((({S:Warn}In a production system, an inventory issue is created automatically when a user releases a shipment.
)))
==Step 7: Reviewing the Settings of the SRNJCR Serial Class==
The ''SRNJCR'' serial class has been predefined in the dataset to be used for juicers. Serial numbers for juicers are entered in a shipment because you do not need to track juicers by serial numbers in your warehouse but you need to record that a juicer with the particular serial number has been issued from the warehouse. The serial numbers for juicers are provided by the vendor, so sales managers enter the numbers manually.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_70_00|Lot/Serial Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) form, select ''SRNJCR'' in the '''Class ID '''box, and review the settings of the serial class, which are as follows:[anchor|#_f04f177b-b717-42de-9538-741f4fffa6de]
*In the '''Tracking Method''' box, ''Track Serial Numbers'' is selected. This means that this class is used for items that are tracked by serial numbers in the system.
*The '''Track Expiration Date''' box is cleared. Serialized items usually are not tracked by their expiration dates.
*The '''Required for Drop-ship''' check box is cleared. The Service and Equipment Sales Center sells only juicers stored in the warehouse; these items are not drop-shipped from the vendor to the customer.
*In the '''Assignment Method''' box, ''When Used'' is selected. With this setting, the system requires the user to enter the serial number for each unit of an item of the class which in this case will be done in shipments that include the item.
*The '''Share Auto-Incremental Value Between All Class Items''' and '''Auto-Generate Next Number''' check boxes are cleared because users enter serial numbers manually for units of an item of the class.

==Step 8: Reviewing the Settings of the LTFRT Lot Class==
The ''LTFRT'' lot class has been predefined in the dataset to be used for fruits. The fruit vendors provide fruits in lots, each of which has an expiration date. When selling fruits, the sales managers of the SweetLife company want to ship fruits with the earliest expiration date first. Also, within the warehouse, warehouse managers need to track the movements and locations of fruits by lots.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_70_00|Lot/Serial Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) form, select ''LTFRT'' in the '''Class ID '''box, and review the settings of the lot class, which are as follows:[anchor|#_d293b5bc-0820-4079-8f4f-7c92bda317d5]
*In the '''Tracking Method''' box, ''Track Lot Numbers'' is selected. This indicates that the class is used for tracking items by lot numbers.
*The '''Track Expiration Date''' box is selected because fruits are issued by expiration date.
*The '''Required for Drop-ship''' check box is cleared because fruits are not drop-shipped from the vendor to the customer.
*In the '''Assignment Method''' box, ''When Received'' is selected. With this setting, the system requires users to specify lot numbers and expiration dates when they enter purchase receipts.
*In the '''Issue Method''' box, ''Expiration'' is selected. This means that when items assigned to this class are sold, the system will select units of items with the earliest expiration date first.
*The '''Share Auto-Incremental Value Between All Class Items''' and '''Auto-Generate Next Number''' check boxes are cleared because users will enter lot numbers manually for units of items of the class.

==Step 9: Reviewing the Settings of the LTJAM Lot Class==
The ''LTJAM'' lot class has been predefined in the dataset to be used for jams produced by the SweetLife company. These jams are sold in lots. The lot number of an item of the class is generated automatically when a sales manager creates shipments.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_70_00|Lot/Serial Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) form, select ''LTJAM'' in the '''Class ID '''box, and review the settings of the lot class, which are as follows:[anchor|#_bae4d462-a9f1-4157-8ded-7f4e19cefbd9]
*In the '''Tracking Method''' box, ''Track Lot Numbers'' is selected. This indicates that the class is used for tracking items by lot numbers.
*The '''Track Expiration Date''' box is cleared because lot numbers are generated only when jams are sold. (The expiration date is used only together with lot numbers entered when items are received.)
*The '''Required for Drop-ship''' check box is cleared because these jams are not drop-shipped from the vendor to the customer.
*In the '''Assignment Method''' box, ''When Used'' is selected. With this setting, the system generates lot numbers when a user creates shipments.
*The '''Share Auto-Incremental Value Between All Class Items''' check box is selected because lot numbers should be unique within all items assigned to this class.
*In the '''Auto-Incremental Value''' box, <tt>0000</tt> is specified. This means that the first lot number to be used in the segment is ''0001'' and that the system can generate 9999 auto-incremental values in the lot number.
*The '''Auto-Generate Next Number''' check box is selected because the system generates lot numbers automatically.
*In the table, the following segments of a lot number for an item of the class have been added:
**The segment of the ''Constant'' type with the <tt>JM</tt> value. This segment is included in all lot numbers and does not change.
**Segments of the ''Year'', ''Month'', and ''Day'' types: The values of these segments indicate the date when the items have been sold.
**The segment of the ''Auto-Incremental Value'' type: The system increases the value of this numeric segment for each new lot.

You have created the ''SRNPARTS'' serial class for tracking juicer parts by serial numbers, made sure the class settings work as intended, and reviewed the settings of the predefined lot and serial classes.]]></column>
			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Items with Lot and Serial Numbers: Implementation Activity In the following implementation activity, you will learn how to create a serial                 class, review the settings of existing lot and serial classes, and specify lot and                 serial classes for item classes and stock items.

You have created the serial class for tracking juicer parts, and now you can specify                 this serial class in the settings of the item class that provides default settings                 for items that are juicer parts. Step 3: Specifying the Serial Class in the Item Class Settings To specify the created serial class in the settings of the  OTHERPARTS  item                 class so that all new juicer part items have this setting by default, perform the                 following instructions: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000) form. In the  Item Class Tree  pane, click the  OTHERPARTS                      item class. In the  Lot/Serial Class  box on the  General                         Settings  tab of the right pane, select  SRNPARTS . On the form toolbar, click  Save . You have specified the new serial class in the settings of the item class. Step 4: Specifying the Serial Class in the Item Settings Although specifying the  SRNPARTS  serial class in the item class settings will                 cause the system to insert the serial class for all new juicer part items of the                      OTHERPARTS  item class, the serial class must be specified in the settings                 of all existing items that must be tracked according to the settings of this serial                 class. For simplicity, you will specify the serial class in the settings of only the                      EJECTOR05  item; all other items can be modified similarly. Do the                 following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form. In the  Inventory ID  box, select  EJECTOR05 . In the  Lot/Serial Class  box on the  General                         Settings  tab, select  SRNPARTS . On the form toolbar, click  Save . Step 5: Creating an Inventory Receipt with the Serialized Item To make sure that users are able to add an item of the serial class you defined to an                 inventory receipt and that serial numbers can be added for each unit of the item,                 create an inventory receipt with the serialized item as follows: On the company and branch selection menu, on the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP screen, select the  Service and Equipment Sales Center  branch. Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) Receipts (IN301000) form. On the form toolbar, click  Add New Record . In the  Description  box of the Summary area, type                          Receipt of serialized parts . On the  Transaction Details  tab, do the following: On the table toolbar, click  Add Row . In the  Branch  column, make sure that                                  SWEETEQUIP  is selected. In the  Inventory ID  box, select                              EJECTOR05 . In the  Quantity  box, type                                  2  and press Ctrl+Enter to confirm the row.                             The system displays a warning message. On the table toolbar, click  Allocations . In the  Allocations  dialog box, which opens, do                             the following: On the table toolbar, click  Add Row . In the  Lot/Serial Nbr.  column, type                                          EJ0000327 . Press Ctrl+Enter to confirm the line. On the table toolbar, click  Add Row . In the  Lot/Serial Nbr.  column, type                                          EJ0000330 . Press Ctrl+Enter to confirm the line. In the  Unassigned Qty.  box of the Summary                                     area, make sure that the value is  0.00 . This means that                                     you have entered serial numbers for all units of the line being                                     allocated. Click  OK  to save your changes and close                                     the dialog box. On the form toolbar, click  Release  to release the                     inventory receipt you have created. You have tested the creation of an inventory receipt that includes the item with a                 serial number. In the next step, you will test the creation of an inventory issue                 that includes this item. Step 6: Creating an Inventory Issue with the Serialized Item To test whether users will be able to manually add to an inventory issue an item of                 the  SRNPARTS  serial class and that you can select its serial number from the                 list of previously entered numbers, perform the following instructions: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) Issues (IN302000) form. On the form toolbar, click  Add New Record . In the  Description  box of the Summary area, type                          Issue of an ejector . On the  Transaction Details  tab, do the following: On the table toolbar, click  Add Row . In the  Branch  column, make sure that                                  SWEETEQUIP  is selected. In the  Tran. Type  column, make sure that                                  Issue  is selected. In the  Inventory ID  box, select                              EJECTOR05 . In the  Quantity  box, type                                  1 . In the  Lot/Serial Nbr.  column, select                                  EJ0000330 . On the form toolbar, click  Release . You have successfully issued the ejector with the  EJ0000330  serial number. In a production system, an inventory issue is created automatically when a user                 releases a shipment. Step 7: Reviewing the Settings of the SRNJCR Serial Class The  SRNJCR  serial class has been predefined in the dataset to be used for                 juicers. Serial numbers for juicers are entered in a shipment because you do not                 need to track juicers by serial numbers in your warehouse but you need to record                 that a juicer with the particular serial number has been issued from the warehouse.                 The serial numbers for juicers are provided by the vendor, so sales managers enter                 the numbers manually. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) Lot/Serial Classes (IN207000) form, select  SRNJCR  in the                      Class ID  box, and review the settings of the serial                 class, which are as follows: In the  Tracking Method  box,  Track Serial Numbers                      is selected. This means that this class is used for items that are tracked by                     serial numbers in the system. The  Track Expiration Date  box is cleared. Serialized                     items usually are not tracked by their expiration dates. The  Required for Drop-ship  check box is cleared. The                     Service and Equipment Sales Center sells only juicers stored in the warehouse;                     these items are not drop-shipped from the vendor to the customer. In the  Assignment Method  box,  When Used  is                     selected. With this setting, the system requires the user to enter the serial                     number for each unit of an item of the class which in this case will be done in                     shipments that include the item. The  Share Auto-Incremental Value Between All Class Items                      and  Auto-Generate Next Number  check boxes are cleared                     because users enter serial numbers manually for units of an item of the                     class. Step 8: Reviewing the Settings of the LTFRT Lot Class The  LTFRT  lot class has been predefined in the dataset to be used for fruits.                 The fruit vendors provide fruits in lots, each of which has an expiration date. When                 selling fruits, the sales managers of the SweetLife company want to ship fruits with                 the earliest expiration date first. Also, within the warehouse, warehouse managers                 need to track the movements and locations of fruits by lots. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) Lot/Serial Classes (IN207000) form, select  LTFRT  in the                      Class ID  box, and review the settings of the lot class,                 which are as follows: In the  Tracking Method  box,  Track Lot Numbers  is                     selected. This indicates that the class is used for tracking items by lot                     numbers. The  Track Expiration Date  box is selected because fruits                     are issued by expiration date. The  Required for Drop-ship  check box is cleared because                     fruits are not drop-shipped from the vendor to the customer. In the  Assignment Method  box,  When Received  is                     selected. With this setting, the system requires users to specify lot numbers                     and expiration dates when they enter purchase receipts. In the  Issue Method  box,  Expiration  is selected.                     This means that when items assigned to this class are sold, the system will                     select units of items with the earliest expiration date first. The  Share Auto-Incremental Value Between All Class Items                      and  Auto-Generate Next Number  check boxes are cleared                     because users will enter lot numbers manually for units of items of the                     class. Step 9: Reviewing the Settings of the LTJAM Lot Class The  LTJAM  lot class has been predefined in the dataset to be used for jams                 produced by the SweetLife company. These jams are sold in lots. The lot number of an                 item of the class is generated automatically when a sales manager creates                 shipments. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) Lot/Serial Classes (IN207000) form, select  LTJAM  in the                      Class ID  box, and review the settings of the lot class,                 which are as follows: In the  Tracking Method  box,  Track Lot Numbers  is                     selected. This indicates that the class is used for tracking items by lot                     numbers. The  Track Expiration Date  box is cleared because lot                     numbers are generated only when jams are sold. (The expiration date is used only                     together with lot numbers entered when items are received.) The  Required for Drop-ship  check box is cleared because                     these jams are not drop-shipped from the vendor to the customer. In the  Assignment Method  box,  When Used  is                     selected. With this setting, the system generates lot numbers when a user                     creates shipments. The  Share Auto-Incremental Value Between All Class Items                      check box is selected because lot numbers should be unique within all items                     assigned to this class. In the  Auto-Incremental Value  box,                          0000  is specified. This means that the first lot                     number to be used in the segment is  0001  and that the system can generate                     9999 auto-incremental values in the lot number. The  Auto-Generate Next Number  check box is selected                     because the system generates lot numbers automatically. In the table, the following segments of a lot number for an item of the class                     have been added: The segment of the  Constant  type with the                                  JM  value. This segment is included in all lot                             numbers and does not change. Segments of the  Year ,  Month , and  Day  types: The                             values of these segments indicate the date when the items have been                             sold. The segment of the  Auto-Incremental Value  type: The system                             increases the value of this numeric segment for each new lot. You have created the  SRNPARTS  serial class for tracking juicer parts by serial                 numbers, made sure the class settings work as intended, and reviewed the settings of                 the predefined lot and serial classes. ]]></column>

In the following process activity, you will learn how to create and process purchase and sales documents for a stock item with a serial number that is entered manually into each shipment that includes units of the item.[anchor|#_6aa5e06c-9c16-4db1-9fdc-bc0f1c8f6989]((({S:Warn}The following activity is based on the ''U100'' dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system settings have been changed in ''U100'', these changes can affect the workflow of the activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the ''U100'' dataset to its initial state.
)))
==Story==
In this process activity, you will act as a sales and purchasing manager in the Service and Equipment Sales Center.{br}

Suppose that you have received an order for two juicers with a production rate of 0.5 liter per minute from the Thai Food Restaurant customer. You do not have these juicers available in the warehouse for equipment storage, so you will purchase the juicers from the Squeezo Inc. vendor. The vendor provides juicers with serial numbers, which you do not need to track when the items are in the warehouse. But you need to track these numbers when the juicers are sold so that if a customer wants to return the juicer or request services, you can make sure that the juicer is one that the customer bought from your company.{br}

You will process the sales order and the related purchase order in the system and enter serial numbers manually when processing a shipment.
==Configuration Overview==
In the ''U100'' data set, the ''Inventory'' feature in the ''Inventory and Order Management'' group of features has been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in the system:[anchor|#ul_ghb_r2d_pfb]
*A warehouse on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form: ''EQUIPHOUSE''
*A stock item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form: ''JUICER05СC''
*A serial class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_70_00|Lot/Serial Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) form: ''SRNJCR''
*A vendor on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form: ''SQUEEZO''
*A customer on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form: ''TOMYUM''

==Process Overview==
As you prepare the purchasing and sales documents for items with serial numbers, you do the following:[anchor|#_ebf989d6-78c3-4827-8b5e-3a0d1d119b1c]
#Prepare a sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, and mark all items to be purchased for sale.

#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, make sure that the ''Lot and Serial Tracking'' feature is enabled.

==Step 1: Creating a Sales Order==
To create the sales order for two juicers from the ''TOMYUM'' customer, do the following:[anchor|#_49fa2a94-08b9-43bb-9c4c-f12123ba8800]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, create a sales order, and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Order Type''': ''SO''
#* '''Customer''': ''TOMYUM''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Sale of juicers with the 0.5 production rate</tt>
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, add a row, and specify the following settings for it:
#*'''Inventory ID''': ''JUICER05СC''
#* '''Warehouse''': ''EQUIPHOUSE''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>2</tt>
#*'''Unit Price''': <tt>700</tt>
#*'''Mark for PO''': Selected
#*'''PO Source''': ''Purchase to Order''
#:By selecting the '''Mark for PO''' check box, you have marked the order line for purchasing, and it will be available for adding to a purchase order. 
#In the Summary area, make sure that the '''Hold''' check box is cleared.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save''' to save the sales order, which is assigned the ''Open'' status.

You have created a sales order for the juicers and marked the item to be purchased for sale; now you will create a purchase order.
==Step 2: Creating a Purchase Order==
Now you will create a purchase order for two units of the ''JUICER05С'' item from the ''SQUEEZO'' vendor. To create a purchase order for the items that are marked for purchase, do the following:[anchor|#_d02b73be-a0dd-4d95-afc6-ae8703751f36]
#While you are still viewing the sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, click '''Actions''' > '''Create Purchase Order''' on the form toolbar.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_50_00|Create Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) form, which opens, in the row with ''SO to Purchase'' specified as the '''Plan Type''', do the following:
##Select the Included check box (in the unlabeled column) to include this row in processing.
##In the '''Warehouse''' column, make sure that ''EQUIPHOUSE'' is selected.
##In the '''Vendor''' column, select ''SQUEEZO''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Process''' to process the purchase request. 
#:The system creates a purchase order for the ''SQUEEZO'' vendor and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form.
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, in the '''Unit Cost''' column, type <tt>500</tt> in the line.
#In the Summary area, type <tt>Purchase of juicers with the 0.5 production rate</tt> in the '''Description''' box, and clear the '''Hold''' check box. The status of the purchase order changes to ''Open''.[anchor|#_4ce2b2fe-a00f-45a6-9885-b6694c1d855d]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

Suppose that you now print the purchase order and send it to the Squeezo Inc. vendor by mail.
==Step 3: Creating a Purchase Receipt==
Suppose that the Squeezo Inc. vendor has delivered the juicers to ''EQUIPHOUSE''. Prepare the needed documents to reflect the receipt of the juicers as follows:[anchor|#_8071b610-c8c3-4fec-86d5-c63c3f1e4b80]
#While you are still viewing the purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, click '''Actions''' > '''Enter PO Receipt''' on the form toolbar. The system opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form with the new receipt, which has the ''Balanced'' status and the data copied from the linked purchase order.
#In the Summary area, select the '''Create Bill''' check box to make the system generate the bill automatically on release of the purchase receipt.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the purchase receipt. Notice that the system has not required you to add serial numbers to the document; based on the ''SRNJCR'' serial class settings, serial numbers are entered when items are issued rather than when they are received.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_20_00|Inventory Allocation Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) form, do the following:
##In the '''Inventory ID''' box of the Selection area, select ''JUICER05С''.
##In the '''Warehouse''' box, select ''EQUIPHOUSE''.
##Make sure that the quantity of juicers you have received (''2'') is displayed in the '''On Hand''' box.
##On the '''Item Plans''' tab, review the only line in the table, which shows that two ''JUICER05СC'' units are allocated directly for the sales order for which you have processed the purchase.
##Double-click the line to open the sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form.

The ordered juicers are ready for shipment.
==Step 4: Creating a Shipment==
To create a shipment with the ordered and received juicers, do the following:[anchor|#_46af2198-57f3-41f1-9e9e-b556c01e1285]
#While you are still viewing the sales order you have created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, on the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Create Shipment'''.
#In the '''Specify Shipment Parameters''' dialog box, which opens, make sure that the today&rsquo;s date and the ''EQUIPHOUSE'' warehouse are selected, and click '''OK'''. The system creates a shipment and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form.

Notice that the system displays a warning on the '''Document Details''' tab that serial numbers are not specified for the juicer units and displays the ordered quantity of juicers in the '''Unassigned Qty.''' column. This means that you need to specify serial numbers for the ordered juicers manually.
==Step 5: Specifying Serial Numbers for the Shipped Items==
To manually specify the serial numbers in the shipment for the juicers to be sold, while you are still viewing the shipment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form, do the following:[anchor|#_675191c6-88d5-4b4a-8547-4c7c46bcc9a4]
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, click the line.
#On the table toolbar, click '''Allocations'''.
#In the '''Allocations''' dialog box, which opens, do the following:
##On the table toolbar, click '''Add Row'''. The system adds a line for one unit of the ''JUICER05С'' item.
##In the '''Location''' column, select ''MAIN''.
##In the '''Lot/Serial Nbr.''' column, type <tt>JCR050000333</tt>; press Ctrl+Enter to confirm the line. Notice that the value in the '''Unassigned Qty.''' box has been changed to ''1''.
##Add a row for the second juicer.
##In the '''Location''' column, select ''MAIN''.
##In the '''Lot/Serial Nbr.''' column, type <tt>JCR050000168</tt>; press Ctrl+Enter to confirm the line. Notice that the value in the '''Unassigned Qty.''' box has been changed to ''0''.
##Click '''OK''' to save your changes and close the dialog box.[anchor|#_2a9cd444-850f-465c-a841-830edb769055]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

You have entered the serial numbers of the juicers. Notice that the warnings on the '''Document Details''' tab and the '''Unassigned Qty.''' column on this tab have disappeared. Now you can confirm the shipment and process the related invoice.
==Step 6: Confirming a Shipment and Processing an Invoice==
To confirm the shipment and process the related invoice, do the following:[anchor|#_029e2b43-9c72-478b-868e-36ada6ff41d7]
#While you are still viewing the shipment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form, review the line on the '''Document Details''' tab. Make sure that the shipped quantity in the line is equal to the ordered quantity.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Confirm Shipment'''. The status of the shipment has been changed to ''Confirmed''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Prepare Invoice'''. The system prepares the invoice and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Release''' to release the invoice. The system changes the status of the invoice to ''Open'' and the statuses of the shipment and sales order to ''Completed''.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_20_00|Inventory Allocation Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) form, do the following:
##In the '''Inventory ID''' box of the Selection area, select ''JUICER05С''.
##In the '''Warehouse''' box, select ''EQUIPHOUSE''.
##In the '''On Hand''' box, make sure that the quantity of juicers is 0.

You have successfully processed the shipment and the invoice related to the sale of the two juicers with serial numbers.]]></column>
			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Items with Lot and Serial Numbers: To Purchase and Sell Serialized Items In the following process activity, you will learn how to create and process purchase                 and sales documents for a stock item with a serial number that is entered manually                 into each shipment that includes units of the item. The following activity is based on the                  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system settings             have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the activity             and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100  dataset             to its initial state. Story In this process activity, you will act as a sales and purchasing manager in the                 Service and Equipment Sales Center. Suppose that you have received an order for two juicers with a production rate of 0.5                 liter per minute from the Thai Food Restaurant customer. You do not have these                 juicers available in the warehouse for equipment storage, so you will purchase the                 juicers from the Squeezo Inc. vendor. The vendor provides juicers with serial                 numbers, which you do not need to track when the items are in the warehouse. But you                 need to track these numbers when the juicers are sold so that if a customer wants to                 return the juicer or request services, you can make sure that the juicer is one that                 the customer bought from your company. You will process the sales order and the related purchase order in the system and                 enter serial numbers manually when processing a shipment. Configuration Overview In the  U100  data set, the  Inventory  feature in the  Inventory and                     Order Management  group of features has been enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in                 the system: A warehouse on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses (IN204000) form:                          EQUIPHOUSE A stock item on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500)                     form:  JUICER05СC A serial class on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) Lot/Serial Classes (IN207000) form:                          SRNJCR A vendor on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors (AP303000) form:                      SQUEEZO A customer on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000) form:                      TOMYUM Process Overview As you prepare the purchasing and sales documents for items with serial numbers, you                 do the following: Prepare a sales order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form,                     and mark all items to be purchased for sale. Prepare a purchase order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form                     to order the items from the vendor. Prepare a purchase receipt on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000)                     form when you receive the items from the vendor. Create a shipment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) form. Enter the serial numbers of the units of the items to be sold on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments form. Confirm the shipment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments form, and process                     the related invoice on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form. System Preparation Before you start performing the activity, you perform the following instructions: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the  U100  dataset preloaded. To                     sign in as a sales and purchasing manager, use the  brawner  login and the                          123  password.

In the Summary area, make sure that the  Hold  check box is                     cleared. On the form toolbar, click  Save  to save the sales order,                     which is assigned the  Open  status. You have created a sales order for the juicers and marked the item to be purchased                 for sale; now you will create a purchase order. Step 2: Creating a Purchase Order Now you will create a purchase order for two units of the  JUICER05С  item from                 the  SQUEEZO  vendor. To create a purchase order for the items that are marked                 for purchase, do the following: While you are still viewing the sales order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, click  Actions Create Purchase Order  on the form toolbar.

In the  Warehouse  column, make sure that                                  EQUIPHOUSE  is selected. In the  Vendor  column, select  SQUEEZO . On the form toolbar, click  Process  to process the                     purchase request.  The system creates a purchase order for the  SQUEEZO                          vendor and opens it on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000)                         form. On the  Document Details  tab, in the  Unit                         Cost  column, type  500  in the line. In the Summary area, type  Purchase of juicers with the 0.5 production                         rate  in the  Description  box, and clear                     the  Hold  check box.

Suppose that you now print the purchase order and send it to the Squeezo Inc. vendor                 by mail. Step 3: Creating a Purchase Receipt Suppose that the Squeezo Inc. vendor has delivered the juicers to  EQUIPHOUSE .                 Prepare the needed documents to reflect the receipt of the juicers as follows: While you are still viewing the purchase order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form, click  Actions Enter PO Receipt  on the form toolbar. The system opens the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form with the new receipt,                     which has the  Balanced  status and the data copied from the linked                     purchase order. In the Summary area, select the  Create Bill  check box to                     make the system generate the bill automatically on release of the purchase                     receipt. On the form toolbar, click  Release  to release the                     purchase receipt. Notice that the system has not required you to add serial                     numbers to the document; based on the  SRNJCR  serial class settings,                     serial numbers are entered when items are issued rather than when they are                     received. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) Inventory Allocation Details (IN402000) form, do the                         following: In the  Inventory ID  box of the Selection area,                             select  JUICER05С . In the  Warehouse  box, select                              EQUIPHOUSE . Make sure that the quantity of juicers you have received ( 2 ) is                             displayed in the  On Hand  box. On the  Item Plans  tab, review the only line in                             the table, which shows that two  JUICER05СC  units are allocated                             directly for the sales order for which you have processed the                             purchase.

Notice that the value in the  Unassigned                                 Qty.  box has been changed to  0 . Click  OK  to save your changes and close the                             dialog box. On the form toolbar, click  Save . You have entered the serial numbers of the juicers. Notice that the warnings on the                      Document Details  tab and the  Unassigned                     Qty.  column on this tab have disappeared. Now you can confirm the                 shipment and process the related invoice. Step 6: Confirming a Shipment and Processing an Invoice To confirm the shipment and process the related invoice, do the following: While you are still viewing the shipment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments                     (SO302000) form, review the line on the  Document Details                      tab. Make sure that the shipped quantity in the line is equal to the ordered                     quantity. On the form toolbar, click  Actions Confirm Shipment . The status of the shipment has been changed to                      Confirmed . On the form toolbar, click  Actions Prepare Invoice . The system prepares the invoice and opens it on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form. On the form toolbar, click  Actions Release  to release the invoice.

))){br}{TOC}
==Story==
In this process activity, you will act as a sales and purchasing manager in the SweetLife Office and Wholesale Center branch of the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company.{br}

As the purchasing manager, you will buy two boxes (10 pounds each) of guavas with different expiration dates from the Glory Fruit Case vendor. The vendor supplies each box with a lot number that must be used for tracking the enclosed items in the Wholesale warehouse. The lot class is defined so that fruits with the earliest expiration date are issued first when the fruit is sold.{br}

Suppose that GoodFood One Restaurant ordered 12 pounds of guavas. As a sales manager, you will create and process the appropriate documents for the purchase and sale of these items with lot numbers and expiration dates. (You will use quick processing to illustrated expedited processing of the sales order.)
==Configuration Overview==
In the ''U100'' data set, the ''Inventory'' feature in the ''Inventory and Order Management'' group of features has been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in the system:[anchor|#ul_ghb_r2d_pfb]
*A warehouse on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form: ''WHOLESALE''
*A stock item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form: ''GUAVAS''
*A lot class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_70_00|Lot/Serial Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) form: ''LTFRT''
*A vendor on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form: ''GLORYFRUIT''
*A customer on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form: ''GOODFOOD''

Also, the ''SO'' order type has been configured to allow expedited multistep processing of appropriate sales orders, which will be illustrated in this example. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form, the '''Allow Quick Process''' check box has been selected on the '''Template Settings''' tab, and on the '''Quick Process Settings''' tab of the form, the appropriate settings have been specified to configure the sequence of order processing actions to be used by default when orders of this type are quickly processed.
==Process Overview==
As you prepare the purchasing and sales documents for items with lot numbers and expiration dates, you do the following:[anchor|#_8214c13c-7763-4644-bc81-8dcae380cc6d]
#Prepare a purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form to order the dated, lot-numbered items from the vendor.
#Prepare a purchase receipt on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form when you receive the items from the vendor, and specify the lot number and expiration date for each unit of the items.
#Prepare a sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. Select an order type that supports quick processing (if you plan to use it), select the customer to which the items are being sold, and add items to the order.
#Click '''Quick Process''' on the form toolbar to use quick processing of the sales order, review the quick processing settings, and correct them, if needed. Then you run quick processing, during which the system processes the sales order to completion and generates all needed documents. When the quick processing completes, you can review the generated documents.
#Review that the items included in the shipment have been allocated according to the settings of the lot class assigned.

==System Preparation==
Before you start performing the activity, you perform the following instructions:[anchor|#_d09a3573-b715-4111-b792-5858248e13a0]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded. To sign in as a sales and purchasing manager, use the ''wiley'' login and the ''123'' password.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, make sure that the ''Lot and Serial Tracking'' feature is enabled.

==Step 1: Creating a Purchase Order==
To begin the process of ordering two boxes of guavas, 10 pounds each, from the ''GLORYFRUIT'' vendor, do the following to create the purchase order:[anchor|#_aee773cd-f545-48a1-b20d-e26da0ee79cf]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, create a purchase order, and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Type''': ''Normal''
#* '''Vendor''': ''GLORYFRUIT''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Purchase of guavas, 20 lb</tt>
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, add a row, and specify the following settings for it:
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''GUAVAS''
#* '''Warehouse''': ''WHOLESALE''
#* '''Order Qty.''': <tt>20</tt>
#*'''Unit Cost''': <tt>9.95</tt>
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box.
#Click '''Save''' on the form toolbar to save the purchase order, which has the ''Open'' status.

Suppose that you now print the purchase order and send it to the Glory Fruit Case vendor by mail.
==Step 2: Creating a Purchase Receipt and Entering Lot Numbers==
Suppose that the Glory Fruit Case vendor has delivered the guavas to the Wholesale warehouse. The order contains two boxes with separate lot numbers and different expiration dates. You prepare the needed documents to reflect the receipt of the guavas as follows:[anchor|#_671cd87e-b180-4409-8742-2cdc78bbe23f]
#While you are still viewing the purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, click '''Actions''' > '''Enter PO Receipt''' on the form toolbar. The system opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form with the new receipt, which has the ''Balanced'' status and the data copied from the linked purchase order.
#In the table of the '''Document Details''' tab, click the only line of the order.
#On the table toolbar, click '''Allocations'''.
#In the '''Allocations''' dialog box, which opens, do the following:
##Notice that the value of the '''Unassigned Qty.''' box in the Summary area is ''20''.[anchor|#_e67c46a8-4f98-422f-9f55-3da881158ddb]
##On the table toolbar, click '''Add Row'''.
##In the '''Location''' column, select ''MAIN''.
##In the '''Lot/Serial Nbr.''' column, type <tt>FRT000862</tt>.
##In the '''Quantity''' column, type <tt>10</tt>.
##In the '''Expiration Date''' column, select ''02/20/2020''.
##On the table toolbar, click '''Add Row''' to add a second row. Notice that the value of the '''Unassigned Qty.''' box was changed to ''10''.
##In the '''Lot/Serial Nbr.''' column, type <tt>FRT000877</tt>.
##In the '''Quantity''' column, type <tt>10</tt>.
##In the '''Expiration Date''' column, select ''02/13/2020''.
##Click '''OK''' to save your changes and close the dialog box.
#:Notice that the value of the '''Lot/Serial Nbr.''' column for the ''GUAVAS'' line is ''&lt;SPLIT&gt;'', which means that units of the item with different lot numbers have been included in the line of the purchase receipt.
#In the Summary area, select the '''Create Bill''' check box.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the purchase receipt. The system automatically creates and releases the inventory receipt. On the '''Other Information''' tab, you can view the reference number of the created inventory receipt; you can also click the reference number link to view the inventory receipt on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) form.

##In the '''Inventory ID''' box of the Selection area, select ''GUAVAS''.
##In the '''Warehouse''' box, select ''WHOLESALE''.
##Make sure that the value of the '''On Hand''' box is ''20''.

You have processed the purchase receipt and inventory receipt to reflect that the guavas have been received in the Wholesale warehouse. In these documents, you have entered lot numbers and expiration dates, and now sales managers can sell these guavas to customers.
==Step 3: Creating a Sales Order==
In this step, you will act as the sales manager. To create a sales order reflecting that the ''GOODFOOD'' customer has ordered 12 pounds of guavas, do the following:[anchor|#_96d0fc6c-f29c-4a47-ab92-3a10b2cff211]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, create a sales order, and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Order Type''': ''SO''
#* '''Customer''': ''GOODFOOD''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Sale of 12 pounds of guavas</tt>
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, add a row, and specify the following settings for it:
#*'''Inventory ID''': ''GUAVAS''
#* '''Warehouse''': ''WHOLESALE''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>12</tt>
#*'''Unit Price''': <tt>12.99</tt>
#In the Summary area, make sure that the '''Hold''' check box is cleared.
#Click '''Save''' on the form toolbar to save the sales order, which is assigned the ''Open'' status.

You have created a sales order for the guavas, and now you will create the other related documents.
==Step 4: Creating and Quickly Processing Sales Documents==
To create and process the sales documents related to the sales order (which will be created through quick processing of the sales order), do the following:[anchor|#_403cb3ec-6de2-4eaf-8ea0-79e0679bac53]
#While you are still viewing the sales order you have created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, on the form toolbar, click '''Quick Process'''.
#In the '''Process Order''' dialog box, which opens so that you can review (and change, if needed) the settings before quickly processing the order, do the following:
##In the '''Warehouse ID''' box, make sure that ''WHOLESALE'' is selected.
##In the '''Shipment Date''' section, make sure that ''Today'' is selected.
##In the '''Shipping''' section, make sure that the following check boxes are selected:
##*'''Create Shipment'''
##* '''Confirm Shipment'''
##* '''Update IN'''
##In the '''Invoicing''' section, make sure that the '''Prepare Invoice''' check box is selected.
##Select the '''Release Invoice''' check box.
##Click '''OK'''. 
##After the system creates the documents, close the '''Processing Results''' box. Notice that the sales order now has the ''Completed'' status.

By using quick processing, you have created the sales documents related to the sales order. Now you will review how the system has allocated units of the item in the shipment.
==Step 5: Reviewing the Item Allocations in the Shipment==
To review how the system has allocated units of the item in the shipment, do the following:[anchor|#_24e709bd-d5d2-4dbe-955e-132abeb68acc]
#While you are still viewing the sales order you have created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, on the '''Shipments''' tab, click the link in the '''Document Nbr.''' column. The system opens the shipment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form.
#In the '''Lot/Serial Nbr.''' column on the '''Document Details''' tab, notice that the ''&lt;SPLIT&gt;'' value is specified. This means that units of the item with different lot numbers have been included in the shipment line.
#Click the only shipment line, and, on the table toolbar, click '''Allocations'''.
#In the '''Allocations''' dialog box that opens, review how the system has selected guavas from warehouse as follows:
#*In the first line, notice that the system selected 10 pounds of guavas from the ''FRT000877'' lot with the earlier expiration date.
#*In the second line, notice that the system selected two pounds of guavas from the ''FRT000862'' lot with the later expiration date.
#Click '''OK''' to close the dialog box.

You have prepared the documents for purchasing items with lot numbers and expiration dates, and you have prepared the sales documents for selling the lot-numbered items, making sure that the system has selected the items by using the expiration date.]]></column>
			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Items with Lot and Serial Numbers: To Purchase and Sell Lot-Numbered Items that         Expire In the following activity, you will learn how to create and process purchase and                 sales documents for a stock item for which the lot number and expiration date are                 entered manually on receipt. The following activity is based on the                  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system settings             have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the activity             and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100  dataset             to its initial state. Story In this process activity, you will act as a sales and purchasing manager in the                 SweetLife Office and Wholesale Center branch of the SweetLife Fruits & Jams                 company. As the purchasing manager, you will buy two boxes (10 pounds each) of guavas with                 different expiration dates from the Glory Fruit Case vendor. The vendor supplies                 each box with a lot number that must be used for tracking the enclosed items in the                 Wholesale warehouse. The lot class is defined so that fruits with the earliest                 expiration date are issued first when the fruit is sold. Suppose that GoodFood One Restaurant ordered 12 pounds of guavas. As a sales manager,                 you will create and process the appropriate documents for the purchase and sale of                 these items with lot numbers and expiration dates. (You will use quick processing to                 illustrated expedited processing of the sales order.) Configuration Overview In the  U100  data set, the  Inventory  feature in the  Inventory and                     Order Management  group of features has been enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in                 the system: A warehouse on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses (IN204000) form:                          WHOLESALE A stock item on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500)                     form:  GUAVAS A lot class on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) Lot/Serial Classes (IN207000) form:                      LTFRT A vendor on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors (AP303000) form:                          GLORYFRUIT A customer on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000) form:                          GOODFOOD Also, the  SO  order type has been configured to allow expedited multistep                 processing of appropriate sales orders, which will be illustrated in this example.                 On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form, the                      Allow Quick Process  check box has been selected on the                      Template Settings  tab, and on the  Quick                     Process Settings  tab of the form, the appropriate settings have been                 specified to configure the sequence of order processing actions to be used by                 default when orders of this type are quickly processed. Process Overview As you prepare the purchasing and sales documents for items with lot numbers and                 expiration dates, you do the following: Prepare a purchase order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form                     to order the dated, lot-numbered items from the vendor. Prepare a purchase receipt on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000)                     form when you receive the items from the vendor, and specify the lot number and                     expiration date for each unit of the items. Prepare a sales order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form.                     Select an order type that supports quick processing (if you plan to use it),                     select the customer to which the items are being sold, and add items to the                     order. Click  Quick Process  on the form toolbar to use quick                     processing of the sales order, review the quick processing settings, and correct                     them, if needed. Then you run quick processing, during which the system                     processes the sales order to completion and generates all needed documents. When                     the quick processing completes, you can review the generated documents. Review that the items included in the shipment have been allocated according to                     the settings of the lot class assigned. System Preparation Before you start performing the activity, you perform the following instructions: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the  U100  dataset preloaded. To                     sign in as a sales and purchasing manager, use the  wiley  login and the                          123  password. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, make sure that the                          Lot and Serial Tracking  feature is enabled. Step 1: Creating a Purchase Order To begin the process of ordering two boxes of guavas, 10 pounds each, from the                      GLORYFRUIT  vendor, do the following to create the purchase order: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form, create a purchase order,                     and specify the following settings in the Summary area: Type :  Normal Vendor :  GLORYFRUIT Description :  Purchase of guavas, 20                                 lb On the  Document Details  tab, add a row, and specify the                     following settings for it: Branch :  HEADOFFICE Inventory ID :  GUAVAS Warehouse :  WHOLESALE Order Qty. :  20 Unit Cost :  9.95 In the Summary area, clear the  Hold  check box. Click  Save  on the form toolbar to save the purchase                     order, which has the  Open  status. Suppose that you now print the purchase order and send it to the Glory Fruit Case                 vendor by mail. Step 2: Creating a Purchase Receipt and Entering Lot Numbers Suppose that the Glory Fruit Case vendor has delivered the guavas to the Wholesale                 warehouse. The order contains two boxes with separate lot numbers and different                 expiration dates. You prepare the needed documents to reflect the receipt of the                 guavas as follows: While you are still viewing the purchase order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form, click  Actions Enter PO Receipt  on the form toolbar. The system opens the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form with the new receipt,                     which has the  Balanced  status and the data copied from the linked                     purchase order. In the table of the  Document Details  tab, click the only                     line of the order. On the table toolbar, click  Allocations . In the  Allocations  dialog box, which opens, do the                         following: Notice that the value of the  Unassigned Qty.  box                             in the Summary area is  20 . On the table toolbar, click  Add Row . In the  Location  column, select  MAIN . In the  Lot/Serial Nbr.  column, type                                  FRT000862 . In the  Quantity  column, type                                  10 . In the  Expiration Date  column, select                                      02/20/ 2020. On the table toolbar, click  Add Row  to add a                             second row. Notice that the value of the  Unassigned                                 Qty.  box was changed to  10 . In the  Lot/Serial Nbr.  column, type                                  FRT000877 . In the  Quantity  column, type                                  10 . In the  Expiration Date  column, select                                      02/13/ 2020. Click  OK  to save your changes and close the                             dialog box. Notice that the value of the  Lot/Serial Nbr.                          column for the  GUAVAS  line is  <SPLIT> , which means that                         units of the item with different lot numbers have been included in the line                         of the purchase receipt. In the Summary area, select the  Create Bill  check                     box. On the form toolbar, click  Release  to release the                     purchase receipt. The system automatically creates and releases the inventory                     receipt. On the  Other Information  tab, you can view the                     reference number of the created inventory receipt; you can also click the                     reference number link to view the inventory receipt on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) Receipts (IN301000) form. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) Inventory Allocation Details (IN402000) form, do the                         following: In the  Inventory ID  box of the Selection area,                             select  GUAVAS . In the  Warehouse  box, select                              WHOLESALE . Make sure that the value of the  On Hand  box is                                  20 . You have processed the purchase receipt and inventory receipt to reflect that the                 guavas have been received in the Wholesale warehouse. In these documents, you have                 entered lot numbers and expiration dates, and now sales managers can sell these                 guavas to customers. Step 3: Creating a Sales Order In this step, you will act as the sales manager. To create a sales order reflecting                 that the  GOODFOOD  customer has ordered 12 pounds of guavas, do the                 following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, create a sales order,                     and specify the following settings in the Summary area: Order Type :  SO Customer :  GOODFOOD Description :  Sale of 12 pounds of                                 guavas On the  Document Details  tab, add a row, and specify the                     following settings for it: Inventory ID :  GUAVAS Warehouse :  WHOLESALE Quantity :  12 Unit Price :  12.99 In the Summary area, make sure that the  Hold  check box is                     cleared. Click  Save  on the form toolbar to save the sales order,                     which is assigned the  Open  status. You have created a sales order for the guavas, and now you will create the other                 related documents. Step 4: Creating and Quickly Processing Sales Documents To create and process the sales documents related to the sales order (which will be                 created through quick processing of the sales order), do the following: While you are still viewing the sales order you have created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, on the form toolbar, click                          Quick Process . In the  Process Order  dialog box, which opens so that you                     can review (and change, if needed) the settings before quickly processing the                     order, do the following: In the  Warehouse ID  box, make sure that                                  WHOLESALE  is selected. In the  Shipment Date  section, make sure that                                  Today  is selected. In the  Shipping  section, make sure that the                             following check boxes are selected: Create Shipment Confirm Shipment Update IN In the  Invoicing  section, make sure that the                                  Prepare Invoice  check box is selected. Select the  Release Invoice  check box. Click  OK .  After the system creates the documents, close the  Processing                                 Results  box. Notice that the sales order now has the                                  Completed  status. By using quick processing, you have created the sales documents related to the sales                 order. Now you will review how the system has allocated units of the item in the                 shipment. Step 5: Reviewing the Item Allocations in the Shipment To review how the system has allocated units of the item in the shipment, do the                 following: While you are still viewing the sales order you have created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, on the                          Shipments  tab, click the link in the                          Document Nbr.  column. The system opens the shipment                     on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) form. In the  Lot/Serial Nbr.  column on the  Document                         Details  tab, notice that the  <SPLIT>  value is                     specified. This means that units of the item with different lot numbers have                     been included in the shipment line. Click the only shipment line, and, on the table toolbar, click                          Allocations . In the  Allocations  dialog box that opens, review how the                     system has selected guavas from warehouse as follows: In the first line, notice that the system selected 10 pounds of guavas                             from the  FRT000877  lot with the earlier expiration date. In the second line, notice that the system selected two pounds of guavas                             from the  FRT000862  lot with the later expiration date. Click  OK  to close the dialog box. You have prepared the documents for purchasing items with lot numbers and expiration                 dates, and you have prepared the sales documents for selling the lot-numbered items,                 making sure that the system has selected the items by using the expiration date. ]]></column>

If your organization sells or purchases items with multiple attributes (such as T-shirts that have different materials, sizes, colors, and brands), you may want to generate items with various attributes automatically by using predefined templates. To do this, you can use the matrix items functionality in Acumatica ERP. A matrix item is a stock or non-stock item that corresponds to a physical product or a service with particular set of attributes. You define related matrix items in the system by using a template item, which provides the default settings for the particular group of matrix items.{br}

The functionality of matrix items is available if the ''Matrix Items'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Configure item classes to be used for matrix items
*Create template items for matrix items
*Create matrix items based on template items
*Process purchase orders that contain matrix items
*Process sales orders that contain matrix items

==Applicable Scenarios==
You may need to create matrix items in the following cases:[anchor|#_7165d0ed-fbf9-4bca-b563-a0155c7a9310]
*Your organization purchases items or services with multiple variants
*Your organization sells items or services with multiple variants
*Your organization sells items online

==Template Items==
Template items are high-level items that contain default settings for matrix items. Each template item exists solely to provide default settings for a group of matrix items; template items cannot be added to inventory transactions or to AP, AR, sales, or purchase documents. You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_30_00|Template Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN203000|IN203000]) form to create, modify, and delete template items.{br}

Template items are based on item classes, which are created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form. When you create a template item, you specify an item class that provides the default settings for the template item. The item class must contain attributes that have the ''Variant'' attribute category and the ''Combo'' control type; you will use these variables to generate matrix items based on the template item. Before you create an item class, you must createthe specific attributes to be used for matrix items on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_50_00|Attributes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) form, if they don’t already exist.{br}

For each template item, you specify the following settings in addition to the settings inherited from the item class:[anchor|#_1d9174b3-6ab9-4750-bf9f-2ca5ec317ddc]
*The default attributes that are used in the rows and columns of a matrix. As these attributes, you can select the attributes that provide values for variants of items (such as size and color for T-shirts). For other attributes with the ''Variant'' category (if there are any), you select the particular value when creating matrix items. In the example with T-shirts, you can create the group of matrix items for T-shirts made of a particular material (such as cotton) and select particular sizes and colors as item variants in matrix cells.
*The settings of the identifiers of the matrix items generated by using the template item. The identifiers of matrix items can be segmented and are generated automatically. In the segments, you can use attribute values and captions, the template ID and description, constants, automatically generated numbers, and spaces.
*The settings to be used for the descriptions for matrix items. Descriptions are generated automatically when you create matrix items. These descriptions can be segmented, and the segments can be based on the same entities as the segments of item identifiers.

You can specify the prices and discounts for a template item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_10|Sales Price Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202010|AR202010]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_95_00|Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209500|AR209500]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_20_00|Vendor Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AP202000|AP202000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_20_10|Vendor Price Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=AP202010|AP202010]), and [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_50_00|Vendor Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AP205000|AP205000]) forms. These prices and discounts will be applied to the matrix items related to this template item if specific prices and discounts are not specified for the individual matrix items of the template item.
==Matrix Items==
When a template item is created and its settings have been specified, you create matrix items either on the '''Create Matrix Items''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_30_00|Template Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN203000|IN203000]) form or on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_35_00|Create Matrix Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN203500|IN203500]) form. It is not necessary to create matrix items with all possible combinations of attributes at once. You can create only the set of items that is currently required and then create other items later as they are needed. Then on the '''Matrix Items''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_30_00|Template Items] form, you can view the list of items created based on the selected template item.{br}

To check if a particular item is a matrix item, you can open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form and view the value of the '''Template ID''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab. If the box is empty, the item is not a matrix item. If the ID of a template item is specified in this box, the item is a matrix item.{br}

The settings of an individual matrix item can be changed by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form (depending on whether the item is a stock or non-stock item). If you need to change a particular setting for all matrix items of a template item, you can make these changes in the template item settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_30_00|Template Items] form and then apply these changes to all related matrix items by clicking the '''Apply to Matrix Items''' button on the form toolbar.((({S:Warn}When you click the '''Apply to Matrix Items''' button, all specific settings of matrix items will be overwritten with the template item settings.
)))
If you need to completely remove a particular matrix item from the system, you can do this on the '''Matrix Items''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_30_00|Template Items] form. You can also remove the item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form (depending on whether the item is a stock or non-stock item) by clicking '''Delete''' on the form toolbar.
==Document Processing with Matrix Items==
You can add multiple matrix items to purchase orders on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form and to sales orders on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form by clicking the '''Add Matrix Item''' button on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab.{br}

In the '''Add Matrix Item''' dialog box, which opens, you can use either a table view or a matrix view for adding matrix items to the documents. In the table view, you select a template item and specify the attribute values of the matrix items that you need to add to the document. In this view, you can select any set of available attribute values, even if a matrix item with this set does not exist in the system; for a new item, in the table of the '''Add Matrix Item: Table View''' dialog box, the '''New''' check box is selected. The system generates the new items on the fly when you close the dialog box and add the items to the document.{br}

In the matrix view, which is opened when you click the '''Open Matrix View''' button in the '''Add Matrix Item: Table View''' dialog box, you can select existing matrix items by entering the required quantities in the matrix.[anchor|#_d6338c5d-ddd7-42bf-8160-e8c6f6ca96f8]((({S:Danger}You must use either the table view or matrix view to select the matrix items to be added to the document. If you select the items in the table view and then switch to the matrix view, the selection of items in the table view will be discarded.

==Story==
Suppose that SweetLife Fruit & Jams company has decided to extend the assortment of items it sells, and to sell various packed nuts. Packed nuts have multiple variants, with each variant defined by the type of nut, the package weight, and the specialty (salted, spicy, roasted, raw, yogurt-covered, or chocolate-covered). For now, sales managers are going to sell nuts in packages of 4 ounces; depending on sales, other sizes may be available in the future. The following combinations of specialty and nut type will be available initially:[anchor|#_afd2b1a6-f588-463d-bcdf-ca68ef4a91d3]
*Raw almonds, cashews, and hazelnuts
*Roasted pecans and peanuts
*Salted pistachios
*Spicy peanuts
*Chocolate-covered almonds, cashews, hazelnuts, and peanuts

Further suppose that according to the naming policy of matrix items, the identifier of each matrix item must contain segments with values that represent all three attributes, separated by hyphens. The descriptions of the matrix items must contain descriptions of the same attributes, separated by spaces.{br}

You as an implementation manger have a task to prepare the system for these nuts to be purchased and sold. You will use the functionality of matrix items.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this lesson, the following features have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form:[anchor|#_23cbc970-8ba9-43a2-8cd7-d4f9cbec1f91]
*''Matrix Items''
* ''Inventory''

The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in the system:[anchor|#_1ffbd1e9-12fd-4cac-a573-fc05ff09671f]
*The ''WHOLESALE'' warehouse on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form

#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_30_00|Template Items] form, modify the settings of the created matrix items through the template item

==System Preparation==
Before you start creating template items and matrix items, do the following:[anchor|#_f7e2f44f-4624-4d24-85a5-f171f6d99cc2]
#Download the [{up}UserGuide/Files/Matrix_Items_Nutype_Attribute.xlsx|Matrix&#95;Items&#95;Nutype&#95;Attribute] file, which holds the values of the ''NUTYPE'' attribute; you will create this attribute in this activity and upload the values.
#Sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded; you should sign in as a system administrator with the ''gibbs'' login and ''123'' password.

==Step 1: Creating an Attribute==
You will first create the attribute for nut types, which you will later add to the item class and use for the creating matrix items. Do the following:[anchor|#_fa742785-635f-4638-890f-918dff014a89]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_50_00|Attributes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) form.[anchor|#_c7981603-6a05-4f30-a84d-84e25d99496e]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record'''.
#In the Summary area, specify the following settings:
#*'''Attribute ID''': <tt>NUTYPE</tt>
#*'''Description''': <tt>Type of nuts</tt>
#*'''Control Type''': ''Combo''
#On the table toolbar, click '''Load Records from File'''.
#In the '''File Upload''' dialog box, which opens, select the file path to the [{up}UserGuide/Files/Matrix_Items_Nutype_Attribute.xlsx|Matrix&#95;Items&#95;Nutype&#95;Attribute] file, and click '''Upload'''.
#In the '''Common Settings''' dialog box, which opens, leave the default settings, and click '''OK'''.
#In the '''Columns''' dialog box, leave the current mapping, and click '''OK'''.[anchor|#_9437dbe2-0d96-421c-8e2f-3ace8467966c]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

You have created the attribute for nut types that will be used for creation of matrix items and uploaded the values of the attribute.
==Step 2: Reviewing the Settings of Existing Attributes==
Review the settings of the ''WEIGHT'' and ''SPECIALTY'' attributes, which have already been defined in the dataset, as follows:[anchor|#_5ede4828-e105-4fd3-8114-a51a3bfa7efc]
#While you are still viewing the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_50_00|Attributes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) form, in the '''Attribute ID''' box, select ''WEIGHT''.
#In the '''Control Type''' box, make sure that ''Combo'' is selected.

#Click '''Confirm'''. The system creates the items and closes the dialog box.
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_30_00|Template Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN203000|IN203000]) form, and select the ''NUTS'' template item.
#On the '''Matrix Items''' tab, view the list of matrix items.

You have created all of the matrix items that are based on the ''NUTS'' template.
==Step 6: Reviewing the Settings of a Matrix Item==
Review the settings of the ''ALD-CHT-04OZ'' matrix item as follows:[anchor|#_4c5e07a7-f5a4-4c1e-a943-fee61bb15ee4]
#While you are still viewing the '''Matrix Items''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_30_00|Template Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN203000|IN203000]) form with the ''NUTS'' template item selected, click the link in the '''Inventory ID''' column for the ''ALD-CHT-04OZ'' row. The system opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form in a new window.
#On the '''General Settings''' tab, make sure that the ''NUTS'' template item is specified in the '''Template ID''' box.
#On the '''Attributes''' tab, view the list of attribute values specific to this matrix item.
#Close the window with the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form.

==Step 7: Deleting a Matrix Item==
Suppose that you were told that spicy peanuts cannot be supplied by the vendor, so this item is not needed. To delete the stock item for the spicy peanuts, do the following:[anchor|#_3927bc75-521f-4dbe-a5cc-ae35f8e51947]
#While you are still viewing the '''Matrix Items''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_30_00|Template Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN203000|IN203000]) form with the ''NUTS'' template item selected, select the check box in the unlabeled column for the ''PNT-SPC-04OZ'' row.
#On the table toolbar, click '''Delete'''. The item is deleted.

==Step 8: Changing the Settings of the Template Item==
Suppose that you were told that by default, all nuts will be stored in the wholesale warehouse. You will specify the warehouse in the template item settings and apply this change to existing matrix items based on this template. Do the following:[anchor|#_89d963d4-0e33-4a41-bb75-c276e0e35726]
#While you are still viewing the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_30_00|Template Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN203000|IN203000]) form with the ''NUTS'' template item selected, open the '''General Settings''' tab.
#In the '''Default Warehouse''' box of the '''Warehouse Details''' section, select ''WHOLESALE''.[anchor|#_9ae96656-9558-4ce4-88d7-feb2ddd5c23f]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Apply to Matrix Items'''.
#On the '''Matrix Items''' tab, click the link in the '''Inventory ID''' box for the ''ALD-CHT-04OZ'' row. The system opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form.
#On the '''General Settings''' tab, make sure that the ''WHOLESALE'' warehouse is selected in the '''Default Warehouse''' box of the '''Warehouse Details''' section. This means that the default warehouse has been updated for this matrix item (and for other matrix items, too).

You have successfully created a template item and then created, deleted, and modified the settings of the matrix items based on this template item.]]></column>
			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Matrix Items:          Implementation         Activity In the following implementation activity, you will learn how to create attributes,                 template items, and matrix items. In addition, you will learn how to delete matrix                 items and apply changes to multiple related matrix items. The following activity is based on the                  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system settings             have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the activity             and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100  dataset             to its initial state. Story Suppose that SweetLife Fruit & Jams company has decided to extend the assortment                 of items it sells, and to sell various packed nuts. Packed nuts have multiple                 variants, with each variant defined by the type of nut, the package weight, and the                 specialty (salted, spicy, roasted, raw, yogurt-covered, or chocolate-covered). For                 now, sales managers are going to sell nuts in packages of 4 ounces; depending on                 sales, other sizes may be available in the future. The following combinations of                 specialty and nut type will be available initially: Raw almonds, cashews, and hazelnuts Roasted pecans and peanuts Salted pistachios Spicy peanuts Chocolate-covered almonds, cashews, hazelnuts, and peanuts Further suppose that according to the naming policy of matrix items, the identifier                 of each matrix item must contain segments with values that represent all three                 attributes, separated by hyphens. The descriptions of the matrix items must contain                 descriptions of the same attributes, separated by spaces. You as an implementation manger have a task to prepare the system for these nuts to                 be purchased and sold. You will use the functionality of matrix items. Configuration Overview For the purposes of this lesson, the following features have been enabled on the                       ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form: Matrix Items Inventory The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in                 the system: The  WHOLESALE  warehouse on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses (IN204000) form The  MNUTS  item class on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes                     (IN201000) form The following attributes on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) Attributes                     (CS205000) form:  WEIGHT  and  SPECIALTY Process Overview As you create matrix items and specify the related settings to prepare the system for                 matrix items to be purchased and sold, you will do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) Attributes (CS205000) form, create an                     attribute that you will use for the matrix items you will create On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) Attributes form, review the settings of                     the existing attributes, which you will also use for creating matrix items On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000) form, add the                     required attributes to the item class (which has been predefined for your                     convenience) that you will use to provide the default settings for the needed                     template item, and specify the appropriate category for each attribute On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN203000|IN203000]) Template Items (IN203000) form, create the template item                     to be used to create the matrix items On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN203500|IN203500]) Create Matrix Items (IN203500) form, create the matrix                         items You can also create matrix items on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN203000|IN203000]) Template Items form.

The system creates the items and closes                     the dialog box. Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN203000|IN203000]) Template Items (IN203000) form, and select the                          NUTS  template item. On the  Matrix Items  tab, view the list of matrix                     items. You have created all of the matrix items that are based on the  NUTS                  template. Step 6: Reviewing the Settings of a Matrix Item Review the settings of the  ALD-CHT-04OZ  matrix item as follows: While you are still viewing the  Matrix Items  tab on the                           ([~/?ScreenId=IN203000|IN203000]) Template Items (IN203000) form with the  NUTS                      template item selected, click the link in the  Inventory                         ID  column for the  ALD-CHT-04OZ  row. The system opens the                           ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form in a new                     window. On the  General Settings  tab, make sure that the                          NUTS  template item is specified in the  Template                         ID  box. On the  Attributes  tab, view the list of attribute values                     specific to this matrix item. Close the window with the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items                     form. Step 7: Deleting a Matrix Item Suppose that you were told that spicy peanuts cannot be supplied by the vendor, so                 this item is not needed. To delete the stock item for the spicy peanuts, do the                 following: While you are still viewing the  Matrix Items  tab on the                           ([~/?ScreenId=IN203000|IN203000]) Template Items (IN203000) form with the  NUTS                      template item selected, select the check box in the unlabeled column for the                          PNT-SPC-04OZ  row. On the table toolbar, click  Delete . The item is                     deleted. Step 8: Changing the Settings of the Template Item Suppose that you were told that by default, all nuts will be stored in the wholesale                 warehouse. You will specify the warehouse in the template item settings and apply                 this change to existing matrix items based on this template. Do the following: While you are still viewing the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN203000|IN203000]) Template Items (IN203000) form                     with the  NUTS  template item selected, open the  General                         Settings  tab. In the  Default Warehouse  box of the  Warehouse                         Details  section, select  WHOLESALE . On the form toolbar, click  Save . On the form toolbar, click  Apply to Matrix Items . On the  Matrix Items  tab, click the link in the                          Inventory ID  box for the  ALD-CHT-04OZ  row. The                     system opens the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500)                     form. On the  General Settings  tab, make sure that the                          WHOLESALE  warehouse is selected in the  Default                         Warehouse  box of the  Warehouse Details                      section. This means that the default warehouse has been updated for this matrix                     item (and for other matrix items, too). You have successfully created a template item and then created, deleted, and modified                 the settings of the matrix items based on this template item. ]]></column>

The list of inventory items from which employees should select an item can be very long, which increases the probability of an entry error. By using restriction groups, you can reduce the list of inventory items that users see on forms. For more information about restriction groups, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Overview_of_Restriction_Groups|Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP].((({S:Warn}The ''N/A'' item cannot be specified in restriction groups.
)))
For example, suppose that your organization sells furniture, and that each sales manager works with furniture for a particular room, such as kitchen, living room, and bedroom. When managers create a sales order, they should select items from only the list of furniture they sell to avoid entry mistakes. Further suppose that User K sells kitchen furniture, User L sells living room furniture, and User M sells bedroom furniture. To restrict the visibility of inventory items to the appropriate users in the system, you would create the following restriction groups with direct restriction on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_30_00|Inventory Item Access] ([~/?ScreenId=IN103000|IN103000]) form:[anchor|#_cb30ab93-5c66-45d0-9a29-326a00720d31]
#Group K: In this group, include User K and all inventory IDs for kitchen furniture items.
#Group L: To this group, add User L and all inventory IDs for items of living room furniture.
#Group M: In this group, include User M and all inventory IDs for bedroom furniture items.

As a result, the visibility of the inventory items in sales orders will be restricted in the system as follows:[anchor|#_2849d5f9-d042-4dbe-ba52-08cf87492c29]
*User K can view and select only inventory items for kitchen furniture.
*User L can work with only inventory items for living room furniture.
*User M can see and select only inventory items for bedroom furniture.
*Other users cannot see the inventory items that have been added to the three restriction groups in the system.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Inventory Item Security An organization that distributes goods may have many items in stock. In this                     case, users who work with inventory items in the system may have specific tasks                     and work with only particular item classes. When users create a sales order,                     they need to enter an inventory ID for each product. You can define restriction                     groups to limit the lists of inventory items particular users see. In this topic, you will read about managing the visibility of inventory items to                     users in the system. In  Acumatica ERP,             you can configure groups with direct and inverse restriction. In this topic, for             simplicity, groups with direct restriction are used in examples. You can use inverse             restriction groups in the same way as you use direct restriction groups. For details on             the types of restriction groups, see  Types of Restriction Groups. Visibility of Inventory Items to Users The list of inventory items from which employees should select an item can be                     very long, which increases the probability of an entry error. By using                     restriction groups, you can reduce the list of inventory items that users see on                     forms. For more information about restriction groups, see  Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP. The  N/A  item cannot be specified in restriction groups. For example, suppose that your organization sells furniture, and that each sales                     manager works with furniture for a particular room, such as kitchen, living                     room, and bedroom. When managers create a sales order, they should select items                     from only the list of furniture they sell to avoid entry mistakes. Further                     suppose that User K sells kitchen furniture, User L sells living room furniture,                     and User M sells bedroom furniture. To restrict the visibility of inventory                     items to the appropriate users in the system, you would create the following                     restriction groups with direct restriction on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN103000|IN103000]) Inventory Item Access (IN103000) form: Group K: In this group, include User K and all inventory IDs for kitchen                         furniture items. Group L: To this group, add User L and all inventory IDs for items of living                         room furniture. Group M: In this group, include User M and all inventory IDs for bedroom                         furniture items. As a result, the visibility of the inventory items in sales orders will be                     restricted in the system as follows: User K can view and select only inventory items for kitchen furniture. User L can work with only inventory items for living room furniture. User M can see and select only inventory items for bedroom furniture.

An organization can have multiple warehouses in Acumatica ERP, and different groups of employees may work with these warehouses in the system. To limit in the system the set of employees who work with a particular warehouse, you can create restriction groups to display the warehouse for only employees who are responsible for tasks that involve this warehouse. If the employees who work with the same warehouse perform only specific tasks (such as accepting goods and creating purchase orders), you can provide these employees with access to only the forms that they should use.{br}

In this topic, you can find information about configuring the security of warehouses in Acumatica ERP.[anchor|#_98e853b8-e0b4-440b-8a19-485472ea8b0f]((({S:Warn}In Acumatica ERP, you can configure groups with direct and inverse restriction.

For details on the types of restriction groups, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Types_of_Restriction_Groups|Types of Restriction Groups].
))){br}{TOC}
==Usage Scenarios==
The most common scenarios of managing the security of warehouses are the following:[anchor|#_5f60ca2b-471f-457a-bd64-b28264e40516]
*Managing access to forms based on employees&rsquo; functional roles: If employees perform specific tasks (such as receiving goods and creating purchase orders), you can provide the employees access to the forms they use in their work, and revoke access for forms that they shouldn&rsquo;t use. For details, see [[#_7ee4b6ba-c3a5-46d9-a4f7-bd85fda637b4|Access to Forms Based on Roles].
*Managing the visibility of particular warehouses by user: If you have created multiple warehouses in Acumatica ERP, you can restrict the visibility of warehouses to users on forms by using restriction groups. For details, see [[#_83e9713d-f736-4c02-ae67-3ce78bf3c078|Visibility of Warehouses by User].
*:((({S:Warn}You can create and manage multiple warehouses in Acumatica ERP only if the ''Multiple Warehouses'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
)))

In addition to managing the visibility of warehouses in whole, you can restrict the visibility of particular inventory items. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Restriction_Groups_for_Subitems|Inventory Item Security].[anchor|#_7ee4b6ba-c3a5-46d9-a4f7-bd85fda637b4]
==Access to Forms Based on Roles==
By using the forms of the User Security submodule, you can use user roles in Acumatica ERP to give employees access to forms related to working with warehouses. A role can correspond to an area of responsibility for an employee who performs warehouse-related tasks, such as creating purchase orders, accepting goods, and preparing replenishment. If needed, you can assign multiple roles to an employee. For more information about user roles, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Role-Based_Access|Role-Based Access].{br}

Consider the following examples of roles for employees who work with inventory and order management:[anchor|#_c5004388-84a3-44b7-9dd2-dc3f08893db0]
*''Supervisor'': A role for an employee who configures the Inventory submodule and manages work with the submodule. This role should have access to the forms related to inventory processes, such as the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form.
*''Data Entry Clerk'': A role for an employee who creates documents on data entry forms. You should provide access to such forms as [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]), or [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_40_00|Transfers] ([~/?ScreenId=IN304000|IN304000]).
*''Purchasing Manager'': A role for an employee who is responsible for replenishment. For this role, you should provide access to the '''Replenishment''' node of the '''Processes''' tab of the Inventory module.
[anchor|#_83e9713d-f736-4c02-ae67-3ce78bf3c078]
==Visibility of Warehouses by User==
By default, all employees who have access to forms of the inventory and order management modules can see all warehouses created in the system. By using the forms of the Row-Level Security module, you can configure the system so that each warehouse is displayed only to users who work with this warehouse. You can use restriction groups to set up the visibility of warehouses to employees. For details on restriction groups, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Overview_of_Restriction_Groups|Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP].{br}

For example, suppose that your system has the ''Wholesale'' and ''Retail'' warehouses defined, and you need to configure the visibility of these warehouses to users as follows:[anchor|#_db2bdfbf-29ba-46db-b8ad-90113c4268fe]
*User S is a supervisor who should configure and manage both warehouses.
*User C1 is a clerk who enters documents for the ''Wholesale'' warehouse.
*User C2 is a clerk who enters documents for the ''Retail'' warehouse.

To configure the visibility of warehouses according to this example, you do the following on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_20_00|Warehouse Access] ([~/?ScreenId=IN102000|IN102000]) form:[anchor|#_14ead945-ff7d-46b6-b448-96b3a4aea0a6]
#You create two restriction groups of type ''A'' (with direct restriction): ''Group 1'' for the ''Wholesale'' warehouse, and ''Group 2'' for the ''Retail'' warehouse.
#In Group 1, you include User S, User C1, and the ''Wholesale'' warehouse.
#In Group 2, you include User S, User C2, and the ''Retail'' warehouse.

The resulting visibility of warehouses will be the following:[anchor|#_cda8b83f-bba1-4a88-98dc-1c0bbf3d916f]
*User S can see both the ''Wholesale'' and ''Retail'' warehouses.
*User C1 can see only the ''Wholesale'' warehouse.
*User C2 can see only the ''Retail'' warehouse.

Data Entry Clerk : A role for an employee who creates documents on                         data entry forms. You should provide access to such forms as   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) Issues (IN302000),   ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) Receipts (IN301000), or   ([~/?ScreenId=IN304000|IN304000]) Transfers (IN304000).

You can use restriction                     groups to set up the visibility of warehouses to employees. For details on                     restriction groups, see  Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP. For example, suppose that your system has the  Wholesale  and  Retail  warehouses                     defined, and you need to configure the visibility of these warehouses to users                     as follows: User S is a supervisor who should configure and manage both warehouses. User C1 is a clerk who enters documents for the  Wholesale                          warehouse. User C2 is a clerk who enters documents for the  Retail                          warehouse. To configure the visibility of warehouses according to this example, you do the following on the                           ([~/?ScreenId=IN102000|IN102000]) Warehouse Access (IN102000)                     form: You create two restriction groups of type  A  (with direct restriction):  Group 1  for                         the  Wholesale  warehouse, and  Group 2  for the  Retail                          warehouse. In Group 1, you include User S, User C1, and the  Wholesale  warehouse. In Group 2, you include User S, User C2, and the  Retail  warehouse.

A kit is a bundle of stock and non-stock items that increases the value of the kit components. In Acumatica ERP, you can use kits of inventory items if your organization sells multiple inventory items together and wants to track these items as a whole. For example, suppose that an organization sells cheese and wine and also offers nicely packed baskets with a bottle of wine and a set of cheese that pairs well with this wine. To track these baskets in inventory, the organization uses kits, which include a bottle of wine, several cheeses, and a basket as stock items, and the delivery service and packaging as non-stock items.((({S:Warn}To use the kit functionality, make sure the ''Kit Assembly'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.

In this topic, you will read about kit types and revisions of kit specifications.{br}{TOC}
==Kit Types==
You can create stock and non-stock kits. The main difference between these kit types is that the system tracks stock kits in inventory and does not track non-stock kits. The table below compares stock and non-stock kits.[anchor|#table_yfs_ffm_qy]

==Kit Specifications and Revisions==
To represent kits in the system, you create specifications, which define the stock and non-stock items included in a kit, by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_95_00|Kit Specifications] ([~/?ScreenId=IN209500|IN209500]) form. Each specification has at least one ''revision'', which is automatically created when you create a specification. A revision is a version of the same kit, which has minor differences from the previous version. For example, suppose that your organization sells computers and offers a keyboard, a mouse, a leather case, and software installation service as a kit. If you change the vendor of leather cases, you can just change the inventory item for the case in the kit instead of creating a new kit.{br}

For stock kits, you can create multiple revisions of the same specification. When you assemble a stock kit, you can use only the latest revision. If you need to disassemble a stock kit, you select the revision that was used for kit assembly.{br}

For non-stock kits, only one revision is created when you create a specification by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_95_00|Kit Specifications] form. You cannot add multiple revisions, as for stock kits.{br}

For each stock or non-stock kit revision, you can allow users to add components to the kit during assembly by selecting the '''Allow Component Addition''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_95_00|Kit Specifications] form and to change the quantity of components in the kit by selecting the '''Allow Component Qty. Variance''' check box for each kit component.
Suppose that you are including in a kit specification stock components with the '''Divisible Unit''' check box cleared for the base UOMs on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. When you type the quantity in the '''Component Qty.''' box on the '''Stock Components''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_95_00|Kit Specifications] form, the system validates the quantities of the components included in the kit, making sure they are integers. If they are not, an error message is displayed, and you cannot save the specification until you type an integer quantity.

A stock kit is a bundle of stock and non-stock components. You create each kit and add it to inventory by processing a production transaction. The kit production subtracts the stock components from inventory and adds the kit units to inventory instead. After you have assembled a kit, you can disassemble it back to its components. When a stock kit is sold, one line item appears in the transaction, and the on-hand quantity of the kit is reduced.{br}

In this topic, you will find details about the configuration, assembly, disassembly, and cost calculation of stock kits.{br}{TOC}
==Configuration of Stock Kits==
You do the following to configure a stock kit:[anchor|#_63d4a36d-6746-432c-b903-67587431857f]
#You create item classes for kits with similar settings by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Item_Classes_Implem_Activity|Item Classes for Stock Items: Implementation Activity].
#You create as many kits as you need by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. To indicate that each item is a kit, you select the '''Is a Kit''' check box on the '''General Settings''' tab of this form. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Create_Stock_Kit|To Create a Stock Kit].
#You create a specification for each kit by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_95_00|Kit Specifications] ([~/?ScreenId=IN209500|IN209500]) form. In the specification, you select the items that will be included in the kit and specify the settings of each component. Any lot- and serial-tracked stock items can be added to the specification of a stock kit. For details on this step, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Create_Specification_for_Stock_Kit|To Create a Specification for a Stock Kit].
#You create and release a kit assembly document by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_70_00|Kit Assembly] ([~/?ScreenId=IN307000|IN307000]) form. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Assemble_Stock_Kit|To Assemble a Stock Kit].
#You assign sales prices to kits as follows:
#*If you sell a limited number of kits, you assign the default prices on a per-kit basis by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form.
#*If you are selling more than ten kits, you assign multiple sales prices to kits by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_10|Sales Price Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202010|AR202010]) form.

A stock kit may require a serial or lot number and an expiration date to be assigned when the kit is produced or sold, depending on the item class settings. For details on lot and serial numbers, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Lot_and_Serial_Numbers_GeneralInfo|Items with Lot and Serial Numbers: General Information].{br}

You can disassemble a stock kit at any time. You may want to do this, for example, when its expiration date has approached.
==Assembly and Disassembly of Stock Kits==
You must assemble a stock kit by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_70_00|Kit Assembly] ([~/?ScreenId=IN307000|IN307000]) form before you add the kit to a sales order. The kit assembly document lists the components with their quantities and costs, as determined by the kit specification. Each time a stock kit is assembled and its kit assembly document is released, the on-hand quantities of the items used as components are automatically decreased, and the on-hand quantity of the kits is increased. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Assemble_Stock_Kit|To Assemble a Stock Kit].{br}

On assembly of stock kits, the standard costs of the kit&rsquo;s non-stock components are recorded to the Expense Accrual accounts specified by the '''Use Inventory/Accrual Account From''' setting of the posting class (on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) form) of each of the non-stock components.{br}

If disassembly might be required for a stock kit (for example, because of an expiration date), it can be performed in accordance with the revision used to assemble the kit. You can create and release a disassembly document with the ''Disassembly'' operation selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_70_00|Kit Assembly] form. The quantity of components extracted from the kit is estimated using the disassembly coefficient specified for each stock component. However, the quantities of stock components and non-stock components are not validated in any way, and you can manually adjust the calculated quantities.{br}

For details about how to disassemble a stock kit, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Disassemble_Stock_Kit|To Disassemble a Stock Kit].{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_70_00|Kit Assembly] ([~/?ScreenId=IN307000|IN307000]) form, when you assemble or disassemble a kit for which the '''Divisible Unit''' check box is cleared for the base UOMs on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, the system validates the quantity of the kit: It checks to be sure that the quantity is an integer and displays an error message if it is not.{br}

If a kit that you assemble or disassemble includes stock components for which the '''Divisible Unit''' check box is cleared for the base UOMs on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form, the system also validates the quantities of the stock components in the document. It makes sure that the quantities are integers and displays an error message if they are not.
==Cost Calculation For Stock Kits==
The assembly of stock kits (with valuation methods other than the standard cost method) creates a new cost layer. The cost of a stock kit is calculated based on the costs of components when the document is released. The total cost of the kit is the total cost of stock components according to the specification&rsquo;s revision, the cost of components added during assembly, and the rates of non-stock components of the ''Labor'' and ''Service'' types multiplied by their quantities.{br}

If the standard cost method is used for the stock kit, any difference between the currently effective standard cost and the total cost of components is recorded (as with non-stock kits) to the Standard Cost Variance account determined by the posting class of the stock kit.{br}

When a stock kit is disassembled, the costs of its stock components, which are returned to inventory, are calculated depending on the valuation method of the components as follows:[anchor|#ul_txg_lkh_yx]
*''Average'': The cost of the component is calculated based on the setting of the '''Avg. Default Returns Cost''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form. By default, this setting is the average cost of the item at the warehouse. You can also select the last cost as the value of this box.
*''FIFO'': The cost of the component is calculated based on the setting of the '''FIFO Default Returns Cost''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] form. By default, this setting is the average cost of the item at the warehouse. You can also select the last cost as the value of this box.
*''Specific'': The cost of the component is the average cost of the item at the warehouse. If there is no average cost of the item at the warehouse, the last cost of the item at the warehouse is used.
*''Standard'': The cost of the component is the standard cost of the item at the warehouse, if any standard cost is defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form. Otherwise, the global standard cost of the item defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form is used.

==Lot and Serial Numbers for Kits==
If component parts as well as assembled kits have lot or serial numbers, your company will know precisely which assembled kits contain any component, if this information is requested by the component manufacturer.

In the specification, you select the items that will be      included in the kit and specify the settings of each component. Any lot- and serial-tracked      stock items can be added to the specification of a stock kit. For details on this step, see        To Create a Specification for a Stock Kit. You create and release a kit assembly document by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN307000|IN307000]) Kit Assembly      (IN307000) form. For details, see  To Assemble a Stock Kit. You assign sales prices to kits as follows: If you sell a limited number of kits, you assign the default prices on a per-kit basis by        using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form. If you are selling more than ten kits, you assign multiple sales prices to kits by using        the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR202010|AR202010]) Sales Price Worksheets (AR202010) form.

If a kit that you assemble or disassemble includes stock components for which the       Divisible Unit  check box is cleared for the base UOMs on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form, the system also validates the quantities of the     stock components in the document. It makes sure that the quantities are integers and displays an     error message if they are not. Cost Calculation For Stock Kits The assembly of stock kits (with valuation methods other than the standard cost method)     creates a new cost layer. The cost of a stock kit is calculated based on the costs of components     when the document is released. The total cost of the kit is the total cost of stock components     according to the specification's revision, the cost of components added during assembly, and the     rates of non-stock components of the  Labor  and  Service  types multiplied by their     quantities. If the standard cost method is used for the stock kit, any difference between the currently     effective standard cost and the total cost of components is recorded (as with non-stock kits) to     the Standard Cost Variance account determined by the posting class of the stock kit. When a stock kit is disassembled, the costs of its stock components, which are returned to     inventory, are calculated depending on the valuation method of the components as follows: Average : The cost of the component is calculated based on the setting of the        Avg. Default Returns Cost  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses      (IN204000) form. By default, this setting is the average cost of the item at the warehouse. You      can also select the last cost as the value of this box. FIFO : The cost of the component is calculated based on the setting of the        FIFO Default Returns Cost  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses      form. By default, this setting is the average cost of the item at the warehouse. You can also      select the last cost as the value of this box. Specific : The cost of the component is the average cost of the item at the warehouse.      If there is no average cost of the item at the warehouse, the last cost of the item at the      warehouse is used. Standard : The cost of the component is the standard cost of the item at the      warehouse, if any standard cost is defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details (IN204500)      form. Otherwise, the global standard cost of the item defined on the    ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form is used. Lot and Serial Numbers for Kits If component parts as well as assembled kits have lot or serial numbers, your company will         know precisely which assembled kits contain any component, if this information is requested         by the component manufacturer.

A non-stock kit is a bundle of stock and non-stock components; you assign an individual inventory identifier to the non-stock kit, and it can be selected in sales orders. Non-stock kits are virtual kits because they neither produced nor tracked in inventory, unlike stock kits. The stock components of the non-stock kit remain in inventory and can be sold in the kit or as separate units.{br}

In this topic, you will read about the configuration, processing, and cost calculation of non-stock kits.{br}{TOC}[anchor|#nonstockkits]
==Configuration of Non-Stock Kits==
When you create a non-stock kit, you do the following:[anchor|#_a8651c20-e547-4259-8087-5559ccb78e43]
#If you need to create a number of kits with similar settings, you create an item class for each group of kits by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form.
#You create as many kits as you need by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. To indicate that an item is a kit, you select the '''Is a Kit''' check box on the '''General Settings''' tab of this form. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Create_Non_Stock_Kit|To Create a Non-Stock Kit].
#You create a specification for each kit by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_95_00|Kit Specifications] ([~/?ScreenId=IN209500|IN209500]) form. In the specification, you select the inventory items that will be included in the kit and specify the settings of each component. Any lot- and serial-tracked stock items can be added to the specification of a non-stock kit, except for items with the ''When Used'' assignment method or with the ''User-Enterable'' issue method specified for their lot/serial classes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_70_00|Lot/Serial Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) form. For details on this step, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Create_Specification_for_Non_Stock_Kit|To Create a Specification for a Non-Stock Kit].
#You assign sales prices to kits as follows:
#*If you sell a limited number of kits, you assign the default prices on a per-kit basis by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form.
#*If you are selling more than ten kits, you assign multiple sales prices to kits by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_10|Sales Price Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202010|AR202010]) form.

==Processing of Non-Stock Kits ==
As with non-stock items, non-stock kits are not stocked. When non-stock kits are added to a sales order, the items are gathered for the sale but no preliminary assembly has been performed. When a non-stock kit is listed on a sales order as a line item, its stock components are specified on a pick list and shipped to the customer. Upon shipment confirmation, the quantity of stock components is decreased while the quantities of non-stock components and kits are not tracked in any way.{br}

On release of a Sales Order invoice for a non-stock kit with stock components, the system generates an inventory issue; on release of the inventory issue, the system debits the COGS accounts of the stock components, thus updating the stock components&rsquo; costs. On the sale of a non-stock kit with only non-stock components, no inventory issue is generated.{br}

When you process a sale of a non-stock kit, its stock components are issued from inventory, and the sales revenue from all components of the kit is recorded to accounts.{br}

For a non-stock kit that includes stock components for which the '''Divisible Unit''' check box is cleared for base UOMs on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form, when a user creates and saves a shipment for a sales order with at least one such kit, the system validates the quantity of each component included in the specified quantity of the kit, making sure that it is an integer. If the quantity of any component is not an integer, the system displays an error message. The shipment is not created or is created but placed on hold, depending on the state of the '''Hold Shipments on Entry''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form. When a user creates and saves a receipt for a purchase order that includes at least one non-stock kit with similar stock components, the system works similarly.
==Calculation of Cost for Non-Stock Kits==
The cost of a non-stock kit may include the cost of the kit itself and the costs of all stock components included in the kit. You can select one of the following cost calculation rules on in the '''Cost Calculation Basis for Non-Stock Kits''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form:[anchor|#_0a245417-0290-4289-b75e-38c12b9f6352]
*''Stock Component Cost'': The system will use the sum of the costs of the kit&rsquo;s stock components as the cost of a non-stock kit. You can select this rule if the kit does not include non-stock components or the value of the included non-stock components is very low.
*''Non-Stock Kit Standard Cost'': The system will use the standard current cost of the non-stock kit. You can select this rule if the kit does not include stock components or the value of the included stock components is very low.
*''Non-Stock Kit Standard Cost Plus Stock Component Cost'': The system will calculate the sum of the standard current cost of a non-stock kit and the costs of the stock components of this kit.

You can enter the kit standard cost directly in the '''Pending Cost''' box on the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form when you create or modify the non-stock kit.((({S:Warn}Only the ''Standard Cost'' valuation method may be assigned to non-stock kits. For more information, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Item_Costs_and_Valuation_Methods|Item Costs and Valuation Methods].

In Acumatica ERP, item classes are used to group stock or non-stock items with similar properties and to provide default settings for new items. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form, you can create item classes for stock items as well as for non-stock items of each type that is used in your business. The item class is a required parameter of a stock item; the item class includes the settings that are used for availability calculation, replenishment, price management, and posting to the general ledger. A user specifies an item class when they define a new stock or non-stock item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form respectively, and the system fills in many values, thus saving users time and increasing the accuracy of the entered data.{br}

You can also use item classes for categorizing items. To do this, you can set the hierarchy of the item classes directly in the item class IDs. The sections below describe the specifics of configuring item classes and using them for categorizing inventory items.{br}{TOC}
==Planning the Item Class Hierarchy==
The structure of item class IDs is defined by the ''INITEMCLASS'' segmented key, which you can review and modify on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form. This segmented key has a hierarchical structure—that is, each segment of the segmented key defines the hierarchical level. You can review the item class hierarchy in the '''Item Class Tree''' pane on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form. In this pane, each item class is represented as a tree node if it has child item classes, or as a leaf of a tree if it has no child item classes.{br}

After you have defined the structure of the ''INITEMCLASS'' segmented key, the system shows the mask that corresponds to this structure in any box that requires the user to enter an item class ID. The characters in the mask that aren&rsquo;t yet specified are denoted with ''&#42;''; the segments are divided with the separator character specified in the '''Delimiter''' column on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] form for ''INITEMCLASS'' (''-'' by default). For example, if you have specified three segments of two symbols each, the mask shown in a box where an item class ID must be entered will be &#42;&#42;-&#42;&#42;-&#42;&#42;.{br}

If the ''INITEMCLASS'' segmented key has one segment, the item classes will have a plain structure with no nested levels (see Example 1 on the diagram below). If you are going to use a plain structure of the item classes, you have to specify a sufficient length of the only segment so you can specify as many classes as you need.{br}

If you specify two or more segments in the ''INITEMCLASS'' segmented key, each segment after the first segment defines a subsequent level of hierarchy. Item classes that have the second segment specified are displayed at the second level of hierarchy. An item class segment of the second level directly refers to the parent item class segment of the first level. That is, under different parent item classes, you can create child item classes with the same ID of the second segment but different settings; see ''20-10 (Technical Literature)'' and ''30-10 (Paper)'' in Example 2 on the diagram below.{br}

By adding more segments to the segmented key, you can expand your ability to categorize items by item classes. For instance, you could add a third level (see the hierarchy in Example 3 on the diagram below) to make your inventory categorization even more comprehensive and flexible. By using the ''INITEMCLASS'' segmented key, you can specify as many levels as you need. You can append a new segment to the key at any time; however, we recommend that you carefully plan the structure of the segmented key before you start to create and use item classes.[anchor|#fig_xxq_my5_h1b][anchor|#image_yxq_my5_h1b][image:UserGuide/Images/IN_CON_ItemClassDiagram.png|popup|Item class hierarchy|450px]
==Specifying Default Item Classes==
When you create an item class (stock or non-stock) that is the child of any other item class, the system suggests the default settings of the parent class. For the classes at the first level of the item class hierarchy, which have no parent classes that could provide default settings, you can specify the default item classes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form as follows:[anchor|#ul_y2z_bx1_31b]
*In the '''Default Stock Item Class''' box, you can select the stock item class whose settings will be used by default for newly created stock item classes.
*In the '''Default Non-Stock Item Class''' box, you can select the non-stock item class whose settings will be used by default for newly created non-stock item classes.

==Sequentially Selecting Child Segment Values==
When you create a new item class or enter an item class ID in any appropriate box in the system, you have to specify the needed symbols according to the mask of the ''INITEMCLASS'' segmented key. If you skip any of the characters in any segment, the system shows &#42; instead of a blank symbol. When you enter an item class ID, you can either enter each segment value manually, or press F3 and select the segment value from the list. For the first segment, only the segment values of the first level of hierarchy are displayed in the selection box. For each subsequent segment, in the selection list, the system shows the child segment values that are appropriate based on the previous segment or segments selected.((({S:Warn}The way the system narrows the list of segment values based on previously selected values is defined by the ''By Segments: Child Segment Values'' option selected in the '''Lookup Mode''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form; this option is the default for the ''INITEMCLASS'' segmented key. For the description of other lookup options, see the [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Identifier_Segmentation|Segmented Identifiers] topic.
)))
==Mass-Updating Settings of Item Classes==
Suppose that you have changed some settings of a parent item class. When you changed these settings, they will apply to all newly created item classes of this parent item class, but these changes do not influence the settings of the existing child item classes of this parent item class. So if you need to have these changed settings reflected in all child item classes, you need to update them as well.{br}

To simplify the process of updating multiple child item classes, you can automatically apply the settings of the parent item class to all its child item classes. To do this, while viewing the parent class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form, you click '''Actions &gt; Apply to Children''' on the form toolbar. After you confirm the action, the system updates all the settings of the children of this item class on all levels of the hierarchy, so that all item classes of this tree node have identical settings.
==Deleting Item Classes with Children==
You can delete only those item classes to which no inventory items have been assigned yet. To delete an item class, you open the class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form and click '''Delete''' on the form toolbar. When you delete a parent item class, the system asks whether you want to keep the child item classes of this parent. The system proceeds as follows based on your response:[anchor|#ul_kjk_34b_31b]
*If you click '''Yes''' in the message box, the system deletes the parent item class and keeps all its the children in the hierarchy. The children item classes becomes the children of the item class at the level immediately above the deleted item class.
*If you click '''No''' in the message box, the system deletes the entire tree node of the item class hierarchy (that is, the parent item class along with all of its child item classes).

==Moving Item Classes Within the Hierarchy==
A change of one segment or multiple segments in an item class ID may influence the position of the item class in the tree. To change an item class ID, click '''Actions &gt; Change ID''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form, and specify the new ID in the dialog box that opens. When you confirm the action, the item class ID changes, and the system rebuilds the item class hierarchy.
==Reviewing the Items of the Item Class==
You can review the inventory items that belong to a particular item class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_80_00|Inventory By Item Class] ([~/?ScreenId=IN408000|IN408000]) form. The left pane of this form shows the tree of item classes. When you click an item class in the tree, the right pane of the form shows the inventory items that belong to this class.{br}

The '''Show Items''' option button specified on the right pane determines which inventory items are listed: By default, the '''Related to Only the Current Item Class'''option button is selected, which means that the table displays only the items that belong to the selected item class. To make the system show the inventory items that belong to the selected item class, along with inventory items that belong to all child item classes of the selected item class, select the '''Related to the Current and Child Item Classes''' option button.{br}

Also, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_80_00|Inventory By Item Class] form, you can quickly review to which item class a particular item belongs and which other inventory items belong to this class. To do this, select the particular inventory item by its ID in the '''Inventory ID''' box. Once you do, the system selects the item class to which the item belongs in the tree of item classes and shows all inventory items of this class in the table.
==Moving Inventory Items to Another Item Class==
For a single stock or non-stock inventory item, you can change the item class in the item&rsquo;s settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form or [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, respectively. 
If you need to move multiple inventory items to another item class at a time, you can use the cut and paste functionality on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_80_00|Inventory By Item Class] ([~/?ScreenId=IN408000|IN408000]) form. To do this, on this form, click the item class to which the needed items currently belong in the '''Item Class Tree''', select the unlabeled check boxes in the rows with the needed inventory items in the table on the right pane, and click the '''Cut Selected Records''' button on the table toolbar of the right pane. The system copies the selected rows to the clipboard. Then, in the '''Item Class Tree''', click the destination item class (the class into which you want to move the selected items), and on the table toolbar of the right pane, click the '''Paste Records''' button. The system asks whether you want to keep the settings of the moved items:[anchor|#ul_olf_ylc_31b]
*If you click '''Yes''' in the message box, the system updates the settings of the moved items to the settings of the destination item class.
*If you click '''No''' in the message box, the system keeps the settings of the moved items unchanged.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Hierarchy of Item Classes  In  Acumatica ERP,     item classes are used to group stock or non-stock items with similar properties and to provide     default settings for new items. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000) form, you     can create item classes for stock items as well as for non-stock items of each type that is used     in your business. The item class is a required parameter      of     a stock item ;      the      item class includes the settings that are used for availability calculation,     replenishment, price management, and posting to the general ledger. A user specifies an item     class when they define a new stock or non-stock item on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items     (IN202500) or   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form respectively, and the system     fills in many values, thus saving users time and increasing the accuracy of the entered     data. You can also use item classes      for     categorizing items . To do this, you can set the hierarchy of the item classes     directly in the item class IDs. The sections below describe the specifics of configuring item     classes and using them for categorizing inventory items. Planning the Item Class Hierarchy The structure of item class IDs is defined by the  INITEMCLASS  segmented key, which you     can review and modify on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) Segmented Keys (CS202000) form. This segmented     key has a hierarchical structure—that is, each segment of the segmented key      def ines      the hierarchical level. You can review the item class hierarchy in the  Item Class      Tree  pane on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000) form. In this pane,     each item class is represented as a tree node if it has child item classes, or as a leaf of a     tree if it has no child item classes. After you have defined the structure of the  INITEMCLASS  segmented key, the system shows     the mask that corresponds to this structure in any box that requires the user to enter an item     class ID. The characters in the mask that aren't yet specified are denoted with  * ; the     segments are divided with the separator character specified in the       Delimiter  column on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) Segmented Keys form for       INITEMCLASS  ( -  by default). For example, if you have specified three segments of     two symbols each, the mask shown in a box where an item class ID must be entered will be     **-**-**. If the  INITEMCLASS  segmented key has one segment, the item classes will have a      plain      structure with no nested levels (see Example 1 on the diagram below). If you are going to use a     plain structure of the item classes, you have to specify a sufficient length of the only segment     so you can specify as many classes as you need. If you specify two or more segments in the  INITEMCLASS  segmented key, each segment     after the first segment defines a subsequent level of hierarchy. Item classes that have the     second segment specified are displayed at the second level of hierarchy. An item class segment     of the second level     d irectly     refers  to the parent item class segment of the first level. That is, under     different parent item classes, you can create child item classes with the      same     ID of the second segment  but different settings; see  20-10 (Technical      Literature)  and  30-10 (Paper)  in Example 2 on the diagram below. By adding more segments to the segmented key, you can expand your ability to categorize items     by item classes. For instance, you could add a third level (see the hierarchy in Example 3 on     the diagram below) to make your inventory categorization even more comprehensive and flexible.     By using the  INITEMCLASS  segmented key, you can specify as many levels as you need. You     can append a new segment to the key at any time; however, we recommend that you carefully plan     the structure of the segmented key before you start to create and use item classes. Item class hierarchy Specifying Default Item Classes When you create an item class (stock or non-stock) that is the child of any other item class,     the system suggests the default settings of the parent class. For the classes at the first level     of the item class hierarchy, which have no parent classes that could provide default settings,     you can specify the default item classes on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000)     form as follows: In the  Default Stock Item Class  box, you can select the stock item      class whose settings will be used by default for newly created stock item classes. In the  Default Non-Stock Item Class  box, you can select the non-stock      item class whose settings will be used by default for newly created non-stock item      classes. Sequentially Selecting Child Segment Values When you create a new item class or enter an item class ID in any appropriate box in the     system, you have to specify the needed symbols according to the mask of the  INITEMCLASS      segmented key. If you skip any of the characters in any segment, the system shows * instead of a     blank symbol. When you enter an item class ID, you can either enter each segment value manually,     or press F3 and select the segment value from the list. For the first segment, only the segment     values of the first level of hierarchy are displayed in the selection box. For each subsequent     segment, in the selection list, the system shows the child segment values that are appropriate     based on the previous segment or segments selected. The way the system narrows the list of segment values based on previously selected values     is defined by the  By Segments: Child Segment Values  option selected in the       Lookup Mode  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) Segmented Keys (CS202000)     form; this option is the default for the  INITEMCLASS  segmented key. For the description     of other lookup options, see the  Segmented Identifiers     topic. Mass-Updating Settings of Item Classes Suppose that you have changed some settings of a parent item class. When you changed these     settings, they will apply to all newly created item classes of this parent item class, but these     changes do not influence the settings of the existing child item classes of this parent item     class. So if you need to have these changed settings reflected in all child item classes, you     need to update them as well. To simplify the process of updating multiple child item classes, you can automatically apply     the settings of the parent item class to all its child item classes. To do this, while viewing     the parent class on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000) form, you click  Actions > Apply to Children  on the form toolbar. After you confirm the action, the system updates all the     settings of the children of this item class on all levels of the hierarchy, so that      all     item classes of this tree node have identical settings . Deleting Item Classes with Children You can delete only those item classes to which no inventory items have been assigned yet. To     delete an item class, you open the class on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000)     form and click  Delete  on the form toolbar. When you delete a parent item     class, the system asks whether you want to keep the child item classes of this parent. The     system proceeds as follows based on your response: If you click  Yes  in the message box, the system deletes the parent      item class and keeps all its the children in the hierarchy. The children item classes becomes      the children of the item class at the level immediately above the deleted item class. If you click  No  in the message box, the system deletes the entire      tree node of the item class hierarchy (that is, the parent item class along with all of its      child item classes). Moving Item Classes Within the Hierarchy A change of one segment or multiple segments in an item class ID may influence the position of     the item class in the tree. To change an item class ID, click  Actions > Change ID  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000) form,     and specify the new ID in the dialog box that opens. When you confirm the action, the item class     ID changes, and the system rebuilds the item class hierarchy. Reviewing the Items of the Item Class You can review the inventory items that belong to a particular item class on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN408000|IN408000]) Inventory By Item Class (IN408000) form. The left pane of this form shows the tree of item     classes. When you click an item class in the tree, the right pane of the form shows the     inventory items that belong to this class. The  Show Items  option button specified on the right pane determines     which inventory items are listed: By default, the  Related to Only the Current Item      Class option button is selected, which means that the table displays only the items     that belong to the selected item class. To make the system show the inventory items that belong     to the selected item class, along with inventory items that belong to all child item classes of     the selected item class, select the  Related to the Current and Child Item      Classes  option button. Also, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN408000|IN408000]) Inventory By Item Class form, you can quickly review to which item class     a particular item belongs and which other inventory items belong to this class. To do this,     select the particular inventory item by its ID in the  Inventory ID  box.     Once you do, the system selects the item class to which the item belongs in the tree of item     classes and shows all inventory items of this class in the table. Moving Inventory Items to Another Item Class For a single stock or non-stock inventory item, you can change the item class in the item's     settings on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form or   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form, respectively.  If you need to move multiple inventory items to another item class at a time, you can use the     cut and paste functionality on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN408000|IN408000]) Inventory By Item Class (IN408000) form. To do     this, on this form, click the item class to which the needed items currently belong in the       Item Class Tree , select the unlabeled check boxes in the rows with the     needed inventory items in the table on the right pane, and click the  Cut Selected      Records  button on the table toolbar of the right pane. The system copies the     selected rows to the clipboard. Then, in the  Item Class Tree , click the     destination item class (the class into which you want to move the selected items), and on the     table toolbar of the right pane, click the  Paste Records  button. The     system asks whether you want to keep the settings of the moved items: If you click  Yes  in the message box, the system updates the settings      of the moved items to the settings of the destination item class. If you click  No  in the message box, the system keeps the settings of      the moved items unchanged. ]]></column>

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
For convenience during the processing of purchase and sales orders, in Acumatica ERP, you can define the relationships between the inventory item identifiers maintained by your company and those used by your vendors and customers. These cross-references associate the internal inventory ID of an inventory item with an alternate ID for the item that is used by the vendor or customer. For information on inventory IDs, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Inventory_IDs_and_Subitem_Codes|Inventory Subitems].{br}

Once these cross-references are established in the system, when you enter a customer&rsquo;s sales order and specify the alternate ID for an inventory item, the system inserts the associated inventory ID and item price in the order line. Cross-referencing saves time that would be spent on handling customer and vendor orders and helps you avoid costly errors. You can also enable the ability to load prices specified by alternate IDs to sales price worksheets and vendor price worksheets. {br}

The types of cross-references that are supported in Acumatica ERP are described in the sections below.{br}{TOC}
==Using Alternate IDs==
You can manage cross-references for inventory items in the Inventory module. You create cross-references by using the '''Cross-References''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form for a stock item and of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form for a non-stock item. When you add a cross-reference to the table on the '''Cross-References''' tab, you select one of the following types in the '''Alternate Type''' column:[anchor|#ul_fmq_swd_zz]
*''Global'': This is a global cross-reference for the item. For this type, you do not need to specify a particular customer or vendor. You can use global alternate IDs in sales orders, invoices, purchase orders, purchase receipts, purchase requests and purchase requisitions, sales price worksheets, and vendor price worksheets.
*''Customer Part Number'': The alternate ID is specific to a particular customer (specified in the '''Customer/Vendor '''column); this ID can be used in sales orders.
*''Vendor Part Number'': The alternate ID is specific to a particular vendor (specified in the '''Customer/Vendor '''column); this ID can be used in purchase orders and purchase requisitions.
*''Barcode'': The barcode associated with the item. You can use barcodes in sales orders, invoices, purchase orders, purchase receipts, purchase requests and purchase requisitions, sales price worksheets, and vendor price worksheets.

If subitems are used in your system to split an inventory ID by item properties (such as color, fabric, or size), alternate IDs are specified for the inventory ID–subitem pair. The way alternate IDs are specified depends on whether the partner (the customer or vendor) uses the same classification of items or its classification has more or fewer details than are maintained in Acumatica ERP. If the partner IDs include classification by properties specified by subitem, you match its IDs to your inventory ID–subitem pairs. If the partner&rsquo;s alternate IDs don&rsquo;t include classification provided by subitems, you use the partner IDs concatenated with subitems as alternate IDs. In any case, to ensure unique identification by alternate IDs, you should establish internal rules on specifying alternate IDs. {br}

If subitems are not used in your system along with inventory IDs to identify inventory, then for each inventory item, you can provide multiple alternate IDs used by customers and by vendors. You can also specify alternate IDs specific to particular units of measure, as described in the sections below.{br}

The system does not verify the uniqueness of alternate IDs in the system. However, an alternate ID is unique for each vendor or customer, and you can find the items you want to add to an order by typing their alternate IDs in the '''Inventory ID''' column on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. 
==Configuring the ''INVENTORY'' Segmented Key==
If you plan to use customer and vendor alternate IDs for stock and non-stock items, keep in mind that alternate IDs may have more characters than you have planned for your inventory IDs and that they may have different lengths in the systems of different vendors and customers. To avoid inserting unnecessary zeros or other characters in each inventory ID, take into account the following recommendations when you configure the ''INVENTORY'' segmented key on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form: [anchor|#ol_mg1_1hc_sv]
#You should configure the ''INVENTORY'' segmented key as a single-segment key. The length of the segment must be equal to the maximum possible length of alternate IDs.
#You select the ''Unicode'' option in the '''Edit Mask''' column for this segment of the ''INVENTORY'' segmented key. Otherwise, errors may result from alternate IDs that contain numbers, letters, special characters, and spaces.
#If you plan to use automatic numbering for inventory items, you should do the following:
##Select the '''Auto-Number''' option for the segment.
## In the '''Numbering ID''' box, select the numbering sequence to be used to generate identifiers for new items. This numbering sequence may be defined on [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_10_10|Numbering Sequences] ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) form with the '''Start Number''' and '''End Number''' that have fewer characters than the segment length. 
#If you plan to enter the inventory IDs for items manually, you should make sure the '''Validate''' check box is cleared for the segment—then the users will be able to enter identifiers with less characters than the specified segment length. 

==Using Customer Alternate IDs==
Customer alternate IDs are inventory identifiers (such as part numbers) used by customers for the items. Because different customers may use different identifiers to refer to the same product (defined as an item in Acumatica ERP), you can create multiple alternate IDs for the product (one for each customer per item). You can specify a customer alternate ID for an item by using the '''Cross-References''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form or the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. {br}

If you have specified an alternate ID for the item, the system shows this ID in the '''Alternate ID''' column on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. If you enter a new value in this column while editing a sales order, the system will create a new customer-specific alternate ID or replace the existing customer-specific alternate ID for the item specified in the document line.{br}

When you create a sales order, once you select the customer, you can add each item to the order by typing its alternate ID (that is, the alternate ID associated with this customer) in the '''Inventory ID''' column. Once you enter the alternate ID, the system will automatically search for the stock or non-stock item and insert its settings in the document line. When you add items to a sales order by using the '''Inventory Lookup''' dialog box, which you invoke by clicking the '''Add Stock Item''' button on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, you can also search for stock items in this dialog box by alternate ID.((({S:Warn}The '''Alternate ID''' column in the '''Inventory Lookup''' dialog box becomes populated only after you have typed a string in the '''Inventory''' box and the system has performed a search for the items with inventory IDs, alternate IDs, and descriptions that match the string.
)))
==Using Vendor Alternate IDs==
Vendor alternate IDs are inventory identifiers used by your company&rsquo;s vendors for the product (defined as an item in Acumatica ERP). As with customer alternate IDs, you can maintain multiple vendor alternate IDs (one for each vendor per item) in the Inventory module. You can specify a vendor alternate ID for an item by using the '''Cross-References''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form or the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. {br}

If you have specified an alternate ID for an item, the system shows this ID in the '''Alternate ID''' column on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. If you enter a new value in this column while editing a purchase order, the system will create a new vendor-specific alternate ID or replace the existing vendor-specific alternate ID for the item specified in the document line.{br}

When you create a purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form, once you select the vendor, you can add each item to the order by typing its alternate ID (that is, the alternate ID associated with this vendor) in the '''Inventory ID''' column. Once you enter the alternate ID, the system will automatically search for the stock or non-stock item and insert its settings in the document line. When you add items to a purchase order by using the '''Inventory Lookup''' dialog box, which you invoke by clicking the '''Add Item''' button on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, you can also search for the stock items in this dialog box by alternate ID.((({S:Warn}The '''Alternate ID''' column in the '''Inventory Lookup''' dialog box becomes populated only after you have typed a string in the '''Inventory''' box and the system has performed a search for the items with inventory IDs, alternate IDs, and descriptions that match the string.
)))
==Using Vendor Catalogs==
For inventory items your company frequently purchases from a particular vendor, you can maintain a vendor catalog on either the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_20_10_00|Vendor Inventory] ([~/?ScreenId=PO201000|PO201000]) form or the '''Vendor Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. Along with alternate IDs, you can specify the vendor's last prices for the items and update them with the prices quoted on vendor documents, such as receipts or even purchase orders. When they create purchase orders, users will be able to see the vendor's last prices for the items listed on the orders. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_Vendor_Catalog|Vendor Catalogs]. 
==Using Barcodes==
Most products (items) that are sold or purchased have barcodes. A barcode is a machine-readable graphical representation of data that contains information about the product to which the barcode is attached. A special scanner is used to read the information encoded in the image. Scanner software converts barcodes to alphanumeric strings. Barcodes are specific to the company that manufactures or resells the products. Different barcode standards are used for different types of products and in different world regions. {br}

With Acumatica ERP, you can use barcodes as alternate IDs for inventory items. On creating a receipt by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, a user scans a barcode of the product and associates it with the inventory ID used for this product in the system. {br}

Alternatively, barcodes can be entered manually or by using a scanner on the '''Cross-References''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form. Any number of barcodes can be entered for the same item. For barcodes, no association with a particular vendor or customer is required. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\PO__con_Barcode_Support|Barcode Support]. [anchor|#_119e97a3-c747-4cea-a699-ef56e2ead6b5]
==Using Cross-Reference Units of Measure==
The system provides you with the ability to define and use cross-reference units of measure other than the default sales or purchase units specified for the item. For an alternate ID of any type specified on the '''Cross-References''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, you can specify the unit of measure in the '''Unit of Measure''' column.{br}

When you add items to the sales order or purchase order by entering the alternate ID in the '''Inventory ID''' column of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form or [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form, the system searches for the item by its alternate ID, replaces the alternate ID identifier in this column with the item, and specifies the cross-reference unit of measure in the '''UOM''' column. If an alternate ID does not have a unit of measure specified, the system will use the default sales or purchase unit in the document line.((({S:Warn}In the '''Unit of Measure''' column, you can specify only those units of measure that are defined for the item in the '''Unit Conversion''' table on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form.
)))[anchor|#IDworksh]
==Uploading Prices with Alternate IDs and Creating Alternate IDs from Price Worksheets==
In the system, you can make it possible to upload prices in worksheets with alternate IDs instead of item identifiers defined in the system, and to create alternate IDs for inventory items on release of worksheets. To be able to use alternate IDs in price lists, you need to do the following:[anchor|#ul_vzs_b3k_zz]
*To enable these capabilities for sales price worksheets, you need to select the '''Load Sales Prices by Alternate ID''' check box on the '''Price/Discount Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] form. Once you do, the '''Alternate ID''' column appears on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_10|Sales Price Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202010|AR202010]) form. 
*To enable these capabilities for vendor price worksheets, you need to select the '''Load Vendor Prices by Alternate ID''' check box on the '''Price/Discount Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_10_10_00|Accounts Payable Preferences] form. Once you do, the '''Alternate ID''' column appears on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_20_10|Vendor Price Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=AP202010|AP202010]) form.

After you enter the '''Alternate ID''' on either of these price worksheet forms (or upload an Excel file with alternate IDs and prices specified), the system searches for the items by their alternate IDs (that is, cross-references) and automatically populates the following columns in the worksheet lines: [anchor|#ul_gzq_tjp_d1b]
*'''Inventory ID''': The ID of the stock or non-stock item, which the system located by using its alternate ID.
*'''Description''': The description that has been specified for the item.
*'''UOM''': The cross-reference unit of measure, if one has been defined for alternate ID that was entered in the worksheet line. If a cross-reference unit of measure has not been defined, this column is populated with the default sales unit (in the sales price worksheet) or purchase unit (in the vendor price worksheet). 

If the alternate ID specified in the worksheet line is not found, when the worksheet is released, the system will create a global alternate ID and assign it to the inventory ID that is specified in the price worksheet line.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Item Cross-References For convenience during the processing of purchase and sales orders, in  Acumatica ERP, you can define the relationships between the inventory item identifiers 				maintained by your company and those used by your vendors and customers. These 				cross-references associate the internal inventory ID of an inventory item with an 				alternate ID for the item that is used by the vendor or customer. For information on 				inventory IDs, see  Inventory Subitems. Once these cross-references are established in the system, when you enter a 				customer's sales order and specify the alternate ID for an inventory item, the 				system inserts the associated inventory ID and item price in the order line. 				Cross-referencing saves time that would be spent on handling customer and vendor 				orders and helps you avoid costly errors. You can also enable the ability to load 				prices specified by alternate IDs to sales price worksheets and vendor price 				worksheets.  The types of cross-references that are supported in  Acumatica ERP are described in the sections below. Using Alternate IDs You can manage cross-references for inventory items in the Inventory module. You 				create cross-references by using the  Cross-References  tab of 				the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form for a stock 				item and of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form for a non-stock 				item. When you add a cross-reference to the table on the 					 Cross-References  tab, you select one of the following 				types in the  Alternate Type  column: Global : This is a global cross-reference for the item. For this type, you 					do not need to specify a particular customer or vendor. You can use global 					alternate IDs in sales orders, invoices, purchase orders, purchase receipts, 					purchase requests and purchase requisitions, sales price worksheets, and vendor 					price worksheets. Customer Part Number : The alternate ID is specific to a particular 					customer (specified in the  Customer/Vendor  column); this 					ID can be used in sales orders. Vendor Part Number : The alternate ID is specific to a particular vendor 					(specified in the  Customer/Vendor  column); this ID can be 					used in purchase orders and purchase requisitions. Barcode : The barcode associated with the item. You can use barcodes in 					sales orders, invoices, purchase orders, purchase receipts, purchase requests 					and purchase requisitions, sales price worksheets, and vendor price 					worksheets. If subitems are used in your system to split an inventory ID by item properties (such 				as color, fabric, or size), alternate IDs are specified for the inventory 				ID–subitem pair. The way alternate IDs are specified depends on whether the 				partner (the customer or vendor) uses the same classification of items or its 				classification has more or fewer details than are maintained in  Acumatica ERP. If the partner IDs include classification by properties specified by subitem, 				you match its IDs to your inventory ID–subitem pairs. If the partner's 				alternate IDs don't include classification provided by subitems, you use the partner 				IDs concatenated with subitems as alternate IDs. In any case, to ensure unique 				identification by alternate IDs, you should establish internal rules on specifying 				alternate IDs.  If subitems are not used in your system along with inventory IDs to identify 				inventory, then for each inventory item, you can provide multiple alternate IDs used 				by customers and by vendors. You can also specify alternate IDs specific to 				particular units of measure, as described in the sections below. The system does not verify the uniqueness of alternate IDs in the system. However, an 				alternate ID is unique for each vendor or customer, and you can find the items you 				want to add to an order by typing their alternate IDs in the  Inventory 					ID  column on the  Document Details  tab of the 					  ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) or   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders 				(PO301000) form.  Configuring the  INVENTORY  Segmented Key If you plan to use customer and vendor alternate IDs for stock and non-stock items, 				keep in mind that alternate IDs may have more characters than you have planned for 				your inventory IDs and that they may have different lengths in the systems of 				different vendors and customers. To avoid inserting unnecessary zeros or other 				characters in each inventory ID, take into account the following recommendations 				when you configure the  INVENTORY  segmented key on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) Segmented Keys (CS202000) form:  You should configure the  INVENTORY  segmented key as a single-segment key. 					The length of the segment must be equal to the maximum possible length of 					alternate IDs. You select the  Unicode  option in the  Edit Mask  					column for this segment of the  INVENTORY  segmented key. Otherwise, errors 					may result from alternate IDs that contain numbers, letters, special characters, 					and spaces. If you plan to use automatic numbering for inventory items, you should do the 						following: Select the  Auto-Number  option for the 							segment.  In the  Numbering ID  box, select the numbering 							sequence to be used to generate identifiers for new items. This 							numbering sequence may be defined on   ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) Numbering Sequences 							(CS201010) form with the  Start Number  and 								 End Number  that have fewer characters than 							the segment length.  If you plan to enter the inventory IDs for items manually, you should make sure 					the  Validate  check box is cleared for the segment—then 					the users will be able to enter identifiers with less characters than the 					specified segment length.  Using Customer Alternate IDs Customer alternate IDs are inventory identifiers (such as part numbers) used by 				customers for the items. Because different customers may use different identifiers 				to refer to the same product (defined as an item in  Acumatica ERP), you can create multiple alternate IDs for the product (one for each customer 				per item). You can specify a customer alternate ID for an item by using the 					 Cross-References  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form or the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form.  If you have specified an alternate ID for the item, the system shows this ID in the 					 Alternate ID  column on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form. If you enter a new value in this column 				while editing a sales order, the system will create a new customer-specific 				alternate ID or replace the existing customer-specific alternate ID for the item 				specified in the document line. When you create a sales order, once you select the customer, you can add each item to 				the order by typing its alternate ID (that is, the alternate ID associated with this 				customer) in the  Inventory ID  column. Once you enter the 				alternate ID, the system will automatically search for the stock or non-stock item 				and insert its settings in the document line. When you add items to a sales order by 				using the  Inventory Lookup  dialog box, which you invoke by 				clicking the  Add Stock Item  button on the  Document 					Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) 				form, you can also search for stock items in this dialog box by alternate ID. The  Alternate ID  column in the  Inventory 					Lookup  dialog box becomes populated only after you have typed a 				string in the  Inventory  box and the system has performed a 				search for the items with inventory IDs, alternate IDs, and descriptions that match 				the string. Using Vendor Alternate IDs Vendor alternate IDs are inventory identifiers used by your company's vendors for the 				product (defined as an item in  Acumatica ERP). As with customer alternate IDs, you can maintain multiple vendor alternate IDs 				(one for each vendor per item) in the Inventory module. You can specify a vendor 				alternate ID for an item by using the  Cross-References  tab of 				the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form or the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form.  If you have specified an alternate ID for an item, the system shows this ID in the 					 Alternate ID  column on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form. If you enter a new value in this column 				while editing a purchase order, the system will create a new vendor-specific 				alternate ID or replace the existing vendor-specific alternate ID for the item 				specified in the document line. When you create a purchase order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form, once 				you select the vendor, you can add each item to the order by typing its alternate ID 				(that is, the alternate ID associated with this vendor) in the  Inventory 					ID  column. Once you enter the alternate ID, the system will 				automatically search for the stock or non-stock item and insert its settings in the 				document line. When you add items to a purchase order by using the 					 Inventory Lookup  dialog box, which you invoke by clicking 				the  Add Item  button on the  Document 					Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) 				form, you can also search for the stock items in this dialog box by alternate 				ID. The  Alternate ID  column in the  Inventory 					Lookup  dialog box becomes populated only after you have typed a 				string in the  Inventory  box and the system has performed a 				search for the items with inventory IDs, alternate IDs, and descriptions that match 				the string. Using Vendor Catalogs For inventory items your company frequently purchases from a particular vendor, you 				can maintain a vendor catalog on either the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO201000|PO201000]) Vendor Inventory (PO201000) form or the  Vendor Info  tab 				of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form. Along with alternate IDs, 				you can specify the vendor's last prices for the items and update them with the 				prices quoted on vendor documents, such as receipts or even purchase orders. When 				they create purchase orders, users will be able to see the vendor's last prices for 				the items listed on the orders. For more information, see  Vendor Catalogs.  Using Barcodes Most products (items) that are sold or purchased have barcodes. A barcode is a 				machine-readable graphical representation of data that contains information about 				the product to which the barcode is attached. A special scanner is used to read the 				information encoded in the image. Scanner software converts barcodes to alphanumeric 				strings. Barcodes are specific to the company that manufactures or resells the 				products. Different barcode standards are used for different types of products and 				in different world regions.  With  Acumatica ERP, you can use barcodes as alternate IDs for inventory items. On creating a receipt 				by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form, a user scans a 				barcode of the product and associates it with the inventory ID used for this product 				in the system.  Alternatively, barcodes can be entered manually or by using a scanner on the 					 Cross-References  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form. Any number of barcodes can be entered for the same item. For barcodes, no 				association with a particular vendor or customer is required. For details, see  Barcode Support.  Using Cross-Reference Units of Measure The system provides you with the ability to define and use cross-reference units of 				measure other than the default sales or purchase units specified for the item. For 				an alternate ID of any type specified on the  Cross-References  				tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) or   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form, you can specify the unit of 				measure in the  Unit of Measure  column. When you add items to the sales order or purchase order by entering the alternate ID 				in the  Inventory ID  column of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders form or   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form, the 				system searches for the item by its alternate ID, replaces the alternate ID 				identifier in this column with the item, and specifies the cross-reference unit of 				measure in the  UOM  column. If an alternate ID does not have a 				unit of measure specified, the system will use the default sales or purchase unit in 				the document line. In the  Unit of Measure  column, you can specify only those 				units of measure that are defined for the item in the  Unit 					Conversion  table on the  General Settings  tab 				of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) or   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form. Uploading Prices with Alternate IDs and Creating Alternate IDs from Price 				Worksheets In the system, you can make it possible to upload prices in worksheets with alternate 				IDs instead of item identifiers defined in the system, and to create alternate IDs 				for inventory items on release of worksheets. To be able to use alternate IDs in 				price lists, you need to do the following: To enable these capabilities for sales price worksheets, you need to select the 						 Load Sales Prices by Alternate ID  check box on the 						 Price/Discount Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) Accounts Receivable Preferences form. Once you do, the  Alternate 						ID  column appears on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR202010|AR202010]) Sales Price Worksheets 					(AR202010) form.  To enable these capabilities for vendor price worksheets, you need to select the 						 Load Vendor Prices by Alternate ID  check box on the 						 Price/Discount Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP101000|AP101000]) Accounts Payable Preferences form. Once you do, the  Alternate 						ID  column appears on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP202010|AP202010]) Vendor Price Worksheets 					(AP202010) form. After you enter the  Alternate ID  on either of these price 				worksheet forms (or upload an Excel file with alternate IDs and prices specified), 				the system searches for the items by their alternate IDs (that is, cross-references) 				and automatically populates the following columns in the worksheet lines:  Inventory ID : The ID of the stock or non-stock item, 					which the system located by using its alternate ID. Description : The description that has been specified for 					the item. UOM : The cross-reference unit of measure, if one has been 					defined for alternate ID that was entered in the worksheet line. If a 					cross-reference unit of measure has not been defined, this column is populated 					with the default sales unit (in the sales price worksheet) or purchase unit (in 					the vendor price worksheet).  If the alternate ID specified in the worksheet line is not found, when the worksheet 				is released, the system will create a global alternate ID and assign it to the 				inventory ID that is specified in the price worksheet line.  ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500])  ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000])  ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) ]]></column>

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
While barcodes have been in use in retail stores for many years, many warehouses do not fully use this technology. Barcode scanning saves you time when you receive goods to warehouses and increases overall control of operations. {br}

 Acumatica ERP supports integration with barcode scanning solutions in the following ways. {br}{TOC}
==Barcodes as Alternative IDs for Inventory Items==
In Acumatica ERP, you can use product barcodes as alternative identifiers for inventory items. For details on allowed types of alternative IDs, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Item_Cross-References|Item Cross-References]. {br}

You can enter barcodes for items on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, the '''Cross-References''' tab, manually or by scanning them. The scanner&rsquo;s software converts the scanned barcode to an alphanumeric string that is immediately visible in the appropriate box as if it had been typed. You can add any number of different barcode strings to the item record in the database. Barcodes are not necessarily associated with particular vendors or customers. 
==Data Entry Through Barcode Scanning==
Barcode scanning can be used to effectively receive products at a warehouse and enter warehouse location information for them. {br}

From the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, you can invoke the '''Add Receipt Line''' dialog box, which has been designed for the following scenario: You scan a product barcode, and the system finds the item record, brings up the item information with the quantity copied from a matching purchase order, and automatically adds a new line to the receipt or adds one unit per each scanned item if you scan items with serial numbers. {br}

To use the dialog box for barcode scanning, make sure the '''Add Receipt Line Automatically''' option is selected. Then, once the dialog box elements are filled in, the system creates a new line automatically. {br}

If you select the '''Add One Unit per Barcode''' check box in the dialog box, each time you scan a barcode, the item quantity for the receipt will be increased by one unit. If you clear the check box, when a user scans an item barcode, the system searches for a purchase order that matches the vendor and inventory ID associated with the barcode, and inserts the quantity of the item from the purchase order. If no such order is found, the system inserts one unit.{br}

If no item is found in the system after the item barcode has been scanned, you can enter the inventory ID of the item manually. In this case, this new barcode is automatically associated with the item. {br}

To further simplify data entry in warehouses, you can print barcodes for warehouse IDs and warehouse location IDs. You can print barcodes for such identifiers by using customized Acumatica ERP reports. {br}

Barcodes of the warehouse and its locations also can be used when you create receipts by using the following scenarios: 
*If you create receipts at a desk, print barcodes on a sheet of paper, and put it close at hand. When you&rsquo;re creating a receipt line for an item, scan the barcode from the item, warehouse, and location barcodes from the paper.
*If you generally create receipts from a cart (equipped with a scanner and a computer) after you place items in appropriate locations, perform the following actions prior to receiving goods: print location IDs as barcodes on special labels, and stick them to appropriate shelves, bins, or other storage structures available in your warehouse. Then, take items one by one from the cart, and read the item barcode and location barcode from the shelf. Appropriate receipt lines will be added automatically.

==Using Barcode Scanners for Physical Inventory==
With Acumatica ERP, you can use barcode scanners to perform physical inventory counts.{br}

If product barcodes are used in your system as alternative inventory IDs, you can use barcode scanners for counting—each scanned barcode will increase the quantity of the item by one unit in the physical inventory document open on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_10|Physical Inventory Count] ([~/?ScreenId=IN305010|IN305010]) if your system is configured for using barcodes and if the scanners are connected as an input device to your computer.

For each stock item, Acumatica ERP provides a basic set of properties of the item. These properties include the item&rsquo;s identifier, description, price, cost, units of measure, default warehouse, and default vendor information.{br}

Stock items can have additional properties, known as ''attributes'' in Acumatica ERP, that do not affect item processing in the Inventory module but may help your organization analyze stock movements or item sales. Attributes may differ for different types of inventory items.
==Types of Attributes==
In Acumatica ERP, product attributes are completely customizable. You can create attributes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_50_00|Attributes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) form. You can decide what attributes are needed, what values are allowed for each, and what control (type of element) is used to implement the attribute on the interface. Attributes may be of the following types: 
*'''Free text''': Users can enter any text as the attribute value.
*'''Masked text''': The attribute text users enter must comply with a certain mask or validation rule (defined as a regular expression).
*'''Date/time''': The user selects a date-time value.
*'''Check box''': The attribute is a Boolean value, which means that the user can only select or clear it (such as ''yes/no'', ''true/false'', or ''on/off'').
*'''Combo box''': The user selects the attribute value from a predefined list that consists of values you specify when you create the attribute. For each value, you specify its ID (such as ''1M''), its description (such as ''Less than 1,000,000''), and its sort order. Values with smaller sort orders are listed nearer to the top of the combo box list.

Also, you can define an attribute as an optional or required. This allows items to have no value for the attribute. Alternatively, you can define a special value such as ''None'' or ''N/A'' (not applicable) for use with such items. 
==Attribute Assignment==
You assign attributes at the item class level by using the '''Attributes''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form. The same attribute can be used for one or several item classes. The attributes for a newly created item class are by default those of the parent item class. If the created item class has no parent, the default attributes are those of the class that is specified in the '''Default Stock Item Class''' box (if you are creating a stock item class) or the '''Default Non-Stock Item Class''' box (if you are creating a non-stock item class) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form.{br}

When a user creates a new inventory item and assigns it to an item class by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, the system will display the list of attributes assigned to the item's class. All items of the same item class will have the same set of attributes, although their values may differ for different items. For example, if you define a color attribute for an item class, each item in the class will have this attribute but the items can have different colors (or this attribute can be optional). {br}

Because item classes have different lists of attributes, users can have more complete information about each item. You can design custom reports to allow users to analyze information provided by item attributes.

For peak efficiency, manufacturing and merchandising companies need to precisely track the types and quantities of items of every type stored in inventory. Acumatica ERP provides flexible tools for identifying and tracking various types of such items.{br}{TOC}
==Inventory IDs==
Each inventory item is tracked in the system by its inventory ID. This unique identifier can be just a number, or you can configure it to provide basic information about the item type, brand, or use. Well-designed inventory IDs can help you sort and group items for reports. {br}

As with other identifiers in Acumatica ERP, inventory IDs can be configured on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form. Identifiers for stock and non-stock items are configured using the same segmented key: ''INVENTORY''. For the key, you can define how many segments it will have, what values may be used, whether they should be validated, or whether auto-numbering should be used for generating inventory IDs. To have inventory IDs automatically generated on creating new inventory items, you can configure the ''INVENTORY'' segmented key as having a single segment with the '''Auto-Number''' option selected for this segment and a numbering sequence specified in the '''Numbering ID''' box. If you have a restricted number of possible items and the users will enter arbitrary inventory IDs manually, you can configure the ''INVENTORY'' key as having a single segment with non-validated values. If the type of items should be indicated by their IDs, consider configuring the ''INVENTORY'' key with two segments, for one of which you create a list of pre-defined values.{br}

When configuring the ''INVENTORY'' segmented key, decide whether you will use alternate IDs for stock and non-stock items. With alternate IDs (item identifiers used by vendors and customer of the items), the users will be able to specify items by typing their alternate IDs as well as inventory IDs in the '''Inventory ID''' boxes on sales and purchase orders without errors. For more information on using alternate IDs and on how to configure the ''INVENTORY'' segmented key in this case, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Item_Cross-References|Item Cross-References].{br}

If required, you can change the inventory ID for any non-stock or stock item manually by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Change ID''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, respectively, and by specifying another inventory ID in a dialog box that opens.
==Subitem Codes==
In addition to inventory IDs, Acumatica ERP supports subitems (or subitem codes), which can be useful for otherwise-identical products that have different colors, sizes, or other properties tracked because they are important to customers. Thus, under the same inventory ID, you may have a number of subitems—products that share all the settings of the inventory record but have additional properties that differ, such as size or color. {br}

You decide whether to use subitems on a system-wide level, based on the particular products you stock. If products with differing properties represent a small part of all products stocked in your warehouse, you can assign individual inventory IDs to each product variation. If such products represent a significant percentage of all stock, you may want to save the effort of creating and maintaining inventory records for each variation and instead use subitems, each with a subitem code. See below for a simplified example of subitems in use. ((({S:Hint}If subitems are enabled, subitem codes should be used with every stock item, even if an item has no variations. Make sure to add for each subitem segment values that mean ''no variations''.
)))
==Example of Using Subitems==
Suppose the merchandise sold by your company is men&rsquo;s apparel: T-shirts, shoes, and socks. While each model of T-shirts, shoes, and socks has a different inventory ID, the ID offers no information about the material used, the color, and the size. If you used a different ID for every possible permutation of size, color, and material, it would significantly increase the number of IDs in use and would require a significant effort to enter all those inventory records. {br}

Suppose that your men&rsquo;s apparel company stocks and sells only three products with the following properties. 
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="20%" !  Product Type
!width="30%" ! Color
!width="20%" ! Size
!width="30%" ! Fabric/Material
|- 
|  T-Shirt
| Yellow, White, or Red
| S, M, L, XL, or XXL
| Cotton or Viscose
|- 
|  Socks
| Black
| 6, 7, 8, or 9
| Polyester
|- 
|  Shoes
| Black, Brown, or White
| 38, 39, 40, 42, 42, or 43
| Nubuck or Leather
|}
For all types of products at the warehouse, we break down all the properties—such as color, size, and fabric or material—that split the products into subitems and all possible values of these properties as shown in the table below. 
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="20%" !  Property
!width="80%" ! Property Values 
|- 
|  Color
| Yellow, White, Red, Black, Brown 
|- 
|  Size
| S, M, L, XL, XXL , 6, 7, 8, 9, 38, 39, 40, 42, 42, 43 
|- 
|  Material
| Nubuck, Leather, Polyester, Cotton, Viscose 
|}
You would then design the subitem code. It can be segmented, with each segment describing a specific property. For the above example, we could create a subitem code that consists of the following three segments: color, size, and material. {br}

Imagine if you added soap (with the inventory ID ''SOAP'') to this merchandise; the soap has only one size and one &ldquo;signature&ldquo; scent. The color, size, and material properties, then, do not apply to soap. For products without specific properties, you need non-specific values (those that mean &ldquo;not applicable&ldquo;) for the respective segments. We recommend that you use similar non-specific values for all segments, such as zero values or ''N/A'' strings. In this example, we could use ''000'', ''000'', and ''0000000000'' for color, size, and material, respectively. {br}

By using these properties, you can describe variations of all product subitems. The subitem code consists of the following possible values for the specified three segments.
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="14%" !  Segment
!width="14%" ! Property
!width="14%" ! Length
!width="57%" ! Segment Values 
|- 
|  1
| Color
| 3
|  000, YLW, WHT, RED, BLK, BRN
|- 
|  2
| Size
| 3
|  000, S&#95;;&#95;;, M&#95;;&#95;;, L&#95;;&#95;;, XL&#95;;, XXL , &#95;;&#95;;6, &#95;;&#95;;7, &#95;;&#95;;8, &#95;;&#95;;9, &#95;;38, &#95;;39, &#95;;40, &#95;;42, &#95;;42, &#95;;43
|- 
|  3
| Material
| 9
|  000000000, Nubuck, Leather, Polyester, Cotton, Viscose
|}
Thus, we have the following subitems: 
*For the ''SHOES'' inventory ID: ''BLK-038-LEATHER'', ''BRN-038-NUBUCK'', ''BLK-039-LEATHER'', ''BRN-038-LEATHER'', and so forth, with 36 total subitems
*For the ''TSHIRT'' inventory ID: ''YLW-S&#95;;&#95;;-COTTON'','' YLW-XL&#95;;-COTTON'', ''YLW-XXL-COTTON'', and so forth, with 36 total subitems
*For the ''SOCKS'' inventory ID: ''BLK-&#95;;&#95;;8-POLYESTER'', ''BLK-&#95;;10-POLYESTER'', and so forth, with 6 total subitems
*For the ''SOAP'' inventory ID: ''000-000-000000000'' (the only subitem)

==Implementation of Subitems==
Subitems allow you to use the same inventory ID with all financial, warehousing, and processing settings for multiple variations of an item. Subitem codes are used in addition to inventory IDs. If you decide to use subitems, subitem codes must be used with each inventory ID, even if the product does not have variations (as with soap in the above example). {br}

Once subitems are enabled in the system, users need to enter a subitem code for every inventory transaction in the Inventory, Purchase Orders, and Sales Orders modules. When entering a subitem code for an item on any document, users browse through the possible values of each segment. {br}

By default, the subitem code is independent of inventory items and the system permits all combinations between them, although most combinations make no sense. For example, the inventory item ''SOAP'' does not actually have the subitem ''MGT-XXL-Polyester'', and the inventory item ''SOCKS'' doesn&rsquo;t have the valid subitem ''YLW-42-NUBUCK''. ((({S:Warn}For user reference, you can maintain the list of valid subitems on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_50_00|Subitems] ([~/?ScreenId=IN205000|IN205000]) form.
)))
==Configuration of Subitems in Your System==
To configure subitems in your system, perform the following general steps: [anchor|#ol_wzv_2f2_rj]
#To use subitems in the system, enable the ''Inventory Subitems'' feature on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
#:((({S:Hint}Once enabled, this feature cannot be disabled. 
)))
#Define the segmented structure of subitems by using the ''INSUBITEM'' key on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form.
#Add values for each subitem segment by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_30_00|Segment Values] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203000|CS203000]) form.
#Create stock items by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form.
#On the '''Cross-References''' tab, assign to each inventory ID-subitem pair alternate IDs, if such IDs are used by vendors or customers.
#By using the '''Restriction Groups''' tab of this form, assign the item to appropriate subitem restriction groups.

==Subitem Cost Calculation Options==
Products with different inventory IDs are always costed separately. Products with the same inventory ID and different subitem codes can be costed as one item or as several items. For each subitem segment defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] form, the '''Include in Cost''' check box controls how cost will be calculated: 
*If the check box is selected, costs of products with the same inventory ID and different values in this subitem segment are calculated as if for different items.
*If the check box is cleared, in cost calculations, items with different segment values in their subitems will be considered as one item. In this case, the segment should have one value marked as aggregating value on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_30_00|Segment Values] form. The cost will be shown for the item with the subitem that has this aggregating value in the segment.

In this example, we could use  000 , 					 000 , and  0000000000  for color, size, and material, respectively.  By using these properties, you can describe variations of all product subitems. The 				subitem code consists of the following possible values for the specified three 				segments.  Segment Property Length Segment Values   1 Color 3  000, YLW, WHT, RED, BLK, BRN  2 Size 3  000, S_;_;, M_;_;, L_;_;, XL_;, XXL 								, _;_;6, _;_;7, _;_;8, _;_;9, 								_;38, _;39, _;40, _;42, _;42, _;43  3 Material 9  000000000, Nubuck, Leather, Polyester, Cotton, Viscose Thus, we have the following subitems:  For the  SHOES  inventory ID:  BLK-038-LEATHER , 					 BRN-038-NUBUCK ,  BLK-039-LEATHER ,  BRN-038-LEATHER , and so 					forth, with 36 total subitems For the  TSHIRT  inventory ID:  YLW-S_;_;-COTTON ,  						YLW-XL_;-COTTON ,  YLW-XXL-COTTON , and so forth, with 36 total 					subitems For the  SOCKS  inventory ID:  BLK-_;_;8-POLYESTER , 						 BLK-_;10-POLYESTER , and so forth, with 6 total subitems For the  SOAP  inventory ID:  000-000-000000000  (the only 					subitem) Implementation of Subitems Subitems allow you to use the same inventory ID with all financial, warehousing, and 				processing settings for multiple variations of an item. Subitem codes are used in 				addition to inventory IDs. If you decide to use subitems, subitem codes must be used 				with each inventory ID, even if the product does not have variations (as with soap 				in the above example).  Once subitems are enabled in the system, users need to enter a subitem code for every 				inventory transaction in the Inventory, Purchase Orders, and Sales Orders modules. 				When entering a subitem code for an item on any document, users browse through the 				possible values of each segment.  By default, the subitem code is independent of inventory items and the system permits 				all combinations between them, although most combinations make no sense. For 				example, the inventory item  SOAP  does not actually have the subitem 					 MGT-XXL-Polyester , and the inventory item  SOCKS  doesn't have the 				valid subitem  YLW-42-NUBUCK .  For user reference, you can maintain the list of valid subitems on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN205000|IN205000]) Subitems (IN205000) form. Configuration of Subitems in Your System To configure subitems in your system, perform the following general steps:  To use subitems in the system, enable the  Inventory Subitems  feature on 					the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. Once 						enabled, this feature cannot be disabled.  Define the segmented structure of subitems by using the  INSUBITEM  key on 					the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) Segmented Keys (CS202000) form. Add values for each subitem segment by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203000|CS203000]) Segment Values (CS203000) form. Create stock items by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items 					(IN202500) form. On the  Cross-References  tab, assign to each inventory ID-subitem pair 					alternate IDs, if such IDs are used by vendors or customers. By using the  Restriction Groups  tab of this form, assign the item to 					appropriate subitem restriction groups. Subitem Cost Calculation Options Products with different inventory IDs are always costed separately. Products with the 				same inventory ID and different subitem codes can be costed as one item or as 				several items. For each subitem segment defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) Segmented Keys form, the  Include in Cost  check box controls how cost will be calculated:  If the check box is selected, costs of products with the same inventory ID and 					different values in this subitem segment are calculated as if for different 					items. If the check box is cleared, in cost calculations, items with different segment 					values in their subitems will be considered as one item. In this case, the 					segment should have one value marked as aggregating value on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203000|CS203000]) Segment Values form. The cost will be shown for the item with the 					subitem that has this aggregating value in the segment.  ([~/?ScreenId=IN205000|IN205000])  ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500])  ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000])  ([~/?ScreenId=CS203000|CS203000]) ]]></column>

Inventory transactions are used to account for inventory items moved to or from a specific warehouse, between locations within a warehouse, or between warehouses.{br}

Purchases and sales cause inventory item movements, and the respective inventory transactions are generated by documents, such as purchase receipts and sales orders, originated in other modules. Your company may also have direct inventory transactions—those not based on purchase or sales documents—such as issue transactions to remove damaged or expired goods from inventory. Because direct transactions are not standard operations, they should be accompanied by reason codes that supply offset accounts and subaccounts and explain why these transactions were performed.{br}

This topic contains an overview of the inventory processes and processing options applicable to documents of all types.{br}{TOC}
==Types of Inventory Transactions==
You use the following documents to record the inventory transactions performed:[anchor|#ul_zr1_gd2_rj]
*'''Receipt''': To record the arrival of some quantity of stock items to the inventory. Generally, inventory receipts are generated in the process of releasing purchase and transfer receipts, and inventory receipts can be created manually. For more details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Receipt_Processing|Inventory Receipt Processing]. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) form, you can enter inventory receipts manually and view all the receipts that have been created in the system.
*'''Issue''': To record the withdrawal of some quantity of stock items from the inventory. Generally, inventory issues are generated in the process of shipment confirmation, but also can be created directly in Inventory. By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form, you can enter inventory issues manually and view all the issues that have been created in the system. For more details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Issue_Processing|Inventory Issue Processing].
*'''Adjustment''': To update the quantity of stock items in the warehouse (usually after physical inventory counts) and to update costs for items with standard cost and other valuation methods. By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_30_00|Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=IN303000|IN303000]) form, you can enter inventory adjustments manually and view all the adjustments that have been created in the system. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Enter_Inventory_Adjustment|To Enter an Inventory Adjustment].
*'''Transfer''': To record the movement of stock items between locations within a warehouse or between warehouses. For more details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Warehouse_Locations_GeneralInfo|Warehouse Locations and Single-Step Transfers: General Information] and [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\InvMgmt_2Step_Transfers_GeneralInfo|Two-Step Transfers: General Information].
*'''Kit Assembly''': To update the quantities of kits that were assembled and items that were used as kit components. If a kit is a stock item, this transaction increases the on-hand quantity of kits and decreases the on-hand quantity of its stock item components (if any). The cost of the assembled kit may exceed the total cost of its components if includes the cost of labor or other extra costs, added as non-stock item components. For more information, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Accounting_for_Kits|Inventory Item Kits].
*'''Kit Disassembling''': To update the quantities of kits and their stock components when kits are disassembled into components. If a kit is a stock item, this transaction decreases the on-hand quantity of kits and increases the on-hand quantity of stock components (if any). The system generates an inventory adjustment to account for the extra costs that incur in the process of disassembling, if any. 

==Currency of the Inventory Documents==
For all inventory documents, the base currency is used. Even if the original documents in the Purchase Orders or Sales Orders modules were created in foreign currencies, the inventory documents generated for them are always in the base currency.
==Data Entry Options==
The settings that can be used to manage the data entry of inventory documents are located on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]).{br}

When a new inventory document is created, the system assigns it a reference number according to the numbering sequence specified for documents of this type in the '''Numbering Settings''' section of the form.{br}

You can select the '''Hold Documents on Entry''' check box to make ''On Hold'' the default status. Then on saving, a new inventory document will get the ''On Hold'' status. To save it in another status, the user will need to clear the '''Hold''' check box.{br}

To reduce the input error rate, you can select the '''Validate Document Totals on Entry''' check box. Then, the user will need to review the document and enter manually the control quantity as a value that is equal to the document quantity and control amount as a value that is equal to the document amount. {br}

To make data entry for receiving operations more efficient with the help of barcode scanners, select the '''Automatically Add Receipt Line for Barcode''' check box to enable adding a line to receipt each time a new barcode has been scanned or entered manually. {br}

Also, you can select the '''Add One Unit Per Barcode''' check box to indicate to the system that the item quantity on the receipt should be increased by one unit each time the item&rsquo;s barcode is entered into the system, manually or by using a barcode scanner.
==Statuses==
An inventory transaction can pass through the following statuses:[anchor|#ul_t3b_tqc_2v]
*''On Hold'': The transaction is a draft and may require further editing. With this status, the transaction cannot be released. If the '''Hold Documents on Entry''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form, the system assigns the ''On Hold'' status to new inventory transactions by default. To change the status of the transaction, you need to clear the '''Hold''' check box and save the transaction.
*''Balanced'': This is the default status for new transactions if the '''Hold Documents on Entry''' check box is cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] form. The transaction still can be edited and can be released. If the '''Validate Document Totals on Entry''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] form, you must enter the control quantity and control amount to save the transaction in this status.
*''Released'': The transaction has been released and cannot be edited. Releasing the transaction updates the availability data. 

==Releasing Options==
You can release inventory transactions one-by-one using the appropriate form: [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]), or [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_30_00|Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=IN303000|IN303000]). In addition, you can release multiple inventory transactions by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_10_00|Release IN Documents] ([~/?ScreenId=IN501000|IN501000]) form. {br}

You can select the '''Update GL''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] form to enable posting of the transactions generated in the Inventory module to the general ledger. If the check box is cleared, the system doesn't generate GL transactions on release of inventory documents and the general ledger will not be updated by the inventory documents.{br}

Upon release, the system takes the following actions:[anchor|#ul_wlz_lw4_3v]
*Updates the availability data according to the transaction type of each line.
*Updates the cost statistics for each item.
*If the updating of the general ledger is enabled, generates the general ledger transactions according to the transaction type of each line. You can view the balance of each inventory account and the list of documents (that updates the account) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_30_00|Inventory Transactions by Account] ([~/?ScreenId=IN403000|IN403000]) form. 

==Posting Options==
The settings that can be used to manage the posting process for inventory documents are located on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]). ((({S:Warn}You may need to temporarily clear the check box before you start import of historical inventory documents if you do not want them to affect the balances of GL accounts.
)))
The system assigns the batch numbers according to the numbering sequence selected in the '''Batch Numbering Sequence''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form. The system immediately posts the GL transactions if the '''Automatically Post on Release''' check box is selected.{br}

Also, you can use the '''Post Summary on Updating GL''' check box to control how transactions are posted. If you use the GL accounts that allow posting of summary values, you can select this check box. Then, the transactions in the batches will be grouped by account and subaccount pair and only the sum for each pair will be posted.
==Transaction Reason Codes==
You use reason codes, defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_21_10_00|Reason Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS211000|CS211000]) form, to indicate why direct inventory transactions are made. Each reason code has a default account and subaccount specified that are used as the offset account and subaccount for the inventory transactions. You can specify the reason codes to be used as the default reason codes for inventory receipts, issues, and adjustments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form.

This topic contains an overview of the inventory processes and processing options                 applicable to documents of all types. Types of Inventory Transactions You use the following documents to record the inventory transactions performed: Receipt : To record the arrival of some quantity of stock items to the                     inventory. Generally, inventory receipts are generated in the process of                     releasing purchase and transfer receipts, and inventory receipts can be created                     manually. For more details, see  Inventory Receipt Processing.                     On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) Receipts (IN301000) form, you can enter inventory                     receipts manually and view all the receipts that have been created in the                     system. Issue : To record the withdrawal of some quantity of stock items from the                     inventory. Generally, inventory issues are generated in the process of shipment                     confirmation, but also can be created directly in Inventory. By using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) Issues (IN302000) form, you can enter inventory issues                     manually and view all the issues that have been created in the system. For more                     details, see  Inventory Issue Processing. Adjustment : To update the quantity of stock items in the warehouse                     (usually after physical inventory counts) and to update costs for items with                     standard cost and other valuation methods. By using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN303000|IN303000]) Adjustments (IN303000) form, you can enter inventory                     adjustments manually and view all the adjustments that have been created in the                      system .                     For details, see  To Enter an Inventory Adjustment. Transfer : To record the movement of stock items between locations within                     a warehouse or between warehouses. For more details, see  Warehouse Locations and Single-Step Transfers: General Information and  Two-Step Transfers: General Information. Kit Assembly : To update the quantities of kits that were assembled and                     items that were used as kit components. If a kit is a stock item, this                     transaction increases the on-hand quantity of kits and decreases the on-hand                     quantity of its stock item components (if any). The cost of the assembled kit                     may exceed the total cost of its components if includes the cost of labor or                     other extra costs, added as non-stock item components. For more information, see                          Inventory Item Kits. Kit Disassembling : To update the quantities of kits and their stock                     components when kits are disassembled into components. If a kit is a stock item,                     this transaction decreases the on-hand quantity of kits and increases the                     on-hand quantity of stock components (if any). The system generates an inventory                     adjustment to account for the extra costs that incur in the process of                     disassembling, if any.  Currency of the Inventory Documents For all inventory documents, the base currency is used. Even if the original                 documents in the Purchase Orders or Sales Orders modules were created in foreign                 currencies, the inventory documents generated for them are always in the base                 currency. Data Entry Options The settings that can be used to manage the data entry of inventory documents are                 located on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000). When a new inventory document is created, the system assigns it a reference number                 according to the numbering sequence specified for documents of this type in the                      Numbering Settings  section of the form. You can select the  Hold Documents on Entry  check box to make                      On Hold  the default status. Then on saving, a new inventory document will                 get the  On Hold  status. To save it in another status, the user will need to                 clear the  Hold  check box. To reduce the input error rate, you can select the  Validate Document                     Totals on Entry  check box. Then, the user will need to review the                 document and enter manually the control quantity as a value that is equal to the                 document quantity and control amount as a value that is equal to the document                 amount.  To make data entry for receiving operations more efficient with the help of barcode                 scanners, select the  Automatically Add Receipt Line for Barcode  check box to                 enable adding a line to receipt each time a new barcode has been scanned or entered                 manually.  Also, you can select the  Add One Unit Per Barcode  check box to                 indicate to the system that the item quantity on the receipt should be increased by                 one unit each time the item's barcode is entered into the system, manually or by                 using a barcode scanner. Statuses An inventory transaction can pass through the following statuses: On Hold : The transaction is a draft and may require further editing. With                     this status, the transaction cannot be released. If the  Hold                         Documents on Entry  check box is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000) form, the system assigns the  On                         Hold  status to new inventory transactions by default. To change the                     status of the transaction, you need to clear the  Hold                      check box and save the transaction. Balanced : This is the default status for new transactions if the                          Hold Documents on Entry  check box is cleared on the                           ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences form. The transaction still can be edited                     and can be released. If the  Validate Document Totals on                         Entry  check box is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences form, you must enter the control quantity and control amount to save the                     transaction in this status. Released : The transaction has been released and cannot be edited.                     Releasing the transaction updates the availability data.  Releasing Options You can release inventory transactions one-by-one using the appropriate form:   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) Issues (IN302000)   ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) Receipts (IN301000),                 or   ([~/?ScreenId=IN303000|IN303000]) Adjustments (IN303000). In addition, you can release multiple                 inventory transactions by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN501000|IN501000]) Release IN Documents (IN501000) form.  You can select the  Update GL  check box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences form to enable posting of the transactions generated                 in the Inventory module to the general ledger. If the check box is cleared, the                 system doesn't generate GL transactions on release of inventory documents and the                 general ledger will not be updated by the inventory documents. Upon release, the system takes the following actions: Updates the availability data according to the transaction type of each                     line. Updates the cost statistics for each item. If the updating of the general ledger is enabled, generates the general ledger                     transactions according to the transaction type of each line. You can view the                     balance of each inventory account and the list of documents (that updates the                     account) on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN403000|IN403000]) Inventory Transactions by Account (IN403000) form.  Posting Options The settings that can be used to manage the posting process for inventory documents                 are located on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000).  You may need to temporarily clear the check box before you start import of                 historical inventory documents if you do not want them to affect the balances of GL                 accounts. The system assigns the batch numbers according to the numbering sequence selected in                 the  Batch Numbering Sequence  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000) form. The system immediately posts the GL                 transactions if the  Automatically Post on Release  check box                 is selected. Also, you can use the  Post Summary on Updating GL  check box to control how                 transactions are posted. If you use the GL accounts that allow posting of summary                 values, you can select this check box. Then, the transactions in the batches will be                 grouped by account and subaccount pair and only the sum for each pair will be                 posted. Transaction Reason Codes You use reason codes, defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS211000|CS211000]) Reason Codes                 (CS211000) form, to indicate why direct inventory transactions are made. Each reason                 code has a default account and subaccount specified that are used as the offset                 account and subaccount for the inventory transactions. You can specify the reason                 codes to be used as the default reason codes for inventory receipts, issues, and                 adjustments on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000)                 form.

Inventory receipts, which you can create and view by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) form, are used to account for stock items received in the inventory. If your organization uses the Purchase Orders module, the system creates inventory receipts automatically once purchase receipts have been released.{br}

Also, you can create inventory receipts not linked to purchases in the following situations:[anchor|#ul_gc5_c2b_dv]
*To enter initial quantities of stock items during the system implementation
*To record the items transferred to the destination warehouses from the source warehouses

If the Purchase Orders module is not used, or in some other cases, you can create inventory receipts manually to account for the stock items purchased and received to inventory.{br}{TOC}
==Data Entry==
You can view, edit, and create inventory receipts by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) form. A new inventory receipt, either automatically generated or created manually, is assigned a reference number according to the numbering sequence that is specified in the '''Receipt / Transfer Numbering Sequence''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form.{br}

For manually created receipts, you enter the following information for each line:[anchor|#ul_qpy_mh4_3v]
*'''Inventory ID''' that identifies the stock item. If the ''Inventory Subitems'' feature is enabled in your system, subitem is used with the inventory ID to identify the stock item.
*'''UOM''', unit of measure. By default, it is the base UOM selected for the item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form. However, if the ''Multiple Units of Measure'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can use any of the UOMs specified for the item.
*'''Quantity''', the quantity of the item to be received to the inventory in the selected UOM.
*'''Unit Cost''' or '''Ext. Cost''' (extended cost) of the received item. You can enter the unit cost or use the default unit cost, and the system calculates the extended cost automatically as the unit cost multiplied by quantity. Or, you can enter the extended cost. The default unit cost specified for a stock item on a receipt is an estimation of actual cost retrieved from cost statistics at the moment when the item is selected for a line. Later, on release of the receipt, the system applies the correct cost according to the valuation method selected for the item.
*'''Reason Code''', which is required only for manually entered receipts. A reason code supplies the offset account and subaccount (to be credited) by the receipt-based batch of transactions. The system will use the default reason code selected for receipts on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form if no reason code is specified for the line. Reason codes are not used for receipts generated from the documents originated in the Purchase Orders module.

An item can be added to a receipt with the help of a barcode scanner. Scanning a new barcode automatically adds a new line to the receipt and scanning the same barcode adds one more unit of the item. The options that control this behavior are located on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] form.{br}

For the procedure that describes hot to enter inventory receipts, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Enter_IN_Receipt|To Enter an Inventory Receipt].
==Release of Receipts==
You can release a particular inventory receipt by clicking '''Release''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) form. Also, you can release multiple receipts (along with inventory transactions of other types) by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_10_00|Release IN Documents] ([~/?ScreenId=IN501000|IN501000]) form. {br}

Released receipts are read-only documents.{br}

If the '''Update GL''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] form, on release of each receipt the system generates a batch of general ledger entries, updates the availability data for the items and the cost statistics. You can view the reference number of such batch on the Financial Details tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] form: To view the details of the batch, click the reference number of the batch in the '''Batch Nbr''' box.{br}

The [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_61_55_00|Inventory Valuation] ([~/?ScreenId=IN615500|IN615500]) report shows the on-hand quantity and the total cost of inventory items on hand, which are updated by every released inventory receipt.
==Processing of Receipts Generated by Purchases==
If a receipt is created automatically as the result of releasing a purchase receipt, the information required to post transactions listed in automatically generated inventory receipts comes from the posting class of the item. Posting classes are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) form and assigned to stock items on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] and to non-stock items on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form.{br}

When an inventory receipt based on a purchase receipt is released, the item&rsquo;s posting class determines the General Ledger accounts to be updated. Reason codes are not used for receipts generated from the Purchase Orders module.{br}

On release of a receipt, the system generates a batch of General Ledger entries: For each receipt&rsquo;s line, one journal entry debits the inventory account and another one credits the PO accrual account (determined by the posting class of the item). 
==Processing of Manually Entered Receipts==
You can create inventory receipts manually if your organization does not use the Purchase Orders and Sales Orders modules. In case the Sales Orders module is integrated with the Inventory module, you can create receipts for the transferred inventory in a two-step transfer process. Also, you can use receipts to enter initial quantities of stock items during the system implementation.{br}

On release of a receipt, the system generates a batch of General Ledger entries: For each receipt&rsquo;s line, one journal entry debits the inventory account (determined by the posting class of the item) and another credits the account specified in the reason code of the receipt line.
==Printing Labels==
After you have processed the receipt, you can print labels for the received items by clicking '''Reports''' > '''Inventory Item Labels''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) form. You can also print labels later by running the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_61_92_00|Inventory Item Labels] ([~/?ScreenId=IN619200|IN619200]) report. {br}

A label for a stock item includes the name of the warehouse, the location where this item is stored, the inventory ID, subitem, description, and information about receipt (the reference number and the date). If the lot/serial numbers are assigned to the item on receipt, separate labels are generated for each serial or lot number used for the received quantity of the item.

Inventory issues allow your organization to track stock levels at warehouses. If your organization uses the Sales Orders module, Acumatica ERP automatically generates inventory issues upon release of sales orders, customer returns, credit and debit memos, and kit assembly documents. {br}

Also, you can create inventory issues that are not linked to sales in the following situations: [anchor|#ul_gc5_c2b_dv]
*To remove expired or damaged goods
*To return excessively issued goods

If the Sales Orders module is not used, or in some other cases, you can create inventory issues to account for sales and returns.{br}{TOC}
==Types of Issue Lines==
Inventory issues may decrease or increase inventory, depending on the transaction type of the issue lines.{br}

The following transaction types are available for issues:[anchor|#ul_x53_vq4_3v]
*''Issue'': Indicates that the specified quantity of the inventory item is issued from inventory. Transactions of this type are generated from the purchase returns and can be created directly in the Inventory module to account for expired goods. The quantities of stock items on the issues of this type decrease the on-hand quantities of these items and decrease the total costs of the items in inventory by the amount specified in the '''Ext. Cost''' box.
*''Return'': Indicates that the specified quantity of the stock item was returned to inventory. Transactions of this type are generated from customer return orders of the ''RM'' and ''RR'' order types. Issues of this type can be created to return the excessively issued items. The quantities of returned items increase the on-hand quantities of stock items and the total costs.
*''Invoice'': Indicates that the specified quantity of the inventory item is issued based on an invoice. Generally, the system generates issues of this type when you are fulfilling the sales orders; also, you can create these issues manually. The quantity of inventory in this transaction will be subtracted from the quantity of the item available at the warehouse. 
*:((({S:Warn}If the ''Advanced SO Invoices'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the system generates issues of the ''Invoice'' type on release of the direct sales invoices. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\OrderMgmt_Direct_Sales_GeneralInfo|Direct Sales: General Information].
)))
*''Debit Memo'': Indicates that the specified quantity of the inventory item is issued from inventory; the system generates transactions of this type of transaction on release of the appropriate documents. The quantity of the item in this transaction will be deducted from the on-hand quantity of the item. Transactions of this type can also be entered manually. 
*''Credit Memo'': Indicates that the specified quantity of the stock item is received to inventory; transactions of this type are generated by the system during the processing of customer returns of the ''RC (Return for Credit)'' type and can be entered manually. The quantity of the item in this transaction increases the on-hand quantity. 
*:((({S:Warn}If the ''Advanced SO Invoices'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the system generates issues of the ''Credit Memo'' type on release of the direct sales invoices with return lines. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\OrderMgmt_Direct_Returns_GeneralInfo|Direct Returns: General Information].
)))

==Data Entry==
You can view, edit, and create inventory issues by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form. A new inventory issue, whether automatically generated or created manually, is assigned a reference number according to the numbering sequence that is specified in the '''Issue Numbering Sequence''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form.{br}

For each line of a new issue, you enter the following information:[anchor|#ul_qpy_mh4_3v]
*'''Tran. Type''', which determines how the issue updates the ending inventory and which general ledger transactions are generated. 
*'''Inventory ID''', which identifies the stock item. If the ''Inventory Subitems'' feature is enabled in your system, the subitem is used with the inventory ID to identify the stock item.
*'''UOM''', or the unit of measure. By default, the system inserts the base UOM selected for the item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form. However, if the ''Multiple Units of Measure'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can use any of the UOMs specified for the item.
*'''Quantity''', the quantity of the item to be issued in the selected UOM.
*'''Unit Cost''' or '''Ext. Cost''' (extended cost) of the issued item. You can enter the unit cost or use the default unit cost, and the system calculates the extended cost automatically as the unit cost multiplied by quantity. Alternatively, you can enter the extended cost. The default unit cost specified for a stock item on a receipt is an estimation of the actual cost retrieved from cost statistics at the moment when the item is selected for a line. Later, on release of the receipt, the system applies the correct cost according to the valuation method selected for the item.
*'''Unit Price''' or '''Ext. Price''' (extended price) of the issued item, which is applicable only to lines of the ''Invoice'', ''Debit'', and ''Credit Memo'' types. You can enter the unit price or use the default unit price, and the system calculates the extended price automatically as the unit price multiplied by quantity. You can instead enter the extended price manually. 
*'''Reason Code''', which is required only for transactions of the ''Issue'' or ''Return'' types. The reason code defines the offset account to be updated by the issue line. The system will use the default reason code selected for issues on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form if no reason code is specified for the line. Reason codes are not used for issues generated from documents originating in the Sales Orders module.

For the procedures that describe how to enter an inventory issue, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Enter_Issue_of_Issue_Type|To Enter an Inventory Issue of the Issue Type] and [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Enter_Issue_of_Invoice_Type|To Enter an Inventory Issue of the Invoice Type].
==Release of Issues==
You can release a particular inventory issue by clicking '''Release''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form. Also, you can mass-release issues (along with inventory transactions of other types) by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_10_00|Release IN Documents] ([~/?ScreenId=IN501000|IN501000]) form.{br}

If the quantity specified for any of the inventory items in the issue is greater than the ''Available for Issue'' quantity for this item in the warehouse specified for the line that contains the item, the system will not release the issue. Also, if an inventory item is tracked by lot or serial numbers, the system checks whether the specified lot or serial numbers are available in the warehouse selected in the line.{br}

If the '''Update GL''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form, on release of each inventory issue, the system generates a batch of journal entries based on the types of transactions included in the issue, and updates the availability data for the items and the cost statistics. You can view the reference number of this batch on the '''Financial Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] form: To view the details of the batch, click the reference number of the batch in the '''Batch Nbr.''' box.{br}

Released issues are read-only documents.{br}

The [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_61_55_00|Inventory Valuation] ([~/?ScreenId=IN615500|IN615500]) report shows the on-hand quantity and the total cost of inventory items on hand, which are updated by every released inventory issue.
==Issues Generated by Sales==
If an issue is created automatically as the result of a sales order being processed, the extended cost amount usually debits a cost of goods sold account and credits an inventory account, with the accounts determined by the posting class of the stock item. Reason codes are not used for issues generated from the Sales Orders module.{br}

The unit costs specified for stock items on inventory issues are the estimations of actual costs according to the cost statistics at the moment when each item is selected in the sales order line. On release of the inventory issue, the system calculates the correct costs of the goods sold based on the valuation methods assigned to the items.
==Direct Issues==
If you enter an issue manually, reason codes are required for each issue line of the ''Issue'' and ''Return'' types. Reason codes used for issues should provide offset accounts for each specific type of issues. You can specify the most appropriate reason code for each issue line; when no reason code is selected, the system automatically inserts the default reason code of the ''Issue'' usage that is specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form.{br}

With a direct issue, the extended cost amount updates the balances of the inventory account and of the offset account supplied by the reason code. The selected offset account depends on the reason of the transaction; it is a specific expense account. If the issue has been created for kit assembling, the offset account is usually an expense account, such as ''Material Expense''. If the issue has been created to remove expired goods, the offset account might be ''Expired Goods&rsquo; Costs''. {br}

For issue lines of the ''Invoice'', ''Credit Memo'', and ''Debit Memo'' types, you can specify the price and the extended price of the line item. ((({S:Warn}The '''Unit Price''' and '''Ext. Price''' values cannot be used for inventory issues of the ''Return'' and ''Issue'' types.
)))
On release of such transactions (with nonzero extended prices), the system generates the following additional journal entries:[anchor|#ol_jpg_lpq_2v]
*For a line of the ''Invoice'' type, the extended price amount (sales amount) is credited to the Sales account and debited to the AR Clearing account defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form. 
*For a line of the ''Credit Memo'' or ''Debit Memo'' type, this amount is credited to the AR Clearing account and debited to the Sales account. The Sales account is determined by the posting class of the item; can be overridden by the offset account of the reason code it such code is specified. 

To complete the sale to the customer or the customer return, you can later create an appropriate AR document (''Invoice'', ''Credit Memo'', or ''Debit Memo'') by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form, and move the sales amount from the AR Clearing account to the AR account of the customer.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Inventory Issue Processing Inventory issues allow your organization to track stock levels at warehouses. If your         organization uses the Sales Orders module,  Acumatica ERP automatically generates inventory issues upon release of sales orders, customer returns,         credit and debit memos, and kit assembly documents.  Also, you can create inventory issues that are not linked to sales in the following         situations:  To remove expired or damaged goods To return excessively issued goods If the Sales Orders module is not used, or in some other cases, you can create inventory         issues to account for sales and returns. Types of Issue Lines Inventory issues may decrease or increase inventory, depending on the transaction type of         the issue lines. The following transaction types are available for issues: Issue : Indicates that the specified quantity of the inventory item is issued from           inventory. Transactions of this type are generated from the purchase returns and can be           created directly in the Inventory module to account for expired goods. The quantities of           stock items on the issues of this type decrease the on-hand quantities of these items and           decrease the total costs of the items in inventory by the amount specified in the              Ext. Cost  box. Return : Indicates that the specified quantity of the stock item was returned to           inventory. Transactions of this type are generated from customer return orders of the              RM  and  RR  order types. Issues of this type can be created to return the           excessively issued items. The quantities of returned items increase the on-hand quantities           of stock items and the total costs. Invoice : Indicates that the specified quantity of the inventory item is issued           based on an invoice. Generally, the system generates issues of this type when you are           fulfilling the sales orders; also, you can create these issues manually. The quantity of           inventory in this transaction will be subtracted from the quantity of the item available           at the warehouse.  If the  Advanced SO Invoices  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features             (CS100000) form, the system generates issues of the  Invoice  type on release of             the direct sales invoices. For more information, see  Direct Sales: General Information. Debit Memo : Indicates that the specified quantity of the inventory item is issued           from inventory; the system generates transactions of this type of transaction on release           of the appropriate documents. The quantity of the item in this transaction will be           deducted from the on-hand quantity of the item. Transactions of this type can also be           entered manually.            Credit Memo : Indicates that the specified quantity of the stock item is received           to inventory; transactions of this type are generated by the system during the processing           of customer returns of the  RC (Return for Credit)  type and can be entered manually.           The quantity of the item in this transaction increases the on-hand quantity.              If             the  Advanced SO Invoices  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features             (CS100000) form, the system generates issues of the  Credit Memo  type on release             of the direct sales invoices with return lines. For more information, see  Direct Returns: General Information. Data Entry You can view, edit, and create inventory issues by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) Issues (IN302000) form. A new inventory issue, whether automatically generated or         created manually, is assigned a reference number according to the numbering sequence that is         specified in the  Issue Numbering Sequence  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000) form. For each line of a new issue, you enter the following information: Tran. Type , which determines how the issue updates the ending           inventory and which general ledger transactions are generated.  Inventory ID , which identifies the stock item. If the              Inventory Subitems  feature is enabled in your system, the subitem is used with           the inventory ID to identify the stock item. UOM , or the unit of measure. By default, the system inserts the           base UOM selected for the item on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form. However, if           the  Multiple Units of Measure  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, you can use any of the UOMs specified for the           item. Quantity , the quantity of the item to be issued in the selected           UOM. Unit Cost  or  Ext. Cost  (extended cost) of           the issued item. You can enter the unit cost or use the default unit cost, and the system           calculates the extended cost automatically as the unit cost multiplied by quantity.           Alternatively, you can enter the extended cost. The default unit cost specified for a           stock item on a receipt is an estimation of the actual cost retrieved from cost statistics           at the moment when the item is selected for a line. Later, on release of the receipt, the           system applies the correct cost according to the valuation method selected for the           item. Unit Price  or  Ext. Price  (extended price)           of the issued item, which is applicable only to lines of the  Invoice ,  Debit ,           and  Credit Memo  types. You can enter the unit price or use the default unit price,           and the system calculates the extended price automatically as the unit price multiplied by           quantity. You can instead enter the extended price manually.  Reason Code , which is required only for transactions of the              Issue  or  Return  types. The reason code defines the offset account to be           updated by the issue line. The system will use the default reason code selected for issues           on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000) form if no reason code is specified for           the line. Reason codes are not used for issues generated from documents originating in the           Sales Orders module. For the procedures that describe how to enter an inventory issue, see  To Enter an Inventory Issue of the Issue Type and  To Enter an Inventory Issue of the Invoice Type. Release of Issues You can release a particular inventory issue by clicking  Release  on         the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) Issues (IN302000) form. Also,         you can mass-release issues (along with inventory transactions of other types) by using the             ([~/?ScreenId=IN501000|IN501000]) Release IN Documents (IN501000) form. If the quantity specified for any of the inventory items in the issue is greater than the            Available for Issue  quantity for this item in the warehouse specified for the line         that contains the item, the system will not release the issue. Also, if an inventory item is         tracked by lot or serial numbers, the system checks whether the specified lot or serial         numbers are available in the warehouse selected in the line. If the  Update GL  check box is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000) form, on release of each inventory issue, the system         generates a batch of journal entries based on the types of transactions included in the         issue, and updates the availability data for the items and the cost statistics. You can view         the reference number of this batch on the  Financial Details  tab of         the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) Issues form: To view the details of the batch, click the         reference number of the batch in the  Batch Nbr.  box. Released issues are read-only documents. The   ([~/?ScreenId=IN615500|IN615500]) Inventory Valuation (IN615500) report shows the on-hand quantity and the         total cost of inventory items on hand, which are updated by every released inventory         issue. Issues Generated by Sales If an issue is created automatically as the result of a sales order being processed, the         extended cost amount usually debits a cost of goods sold account and credits an inventory         account, with the accounts determined by the posting class of the stock item. Reason codes         are not used for issues generated from the Sales Orders module. The unit costs specified for stock items on inventory issues are the estimations of actual         costs according to the cost statistics at the moment when each item is selected in the sales         order line. On release of the inventory issue, the system calculates the correct costs of         the goods sold based on the valuation methods assigned to the items. Direct Issues If you enter an issue manually, reason codes are required for each issue line of the            Issue  and  Return  types. Reason codes used for issues should provide offset         accounts for each specific type of issues. You can specify the most appropriate reason code         for each issue line; when no reason code is selected, the system automatically inserts the         default reason code of the  Issue  usage that is specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000) form. With a direct issue, the extended cost amount updates the balances of the inventory account         and of the offset account supplied by the reason code. The selected offset account depends         on the reason of the transaction; it is a specific expense account. If the issue has been         created for kit assembling, the offset account is usually an expense account, such as            Material Expense . If the issue has been created to remove expired goods, the offset         account might be  Expired Goods' Costs .  For issue lines of the  Invoice ,  Credit Memo , and  Debit Memo  types, you         can specify the price and the extended price of the line item.  The  Unit Price  and  Ext. Price  values         cannot be used for inventory issues of the  Return  and  Issue  types. On release of such transactions (with nonzero extended prices), the system generates the         following additional journal entries: For a line of the  Invoice  type, the extended price amount (sales amount) is           credited to the Sales account and debited to the AR Clearing account defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000) form.  For a line of the  Credit Memo  or  Debit Memo  type, this amount is credited           to the AR Clearing account and debited to the Sales account. The Sales account is           determined by the posting class of the item; can be overridden by the offset account of           the reason code it such code is specified.  To complete the sale to the customer or the customer return, you can later create an         appropriate AR document ( Invoice ,  Credit Memo , or  Debit Memo ) by using         the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form, and move the sales amount from the AR         Clearing account to the AR account of the customer. ]]></column>

Physical inventory is an important process if your organization that sells items, because it gives you accurate numbers of goods in stock. Acumatica ERP provides you with various methods of physical inventory counts (such as full physical inventory and cycle counting). You set up physical inventory during configuration of the Inventory module in the system.{br}

In this topic, you will find basic information about configuring physical inventory in Acumatica ERP.{br}{TOC}
==Configuration of Physical Inventory==
In Acumatica ERP, you can create as many types of physical inventory counts (called ''physical inventory types'') as you need by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_89_00|Physical Inventory Types] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) form. The physical inventory type defines the way the system selects inventory items for counting, and the order of count lines in the physical inventory document. For each physical count, you have to prepare the physical inventory document; you can also print the count sheets and count tags. You do the following to configure a physical inventory type:
*Select the generation method—that is, the method that the system will use to generate the list of inventory items. You can select one of the following methods:
**''Full Physical Inventory''
** ''By Inventory''
** ''By Item Class''
** ''By ABC Code''
** ''By Movement Class''
** ''By Cycle''
*:For a detailed description of these generation methods, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Physical_Inventory_Types|Types of Physical Inventory].
*Decide whether you want to include items with zero book quantity in the physical inventory. This setting is available for all physical inventory types except ''Full Physical Inventory'' and ''By Inventory''.
*Decide whether you want to display the '''Book Qty.''' column on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_10|Physical Inventory Count] ([~/?ScreenId=IN305010|IN305010]) form.
*Optional: Select a warehouse and warehouse location. If you use multiple warehouses or warehouse locations in the system, you can select a particular warehouse and location to perform the physical inventory. With the warehouse or location selected, the system will add to the list only items stored in this warehouse or location.
*Specify the assignment order. You define the order in which tag and line numbers are assigned to items on the count sheets prepared for counts of the selected type. These settings specify the sort order of count lines and, correspondingly, the sort order of the count tags that will be generated based on the physical inventory type. You can group items by one of the following entities:
**Inventory ID
**Inventory description
**Subitem (if you use subitems in the system)
**Lot/serial number (if you use lot or serial numbers in the system)
**Warehouse location ID (if you use multiple warehouse locations in the system)

In the physical inventory process, you can use count tags. Each count tag contains the information of the count line, including the book quantity and inventory ID of the set of units to be counted and recorded to the count tag. If you use tags, the system will assign a tag number to each line during the generation of the count sheet, with tag numbers in ascending order. To indicate that you want to use the tags, you select the '''Use Tags''' check box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the[HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form ('''Physical Inventory Settings''' section) and specify the last tag number.((({S:Warn}We recommend that you specify a relatively large last tag number, such as 1000 or 10000, so that the tag number will be easily distinguishable at a glance from the book quantity that is also printed on the tag.
)))
After you have configured the physical inventory, you can start the counting process at any time, as described in [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Physical_Inventory_Counts|Physical Inventory Counts].

Most organizations conduct a full physical inventory count for each warehouse at least once a year. A full physical inventory greatly improves the accuracy of availability data, but it disrupts business processes and can be very costly.{br}

 Acumatica ERP provides you with the functionality to support physical counts for full inventory, as well as other alternatives. These alternatives includes cycle counting, whereby all items are assigned to specific cycles and separate physical counts are performed for each cycle&rsquo;s items at an appropriate frequency. Because counting by alternate methods can be conducted more quickly, these methods are less disruptive to daily operations.{br}

In this topic, you will read about the types of physical inventory available in Acumatica ERP.{br}{TOC}
==Types of Physical Inventory==
In Acumatica ERP, you can use basic or advanced types of physical inventory counts, which depend on your license configuration as follows:[anchor|#_c8ec57d2-5cd3-4389-afc4-2e51d96a7219]
*If the ''Advanced Physical Counts'' feature is disabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] CS100000) form, you can use only the full physical inventory. With this type, you count all inventory items in all warehouses. For details, see [[#_c93b596a-d3a8-407f-abb1-53c390e48871|Full Physical Inventory].
*If the ''Advanced Physical Counts'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] CS100000) form, you can use the following advanced types of physical inventory counts:
**By item class: With this type, you count only stock items of the item classes you select. For more information, see: [[#_fb1f9130-8397-410d-b2ea-5cf54a163e7c|Count by Item Class].
**By specific stock stems: With this type, you count only particular stock items. For details, see [[#_41f48f72-6e83-4ee1-8530-edb1ed63006d|Count by Specific Stock Items].
**By cycle or by cycle count frequency: With this type, you count stock items depending on the specified counting frequency. For more information, see [[#_c3abacfb-eeb1-47ed-b66b-e7d8e6b40f37|Count by Cycle and by Cycle Count Frequency].
**By movement class or by associated count frequency: With this type, you count stock items depending on their turnover rates. For details, see [[#_ebde4ea9-921d-43ab-88e9-1b952f73c998|Count by Movement Class and by Associated Count Frequency]
**By ABC code and by code count frequency: With this type, you can count stock items depending on their stock values. For more information, see [[#_2726dde2-8370-48bc-b599-13ffe17f81d3|Count by ABC Code and by Code Count Frequency].
[anchor|#_c93b596a-d3a8-407f-abb1-53c390e48871]
==Full Physical Inventory==
If you select the ''Full Physical Inventory'' generation method on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_89_00|Physical Inventory Types] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) form, the resulting physical inventory document includes all stock items available in the specified warehouse, in all locations or only in the selected ones, with all combinations of subitem codes (if your implementation of Acumatica ERP uses subitems) and lot or serial numbers (if you use them in the system). For details about how to create a type for full physical inventory, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__How_Create_Full_Count_PI_Type|To Create a PI Type for a Full Count].{br}

Counting all the items in the warehouse is a time-consuming procedure generally performed before a planned closing of financial period. All movements of inventory involved in counting should be stopped during counting, and no transactions are released during counting.[anchor|#_fb1f9130-8397-410d-b2ea-5cf54a163e7c]
==Count by Item Class==
Depending on how you have defined item classes, you may decide to perform counts by item class. For example, one item class may include your company&rsquo;s most valuable items, which you count more frequently.{br}

If you select the ''By Item Class'' method on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_89_00|Physical Inventory Types] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) form, the '''Item Class Selection''' tab appears. On this tab, you can add one item class or multiple item classes for which the counting will be performed. If you add an item class that has child item classes, the physical inventory count is performed for the selected item class and all its child item classes as well.[anchor|#_41f48f72-6e83-4ee1-8530-edb1ed63006d]
==Count by Specific Stock Items==
By using the ''By Inventory'' generation method, you can create physical inventory types that generate count sheets with particular stock items. You select the appropriate method of selecting items on the '''Inventory Item Selection''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_89_00|Physical Inventory Types] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) form, which appears when you select the ''By Inventory'' generation method. You can select one of the following item selection methods in the '''Select Method''' box:[anchor|#ul_lz2_1fg_dr]
*''Items Having Negative Book Qty.'': Acumatica ERP can allow a negative inventory balance for items of specific item classes. Negative quantities may be allowed for a warehouse or to a specific location in a warehouse if the aggregated inventory is positive. The physical count may show positive values. 
*:You can create a physical inventory type based on this selection method, and specify that items should be selected for counting only if they have a negative quantity at one location or multiple locations in the system. With this type, you can check the actual availability of items shown on the books with negative quantities.
*''Random Items'': To evaluate the accuracy of item availability data, your organization might find it helpful to occasionally count items selected at random. By using this option, you can also check the accuracy of the full physical inventory. 
*:When you select the ''Random Items (up to)'' selection method, you also specify the number of items for counting. The system generates a count sheet with a randomly selected list of items.
*''Last Count On Or Before'': You can create a physical inventory type for a particular warehouse or any warehouse that would generate a list of items that were counted a specified number of days ago or earlier. 
*:When you select the ''Last Count On or Before'' selection method, in the '''Last Count Before (Days) '''box that appears to the right of the '''Selection Method '''box, specify the number of days. Items counted the specified number of days ago or sooner are included in this list, regardless of the physical count type in which the item was involved earlier.
*''List of Items'': In some cases, you may want to perform physical inventory for only particular items. For example, you may want to count the most valuable items stored at a specific location every other day. 
*:To count only particular items, you specify the ''List Of Items'' selection method and add the required items to the list.
[anchor|#_c3abacfb-eeb1-47ed-b66b-e7d8e6b40f37]
==Count by Cycle and by Cycle Count Frequency==
You can configure physical counting to be performed with a regular time interval by using cycle counting. You select the ''By Cycle'' generation method on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_89_00|Physical Inventory Types] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) form to create an inventory type by cycle. For details on configuring this type of physical counting, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Cycle_Counting_Configuration|Cycle Counting Configuration].{br}

The ''By Cycle'' generation method has the following variations:[anchor|#_4394881f-ef71-47d8-aa26-c722bbd1de8e]
*Including in the count only the items assigned to a particular cycle: For this variation, you specify the cycle in the '''Cycle ID''' box and clear the '''By Frequency''' check box on the '''PI Cycle Selection''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_89_00|Physical Inventory Types] form.
*Including the items of all cycles for which counting is due based on the frequency associated with their cycles: For this variation, you do not specify a cycle; instead, you select the '''By Frequency''' check box on the '''PI Cycle Selection''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_89_00|Physical Inventory Types] form.
[anchor|#_ebde4ea9-921d-43ab-88e9-1b952f73c998]
==Count by Movement Class and by Associated Count Frequency==
The more often a product is received or shipped, the less accurate its availability data may become. Thus, you may want to count items with higher turnover rates more frequently. To configure this type of physical inventory in Acumatica ERP, you define movement classes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_86_00|Movement Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208600|IN208600]) form and assign items to classes either on a permanent basis or by using their turnover rates during the specified turnover period. You then create a physical inventory type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_89_00|Physical Inventory Types] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) form with the ''By Movement Class'' generation method.{br}

The ''By Movement Class'' generation method has two variations, depending on the settings you specify on the '''Movement Class Selection''' tab (which appears when you select this generation method): [anchor|#_12b1174d-6ed4-4dd6-b791-fdc6724e42f5]
*Including in a count only the items assigned to a particular movement class: For this variation, specify a movement class in the '''Movement Class ID''' box and clear the '''By Frequency''' check box.
*Including the items of all classes for which counting is due based on the frequency associated with the movement class: For this variation, select the '''By Frequency''' check box rather than specifying a movement class.

Once items are assigned to movement classes, you can organize counting by movement classes in the following way: [anchor|#_7fe6459e-f294-41e9-a6ba-51c0732eac8c]
*Perform an initial full physical inventory
*Conduct subsequent counts in one of these ways: 
**By creating a type for each movement class and performing counts of each type at the frequency defined for the movement class.
**By creating a type with the '''By Frequency''' check box selected for the ''By Movement Class'' generation method. Make sure that the count-per-year values are factors of the largest count-per-year value. A physical inventory document in such a case can include items of multiple movement classes for which count-per-year values are factors of the largest count-per-year value. Conduct counts at a frequency defined by the largest value of counts per year required for movement classes.

==Count by ABC Code and by Code Count Frequency==
If your company uses ABC codes to identify items critical to your business, select the ''By ABC Code'' generation method to have counts performed based on the frequencies required for items with different codes assigned. ABC codes, which you create by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_85_00|ABC Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208500|IN208500]) form, group items by their stock value in a specific warehouse in a specific period, based on the period-to-date balances of inventory accounts. ABC codes divide items into groups that require different management and controls; for example, ''A'' code items, because of their high impact on the business, should be counted more often than items with other codes assigned. {br}

The generation method for counting based on ABC codes has two variations, based on your specifications on the '''ABC Code Selection''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_89_00|Physical Inventory Types] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) form, which appears when you select this generation method: [anchor|#_08b4a09f-8d94-4b61-b116-d5679727e163]
*Including in a count only the items assigned to a particular ABC code: For this variation, specify a code in the '''ABC Code''' box and leave the '''By Frequency''' check box clear.
*Including the items with any code for which counting is due based on the frequency associated with the ABC code: For this variation, select the '''By Frequency''' check box and do not specify an ABC code.

Once ABC codes are assigned to items, you can organize counting by ABC codes in the following way: [anchor|#_f589dfcd-587e-4e1b-b934-58d558814a99]
*Perform an initial full physical inventory.
*Conduct counts in one of these ways: 
**Create a type for each ABC code defined in the system (which has a specific frequency specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_85_00|ABC Codes] form). Conduct counts for items assigned to every code with the appropriate frequencies.
**Define one type for counts based on ABC codes with the '''By Frequency''' check box selected. Make sure that the count-per-year values for different codes are factors of the largest count-per-year value. Then when you&rsquo;re preparing the physical inventory document, only items that are due for counting by their code frequency will be included. A physical inventory document in this case can include items with different codes assigned for which count-per-year values are factors of the largest count-per-year value.

For details on configuration, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__How_Set_up_PI_by_ABCcodes|To Create a Physical Inventory Type for an ABC Code].{br}

Counting by ABC codes usually works best for maintaining accurate inventory counts because in most businesses, a small number of items generally accounts for the largest value of stock, and with this method, you count the high-value items most frequently.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Types of Physical Inventory Most organizations conduct a full physical inventory count for each warehouse at least once         a year. A full physical inventory greatly improves the accuracy of availability data, but it         disrupts business processes and can be very costly.  Acumatica ERP provides you with the functionality to support physical counts for full inventory, as         well as other alternatives. These alternatives includes cycle counting, whereby all items         are assigned to specific cycles and separate physical counts are performed for each cycle's         items at an appropriate frequency. Because counting by alternate methods can be conducted         more quickly, these methods are less disruptive to daily operations. In this topic, you will read about the types of physical inventory available in  Acumatica ERP. Types of Physical Inventory In  Acumatica ERP, you can use basic or advanced types of physical inventory counts, which depend on your         license configuration as follows: If the  Advanced Physical Counts  feature is disabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features CS100000) form, you can use only the full physical             inventory. With this type, you count all inventory items in all warehouses. For details,             see  Full Physical Inventory Full Physical Inventory. If the  Advanced Physical Counts  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features CS100000) form, you can use the following advanced types of             physical inventory counts: By item class: With this type, you count only stock items of the item classes you                 select. For more information, see:  Count by Item Class Count by Item Class. By specific stock stems: With this type, you count only particular stock items.                 For details, see  Count by Specific Stock Items Count by Specific Stock Items. By cycle or by cycle count frequency: With this type, you count stock items                 depending on the specified counting frequency. For more information, see  Count by Cycle and by Cycle Count Frequency Count by Cycle and by Cycle Count Frequency. By movement class or by associated count frequency: With this type, you count                 stock items depending on their turnover rates. For details, see  Count by Movement Class and by Associated Count Frequency Count by Movement Class and by Associated Count FrequencyBy ABC code and by code count frequency: With this type, you can count stock items                 depending on their stock values. For more information, see  Count by ABC Code and by Code Count Frequency Count by ABC Code and by Code Count Frequency. Full Physical Inventory If you select the  Full Physical Inventory  generation method on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) Physical Inventory Types (IN208900) form, the resulting physical inventory document         includes all stock items available in the specified warehouse, in all locations or only in         the selected ones, with all combinations of subitem codes (if your implementation of  Acumatica ERP uses subitems) and lot or serial numbers (if you use them in the system). For details         about how to create a type for full physical inventory, see  To Create a PI Type for a Full Count. Counting all the items in the warehouse is a time-consuming procedure generally performed         before a planned closing of financial period. All movements of inventory involved in         counting should be stopped during counting, and no transactions are released during         counting. Count by Item Class Depending on how you have defined item classes, you may decide to perform counts by item         class. For example, one item class may include your company's most valuable items, which you         count more frequently. If you select the  By Item Class  method on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) Physical Inventory Types         (IN208900) form, the  Item Class Selection  tab appears. On this tab,         you can add one item class or multiple item classes for which the counting will be         performed. If you add an item class that has child item classes, the physical inventory         count is performed for the selected item class and all its child item classes as well. Count by Specific Stock Items By using the  By Inventory  generation method, you can create physical inventory types         that generate count sheets with particular stock items. You select the appropriate method of         selecting items on the  Inventory Item Selection  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) Physical Inventory Types (IN208900) form, which appears when you select the  By           Inventory  generation method. You can select one of the following item selection         methods in the  Select Method  box: Items Having Negative Book Qty. :  Acumatica ERP can allow a negative inventory balance for items of specific item classes. Negative           quantities may be allowed for a warehouse or to a specific location in a warehouse if the           aggregated inventory is positive. The physical count may show positive values.  You can             create a physical inventory type based on this selection method, and specify that items             should be selected for counting only if they have a negative quantity at one location or             multiple locations in the system. With this type, you can check the actual availability             of items shown on the books with negative quantities. Random Items : To evaluate the accuracy of item availability data, your           organization might find it helpful to occasionally count items selected at random. By           using this option, you can also check the accuracy of the full physical inventory.  When             you select the  Random Items (up to)  selection method, you also specify the number             of items for counting. The system generates a count sheet with a randomly selected list             of items. Last Count On Or Before : You can create a physical inventory type for a           particular warehouse or any warehouse that would generate a list of items that were           counted a specified number of days ago or earlier.  When you select the  Last Count On               or Before  selection method, in the  Last Count Before (Days)              box that appears to the right of the  Selection Method              box, specify the number of days. Items counted the specified number of days             ago or sooner are included in this list, regardless of the physical count type in which             the item was involved earlier. List of Items : In some cases, you may want to perform physical inventory for only           particular items. For example, you may want to count the most valuable items stored at a           specific location every other day.  To count only particular items, you specify the                List Of Items  selection method and add the required items to the list. Count by Cycle and by Cycle Count Frequency You can configure physical counting to be performed with a regular time interval by using         cycle counting. You select the  By Cycle  generation method on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) Physical Inventory Types (IN208900) form to create an inventory type by cycle. For         details on configuring this type of physical counting, see  Cycle Counting Configuration. The  By Cycle  generation method has the following variations: Including in the count only the items assigned to a particular cycle: For this           variation, you specify the cycle in the  Cycle ID  box and clear the              By Frequency  check box on the  PI Cycle             Selection  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) Physical Inventory Types form. Including the items of all cycles for which counting is due based on the frequency           associated with their cycles: For this variation, you do not specify a cycle; instead, you           select the  By Frequency  check box on the  PI Cycle             Selection  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) Physical Inventory Types form. Count by Movement Class and by Associated Count Frequency The more often a product is received or shipped, the less accurate its availability data         may become. Thus, you may want to count items with higher turnover rates more frequently. To         configure this type of physical inventory in  Acumatica ERP, you define movement classes on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN208600|IN208600]) Movement Classes         (IN208600) form and assign items to classes either on a permanent basis or by using their         turnover rates during the specified turnover period. You then create a physical inventory         type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) Physical Inventory Types (IN208900) form with the  By Movement           Class  generation method. The  By Movement Class  generation method has two variations, depending on the         settings you specify on the  Movement Class Selection  tab (which         appears when you select this generation method):  Including in a count only the items assigned to a particular movement class: For this           variation, specify a movement class in the  Movement Class ID  box           and clear the  By Frequency  check box. Including the items of all classes for which counting is due based on the frequency           associated with the movement class: For this variation, select the  By             Frequency  check box rather than specifying a movement class. Once items are assigned to movement classes, you can organize counting by movement classes         in the following way:  Perform an initial full physical inventory Conduct subsequent counts in one of these ways:  By creating a type for each movement class and performing counts of each type at the               frequency defined for the movement class. By creating a type with the  By Frequency  check box selected               for the  By Movement Class  generation method. Make sure that the count-per-year               values are factors of the largest count-per-year value. A physical inventory document               in such a case can include items of multiple movement classes for which count-per-year               values are factors of the largest count-per-year value. Conduct counts at a frequency               defined by the largest value of counts per year required for movement classes. Count by ABC Code and by Code Count Frequency If your company uses ABC codes to identify items critical to your business, select the            By ABC Code  generation method to have counts performed based on the frequencies         required for items with different codes assigned. ABC codes, which you create by using the             ([~/?ScreenId=IN208500|IN208500]) ABC Codes (IN208500) form, group items by their stock         value in a specific warehouse in a specific period, based on the period-to-date balances of         inventory accounts. ABC codes divide items into groups that require different management and         controls; for example,  A  code items, because of their high impact on the business,         should be counted more often than items with other codes assigned.  The generation method for counting based on ABC codes has two variations, based on your         specifications on the  ABC Code Selection  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) Physical Inventory Types (IN208900) form, which appears when you select this generation         method:  Including in a count only the items assigned to a particular ABC code: For this           variation, specify a code in the  ABC Code  box and leave the              By Frequency  check box clear. Including the items with any code for which counting is due based on the frequency           associated with the ABC code: For this variation, select the  By             Frequency  check box and do not specify an ABC code. Once ABC codes are assigned to items, you can organize counting by ABC codes in the         following way:  Perform an initial full physical inventory. Conduct counts in one of these ways:  Create a type for each ABC code defined in the system (which has a specific               frequency specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN208500|IN208500]) ABC Codes form). Conduct counts for               items assigned to every code with the appropriate frequencies. Define one type for counts based on ABC codes with the  By                 Frequency  check box selected. Make sure that the count-per-year values               for different codes are factors of the largest count-per-year value. Then when you're               preparing the physical inventory document, only items that are due for counting by               their code frequency will be included. A physical inventory document in this case can               include items with different codes assigned for which count-per-year values are               factors of the largest count-per-year value. For details on configuration, see  To Create a Physical Inventory Type for an ABC Code. Counting by ABC codes usually works best for maintaining accurate inventory counts because         in most businesses, a small number of items generally accounts for the largest value of         stock, and with this method, you count the high-value items most frequently.  ]]></column>

In inventory management, you can use ABC codes and movement classes to identify categories of stock that may require different management and controls. By using these categorization methods, you can rank inventory items by their cost and turnover, respectively.

==ABC Codes==
Data gathered on various types of businesses shows that the 80-20 rule applies to most of them: 80% of the effect is generated by 20% of the cause. Similar logic generally applies to inventory: 
*A small number of items (which can be designated with the ''A'' code) typically accounts for the largest value of stock.
*A slightly larger number of items (''B'' code items) accounts for a smaller yet significant stock value.
*The remaining large number of items (''C'' code items) accounts for only a small part of stock value.
((({S:Warn}In Acumatica ERP, the ABC codes are specified in such a way that the total of percentages for all codes should be equal to 100%.
)))
Ranking items by stock values can be used as the basis for planning efficient physical inventories in which ''A'' items are counted more often than ''B'' items (which in turn are counted more often than ''C'' items). This reduces the total number of counts performed while maintaining more accurate inventory levels. {br}

You define the ABC codes to be used for inventory items (stock items) by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_85_00|ABC Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208500|IN208500]) form. For each code, you specify the percentage threshold and the frequency of physical counts per year. 
==Assignment of ABC Codes==
Initially, you can manually assign ABC codes to some items by using the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, and the items will have the same code assigned in every warehouse until the code assignment is updated for the first time. You should assign codes to only items for which codes will be fixed (that is, not updated over time) and skip initial assignment for other items. {br}

At the end of a financial period, you can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_60_00|Update ABC Code] ([~/?ScreenId=IN506000|IN506000]) form to mass-assign ABC codes to items based on their stock-on-hand values. For the selected warehouse and financial period, the system assigns pending ABC codes as follows: 
*The system arranges inventory items in decreasing order, based on their percentages of total stock.
*For each item, a subtotal is calculated as the item&rsquo;s percentage plus the previous subtotal (the sum of percentages of previous items).
*These subtotals are compared to the thresholds specified for codes as follows: Items for which the subtotals are less than the threshold for the ''A'' code are assigned the pending ''A'' code (including the item whose subtotal is equal to the ''A'' threshold if any). Items with subtotal percentages between the threshold for ''A'' and the sum of the thresholds for ''A'' and ''B'' codes will be assigned to the pending ''B'' code. Assignment continues in this fashion, and the subtotals for the ''C''-code items should be greater than the sum of ''A'' and ''B'' thresholds and less than the sum of the ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' thresholds.

You can view the list of the inventory items with their current and pending ABC codes, and update the ABC code assignments for all displayed items. {br}

The ABC analysis gives you an immediate view of items that are expensive to stock. By using this analysis, you can learn where your money is locked up and reduce the stock of expensive items. When planning physical inventories, you can perform counts for items with each code at the appropriate frequency for that code. {br}

Items with fixed codes are part of the assignment, but their codes do not change in accordance with the statistical data. ((({S:Hint}ABC code assignment should be performed only when a certain volume of statistical data is available. If the data is available for fewer items than a certain threshold number, no items will be assigned to the ''A'' code.
)))
==Movement Classes==
As with ABC codes, movement classes group items based on key inventory data—in this case, stock turnover rates. Items are grouped into a few classes, such as fast moving items, normal moving items, slow moving items, and dormant items. For each movement class, which is defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_86_00|Movement Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208600|IN208600]) form, you specify the frequency of physical counts per year and the threshold value based on turnover to assign inventory items to this class. {br}

The number of turnover periods per year for all warehouses is specified ('''Turnover Periods per Year''') on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form. Inventory turnover rate for an item for a period is calculated as {{Quantity Sold during a turnover period / Average Quantity on Hand}}. The {{Average Quantity on Hand}} is calculated as a sum of on-hand quantities at the end of each last 12 periods divided by the number of periods in the last financial year, including the analyzed period.
==Assignment of Movement Classes==
You can initially assign items to movement classes by using the '''Attributes''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form; these items will have the same class in every warehouse until movement class assignments are updated for the first time. You might instead initially assign to the classes only items for which class assignment will be fixed and skip assignment for other items. {br}

You can update movement class assignments for a particular warehouse and a selected turnover period by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_61_00|Update Movement Class] ([~/?ScreenId=IN506100|IN506100]) form. The system assigns movement classes to items as follows: 
*For each warehouse, the system arranges inventory items in decreasing order by their average turnover rate in this warehouse ({{Quantity Sold during a turnover period/ Average Quantity}}). The {{Average Quantity on Hand}} is calculated as a sum of on-hand quantities at the end of each last 12 periods divided by the number of periods in the last financial year, including the analyzed period.
*For each item starting from the item with the highest turnover rate, the item&rsquo;s turnover rate is compared to the thresholds (maximum turnover rates) defined for each movement class. If the item&rsquo;s turnover rate is less than or equal to the lowest threshold, the item is assigned to the appropriate class. If the item&rsquo;s turnover rate is between two successive thresholds, that is, less than threshold of the class N and greater than or equal to the threshold for the class M, then the item is assigned to the class N. 

When planning physical inventories, you can organize counts by the frequencies specified for movement classes. Thus, you can perform counts for items with higher turnover rates more frequently. Items of each movement class will be counted at the frequency you&rsquo;ve specified for the movement class.

==Configuration of Cycle Counting==
The configuration of cycle counting includes the following stages:[anchor|#ol_kxc_mmf_zl]
#Creating physical inventory cycles.
#:You should decide how often you want to perform full counts and which items you want to count more frequently (and how often). Thus, items of all cycles will be counted during the full inventory count, which is performed least frequently, and some of the other counts will include items of more than one cycle.
#:You create physical inventory cycles (physical inventory cycles) by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_87_00|Physical Inventory Cycles] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208700|IN208700]) form. For the full count and for each cycle, you specify how many times in a year the items should be counted (that is, the count-per-year value). For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__How_to_Setup_PI_by_Cycles|To Create Physical Inventory Cycles].
#Assigning stock items to the appropriate cycles. 
#:If you configure cycle counting during the implementation stage, you can assign stock items to physical inventory cycles when you import the stock items from your legacy system. Otherwise, you need to assign each item to an appropriate cycle manually. For more information, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Assign_Stock_Items_to_PI_Cycles|To Assign a Stock Item to a Physical Inventory Cycle].
#Creating physical inventory types. Before you create these types, you should plan the convention for the identifiers of physical inventory types and decide how to organize data on count sheets for each type of count. You will need to create a type for a full count (see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__How_Create_Full_Count_PI_Type|To Create a PI Type for a Full Count]) and one type for counting by frequency (see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Create_PI_Types_for_Counts_by_Frequency|To Create a Physical Inventory Type for Cycle Counts by Frequency]). Optionally, you can create a physical inventory type for each cycle (see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Create_PI_Types_for_Cycles|To Create a Physical Inventory Type for Counts by Cycles]). 

After you have configured the cycle counting, you can perform the physical inventory counts in the following order:[anchor|#_f8b7acf0-3dea-4d01-a35a-e6cede12ee56]
#Conducting an initial full physical inventory.
#Conducting other counts with the frequency determined by the largest (among all cycles) number of counts per year and by using the physical inventory type that selects items by their count frequency. For each count, only items that are due for counting by their cycle frequency will be included. Some counts will include the only the items with the largest frequency, while other counts will be joint counts—for items from two or more cycles.
#:((({S:Warn}If some warehouses have items of only specific cycles, you can perform counts by cycles in those warehouses.

Some counts will include the only the items with the largest           frequency, while other counts will be joint counts—for items from two or more             cycles. If some warehouses have items of only specific cycles, you can perform             counts by cycles in those warehouses. ]]></column>

In this topic, you will find information about configuration of physical inventory by ABC codes.{br}{TOC}
==Configuration of PI Counts by ABC Codes==
The configuration of counting based on ABC codes includes the following stages:[anchor|#ol_kxc_mmf_zl]
#Creating ABC codes and specifying counting frequencies for the ABC codes. 
#:When you plan count frequencies, you should make sure that the count-per-year values for different codes are factors of the largest count-per-year value (that is, the largest value can be divided by the smaller ones with no remainder). For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Create_ABC_Code|To Create ABC Codes].
#Assigning stock items to the appropriate ABC codes. 
#:If you configure counting by ABC codes during the implementation stage, you can assign the initial ABC codes to items when you import the stock items from your legacy system. Otherwise, you assign the codes to items manually. Later, as the statistical data on sales is collected, you can update ABC codes for items automatically, as described in [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Assign_ABC_Codes_to_Stock_Items|To Assign an ABC Code to a Stock Item].
#Creating physical inventory types. 
#:You create a type for a full count (see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__How_Create_Full_Count_PI_Type|To Create a PI Type for a Full Count]) and a type for counting by frequency (see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Create_PI_Type_for_Counts_by_ABC_Codes_Frequency|To Create a Physical Inventory Type for Counts by ABC Code and Frequency]). Then when you are preparing the physical inventory document, the system will include only the items that are due for counting based on their code frequency. Also, you can create PI types for particular codes (see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__How_Set_up_PI_by_ABCcodes|To Create a Physical Inventory Type for an ABC Code]). You should plan the convention for the identifiers of PI types and decide how to organize data on count sheets for each type of count.

After you have configured counting by ABC codes, you can perform physical inventory in the following order:[anchor|#_ddc69898-6e0b-4aba-adb9-c42fd62350ac]
#Performing an initial full physical inventory.
#Conducting counts based on ABC codes by frequency.
#Optional: Conducting counts by particular ABC codes.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
In Acumatica ERP, you can track stock item costs over time in accordance with the valuation method assigned to each item. Item costs are tracked for base units, as the units in which items are stored at warehouses or moved between locations or warehouses. Depending on the valuation method you have selected for the stock item, the cost of its base unit is either computed by the system based on purchase receipts or estimated outside the system and entered manually by a user.{br}

For information about how costs are maintained for non-stock items, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Non-Stock_Item_Support|Non-Stock Items in Sales and Purchases]. For information on allocation of purchase price variance amounts for items with different valuation methods, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\IN__con_PPV_Allocation|Allocating Purchase Price Variance].{br}

In this topic, you will read about valuation methods and costs in inventory.{br}{TOC}
==Valuation Methods==
The system uses the item&rsquo;s valuation method to revalue its stock and to determine its unit cost for sales orders and inventory transactions.((({S:Warn}The decimal precision for prices and costs is defined by the number specified in the '''Price / Cost Decimal Places''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) form.
)))
You specify the '''Valuation Method''' for the item on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. You can assign one of the following valuation methods: [anchor|#ul_trk_h22_rj]
*''FIFO'' (first in, first out)
*''Specific''
* ''Average''
* ''Standard Cost''

These methods are discussed in detail in the following sections.((({S:Hint}You can reassign an item&rsquo;s valuation method from ''FIFO'' to ''Average'', from ''Average'' to ''FIFO'', and from ''Standard Cost'' to ''Average'' and ''FIFO'' at any time.
))){br}{TOC}
==FIFO Valuation Method==
If the ''FIFO'' valuation method is assigned to a stock item, its unit costs are recorded in layers, each of which is identified by the receipt date, the quantity, and the purchase price (unit cost).{br}

Each new receipt creates a new cost layer with specific unit cost. You can view the cost of the last layer in the '''Last Cost''' read-only box on the '''Price/Cost information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form. ((({S:Hint}By default, the item cost is zero until it has been automatically or manually assigned.
)))
When a certain quantity of the stock item is issued, the cost for the item is assigned starting with the earliest available cost layer. If the quantity to be issued is greater than the quantity in the earliest layer, the entire quantity from the earliest layer will be issued (with the associated unit cost) and the rest of the required quantity will be issued using the next earliest layer (with another unit cost).{br}

Consider assigning the ''FIFO'' issue method to items actually issued from the inventory. This will help your company avoid discarding obsolete items.{br}

Suppose that a stock item was purchased in the following way:
*Cost layer 1: May 10, 5 units at $8 each
*Cost layer 2: June 10, 5 units at $10 each

The total stock cost is (5 &#42; $8) + (5 &#42; $10) = $90.{br}

Then suppose that a sales order has been created with 8 items. All units from cost layer 1, and three units from cost layer 2 will be used to complete the transaction, with the extended cost equal to (5 &#42; $8) + (3 &#42; $10) = $70. For the next sales order, there will be no more items with the $8 unit cost.((({S:Hint}For each location in a warehouse that has the '''Cost Separately''' check box selected on the '''Location Table''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form, separate cost layers will be created, based on purchase receipts made to the particular location. If certain quantities of the items should be issued from the location, the extended cost will be computed based on those location-specific cost layers.
)))
For each warehouse, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] form, you also can define which costs should be used for items returned to the warehouse (on returns) and for items found during inventory counts (on inventory receipts) by selecting one of the following options in the '''FIFO Default Returns Cost''' box:[anchor|#ul_vpt_vnr_cq]
*''Average'': To recalculate the item cost as an average cost of available items
*''Last'': To set the item&rsquo;s cost equal to the last cost

==Specific Valuation Method==
The ''Specific'' valuation method is used for serialized items (those with lot or serial numbers). With this method, the unit cost for each item is defined by the unit&rsquo;s purchase price. The unit cost assigned to the item on its receipt will remain the same until the item is issued, used as a component, or sold.{br}

With the ''Specific'' method, cost layers are based on the serial or lot numbers. New receipts specifying the same serial or lot number will update the cost of the layer. {br}

For example, suppose that a stock item was purchased as follows:
*May 19, 100 items starting with the serial number 11023423 at $2.00 each
*May 21, 100 items starting with the serial number 11023523 at $2.10 each
*May 19, 100 items starting with the serial number 11023623 at $1.90 each
*May 19, 100 items starting with the serial number 11023723 at $2.20 each

The total stock cost is $820. When items with the serial numbers 11023666 and 11023444 are sold, the unit costs recorded to the COGS account are $1.90 and $2.00 respectively. 
==Average Valuation Method==
If the ''Average'' valuation method (also known as ''average moving cost'') is assigned to the stock item, the unit cost will be calculated as the average weighted cost of all items at the warehouses—that is, the total costs of all quantities of the inventory items at the warehouses divided by the total quantity. This valuation method is used for items that do not require tracking by lot or serial numbers or by expiration dates.{br}

The system updates the average cost every time a new receipt specifying a unit cost different from the current average cost is released. Once this receipt has been released, a batch of journal entries will be generated to adjust the costs of all available items. You can view the current average cost in the '''Average Cost''' read-only box on the '''Price/Cost information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form.{br}

Suppose that a stock item was purchased as follows:
*Layer 1: 100 items at $2.00 each
*Layer 2: 100 items at $2.10 each
*Layer 3: 100 items at $1.90 each
*Layer 4: 100 items at $2.20 each

The total stock cost is $820, and the average cost is $2.05. If you sell 250 items, the unit cost is $2.05, and the extended cost recorded to the COGS account is $512.5 = $2.05 &#42; 250. {br}

For each warehouse, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form, you also can define which cost should be used for items returned to the warehouse (on returns) and for items found during inventory counts (on inventory receipts) by selecting one of the following options in the '''Avg. Default Returns Cost''' box:[anchor|#ul_j2j_54r_cq]
*''Average'': To recalculate the item cost as an average cost of available items
*''Last'': To set the item&rsquo;s cost equal to the last cost

==Standard Cost Valuation Method==
Standard costs, which are estimated to include some of the indirect and direct costs allocated, for stock items are determined outside of Acumatica ERP by cost experts. For an inventory item with the ''Standard Cost'' valuation method assigned, the unit cost is entered directly by a user in the '''Pending Cost''' box on the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form.{br}

For items with the standard cost valuation method, standard costs can be maintained for each warehouse separately if the '''Override Standard Cost''' check box on the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form is selected for the item stored at a particular warehouse.{br}

The item cost doesn&rsquo;t change when new receipts are released.{br}

Suppose that a stock item with a standard cost of $2.50 was purchased in the following way:
*Layer 1: 100 items at $2.00 each
*Layer 2: 100 items at $1.90 each
*Layer 3: 100 items at $2.30 each
*Layer 4: 100 items at $2.60 each

The total stock cost is $1000. Any differences between the standard cost and the unit cost on receipts multiplied by the quantity on the receipt are recorded to the standard cost variance account. In this case, $50, $60, $30, and –$10 respectively. On sales orders, the unit cost will appear as $2.50.{br}

Generally, standard costs are revised at the end of the financial year based on the financial results of the year, although standard costs can be updated as often as required.{br}

If you want to update standard costs for inventory items, you use the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. New values for standard costs are entered as pending standard costs. The pending cost assigned to an inventory item that uses the standard cost valuation method becomes effective starting on the date specified in the '''Pending Date''' box on this tab.{br}

If you want to make similar changes to many or all inventory items, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_20_00|Update Standard Costs] ([~/?ScreenId=IN502000|IN502000]) form to enter new values and compare current and pending costs side by side for all inventory items. If you are satisfied with the changes, you can update the current standard costs with the pending standard costs for all items or only selected ones by using the '''Process All''' or '''Process''' action on the form toolbar. When standard costs are updated and inventory is revalued for multiple inventory items, the system generates a consolidated inventory adjustment for the items being processed to make the necessary cost corrections. The consolidated inventory adjustment is generated on the current business date. To view the list of generated adjustments, use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_30_00|Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=IN303000|IN303000]) form.[anchor|#_41cbf8e1-afbe-49e0-b624-97618425f69f]((({S:Warn}If multiple branches are used in the system a separate inventory adjustment is created for each branch.
)))
If you want to change the settings of the standard cost for the item stored at a particular warehouse by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] form, you make the required changes on this form and then update standard costs by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_20_00|Update Standard Costs] form.{br}

The system does not keep a history of the standard costs for the inventory items, displaying only the last cost and current cost values on the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form. The historical costs that were effective before the last cost are not stored in the database.
==Item Cost Split by Subitem Codes==
 Acumatica ERP supports subitem codes, which can provide more detailed classification of the products, in addition to the inventory ID. The use of subitems may affect product costing if the ''FIFO'' or ''Specific'' valuation methods are used.{br}

Subitem codes, like inventory IDs, consist of segments. Products with the same inventory ID and different subitem codes can be costed as one item, or the cost may be split among different values of one of the subitem segments. This is controlled by the '''Include in Cost''' option, which is specified for each segment of the ''INSUBITEM'' segmented key by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form:
*If the check box is selected for the subitem segment, a separate cost layer is created for each value of the segment.
*If the check box is cleared for the segment, all items with different values in this segment are handled as one item for costing purposes. For such a segment, one segment value should be marked as the ''aggregating value''. It does not have to represent any real feature of the product (such as size or color); it will be used in cost layers to designate all available values of the segment.
((({S:Hint}Including or excluding the segment from cost calculation and changing the aggregating value may result in losing cost layers, because the cost layer is created differently when one segment is included in cost calculation and no segment is included.
)))
Subitems can affect only cost, while price is always set at the inventory item level. For more information about subitem use, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Inventory_IDs_and_Subitem_Codes|Inventory Subitems].
==Unit Cost and Extended Cost On Issues==
For items with the ''Standard Cost'' or ''Average'' valuation methods, on inventory issues, unit costs (costs with respect to the base unit) are specified in the '''Unit Cost''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form.{br}

If an item has the ''FIFO'' or ''Specific'' valuation method assigned, costs of its units may be different, and the '''Unit Cost''' box on the form displays the unit cost for the first unit to be issued, in accordance with the inventory item&rsquo;s issue method. You can invoke the '''Allocations''' dialog box to view particular items to be issued or to select them by lot or serial numbers. The '''Extended Cost''' value on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form will automatically appear as the sum of the unit costs of all listed items.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Item Costs and Valuation Methods In  Acumatica ERP, you can track stock item costs over time in accordance with the valuation method 				assigned to each item. Item costs are tracked for base units, as the units in which 				items are stored at warehouses or moved between locations or warehouses. Depending 				on the valuation method you have selected for the stock item, the cost of its base 				unit is either computed by the system based on purchase receipts or estimated 				outside the system and entered manually by a user. For information about how costs are maintained for non-stock items, see  Non-Stock Items in Sales and Purchases. For information on 				allocation of purchase price variance amounts for items with different valuation 				methods, see  Allocating Purchase Price Variance. In this topic, you will read about valuation methods and costs in inventory. Valuation Methods The system uses the item's valuation method to revalue its stock and to determine its 				unit cost for sales orders and inventory transactions. The decimal precision for prices and costs is defined by the number specified in 				the  Price / Cost Decimal Places  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) Companies (CS101500) form. You specify the  Valuation Method  for the item on the  General Settings  				tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form. You can 				assign one of the following valuation methods:  FIFO  (first in, first out) Specific Average Standard Cost These methods are discussed in detail in the following sections. You can reassign an item's valuation method from  FIFO  to 					 Average , from  Average  to  FIFO , and from  Standard 					Cost  to  Average  and  FIFO  at any time. FIFO Valuation Method If the  FIFO  valuation method is assigned to a stock item, its unit costs are recorded 				in layers, each of which is identified by the receipt date, the quantity, and the 				purchase price (unit cost). Each new receipt creates a new cost layer with specific unit cost. You can view the 				cost of the last layer in the  Last Cost  read-only box on the  Price/Cost 					information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form.  By default, the item cost is zero until it has been automatically or 				manually assigned. When a certain quantity of the stock item is issued, the cost for the item is assigned 				starting with the earliest available cost layer. If the quantity to be issued is 				greater than the quantity in the earliest layer, the entire quantity from the 				earliest layer will be issued (with the associated unit cost) and the rest of the 				required quantity will be issued using the next earliest layer (with another unit 				cost). Consider assigning the  FIFO  issue method to items actually issued from the inventory. 				This will help your company avoid discarding obsolete items. Suppose that a stock item was purchased in the following way: Cost layer 1: May 10, 5 units at $8 each Cost layer 2: June 10, 5 units at $10 each The total stock cost is (5 * $8) + (5 * $10) = $90. Then suppose that a sales order has been created with 8 items. All units from cost layer 1, 				and three units from cost layer 2 will be used to complete the transaction, with the 				extended cost equal to (5 * $8) + (3 * $10) = $70. For the next sales order, there 				will be no more items with the $8 unit cost. For each location in a warehouse that has the 					 Cost 					Separately  check box selected on the  Location 					Table  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses (IN204000) form, 				separate cost layers will be created, based on purchase receipts made to the 				particular location. If certain quantities of the items should be issued from the 				location, the extended cost will be computed based on those location-specific cost 				layers. For each warehouse, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses form, you also can define which 				costs should be used for items returned to the warehouse (on returns) and for items 				found during inventory counts (on inventory receipts) by selecting one of the 				following options in the  FIFO Default Returns Cost  box: Average : To recalculate the item cost as an average cost of available items Last : To set the item's cost equal to the last cost Specific Valuation Method The  Specific  valuation method is used for serialized items (those with lot or serial 				numbers). With this method, the unit cost for each item is defined by the unit's 				purchase price. The unit cost assigned to the item on its receipt will remain the 				same until the item is issued, used as a component, or sold. With the  Specific  method, cost layers are based on the serial or lot numbers. New 				receipts specifying the same serial or lot number will update the cost of the layer.  For example, suppose that a stock item was purchased as follows: May 19, 100 items starting with the serial number 11023423 at $2.00 each May 21, 100 items starting with the serial number 11023523 at $2.10 each May 19, 100 items starting with the serial number 11023623 at $1.90 each May 19, 100 items starting with the serial number 11023723 at $2.20 each The total stock cost is $820. When items with the serial numbers 11023666 and 				11023444 are sold, the unit costs recorded to the COGS account are $1.90 and $2.00 				respectively.  Average Valuation Method If the  Average  valuation method (also known as  average moving cost ) is assigned 				to the stock item, the unit cost will be calculated as the average weighted cost of 				all items at the warehouses—that is, the total costs of all quantities of the 				inventory items at the warehouses divided by the total quantity. This valuation 				method is used for items that do not require tracking by lot or serial numbers or by 				expiration dates. The system updates the average cost every time a new receipt specifying a unit cost different 				from the current average cost is released. Once this receipt has been released, a 				batch of journal entries will be generated to adjust the costs of all available 				items. You can view the current average cost in the  Average Cost  read-only 				box on the  Price/Cost information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items 				(IN202500) form. Suppose that a stock item was purchased as follows: Layer 1: 100 items at $2.00 each Layer 2: 100 items at $2.10 each Layer 3: 100 items at $1.90 each Layer 4: 100 items at $2.20 each The total stock cost is $820, and the average cost is $2.05. If you sell 250 items, 				the unit cost is $2.05, and the extended cost recorded to the COGS account is $512.5 				= $2.05 * 250.  For each warehouse, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses (IN204000) form, you also can 				define which cost should be used for items returned to the warehouse (on returns) 				and for items found during inventory counts (on inventory receipts) by selecting one 				of the following options in the  Avg. Default Returns Cost  				box: Average : To recalculate the item cost as an average cost of available items Last : To set the item's cost equal to the last cost Standard Cost Valuation Method Standard costs, which are estimated to include some of the indirect and direct costs 				allocated, for stock items are determined outside of  Acumatica ERP by cost experts. For an inventory item with the  Standard Cost  valuation 				method assigned, the unit cost is entered directly by a user in the  Pending 					Cost  box on the  Price/Cost Information  tab of the 					  ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form. For items with the standard cost valuation method, standard costs can be maintained 				for each warehouse separately if the  Override Standard Cost  check box on the 					 Price/Cost Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details (IN204500) form is selected for the item 				stored at a particular warehouse. The item cost doesn't change when new receipts are released. Suppose that a stock item with a standard cost of $2.50 was purchased in the 				following way: Layer 1: 100 items at $2.00 each Layer 2: 100 items at $1.90 each Layer 3: 100 items at $2.30 each Layer 4: 100 items at $2.60 each The total stock cost is $1000. Any differences between the standard cost and the unit 				cost on receipts multiplied by the quantity on the receipt are recorded to the 				standard cost variance account. In this case, $50, $60, $30, and –$10 				respectively. On sales orders, the unit cost will appear as $2.50. Generally, standard costs are revised at the end of the financial year based on the 				financial results of the year, although standard costs can be updated as often as 				required. If you want to update standard costs for inventory items, you use the  Price/Cost 					Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items or   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form. New values for standard 				costs are entered as pending standard costs. The pending cost assigned to an 				inventory item that uses the standard cost valuation method becomes effective 				starting on the date specified in the  Pending Date  box on this tab. If you want to make similar changes to many or all inventory items, you use the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN502000|IN502000]) Update Standard Costs (IN502000) form to enter new values and 				compare current and pending costs side by side for all inventory items. If you are 				satisfied with the changes, you can update the current standard costs with the 				pending standard costs for all items or only selected ones by using the  Process 					All  or  Process  action on the form toolbar. When standard costs are 				updated and inventory is revalued for multiple inventory items, the system generates 				a consolidated inventory adjustment for the items being processed to make the 				necessary cost corrections. The consolidated inventory adjustment is generated on 				the current business date. To view the list of generated adjustments, use the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN303000|IN303000]) Adjustments (IN303000) form. If multiple branches are used in the system a separate inventory adjustment is created for each branch. If you want to change the settings of the standard cost for the item stored at a 				particular warehouse by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details 				form, you make the required changes on this form and then update standard costs by 				using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN502000|IN502000]) Update Standard Costs form. The system does not keep a history of the standard costs for the inventory items, displaying 				only the last cost and current cost values on the  Price/Cost Information  tab 				of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
For effective inventory management, your company needs to know the value of the inventory at its warehouses. Acumatica ERP implements the perpetual system of maintaining the cost of inventory. With perpetual inventory system, your company can know the quantity of inventory on hand, its cost and the cost of goods sold at any moment of time.{br}{TOC}
==Multiple Valuation Methods==
Under the perpetual inventory system, the balance of the account Inventory (or multiple inventory accounts used for different warehouses or classes or groups of items) is updated with each sale or purchase transaction. Each time your company purchases stock items, the inventory account is debited for the cost of items; each time your company sells the items, the inventory account is credited for the cost of sold items.{br}

Under the perpetual inventory system, you can use inventory valuation (cost flow) methods to define how unit costs are determined for each inventory item on issues, thus allowing the system to maintain a correct, up-to-date inventory cost. You can use the following valuation methods:
*Standard cost
*Average
*First-in-first-out (FIFO)
*Specific

You assign valuation methods to stock items in the following ways:
*By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form, you can assign a valuation method to a class, which will be used for the items of the class.
*By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, you can assign a valuation method to a particular item, if you want to override the valuation method of its item class.

The valuation methods are discussed in detail in [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Item_Costs_and_Valuation_Methods|Item Costs and Valuation Methods]. 
==Negative Quantities==
In the Inventory module, a negative quantity of an inventory item of a specific item class is allowed at a location as long as the quantity on hand is positive. Appropriate warnings are issued on transactions that result in negative quantities. The '''Allow Negative Quantity''' check box is located in the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form.((({S:Hint}This check box can be applied to items with the standard cost, average cost, and FIFO valuation methods. You cannot apply this check box to items with lot or serial numbers assigned.
)))
Negative quantities on hand can result when an issue has been made before the release of the receipt reflecting the arrival of a certain quantity of the inventory item. In this case, for the over-issued quantity, a new layer is created. The cost assigned to the layer is the most recent historical cost of the item. When the inventory is actually received (on receipt in question release), the system compares the cost on the over-issue layer with the cost on the receipt, and generates a cost adjustment for the difference multiplied by the quantity on the layer (the quantity of over-issued units).
==Inventory Valuation and Revaluation==
You can review the cost of inventory on hand by using the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_61_55_00|Inventory Valuation] ([~/?ScreenId=IN615500|IN615500]) and [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_61_70_00|Historical Inventory Valuation] ([~/?ScreenId=IN617000|IN617000]) reports.{br}

Generally, standard costs are revised at the end of the financial year based on the year’s financial results, although they can be updated more often. The pending standard costs and their effective dates are entered manually for each inventory item that uses this valuation method on the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form.{br}

You can run the process of updating the standard costs with the pending standard costs for multiple inventory items by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_20_00|Update Standard Costs] ([~/?ScreenId=IN502000|IN502000]) form. For items whose standard costs are being updated, revaluation of their cost is performed. The system generates a batch of transactions that increase or decrease the balance of the inventory accounts, depending on whether the pending costs are greater or less than the current costs and updates the Standard Cost Revaluation accounts defined by the item’s posting class.
==Inclusion of Tax Amounts in Costs for Stock Items==
You can configure the system to include use taxes, sales taxes of the ''Input'' group, and partially deductible VATs in the cost of the stock items being purchased. For tax amounts to be included in the costs of items in purchase orders, the following actions must be completed in the system:[anchor|#_ddb0a59a-4b7e-4638-bb69-615e81152c5a]
*A tax reason code of the ''Adjustment'' type must be defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_21_10_00|Reason Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS211000|CS211000]) form, and specified as the '''Tax Reason Code''' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form.
*In the tax settings on the '''GL Accounts''' tab. on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\TX_20_50_00|Taxes] ([~/?ScreenId=TX205000|TX205000]) form, the '''Use Tax Expense Account''' check box must be cleared.

For a stock item with the ''Average'', ''Specific'', or ''FIFO'' valuation method, on release of an AP bill prepared for a purchase order that includes the item, an inventory adjustment transaction is automatically generated to post the tax amounts to the item&rsquo;s inventory account.{br}

The system shows the link to the generated inventory adjustment transaction in the '''Adjustment Nbr.''' box on the '''Financial Details''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form for the AP bill. On release of the inventory adjustment, the system generates the following GL transactions:[anchor|#_4c56cf01-38a9-47a7-9378-d043078628bc]
*Inventory Account, Dr, Tax Amount
*PO Accrual account, Cr, Tax Amount
((({S:Warn}For partially deductible VAT taxes, only the expense part is posted to the item&rsquo;s inventory account.
)))
For stock items with the ''Standard'' valuation method, in the GL transaction generated on release of the AP bill that includes the items, the tax amount is posted directly to the account defined by the '''Tax Reason Code'''. For more information on including taxes in the cost of items, see [HelpRoot_Financials\Taxes_Including_Tax_to_Item_Cost_GeneralInfo|Taxes Included in the Cost of Items: General Information].

When the inventory is actually 				received (on receipt in question release), the system compares the cost on the 				over-issue layer with the cost on the receipt, and generates a cost adjustment for 				the difference multiplied by the quantity on the layer (the quantity of over-issued 				units). Inventory Valuation and Revaluation You can review the cost of inventory on hand by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN615500|IN615500]) Inventory Valuation (IN615500) and   ([~/?ScreenId=IN617000|IN617000]) Historical Inventory Valuation (IN617000) reports. Generally, standard costs are revised at the end of the financial year based on the 				year’s financial results, although they can be updated more often. The pending 				standard costs and their effective dates are entered manually for each inventory 				item that uses this valuation method on the  Price/Cost Information  tab of the 					  ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form. You can run the process of updating the standard costs with the pending standard 				costs for multiple inventory items by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN502000|IN502000]) Update Standard Costs (IN502000) form. For items whose standard costs are being 				updated, revaluation of their cost is performed. The system generates a batch of 				transactions that increase or decrease the balance of the inventory accounts, 				depending on whether the pending costs are greater or less than the current costs 				and updates the Standard Cost Revaluation accounts defined by the item’s posting 				class. Inclusion of Tax Amounts in Costs for Stock Items You can configure the system to include use taxes, sales taxes of the  Input  				group, and partially deductible VATs in the cost of the stock items being purchased. 				For tax amounts to be included in the costs of items in purchase orders, the 				following actions must be completed in the system: A tax reason code of the  Adjustment  type must be defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS211000|CS211000]) Reason Codes (CS211000) form, and specified as the 						 Tax Reason Code  on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) Purchase Orders Preferences (PO101000) form. In the tax settings on the  GL Accounts  tab. on the   ([~/?ScreenId=TX205000|TX205000]) Taxes (TX205000) form, the  Use 						Tax Expense Account  check box must be cleared. For a stock item with the  Average ,  Specific , or  FIFO  valuation 				method, on release of an AP bill prepared for a purchase order that includes the 				item, an inventory adjustment transaction is automatically generated to post the tax 				amounts to the item's inventory account. The system shows the link to the generated inventory adjustment transaction in the 					 Adjustment Nbr.  box on the  Financial 					Details  tab on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments 				(AP301000) form for the AP bill. On release of the inventory adjustment, the system 				generates the following GL transactions: Inventory Account, Dr, Tax Amount PO Accrual account, Cr, Tax Amount For partially deductible VAT taxes, only the expense part is posted to the item's 				inventory account. For stock items with the  Standard  valuation method, in the GL transaction 				generated on release of the AP bill that includes the items, the tax amount is 				posted directly to the account defined by the  Tax Reason 				Code . For more information on including taxes in the cost of items, see 					 Taxes Included in the Cost of Items: General Information.

The physical inventory process in a particular warehouse includes the following stages:[anchor|#ol_h15_c22_rj]
*Physical inventory preparation
*Counting of items
*Entry of counting data
*Adjustment generation

These stages are described in detail in the following sections, along with other key information about physical inventory counts.{br}{TOC}[anchor|#_c47e0a7e-5101-46fd-a6bb-073831910ec7]
==Physical Inventory Preparation==((({S:Warn}Before you prepare any physical counts, make sure that all inventory documents have been released.
)))
You generate a physical inventory document by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_40_00|Prepare Physical Count] ([~/?ScreenId=IN504000|IN504000]) form. On this form, you select the appropriate physical inventory type for the count.{br}

For the physical inventory, you can select a particular warehouse and locations on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_40_00|Prepare Physical Count] form only if the warehouse is not associated with the physical inventory type. Once you are done making selections on the selection tabs of this form, you click '''Generate PI''' on the form toolbar. The system generates a physical inventory document, which you can view on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review] ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) form, with the ''Counting in Progress'' status. The system assigns the document a reference number in accordance with the numbering sequence assigned to physical inventories on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form.((({S:Warn}Starting at the moment when the physical inventory document is generated, no inventory transactions (issues, receipts, or transfers) are allowed that involve items included in the list, meaning that this inventory is in a frozen state. You can view the list of items involved in counting by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_90_00|Physical Inventory Locked Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN409000|IN409000]) form.
)))
The generated physical inventory document contains the list of items for counting, arranged to the specifications on the '''Assignment Order''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_89_00|Physical Inventory Types] form. For each stock item included in the count, the document may have one line or multiple lines, depending on how many warehouse locations are used to store the item and whether the item has subitems or lot or serial numbers. In the simplest case—when such features as ''Inventory Subitems'', ''Lot or Serial Tracking'', and ''Multiple Warehouse Locations'' are not enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form—a line identifies an item available in the warehouse with its book quantity.{br}

You can export the list of items for counting to an Excel file by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review] form. Alternatively, you can use the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_62_05_00|Physical Count Sheets] ([~/?ScreenId=IN620500|IN620500]) report to print item lists (count sheets) for distribution to all employees involved in counting. If you want to prevent employees from reusing the book quantity of items as the physical quantity instead of actually counting the items, you can hide the '''Book Qty.''' column from the printed count sheets by selecting the '''Hide Book Qty.''' check box in the report parameters.{br}

For more information, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Preparation_for_Physical_Count|Preparation for Physical Count].[anchor|#_a9ad80d3-f72e-4341-9263-333405393080]
==Counting of Items==
Employees involved in physical inventory can start counting items after you distribute count sheets and count tags (if you use tags in physical counting) to the employees. The counting process includes the following steps:[anchor|#_7a30361d-93f3-4154-911c-7fd79e0895b3]
#Employees count the actual quantity of an item with the properties specified in the line (the specific inventory ID, lot or serial number, and warehouse location).
#Employees specify the quantity in the appropriate line of the count sheet.
#You indicate to the system that the counting process is finished by clicking '''Finish Counting''' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review] ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) form for the current count. On this form, you can see that the system has changed the status of the physical inventory document to ''Data Entering''.

After the counting process is finished,you can start entering counting data into the system.{br}

 Acumatica ERP provides you with ability to automate counting by using barcode scanners or mobile devices with barcode scanning support. For details, see [HelpRoot_WMS\WMS_Scan_and_Count_GeneralInfo|Counting in Physical Inventory: General Information].[anchor|#_992b7a9a-11c3-45fd-b593-9cc681a1bbb5]
==Entry of Counting Data==
The process of entering counting data includes the following steps:[anchor|#_f8f8cca2-d0dc-4ee9-ae01-d8b2ac2c6303]
#Employees enter the counting data into the system manually or you import data from Excel spreadsheets, depending on the type of count sheets the employees used for counting.
#You review the data entered into the system after all lines have been entered.
#You complete the physical inventory process or cancel the process, depending on the entered data.
((({S:Warn}No movement of goods is allowed and no inventory transactions are released during the entry of the counting data if the '''Unfreeze Stock When Counting Is Finished''' check box is cleared for the physical inventory type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_89_00|Physical Inventory Types] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) form. In this case, the inventory is frozen until data entry is completed.
)))
Manual data entry can be performed as follows. Multiple employees participating in counting can enter count data line by line simultaneously from different locations by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_10|Physical Inventory Count] ([~/?ScreenId=IN305010|IN305010]) form. Each line of the physical inventory document has its own status, and as count data is entered, the status of the line changes from ''Not Entered'' to ''Entered''. Once an employee enters the actual quantity in a line on this form, this data is committed to the database so the data can be visible to other users who are entering the data and to you if you are viewing the count data on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review] ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) form. For details about the entry process, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__How_Enter_Count_Data|To Enter the Count Data].{br}

Employees can simultaneously enter their count data from their computers by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_10|Physical Inventory Count] form. Once the user finishes the row on this form, the system commits the data to the database—all the quantities entered by multiple users will be summed up for each combination of inventory ID, subitem, warehouse location, and lot or serial number. This makes the most recently entered data immediately visible to all users who may be simultaneously using this form for data entry.{br}

If employees find items that are not listed in the count sheets, and the count sheets contain empty lines, these items must be entered into the system, as described in [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Enter_Count_Data_for_New_Items|To Enter the Count Data for New Items].{br}

To import the count data from an Excel spreadsheet, you can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review] form. For a physical count with the ''Data Entering'' status on this form, you can upload the file to the system, review the data on the form, and save the results to the database. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__How_Import_Count_Data|To Import the Count Data From an Excel Spreadsheet].{br}

If all the lines of the document have the ''Entered'' status, you can complete the counting. You can cancel the physical inventory if you cannot complete it for some reason. If there is no valid data for some of the lines, you can set the count values to 0 or change the line status from ''Not Entered'' to ''Skipped'' and complete counting. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__How_Enter_Count_Data|To Enter the Count Data].{br}

Once the entered data is verified, you can indicate to the system that the data entry phase is completed by clicking '''Complete PI''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review]. This changes the status of the physical inventory document to ''Completed''. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__How_Complete_PI_Count|To Complete the Physical Inventory Count].{br}

Completing or canceling the physical inventory unfreezes the inventory items involved in the count.[anchor|#_987bcfbe-1bd7-4335-b7c7-07665f779acf]
==Adjustment Generation==
If the '''Release PI Adjustment Automatically''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form, when you complete the physical inventory, the system changes the status of the physical inventory document to ''Completed'' and generates the inventory adjustments to correct the on-hand quantities. An adjustment is generated for each item with a nonzero quantity variance, including the items with no associated transactions. The system uses the current costs of the items to calculate the cost variance. The reference numbers of these documents are displayed on the '''Adjustment Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review] ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) form; the status of these documents is ''Balanced''. You can review the generated adjustments on the '''Adjustments''' tab of this form.{br}

If the '''Release PI Adjustment Automatically''' check box is cleared, the system works as follows:[anchor|#ul_q5p_r2v_zgb]
*When you click '''Complete PI''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review] form, the physical inventory document has the ''In Review'' status and an adjustment is created with the ''Balanced'' status on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_30_00|Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=IN303000|IN303000]) form.
*In the adjustment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_30_00|Adjustments] form, you can edit the value of the '''Unit Cost''' column for particular items if the value of the '''Quantity''' column is positive for the item. When you manually change the unit cost and save the edited adjustment, the system changes the value of the '''Final Ext. Variance Cost''' column in the item line of the physical inventory document on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review] form.
*You can delete an adjustment before the adjustment is released. After the adjustment is deleted, the status of the physical inventory document changes to ''Data Entering'' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review] form. You can edit the physical inventory document and then create a new adjustment.
*When you successfully release an adjustment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_30_00|Adjustments] form, the system updates the values of the '''Final Ext. Variance Cost''' column in the item line of the physical inventory document and changes the status of the physical inventory document to ''Completed'' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review] form.

==Cost Calculation After Counting==
The system specifies values in the '''Unit Cost''' and '''Estimated Ext. Variance Cost''' columns on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review] ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) form when you click '''Finish Counting''' on the form toolbar. The system also updates these columns when users change the physical quantity while entering data.{br}

For lines with a positive variance quantity, the system calculates the values of the '''Unit Cost''' and '''Estimated Ext. Variance Cost''' columns based on the rules of the valuation methods specified for items as follows:[anchor|#ul_cf4_cz3_ygb]
*For the ''FIFO'' and ''Average'' valuation methods:
**The unit cost is calculated based on the values of the '''FIFO Default Returns Cost''' box (for the'' FIFO'' valuation method) or the '''Avg. Default Returns Cost''' box (for the ''Average'' valuation method) specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form.
**If the average cost of the item is zero on the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form, the system uses the value of the '''Last Cost''' box on this form as the unit cost.
**If both the average cost and the last cost are zero on the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] form, the system uses the average cost on the '''Price/Cost Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form as the unit cost. If the average cost is zero, the system uses the last cost on the same tab as the unit cost.
*For the ''Specific'' valuation method:
**The system uses the cost layer that corresponds to the item as the unit cost. If multiple cost layers exist for the item, the system uses the last created cost layer as the unit cost.
**If no cost layers exist for an item with a specific lot or serial number, the system uses the last cost specified on the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] form as the unit cost.
*For the ''Standard'' valuation method:
**The system uses the current standard cost specified in the '''Standard Cost''' section of the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] form as the unit cost.
**If the current standard cost is zero, the system uses the current standard cost on the '''Price/Cost Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form as the unit cost.

For lines with a negative variance quantity, the system calculates the values of the '''Unit Cost''' and '''Estimated Ext. Variance Cost''' columns based on the calculation rule of the adjustment; the system uses the data of the current cost layer for these calculations.{br}

The '''Update Actual Cost''' action recalculates the values of the '''Unit Cost''', '''Estimated Ext. Variance Cost''', and '''Total Variance Cost''' columns for lines with a negative variance quantity based on the calculation rule of the PI adjustment, and the system uses the data of the current cost layer. For lines with a positive variance quantity, this action recalculates the costs if the default costs were changed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] form.

Once the user finishes the 				row on this form, the system commits the data to the database—all the quantities 				entered by multiple users will be summed up for each combination of inventory ID, 				subitem, warehouse location, and lot or serial number. This makes the most recently 				entered data immediately visible to all users who may be simultaneously using this 				form for data entry. If employees find items that are not listed in the count sheets, and the count sheets 				contain empty lines, these items must be entered into the system, as described in 					 To Enter the Count Data for New Items. To import the count data from an Excel spreadsheet, you can use the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) Physical Inventory Review form. For a physical count with the  Data 					Entering  status on this form, you can upload the file to the system, review 				the data on the form, and save the results to the database. For details, see  To Import the Count Data From an Excel Spreadsheet. If all the lines of the document have the  Entered  status, you can complete the 				counting. You can cancel the physical inventory if you cannot complete it for some 				reason. If there is no valid data for some of the lines, you can set the count 				values to 0 or change the line status from  Not Entered  to  Skipped  and 				complete counting. For details, see  To Enter the Count Data. Once the entered data is verified, you can indicate to the system that the data entry 				phase is completed by clicking  Complete PI  on the form 				toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) Physical Inventory Review. This changes the 				status of the physical inventory document to  Completed . For details, see 					 To Complete the Physical Inventory Count. Completing or canceling the physical inventory unfreezes the inventory items involved 				in the count. Adjustment Generation If the  Release PI Adjustment Automatically  check box is 				selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000) form, when you complete 				the physical inventory, the system changes the status of the physical inventory 				document to  Completed  and generates the inventory adjustments to correct the 				on-hand quantities. An adjustment is generated for each item with a nonzero quantity 				variance, including the items with no associated transactions. The system uses the 				current costs of the items to calculate the cost variance. The reference numbers of 				these documents are displayed on the  Adjustment Info  tab of 				the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) Physical Inventory Review (IN305000) form; the status of these documents 				is  Balanced . You can review the generated adjustments on the 					 Adjustments  tab of this form. If the  Release PI Adjustment Automatically  check box is 				cleared, the system works as follows: When you click  Complete PI  on the form toolbar of the 						  ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) Physical Inventory Review form, the physical inventory 					document has the  In Review  status and an adjustment is created with the 						 Balanced  status on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN303000|IN303000]) Adjustments 					(IN303000) form. In the adjustment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN303000|IN303000]) Adjustments form, you 					can edit the value of the  Unit Cost  column for particular 					items if the value of the  Quantity  column is positive for 					the item. When you manually change the unit cost and save the edited adjustment, 					the system changes the value of the  Final Ext. Variance 						Cost  column in the item line of the physical inventory document 					on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) Physical Inventory Review form. You can delete an adjustment before the adjustment is released. After the 					adjustment is deleted, the status of the physical inventory document changes to 						 Data Entering  on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) Physical Inventory Review 					form. You can edit the physical inventory document and then create a new 					adjustment. When you successfully release an adjustment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN303000|IN303000]) Adjustments form, the system updates the values 					of the  Final Ext. Variance Cost  column in the item line 					of the physical inventory document and changes the status of the physical 					inventory document to  Completed  on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) Physical Inventory Review form. Cost Calculation After Counting The system specifies values in the  Unit Cost  and 					 Estimated Ext. Variance Cost  columns on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) Physical Inventory Review (IN305000) form when you click 					 Finish Counting  on the form toolbar. The system also 				updates these columns when users change the physical quantity while entering 				data. For lines with a positive variance quantity, the system calculates the values of the 					 Unit Cost  and  Estimated Ext. Variance 					Cost  columns based on the rules of the valuation methods specified 				for items as follows: For the  FIFO  and  Average  valuation methods: The unit cost is calculated based on the values of the  FIFO 								Default Returns Cost  box (for the  FIFO  valuation 							method) or the  Avg. Default Returns Cost  box (for 							the  Average  valuation method) specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses (IN204000) form. If the average cost of the item is zero on the  Price/Cost 								Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details (IN204500) form, the system 							uses the value of the  Last Cost  box on this form 							as the unit cost. If both the average cost and the last cost are zero on the 								 Price/Cost Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details form, the system uses the 							average cost on the  Price/Cost Info  tab of the 								  ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form as the 							unit cost. If the average cost is zero, the system uses the last cost on 							the same tab as the unit cost. For the  Specific  valuation method: The system uses the cost layer that corresponds to the item as the unit 							cost. If multiple cost layers exist for the item, the system uses the 							last created cost layer as the unit cost. If no cost layers exist for an item with a specific lot or serial 							number, the system uses the last cost specified on the 								 Price/Cost Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details form as the unit cost. For the  Standard  valuation method: The system uses the current standard cost specified in the 								 Standard Cost  section of the 								 Price/Cost Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details form as the unit cost. If the current standard cost is zero, the system uses the current 							standard cost on the  Price/Cost Info  tab of the 								  ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form as the unit 							cost. For lines with a negative variance quantity, the system calculates the values of the 					 Unit Cost  and  Estimated Ext. Variance 					Cost  columns based on the calculation rule of the adjustment; the 				system uses the data of the current cost layer for these calculations. The  Update Actual Cost  action recalculates the values of the 					 Unit Cost ,  Estimated Ext. Variance 					Cost , and  Total Variance Cost  columns for 				lines with a negative variance quantity based on the calculation rule of the PI 				adjustment, and the system uses the data of the current cost layer. For lines with a 				positive variance quantity, this action recalculates the costs if the default costs 				were changed on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details form.  ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000])  ([~/?ScreenId=IN305010|IN305010])  ([~/?ScreenId=IN504000|IN504000]) ]]></column>

When you decide to perform a physical inventory, you must prepare for this process appropriately. As a result of the preparation, you generate a physical inventory document (count sheet) and distribute it among the employees who will perform the inventory.{br}

When you are preparing for a physical inventory, you perform the following steps:[anchor|#_be190556-e8ad-414b-a584-c0045ab704ca]
#At the warehouse, you organize the goods to prepare for counting, and you complete data entry related to normal warehouse activities that are not connected to the physical inventory. For details, see [[#_9c2ee11b-ce1f-4329-ace5-4f901a0212a4|Organizing Goods in a Warehouse and Preparing Book Quantities].
#You prepare accurate book quantities in the system, as described in [[#_9c2ee11b-ce1f-4329-ace5-4f901a0212a4|Organizing Goods in a Warehouse and Preparing Book Quantities].
#You create the count review document (count sheet) of the needed physical inventory type. For details, see [[#_42a06e26-3687-4016-898e-5ad02423a992|Creating and Distributing a Count Sheet].
#Optional: You add new lines to a prepared count sheet if you realize that the quantity of some stock items became nonzero after completing data entry related to normal warehouse activities. For more information, see [[#_051f8e6c-64e4-4a24-9f4c-d19658c93384|Adding New Lines to a Prepared Count Review Document].
#Optional: You prepare tag sheets. For details, [[#_4a03ef61-09ba-41f9-9a9a-5503a08660f7|Using Tags in Counting].

In this topic, you will find detailed information about the preparation process.{br}{TOC}[anchor|#_9c2ee11b-ce1f-4329-ace5-4f901a0212a4]
==Organizing Goods in a Warehouse and Preparing Book Quantities==
When you prepare for a physical inventory in your warehouse, you do the following:[anchor|#_4834bd46-c57c-44ea-9faf-b1e82e003ef8]
*You oversee the employees in organizing the goods at the warehouse to be able to count accurate physical quantities that match the book quantities. All goods should be placed in appropriate locations.
*You enter and release all inventory transactions that have been physically performed at the warehouse and have already affected the physical quantity.
*You process or delete any unreleased documents in the system, which you can find by clicking '''Unreleased Documents''' on the toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_90_00|Close Financial Periods] ([~/?ScreenId=IN509000|IN509000]) form after you select financial periods.
{br}

The system produces the book quantity for physical counts as follows:{{{{(Book Qty) = (Qty on Hand) – (Qty on SO Shipped)
}}}}
The formula elements mean the following:{br}

{{Book Qty}}: The physical count book quantity{br}

{{Qty on Hand}}: The quantity of items on hand{br}

{{Qty on SO Shipped}}: The quantity of items on sales orders that have been shipped{br}

You have to exclude some items from the physical count because they are not reflected in the book quantity that is printed in the count review document (and used for comparison with the physical quantity). For example, you can place those items in a certain location in the warehouse, label the location to be certain the items will not be counted inadvertently, and skip the counting of this location. You have to make sure those items won&rsquo;t be mistakenly counted; otherwise, there could be an incorrect difference between the book quantity and physical quantity in the count review document.{br}

You have to exclude the following items from the physical count:[anchor|#ul_qjg_zyy_zs]
*Items that have been received to the warehouse if the receipts cannot be released in the system at the moment
*Items on unreleased inventory issues and not-yet-issued shipments if these items haven&rsquo;t been removed from the warehouse yet
[anchor|#_42a06e26-3687-4016-898e-5ad02423a992]
==Creating and Distributing a Count Sheet==
For every physical count that is performed at the warehouse, you have to create the count review document that is used for processing the count result. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_40_00|Prepare Physical Count] ([~/?ScreenId=IN504000|IN504000]) form, you can review the count lines that will be included in the count review document and initiate the process of creating the document. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__How_Prepare_PI_Count|To Prepare a Physical Inventory Count].{br}

After you select the physical count type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_40_00|Prepare Physical Count] form, a preview of the count lines with the tag numbers (if you use tags) is displayed that will be generated for the physical count iteration. Before you start the counting process, you can review the count lines to make sure the needed items are selected for counting and the order of count lines is as expected.{br}

After you have verified the count lines, on the form toolbar, you click '''Generate PI''' to prepare the count review document and start the counting process in the system. Starting at this moment, transactional activities should be frozen at the warehouse and the processing of inventory transactions must be paused in the system until the physical count is complete.{br}

When you click '''Generate PI''', the system performs the following actions:[anchor|#ul_hdq_tsj_xs]
*Generates the count review document that consists of the count lines, which should be populated with physical quantities. The system opens the count review document on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review] ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) form with the ''Counting in Progress'' status.
*:((({S:Warn}You can create the count review document directly on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review] form by clicking '''Add New Record''' on the form toolbar without first previewing the count on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_40_00|Prepare Physical Count] form. Regardless of how you generated the count review document, if you notice that it is wrong, you can click '''Cancel PI''' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review] form, make the necessary changes, and create the count review document again.
)))
*Generates the count sheets, which can be printed by using the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_62_05_00|Physical Count Sheets] ([~/?ScreenId=IN620500|IN620500]) report, as described in [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Print_Count_Sheets|To Print Count Sheets].
*:Alternatively, you can export the count review document to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Export_Count_Sheet_to_Excel|To Export a Count Sheet to an Excel Spreadsheet]) if your organization uses non-paper processesfor counting. 
*Generates the count tags, which can be printed by using the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_62_10_00|Physical Count Tags] ([~/?ScreenId=IN621000|IN621000]) report. The tags will be generated if the '''Use Tags''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] form at the moment. For details about how to print tag sheets, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Print_Tags|To Print Tags].
*Freezes the release of inventory transactions for the warehouse being counted. Under the ''Full Physical Inventory'' method, the system doesn&rsquo;t allow the release of any inventory transactions for the warehouse. For other physical count methods, the system doesn&rsquo;t release inventory transactions if they include items that are currently being counted at the warehouse. The system continues to freeze inventory transactions while the count review document has the ''Counting in Progress'' status.

In a count sheet, the items are arranged according to the settings on the '''Assignment Order''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_89_00|Physical Inventory Types] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) form. For each inventory item included in the count, the document may have one line or multiple lines, depending on how many locations are used to store the item and whether the item has subitems or lot or serial numbers. For items with serial numbers assigned, a separate line is generated for each serial number.{br}

If the '''Use Tags''' option is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] form, the count sheet includes tag numbers for each line generated.[anchor|#_051f8e6c-64e4-4a24-9f4c-d19658c93384]
==Adding New Lines to a Prepared Count Review Document==
When the count review document is prepared, the system adds to the count review document (count sheet) only those inventory items that have a nonzero booked quantity. Thus, if you have prepared the count sheet and then the quantity of some inventory items that are not in the sheet has changed from zero to a nonzero quantity (due to items being found or received), you may need to add new count lines to the count sheet. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review] ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) form, you can add a new line to a prepared count sheet as long as you adhere to the following rules:[anchor|#ul_egs_tnw_kbb]
*The location and warehouse that you specify in this line must match the location and warehouse selection criteria of the count sheet to which you are adding a line.
*You cannot add a line if the specified combination of inventory ID, location, and warehouse is already included in this physical inventory count.
*You cannot add a line if the specified combination of inventory ID, location, and warehouse is included in any other physical inventory count that currently is in progress.
*The item that you specify in this line must correspond to criteria of the physical inventory type which this physical inventory count is prepared. For example, if you count physical inventory by ABC code, the item should be assigned the ABC code selected in the settings of the physical inventory type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_89_00|Physical Inventory Types] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) form. (This restriction applies to all physical inventory types except for those that have the ''Full Physical Inventory'' generation method.)

After you have added any new lines and saved your changes, no inventory transactions (issues, receipts, or transfers) are allowed for the added inventory items in the specified location and warehouse.[anchor|#_4a03ef61-09ba-41f9-9a9a-5503a08660f7]
==Using Tags in Counting==
Tags may or may not be used in the counting process, depending on your organization&rsquo;s policies for physical inventory counts. A tag count is useful for a full-scale end-of-year physical inventory.{br}

You can use tags in counts if the '''Use Tags''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form. With this check box selected, the system assigns a tag number to each line of the count sheets when you prepare the physical inventory count. Depending on the features enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, each tag can contain the following information:[anchor|#ul_jvj_qst_fs]
*Tag number
*Inventory ID
*Subitem (if the ''Inventory Subitems'' feature is enabled) 
*Lot or serial number (if the ''Lot and Serial Tracking'' feature is enabled) 
*Warehouse location (if the ''Multiple Warehouse Locations'' feature is enabled)
*The book quantity of the item with these properties
{br}

You can print tags by using the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_62_10_00|Physical Count Tags] ([~/?ScreenId=IN621000|IN621000]) report, as described in [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Print_Tags|To Print Tags]. The tags can be distributed (in accordance with the count sheets) among employees who are participating in the count. Tags can be used for recording the results of the actual counting and for entering the count results when the counting stage is completed.

Adding New Lines to a Prepared Count Review Document When the count review document is prepared, the system adds to the count review document     (count sheet) only those inventory items that have a nonzero booked quantity. Thus, if you have     prepared the count sheet and then the quantity of some inventory items that are not in the sheet     has changed from zero to a nonzero quantity (due to items being found or received), you may need     to add new count lines to the count sheet. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) Physical Inventory Review (IN305000)     form, you can add a new line to a prepared count sheet as long as you adhere to the following     rules: The location and warehouse that you specify in this line must match the location and      warehouse selection criteria of the count sheet to which you are adding a line. You cannot add a line if the specified combination of inventory ID, location, and warehouse      is already included in this physical inventory count. You cannot add a line if the specified combination of inventory ID, location, and warehouse      is included in any other physical inventory count that currently is in progress. The item that you specify in this line must correspond to criteria of the physical inventory      type which this physical inventory count is prepared. For example, if you count physical      inventory by ABC code, the item should be assigned the ABC code selected in the settings of the      physical inventory type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) Physical Inventory Types (IN208900) form. (This      restriction applies to all physical inventory types except for those that have the  Full       Physical Inventory  generation method.) After you have added any new lines and saved your changes, no inventory transactions (issues,     receipts, or transfers) are allowed for the added inventory items in the specified location and     warehouse. Using Tags in Counting Tags may or may not be used in the counting process, depending on your organization's policies     for physical inventory counts. A tag count is useful for a full-scale end-of-year physical     inventory. You can use tags in counts if the  Use Tags  check box is selected on the        ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000) form. With this check box selected, the system     assigns a tag number to each line of the count sheets when you prepare the physical inventory     count. Depending on the features enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS101000) form,     each tag can contain the following information: Tag number Inventory ID Subitem (if the  Inventory Subitems  feature is enabled)  Lot or serial number (if the  Lot and Serial Tracking  feature is enabled)  Warehouse location (if the  Multiple Warehouse Locations  feature is enabled) The book quantity of the item with these properties You can print tags by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN621000|IN621000]) Physical Count Tags (IN621000) report, as     described in  To Print Tags. The tags can be distributed (in accordance     with the count sheets) among employees who are participating in the count. Tags can be used for     recording the results of the actual counting and for entering the count results when the     counting stage is completed. ]]></column>

If your organization prepares financial reports on a regular basis, accountants should close financial periods in all modules that your organization uses in Acumatica ERP. Before the reports can be prepared for a financial period, the accountants have to verify the account balances, process all necessary transactions for the period, and then close the financial period for further transaction processing.{br}

In this topic, you will read about the process of closing financial periods in Inventory.
==Closing Financial Periods in Inventory==
Closing a financial period in a module is a technical procedure that prevents the posting of new transactions from this module to the closed period, which is undesirable or might be even forbidden after all figures have been verified and disclosed in the reports.{br}

The closed periods cannot be selected in the '''Post Period''' box on inventory transaction data entry forms. However, a closed period can be typed manually in a transaction and the inventory transaction can still be processed to the period if the '''Restrict Access to Closed Periods''' check box is cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_10_20_00|General Ledger Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=GL102000|GL102000]) form. The '''Restrict Access to Closed Periods''' setting applies to the transactions that are produced by all modules that post transactions to the General Ledger module. Only users assigned to the ''Financial Supervisor'' role on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_05|User Roles] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201005|SM201005]) form can post transactions to closed periods; this is the case even when the '''Restrict Access to Closed Periods''' check box is selected.{br}

Closing a financial period in the Inventory module includes the following procedures:[anchor|#ul_wvv_tg4_dt]
*Inventory clerks count the physical inventory, and the warehouse manager makes the necessary inventory adjustments to make the book quantities of items equal to the physical quantities of items in the warehouse. For details on physical inventory counting, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Physical_Inventory_Counts|Physical Inventory Counts].
*The warehouse manager verifies and processes the necessary inventory transactions for the period. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Review_Unprocessed_Inventory_Transactions|To Review Unprocessed Inventory Transactions].
*The accountant reconciles the inventory account balance in the Inventory and General Ledger modules for the period. For more information, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Reconciliation_IN_Account_GL_Account|Reconciliation of the Cost of Inventory with the Account Balance].
*The accountant closes the financial period in the Inventory module. During the process of closing the period, the system verifies that there are no unprocessed inventory transactions entered for these periods, and marks the periods as closed in the Inventory module. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Close_Financial_Period|To Close Financial Periods in Inventory].

After the financial period is closed in all modules, the accountant can prepare the financial reports.

You can reconcile the inventory account balance by comparing the account balance calculated by inventory transactions with the account balance calculated by General Ledger transactions. If you discover a mismatch, each transaction has to be carefully reviewed in the Inventory and General Ledger modules, and corrective actions have to be made to eliminate the mismatch. Reconciliation is a recommended practice before period closing to verify the account balance and the transactions in the inventory account.{br}

In this topic, you will find recommendations for performing reconciliation of the inventory account balance with the General Ledger account balance in Acumatica ERP and the list of forms and report you can use for reconciliation. For simplicity, the topic describes the reconciliation process for only one inventory account. If you have multiple accounts, you can repeat the procedure for each inventory account.{br}{TOC}
==Reconciliation Process in Inventory==
Before starting reconciliation, you must you must decide which periods you want to close. In Acumatica ERP, you reconcile the inventory account balance for the ''last activity period'' (that is, the period when the last transaction was performed) and the ''historical periods'' (that is, the periods that precede the last activity period) separately. For the last activity period, the inventory account balance equals the cost of the inventory on hand.{br}

In Acumatica ERP, you do the following to reconcile the balance of an inventory account in the Inventory and General Ledger modules:[anchor|#_6fc9de40-181b-461f-b2bd-db80a168f6d5]
#You reconcile the balance of the inventory account for the historical periods, as described in [[#_7385631f-858e-4029-95dd-796b543341aa|Reconciliation of the Inventory Account Balance for Historical Periods].
#You reconcile the balance of the inventory account for the last activity period, as described in [[#_f0d77834-bff7-443d-9403-2bafe45fe193|Reconciliation of the Inventory Account Balance for the Last Activity Period].
#If the balances of the inventory and General Ledger accounts disagree, you investigate the reasons. For details, see [[#section_ky1_rmb_2t|Investigation of a Disagreement Between the Balances].

For the list of Acumatica ERP forms and reports you can use in the reconciliation process, see [[#_eb01d874-4c04-4665-88ba-0ae3880b102b|Reports and Forms Used for Reconciliation in the Inventory module].[anchor|#_7385631f-858e-4029-95dd-796b543341aa]
==Reconciliation of the Inventory Account Balance for Historical Periods==
You reconcile the balance of an inventory account for a historical period as follows:[anchor|#_e7919e71-f68d-4125-b905-19981ec8e8b6]
#You find the ending balance of the account in the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_61_70_00|Historical Inventory Valuation] ([~/?ScreenId=IN617000|IN617000]) report as follows:
##You run the report with the following parameters:
##*'''Format''': ''Summary''
##* '''Start Period''': The historical period
##*'''End Period''': The historical period
##:((({S:Warn}If you want to review the account balance for multiple historical periods, in the '''Start Period''' box, you select the earliest period, and in the '''End Period''' box, you select the latest period.
)))
##In the '''Account/Subaccount Ending Balance''' line of the report, you find the ending balance of the account, which you reconcile, and record the balance.
#Optional: You review the inventory transactions and the ending balance of the inventory account on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_30_00|Inventory Transactions by Account] ([~/?ScreenId=IN403000|IN403000]) form as follows:
##In the Summary area of the form, you do the following:
##*In the '''Inventory Account''' box, you select the inventory account for which you want to review transactions.
##*In the '''Period''' box, you select the historical period.
##*You select the '''By Financial Period''' check box to filter the transactions by post period.
##In the '''Ending Balance''' column of the last table row, you find the ending balance for the inventory account and compare it with the balance found in the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_61_70_00|Historical Inventory Valuation] report. The balances should be the same.

==Reconciliation of the Inventory Account Balance for the Last Activity Period==
After you have reconciled the balance of an inventory account for historical periods, you can start reconciling the balance of this account for the last activity period as follows:[anchor|#_ee8305c7-fa27-4a33-ae0f-71912c657db4]
#You find the ending balance for the account in the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_61_55_00|Inventory Valuation] ([~/?ScreenId=IN615500|IN615500]) report as follows:
##You run the report with ''Summary'' selected in the '''Format''' box.
##In the '''Total''' line of the report, you find the '''Total Cost''' value, which is the ending balance of the inventory account for the last activity period. You keep this value for further comparison.
#Optional: You review the inventory transactions and the ending balance of the inventory account on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_30_00|Inventory Transactions by Account] ([~/?ScreenId=IN403000|IN403000]) form as follows:
##In the Summary area of the form, you do the following:
##*In the '''Inventory Account''' box, you select the inventory account for which you want to review transactions.
##*In the '''Period''' box, you select the last activity period.
##*You select the '''By Financial Period''' check box to filter the transactions by post period.
##In the '''Ending Balance''' column of the last table row, you find the ending balance for the inventory account and compare it with the balance found in the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_61_55_00|Inventory Valuation] report. The balances should be the same.
#You find the ending balance of the inventory account in the General Ledger by using the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\GL_63_20_00|Trial Balance Summary] ([~/?ScreenId=GL632000|GL632000]) report as follows:
##You run the report with the following parameters:
##*'''Ledger ID''': Select the ledger with the ''Actual'' type.
##*'''Financial Period''': Select the last activity period.
##In the '''Ending Balance''' column for the inventory account, you find the ending balance.
#You compare the ending balance you found in the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_61_55_00|Inventory Valuation] report with the balance found in the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\GL_63_20_00|Trial Balance Summary] report. You can receive one of the following results:
#*The balances agree: This means that the inventory account balance is reconciled for the last activity period. Now you can close these financial periods in the Inventory module; for details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Close_Financial_Period|To Close Financial Periods in Inventory].
#*The balances disagree: You investigate the reasons, as described in [[#section_ky1_rmb_2t|Investigation of a Disagreement Between the Balances], and reconcile the account balance once again.
[anchor|#section_ky1_rmb_2t]
==Investigation of a Disagreement Between the Balances ==
If the balances don&rsquo;t agree, you have to review every transaction in the Inventory and General Ledger modules to find the entries that do not match. You do the following:[anchor|#_ad9cde9d-c65f-4434-9fba-aff730b24f1f]
#Verify that all inventory transactions are posted in the General Ledger module by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_30_00|Inventory Transactions by Account] ([~/?ScreenId=IN403000|IN403000]) form. If there is an inventory transaction that is missing in the General Ledger account on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_40_40_00|Account Details] ([~/?ScreenId=GL404000|GL404000]) form, you can do any of the following: 
#*Review the inventory transaction and make sure the General Ledger transaction has been generated for it. The transactions could be not generated if the '''Update GL''' check box was cleared when the inventory transaction was released.
#*Review the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_50_20_00|Post Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=GL502000|GL502000]) form to see if there are any ''Unposted'' batches of journal transactions. Process the needed transactions to eliminate the discrepancy.
#Check whether there are any transactions posted to the inventory account by other modules by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_40_40_00|Account Details] form. If there is a General Ledger transaction that is missing on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_30_00|Inventory Transactions by Account] form, open the batch of journal transactions and find the source document for it. Depending on the reason the General Ledger entry has been directly processed to the inventory account without the processing from the Inventory module, you can either correct the General Ledger transaction or process the missing inventory transaction in the Inventory module and reverse the generated batch to equate the balance of the inventory account in the modules.
((({S:Warn}If the '''Post Option''' is set to ''Detail'' for an inventory account on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_20_25_00|Chart of Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=GL202500|GL202500]) form, detailed journal entries are posted to the inventory account regardless of the Inventory module settings, and the General Ledger entries in the inventory account on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_40_40_00|Account Details] form can be matched one to one to the transaction lines on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_30_00|Inventory Transactions by Account] form. Otherwise, if the summary posting to the inventory account is configured for the General Ledger module, a number of inventory transaction lines will correspond to one summarized General Ledger entry. If you use summary posting to an inventory account in the General Ledger, we recommend that you specify unique sequence numbers for different inventory transaction types, so that you can group the inventory transaction lines by transaction type and reference number and match them one to one to the summarized General Ledger entries in the inventory account, if needed.
)))
After you have investigated the reasons for the disagreement, you can recalculate the balance of the inventory account, as described in the next section, to view changes in transactions on Inventory forms and reports.[anchor|#section_kpd_yz1_2t]
==Recalculation of the Inventory Account Balance==
You can run the inventory validation process on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_50_00|Validate Inventory] ([~/?ScreenId=IN505000|IN505000]) form to recalculate the inventory account balance for periods after you have corrected inventory transactions. (This process doesn't affect the on-hand quantity of items in inventory, because this quantity is updated with every released inventory transaction and tracked separately from the inventory account balance.) The inventory validation process performs the following operations:[anchor|#ol_h4l_qbb_2t]
#Recalculates the available quantity and the subtotals by allocation type that are stored in the database and that you can view on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_10_00|Inventory Summary] ([~/?ScreenId=IN401000|IN401000]) form. This operation is always performed when you run the process on the form.
#Clears all transaction history details for the inventory account in the Inventory module, which you can view in the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_61_70_00|Historical Inventory Valuation] ([~/?ScreenId=IN617000|IN617000]) report; the process then rebuilds the history again and recalculates the balance of the inventory account in the module by the released inventory transactions. To perform this operation, you have to select the '''Rebuild Item History''' check box on the form and specify the starting financial period. The system rebuilds the transaction history for each financial period starting from the specified one up to the last activity period in the module.
[anchor|#_eb01d874-4c04-4665-88ba-0ae3880b102b]
==Reports and Forms Used for Reconciliation in the Inventory module==
To review the ending balance of an inventory account for a historical period, you can use any of the following forms and reports:[anchor|#_efe4ed4b-b971-4fcd-b143-70b83fa3d929]
*[HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_61_70_00|Historical Inventory Valuation] ([~/?ScreenId=IN617000|IN617000]) report in the summary format: The summary report shows transaction summaries by inventory item, grouped by the account and subaccount to which the summarized transactions have been processed in the Inventory module. For each item, the summaries by period are presented for each period within the specified range. The first row of the summary shows the cost of the item for the account, subaccount, and period; the second row shows the quantity of the item. The '''Account/Subaccount Beginning Balance''' and '''Account/Subaccount Ending Balance''' lines show the beginning and ending balances on the subaccount for the selected period range. If you do not use subaccounts, the '''Account/Subaccount Ending Balance''' line shows the ending balance of the inventory account.
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_30_00|Inventory Transactions by Account] ([~/?ScreenId=IN403000|IN403000]) form: With the inventory account and period selected in the Summary area, the form shows inventory transactions processed to the selected inventory account and financial period. Each record is an inventory transaction that corresponds to a line in the released inventory entry. The '''Beginning Balance''' and '''Ending Balance''' columns show running totals calculated by the listed transactions. If you specify additional filtering parameters on the form, the running totals are recalculated. '''Beginning Balance''' in the first row starts from the beginning balance of the inventory account for the selected period.
*:By default, the transaction lines are ordered by the transaction date (the '''Date''' column), then by the transaction type (the '''Tran. Type''' column), the reference number (the '''Reference Nbr.''' column), and the line number in the transaction.
*:'''Fin. Period''' shows the financial period that is specified in the '''Post Period''' of the inventory transaction. '''Tran. Period''' shows the financial period to which the transaction date belongs, which is not necessarily equal to the post period. The corresponding General Ledger transaction is posted to the '''Post Period''' of the inventory transaction.
*:The '''Period''' that you specify in the form settings filters transactions by the '''Post Period''' or '''Tran. Period''' of the transaction. If the '''By Financial Period''' check box is selected, the transactions are filtered by '''Post Period'''; otherwise, they are posted by '''Tran. Period'''. With the '''Start Date''' and '''End Date''' parameters on the form, you can also filter the transactions within the specified financial period.
*:In the last row, the '''Ending Balance''' column shows the ending balance of the account for the selected period.

To review the ending balance of an inventory account for the last activity period, you can use one of the following forms and reports:[anchor|#_ba859469-49ae-4a58-898c-0d1ab23c48ee]
*The [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_61_70_00|Historical Inventory Valuation] report in the summary format
*The [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_30_00|Inventory Transactions by Account] form
* The [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_61_55_00|Inventory Valuation] ([~/?ScreenId=IN615500|IN615500]) report in the summary format: The report shows the ending balance of the inventory account for the last activity period in the Inventory module.

To review the ending balance of an inventory account in the General Ledger module, you use the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\GL_63_20_00|Trial Balance Summary] ([~/?ScreenId=GL632000|GL632000]) report.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Reconciliation of the Cost of Inventory with the Account Balance You can reconcile the inventory account balance by comparing the account balance calculated by         inventory transactions with the account balance calculated by General Ledger transactions.         If you discover a mismatch, each transaction has to be carefully reviewed in the Inventory         and General Ledger modules, and corrective actions have to be made to eliminate the         mismatch. Reconciliation is a recommended practice before period closing to verify the         account balance and the transactions in the inventory account. In this topic, you will find recommendations for performing reconciliation of the inventory         account balance with the General Ledger account balance in  Acumatica ERP and the list of forms and report you can use for reconciliation. For simplicity, the         topic describes the reconciliation process for only one inventory account. If you have         multiple accounts, you can repeat the procedure for each inventory account. Reconciliation Process in Inventory Before starting reconciliation, you must you must decide which periods you want to close. In            Acumatica ERP, you reconcile the inventory account balance for the  last activity period  (that         is, the period when the last transaction was performed) and the  historical periods          (that is, the periods that precede the last activity period) separately. For the last         activity period, the inventory account balance equals the cost of the inventory on hand. In  Acumatica ERP, you do the following to reconcile the balance of an inventory account in the Inventory         and General Ledger modules: You reconcile the balance of the inventory account for the historical periods, as described      in  Reconciliation of the Inventory Account Balance for Historical Periods Reconciliation of the Inventory Account Balance for Historical Periods. You reconcile the balance of the inventory account for the last activity period, as      described in  Reconciliation of the Inventory Account Balance for the Last Activity Period Reconciliation of the Inventory Account Balance for the Last Activity Period. If the balances of the inventory and General Ledger accounts disagree, you investigate the           reasons. For details, see  Investigation of a Disagreement Between the Balances Investigation of a Disagreement Between the Balances. For the list of  Acumatica ERP     forms and reports you can use in the reconciliation process, see  Reports and Forms Used for Reconciliation in the Inventory module Reports and Forms Used for Reconciliation in the Inventory module. Reconciliation of the Inventory Account Balance for Historical Periods You reconcile the balance of an inventory account for a historical period as follows: You find the ending balance of the account in the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN617000|IN617000]) Historical Inventory Valuation (IN617000)      report as follows: You run the report with the following parameters: Format :  Summary Start Period : The historical period End Period : The historical period If you want to review the account balance for multiple historical periods, in the           Start Period  box, you select the earliest period, and in the           End Period  box, you select the latest period. In the  Account/Subaccount Ending Balance  line of the report, you        find the ending balance of the account, which you reconcile, and record the balance. Optional: You review the inventory transactions and the ending balance of the inventory      account on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN403000|IN403000]) Inventory Transactions by Account (IN403000) form as follows: In the Summary area of the form, you do the following: In the  Inventory Account  box, you select the inventory                   account for which you want to review transactions. In the  Period  box, you select the historical period. You select the  By Financial Period  check box to filter                   the transactions by post period. In the  Ending Balance  column of the last table row, you find the        ending balance for the inventory account and compare it with the balance found in the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN617000|IN617000]) Historical Inventory Valuation report. The balances should be the same. You find the ending balance of the inventory account in the General Ledger by using the         ([~/?ScreenId=GL632000|GL632000]) Trial Balance Summary (GL632000) report as follows: You run the report with the following parameters: Ledger ID : Select the ledger with the  Actual  type. Financial Period : Select the same historical period, for which                   you retrieved data from the Inventory module. In the  Ending Balance  column for the inventory account, you find               the ending balance. You compare the ending balance in the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN617000|IN617000]) Historical Inventory Valuation report with the           balance in the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL632000|GL632000]) Trial Balance Summary report. You can receive one of the           following results: The balances agree: This means that the inventory account balance is reconciled for               the selected period. You can start reconciling the same account for another historical               period or for the last activity period, if the account balance is reconciled for all               historical periods. The balances disagree: You investigate the reasons, as described in  Investigation of a Disagreement Between the Balances Investigation of a Disagreement Between the Balances,               and reconcile the account balance once again. Reconciliation of the Inventory Account Balance for the Last Activity Period After you have reconciled the balance of an inventory account for historical periods, you can     start reconciling the balance of this account for the last activity period as follows: You find the ending balance for the account in the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN615500|IN615500]) Inventory Valuation      (IN615500) report as follows: You run the report with  Summary  selected in the  Format                box. In the  Total  line of the report, you find the  Total         Cost  value, which is the ending balance of the inventory account for the last        activity period. You keep this value for further comparison. Optional: You review the inventory transactions and the ending balance of the inventory      account on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN403000|IN403000]) Inventory Transactions by Account (IN403000) form as follows: In the Summary area of the form, you do the following: In the  Inventory Account  box, you select the inventory                   account for which you want to review transactions. In the  Period  box, you select the last activity                   period. You select the  By Financial Period  check box to filter                   the transactions by post period. In the  Ending Balance  column of the last table row, you find the        ending balance for the inventory account and compare it with the balance found in the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN615500|IN615500]) Inventory Valuation report. The balances should be the same. You find the ending balance of the inventory account in the General Ledger by using the         ([~/?ScreenId=GL632000|GL632000]) Trial Balance Summary (GL632000) report as follows: You run the report with the following parameters: Ledger ID : Select the ledger with the  Actual  type. Financial Period : Select the last activity period. In the  Ending Balance  column for the inventory account, you find               the ending balance. You compare the ending balance you found in the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN615500|IN615500]) Inventory Valuation report with      the balance found in the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL632000|GL632000]) Trial Balance Summary report. You can receive one of the      following results: The balances agree: This means that the inventory account balance is reconciled for the               last activity period. Now you can close these financial periods in the Inventory               module; for details, see  To Close Financial Periods in Inventory. The balances disagree: You investigate the reasons, as described in  Investigation of a Disagreement Between the Balances Investigation of a Disagreement Between the Balances, and        reconcile the account balance once again. Investigation of a Disagreement Between the Balances  If the balances don't agree, you have to review every transaction in the Inventory and         General Ledger modules to find the entries that do not match. You do the following: Verify that all inventory transactions are posted in the General Ledger module by using           the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN403000|IN403000]) Inventory Transactions by Account (IN403000) form. If there is an inventory transaction           that is missing in the General Ledger account on the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL404000|GL404000]) Account Details           (GL404000) form, you can do any of the following:  Review the inventory transaction and make sure the General Ledger transaction has               been generated for it. The transactions could be not generated if the                  Update GL  check box was cleared when the inventory               transaction was released. Review the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL502000|GL502000]) Post Transactions (GL502000) form to see if there are any                  Unposted  batches of journal transactions. Process the needed transactions to               eliminate the discrepancy. Check whether there are any transactions posted to the inventory account by other           modules by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL404000|GL404000]) Account Details form. If there is a General Ledger           transaction that is missing on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN403000|IN403000]) Inventory Transactions by Account form, open the batch of           journal transactions and find the source document for it. Depending on the reason the           General Ledger entry has been directly processed to the inventory account without the           processing from the Inventory module, you can either correct the General Ledger           transaction or process the missing inventory transaction in the Inventory module and           reverse the generated batch to equate the balance of the inventory account in the           modules. If the  Post Option  is set to  Detail  for an inventory         account on the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL202500|GL202500]) Chart of Accounts (GL202500) form, detailed journal entries are         posted to the inventory account regardless of the Inventory module settings, and the General         Ledger entries in the inventory account on the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL404000|GL404000]) Account Details form can be         matched one to one to the transaction lines on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN403000|IN403000]) Inventory Transactions by Account form.         Otherwise, if the summary posting to the inventory account is configured for the General         Ledger module, a number of inventory transaction lines will correspond to one summarized         General Ledger entry. If you use summary posting to an inventory account in the General         Ledger, we recommend that you specify unique sequence numbers for different inventory         transaction types, so that you can group the inventory transaction lines by transaction type         and reference number and match them one to one to the summarized General Ledger entries in         the inventory account, if needed. After you have investigated the reasons for the disagreement, you can recalculate the         balance of the inventory account, as described in the next section, to view changes in         transactions on Inventory forms and reports. Recalculation of the Inventory Account Balance You can run the inventory validation process on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN505000|IN505000]) Validate Inventory (IN505000)         form to recalculate the inventory account balance for periods after you have corrected         inventory transactions. (This process doesn't affect the on-hand quantity of items in         inventory, because this quantity is updated with every released inventory transaction and         tracked separately from the inventory account balance.) The inventory validation process         performs the following operations: Recalculates the available quantity and the subtotals by allocation type that are stored in      the database and that you can view on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN401000|IN401000]) Inventory Summary (IN401000) form. This      operation is always performed when you run the process on the form. Clears all transaction history details for the inventory account in the Inventory module,           which you can view in the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN617000|IN617000]) Historical Inventory Valuation (IN617000) report; the process           then rebuilds the history again and recalculates the balance of the inventory account in           the module by the released inventory transactions. To perform this operation, you have to           select the  Rebuild Item History  check box on the form and specify           the starting financial period. The system rebuilds the transaction history for each           financial period starting from the specified one up to the last activity period in the           module. Reports and Forms Used for Reconciliation in the Inventory module To review the ending balance of an inventory account for a historical period, you can use any     of the following forms and reports:  ([~/?ScreenId=IN617000|IN617000]) Historical Inventory Valuation (IN617000) report in the summary format: The summary report           shows transaction summaries by inventory item, grouped by the account and subaccount to           which the summarized transactions have been processed in the Inventory module. For each           item, the summaries by period are presented for each period within the specified range.           The first row of the summary shows the cost of the item for the account, subaccount, and           period; the second row shows the quantity of the item. The  Account/Subaccount             Beginning Balance  and  Account/Subaccount Ending             Balance  lines show the beginning and ending balances on the subaccount for           the selected period range. If you do not use subaccounts, the              Account/Subaccount Ending Balance  line shows the ending balance           of the inventory account.  ([~/?ScreenId=IN403000|IN403000]) Inventory Transactions by Account (IN403000) form: With the inventory account and period           selected in the Summary area, the form shows inventory transactions processed to the           selected inventory account and financial period. Each record is an inventory transaction           that corresponds to a line in the released inventory entry. The  Beginning             Balance  and  Ending Balance  columns show running           totals calculated by the listed transactions. If you specify additional filtering           parameters on the form, the running totals are recalculated.  Beginning             Balance  in the first row starts from the beginning balance of the inventory           account for the selected period. By default, the transaction lines are ordered by the             transaction date (the  Date  column), then by the transaction type             (the  Tran. Type  column), the reference number (the                Reference Nbr.  column), and the line number in the             transaction. Fin. Period  shows the financial period that is             specified in the  Post Period  of the inventory transaction.                Tran. Period  shows the financial period to which the             transaction date belongs, which is not necessarily equal to the post period. The             corresponding General Ledger transaction is posted to the  Post               Period  of the inventory transaction. The                Period  that you specify in the form settings filters             transactions by the  Post Period  or  Tran.               Period  of the transaction. If the  By Financial               Period  check box is selected, the transactions are filtered by                Post Period ; otherwise, they are posted by  Tran.               Period . With the  Start Date  and  End               Date  parameters on the form, you can also filter the transactions within             the specified financial period. In the last row, the  Ending               Balance  column shows the ending balance of the account for the selected             period. To review the ending balance of an inventory account for the last activity period, you can use         one of the following forms and reports: The   ([~/?ScreenId=IN617000|IN617000]) Historical Inventory Valuation report in the summary format The   ([~/?ScreenId=IN403000|IN403000]) Inventory Transactions by Account form  The   ([~/?ScreenId=IN615500|IN615500]) Inventory Valuation (IN615500) report in the summary format: The report           shows the ending balance of the inventory account for the last activity period in the           Inventory module. To review the ending balance of an inventory account in the General Ledger module, you use the             ([~/?ScreenId=GL632000|GL632000]) Trial Balance Summary (GL632000) report. ]]></column>

Replenishment for stock items is performed on a per-warehouse basis. If your company has a single warehouse, it purchases inventory to replenish the stock directly in this warehouse. If your company has multiple warehouses (which is possible if the ''Multiple Warehouses'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form), your company can consolidate purchase orders created for replenishment in smaller warehouses, perform purchasing to a single large warehouse (distribution center), and then transfer the purchased quantities from this distribution center to other warehouses. In other cases, the items can be purchased only to a larger warehouse and transferred to point-of-sale warehouses as needed. Some products at specific warehouses may be purchased only if there are customer orders requesting the products.{br}

By using forecast models, you can fine-tune such parameters as safety stock, reorder point, and maximum quantities based on sales statistics. For more information, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Configuration_of_Automated_Replenishment|Configuration of Automated Replenishment].{br}{TOC}
==Replenishment Preparation==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_80_00|Prepare Replenishment] ([~/?ScreenId=IN508000|IN508000]) form, you can view the list of items that require replenishment. To more effectively process the requests, you can select a warehouse and a planned purchase date, and view the list of applicable items requiring replenishment in this warehouse on a specified date. You can further narrow the list by a specific vendor, or you can view only the items assigned to you as a product manager or to your workgroup.{br}

You can select particular items and process them by clicking '''Process''', or you can process all the listed items by clicking '''Process All''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_80_00|Prepare Replenishment] ([~/?ScreenId=IN508000|IN508000]) form.
==Conditions to Initiate Replenishment for a Stock Item==
To create the list of items that require replenishment, the system uses the settings specified on the '''Replenishment Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form for each item at each warehouse where the item can be stocked.{br}

An item is listed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_80_00|Prepare Replenishment] ([~/?ScreenId=IN508000|IN508000]) form if the following general conditions are fulfilled: 
*The processing date you&rsquo;ve selected is within the time interval when the replenishment settings are effective (defined by '''Launch Date''' and '''Termination Date''').
*The available quantity is below the reorder point for this item at this warehouse.
*The item has one of the following sources: 
**''Purchase'': The item stock should be replenished through a purchase. The system will generate a replenishment request for purchasing. By default, the preferred vendor specified on the '''Vendor Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form will be used on the order, but you can select another vendor. 
**''Transfer'': The quantity required for item replenishment should be transferred from a replenishment warehouse. The system will generate a replenishment request for transfer. 

If an item should be replenished by using the ''Fixed'' replenishment method, the system will generate a replenishment request for the following quantity:[anchor|#ul_kqv_3hf_5q]
*If the replenishment source is ''Transfer'', the transfer economic order quantity (transfer EOQ).
*If the source is ''Purchase'', the economic order quantity (EOQ) specified for the selected vendor on the '''Vendor Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form. 

If the item should be replenished by using the ''Min./Max.'' replenishment method, the system will generate a replenishment request for the target quantity, which is calculated as follows: {{{{Target Quantity = Max. Quantity - Quantity on Hand - Quantity on Supply + Quantity on Demand
}}}}
The ''quantity on demand'' is calculated based on the sales orders, transfers, and kit assembly documents (of the ''Production'' type) in accordance with the method of demand calculation, which is selected in the '''Demand Calculation''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form. If the ''Item Class Settings'' option is selected, the demand will be calculated in accordance with the availability settings specified for this item class on the '''General Settings''' tab of the same form; if the ''Hard Demand Only'' option is selected, the demand will be calculated as ''Qty. SO Allocated + Qty. SO Shipped + Qty. SO Back-Ordered''. {br}

The ''quantity on supply'' is calculated based on purchase receipts, transfer receipts, and kit assembly documents (of the ''Disassembly'' type) according to the availability settings specified for this item&rsquo;s class. {br}

The replenishment quantities on the list appear adjusted for low seasons defined by your system&rsquo;s set of seasonality settings. By using seasonality settings, you can adjust the quantities for replenishment that are initiated during low seasons, each of which is defined by its starting and ending date. For a purchase date within a low season, the replenishment quantity is calculated with a ''decreasing factor'', which is a factor that appropriately decreases replenishment quantities. 
==Replenishment Request Handling==
When you process the items listed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_80_00|Prepare Replenishment] ([~/?ScreenId=IN508000|IN508000]) form, the system is prompted to create appropriate replenishment requests, which are internal Acumatica ERP documents used as the basis for creating purchase and transfer orders. Replenishment requests have reference numbers, which are determined by the numbering sequence specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form.{br}

The system handles replenishment requests differently based on the item replenishment source: 
*''Purchase'': Replenishment requests for items with this replenishment source appear on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_50_00|Create Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) form, which you can use to create one order for all items to be purchased from a specific vendor. The system will perform any needed conversions to purchase units. 
*:If the ''Min./Max.'' method has been chosen for the item, the system computes the replenishment quantity as the difference between the maximum quantity and the quantity on hand, minus the quantity on supply (the quantity of items on unreleased purchase orders, purchase receipts, and quantities in transit), and plus the quantity on demand (on customer released and unreleased orders). If the ''Fixed Order Quantity'' method has been selected, the system uses the EOQ values specified for the selected vendor.
*''Transfer'': (This type of source is available only if the ''Multiple Warehouses'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.) Replenishment requests for items with this replenishment source appear on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_90_00|Create Transfer Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO509000|SO509000]) form. You create transfer orders to move the products from the replenishment warehouse to the warehouse when the item needs replenishment.

==Calculation of the Final Replenishment Quantities==
The quantities specified on the purchase order may differ from those specified on the replenishment requests. The final replenishment quantity for an item on a purchase order is calculated based on the settings provided for the vendor that will fulfill replenishment, and the following changes may occur: 
*If the quantity required by replenishment settings is less than the minimum order quantity, the system uses the minimum order quantity.
*If the quantity required by replenishment settings exceeds the maximum order quantity, the system uses the maximum order quantity. (The maximum order quantity is not used in the current version.)
*If the requested quantity is not divisible by the lot size, the result is rounded up to the next integer, and that number of lots is ordered.

To be competitive, a company must strike a balance with its inventory levels: The company should not overstock inventory, because this ties up working capital, yet it should avoid stockouts, which result in lost customers and diminished customer loyalty. {br}

With Acumatica ERP, you can configure automatic replenishment for stock items at a single warehouse, or at multiple warehouses (if the ''Multiple Warehouses'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form). If your warehouses may be used only for sales, you can configure the system so that the warehouses from which sales are performed will be replenished from the warehouses where purchases are performed (from distribution centers).{br}

Before you start to configure automated replenishment in your system, thoroughly consider the warehouse functions in your system, including which warehouses will perform consolidated purchasing, which will serve as replenishment sources for other warehouses, which will be replenished by transfers, and which will be replenished by direct purchasing. For more information about replenishment, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Automated_Replenishment|Automated Replenishment].{br}{TOC}
==Configuration Steps==
To reduce time that would be spent typing replenishment settings for each item in each warehouse, you can configure default replenishment settings at multiple levels.{br}

In general, you perform the following steps to configure automated replenishment: 
#You create the appropriate replenishment classes, which group warehouses by the replenishment sources used in your company. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Create_Replenishment_Class|To Create a Replenishment Class].
#You create replenishment seasonality entities. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Create_Replenishment_Seasonality|To Create a Replenishment Seasonality].
#You assign each warehouse to a replenishment class. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Specify_Replenishment_Class_in_Warehouse_Settings|To Assign a Replenishment Class to a Warehouse].
#For each item class, you specify replenishment settings for all replenishment classes, including the applicable seasonality settings. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Set_Up_Replenishment_for_Item_Class|To Set Up Replenishment for an Item Class].
#For each stock item, you review the replenishment settings that are the default values from the item class, and make any needed adjustments. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Set_Up_Replenishment_for_Stock_Item|To Set Up Replenishment for a Stock Item].
#For each stock item at each specific warehouse, you review the replenishment settings that are the default values from the item. Adjust these settings for each warehouse if needed. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Set_Up_Item_Warehouse_Replenishment|To Specify Warehouse-Specific Replenishment Settings for a Stock Item].

The sections below provide information that will help you execute these steps.
==Replenishment Classes==
Replenishment classes categorize warehouses by their ''replenishment source''—that is, how stock is replenished at the warehouse. You assign a replenishment class to every warehouse.{br}

You create replenishment classes by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_88_00|Replenishment Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208800|IN208800]) form; for each class, you specify its name, description, and replenishment source. As the replenishment source, you can select one of the following options:
*''None'': No replenishment is required for a warehouse. This option could be used, for example, for a warehouse that is closing its operations.
*''Purchase'': The items for stock replenishment in the warehouse will be purchased from vendors when it is determined by the replenishment settings and in the quantities calculated based on the replenishment settings.
*''Transfer'': For stock replenishment in a warehouse, the items will be transferred from a source warehouse; transfer orders will be generated automatically. This option is available only if the ''Multiple Warehouses'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
*''Purchase to Order'': In warehouses with this replenishment source option selected, no actual replenishment is performed; the items are purchased only when customer orders have been received and strictly in the quantities requested by the orders. When you add an item from this warehouse to a sales order, the system automatically selects the '''Mark for PO''' check box so that a purchase order for this item can be created.
*''Drop-Shipment'': In warehouses with this replenishment source option selected, no actual replenishment is performed; the items are purchased only when customer orders have been received and strictly in the quantities requested by the orders. When you add an item from this warehouse to a sales order, the system automatically selects the '''Mark for PO''' check box so that a purchase order for the item can be created; the purchased item is sent directly to the customer.
((({S:Warn}For automated replenishment, only replenishment classes with ''Purchase'' or ''Transfer'' as replenishment sources can be used.
)))
==Setting Up Default Values==
To make it easier to provide replenishment settings for each item that are specific to each warehouse where the item is stocked, you can set up default values at multiple levels:
#Item class: By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form, on the '''Replenishment Settings''' tab, you specify the replenishment settings to be used as the default settings for items of the class. If you know that items of the class are stocked at multiple warehouses with different replenishment sources, configure how the items are typically replenished for each replenishment class. For each item class, you specify the following information: 
#*The method of demand calculation, which you select in the '''Demand Calculation''' box. If you select ''Hard Demand Only'', the demand will be calculated as ''Qty. SO Allocated + Qty. SO Shipped + Qty. SO Back-Ordered''. If you select ''Item Class Settings'', the demand will be calculated in accordance with the availability settings specified for this item class on the '''General Settings''' tab of the same form.
#*The seasonality.
#*The replenishment method: ''None'', ''Min/Max'', or ''Fixed Reorder Qty''. For the second or third option, specify the parameter (the ''reorder point'' quantity) required to determine the need for replenishment.
#*The demand forecast model and parameters for the model (the period type, number of periods to analyze, and service level).
#*The launch and termination dates of the period when the settings are effective for the class.
#:((({S:Warn}The default replenishment settings for a newly created item class are those from the parent item class. If the created item class has no parent, the default replenishment settings are those of the class that is specified in the '''Default Stock Item Class''' box (if you are creating a stock item class) or the '''Default Non-Stock Item Class''' box (if you are creating a non-stock item class) box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form.
)))
#Stock item: On the '''Replenishment Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, you can view the replenishment settings of a particular item, which by default are provided by the item class. For the item, you can review the replenishment settings for different replenishment classes that might be used if the item is stocked at multiple warehouses, and override the settings if needed.
#Subitem: If subitems are used in your system, on the '''Replenishment Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form, you should specify parameters for each subitem. If only the default subitem is used with for the item, you specify the parameters for this default subitem; if different subitems of the item require different replenishment quantities, you specify the parameters that are different. Subitems inherit all other replenishment settings from the item.

==Replenishment Settings for an Item at a Particular Warehouse==
The many replenishment settings for all items at all warehouses are filled in with default values. On the '''Replenishment Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form, you can review the replenishment parameters to be used for the particular item at the selected warehouse. These settings come from the item settings but can be overridden for this item stocked in a particular warehouse. ((({S:Warn}For the item, you cannot use a replenishment source other than the one specified for the warehouse where the item is stocked.
)))
Also, you can override the values of the replenishment parameters used for particular subitems, if in this warehouse they differ from the default values specified for subitems on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form.
==Configuration of Consolidated Purchasing for Replenishment==
With Acumatica ERP, you can configure replenishment for a number of warehouses that is performed by centralized purchasing to one large warehouse, a distribution center, and by transfers to smaller warehouses—this ensures that purchasing is performed more efficiently.{br}

You have to make sure that for items in the warehouse (which is a distribution center), ''Purchase'' is selected as the replenishment source on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form with no replenishment warehouse selected. For items in the smaller warehouses (which should be replenished by purchasing to a distribution center), you specify ''Purchase'' as the replenishment source and select the distribution center as the replenishment warehouse on the '''Replenishment Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] form.{br}

First, you must prepare replenishment requests for small warehouses by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_80_00|Prepare Replenishment] ([~/?ScreenId=IN508000|IN508000]) form and generate transfer orders requesting replenishment by using the form. After that, you will be able to generate purchase orders on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_50_00|Create Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) form—the system will create a single purchase order for all the requested quantities of each item. Additionally, you can run the process of preparing replenishment in the distribution center before you generate consolidated purchase orders for smaller warehouses, to add to consolidated purchase orders the quantities requested for replenishment in the distribution center. Upon receipt of the items (once receipts are released), you will be able to replenish the stock in the distribution center and to fulfill transfer orders by the appropriate number of shipments to all the demand warehouses.{br}

If the item is replenished by using the ''Purchase to Order'' source, for each warehouse where the item is stocked, you can specify the same replenishment warehouse. Then, when you generate purchase orders on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_50_00|Create Purchase Orders] form, the system will create a single purchase order for all the requested quantities of the item, no matter what are the demand warehouses. After you create a receipt for the merchandise from a vendor for this purchase order and release it, the system automatically generates transfer orders to split the received quantity between demand warehouses according to the quantities on the original sales orders.
==Configuration of Replenishment by Transfers==
If the ''Multiple Warehouses'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can configure replenishment for a number of warehouses that is performed by transfers from one large warehouse, a distribution center, for which centralized purchasing is performed, and perform purchasing efficiently.{br}

For items in the smaller warehouses that should be replenished by transfers from the distribution center, specify ''Transfer'' as the replenishment source, while for the same items stocked in the distribution center, select ''Purchase'' as the replenishment source.{br}

First, you must prepare replenishment for small warehouses by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_80_00|Prepare Replenishment] ([~/?ScreenId=IN508000|IN508000]) form and generate transfer orders requesting replenishment—this will create demand for replenishment in the distribution center. After that, you will be able to generate replenishment requests for the distribution center. The next stage in the replenishment process is generating purchase orders on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_50_00|Create Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) form—the system will create a single purchase order for all the requested quantities of each item. Upon receipt of the items (once receipts are released), you will be able to fulfill transfer orders by appropriate number of shipments.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Configuration of Automated Replenishment To be competitive, a company must strike a balance with its inventory levels: The 				company should not overstock inventory, because this ties up working capital, yet it 				should avoid stockouts, which result in lost customers and diminished customer 				loyalty.  With  Acumatica ERP, you can configure automatic replenishment for stock items at a single warehouse, 				or at multiple warehouses (if the  Multiple Warehouses  feature is enabled on 				the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form). If your 				warehouses may be used only for sales, you can configure the system so that the 				warehouses from which sales are performed will be replenished from the warehouses 				where purchases are performed (from distribution centers). Before you start to configure automated replenishment in your system, thoroughly 				consider the warehouse functions in your system, including which warehouses will 				perform consolidated purchasing, which will serve as replenishment sources for other 				warehouses, which will be replenished by transfers, and which will be replenished by 				direct purchasing. For more information about replenishment, see  Automated Replenishment. Configuration Steps To reduce time that would be spent typing replenishment settings for each item in 				each warehouse, you can configure default replenishment settings at multiple 				levels. In general, you perform the following steps to configure automated replenishment:  You create the appropriate replenishment classes, which group warehouses by the 					replenishment sources used in your company. For details, see  To Create a Replenishment Class. You create replenishment seasonality entities. For details, see  To Create a Replenishment Seasonality. You assign each warehouse to a replenishment class. For details, see  To Assign a Replenishment Class to a Warehouse. For each item class, you specify replenishment settings for all replenishment classes, 					including the applicable seasonality settings. For details, see  To Set Up Replenishment for an Item Class. For each stock item, you review the replenishment settings that are the default values from 					the item class, and make any needed adjustments. For details, see  To Set Up Replenishment for a Stock Item. For each stock item at each specific warehouse, you review the replenishment settings that 					are the default values from the item. Adjust these settings for each warehouse 					if needed. For details, see  To Specify Warehouse-Specific Replenishment Settings for a Stock Item. The sections below provide information that will help you execute these steps. Replenishment Classes Replenishment classes categorize warehouses by their  replenishment 				source —that is, how stock is replenished at the warehouse. You assign a 				replenishment class to every warehouse. You create replenishment classes by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN208800|IN208800]) Replenishment Classes (IN208800) form; for each class, you specify its name, 				description, and replenishment source. As the replenishment source, you can select 				one of the following options: None : No replenishment is required for a warehouse. This option could be 					used, for example, for a warehouse that is closing its operations. Purchase : The items for stock replenishment in the warehouse will be 					purchased from vendors when it is determined by the replenishment settings and 					in the quantities calculated based on the replenishment settings. Transfer : For stock replenishment in a warehouse, the items will be transferred from 					a source warehouse; transfer orders will be generated automatically. This option 					is available only if the  Multiple Warehouses  feature is enabled on the 						  ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. Purchase to Order : In warehouses with this replenishment source option 					selected, no actual replenishment is performed; the items are purchased only 					when customer orders have been received and strictly in the quantities requested 					by the orders. When you add an item from this warehouse to a sales order, 					the system automatically selects the  Mark for PO  check box 					so that a purchase order for this item can be created. Drop-Shipment : In warehouses with this replenishment source option selected, 					no actual replenishment is performed; the items are purchased only when customer 					orders have been received and strictly in the quantities requested by the orders. 					When you add an item from this warehouse to a sales order, the system automatically 					selects the  Mark for PO  check box so that a purchase order 					for the item can be created; the purchased item is sent directly to the customer. For automated replenishment, only replenishment classes with  Purchase  or  Transfer  				as replenishment sources can be used. Setting Up Default Values To make it easier to provide replenishment settings for each item that are specific 				to each warehouse where the item is stocked, you can set up default values at 				multiple levels: Item class: By using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes 					(IN201000) form, on the  Replenishment Settings  tab, you 					specify the replenishment settings to be used as the default settings for items 					of the class. If you know that items of the class are stocked at multiple 					warehouses with different replenishment sources, configure how the items are 					typically replenished for each replenishment class. For each item class, you 					specify the following information:  The method of demand calculation, which you select in the 								 Demand Calculation  box. If you select  Hard 								Demand Only , the demand will be calculated as  Qty. SO 								Allocated + Qty. SO Shipped + Qty. SO Back-Ordered . If you 							select  Item Class Settings , the demand will be calculated in 							accordance with the availability settings specified for this item class 							on the  General Settings  tab of the same 							form. The seasonality. The replenishment method:  None ,  Min/Max , or  Fixed 								Reorder Qty . For the second or third option, specify the 							parameter (the  reorder point  quantity) required to determine the 							need for replenishment. The demand forecast model and parameters for the model (the period type, 							number of periods to analyze, and service level). The launch and termination dates of the period when the settings are 							effective for the class. The default replenishment settings for a newly created item class are 						those from the parent item class. If the created item class has no parent, 						the default replenishment settings are those of the class that is specified 						in the  Default Stock Item Class  box (if you are 						creating a stock item class) or the  Default Non-Stock Item 							Class  box (if you are creating a non-stock item class) box 						on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000) form. Stock item: On the  Replenishment Settings  tab of the 						  ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form, you can view 					the replenishment settings of a particular item, which by default are provided 					by the item class. For the item, you can review the replenishment settings for 					different replenishment classes that might be used if the item is stocked at 					multiple warehouses, and override the settings if needed. Subitem: If subitems are used in your system, on the  Replenishment 						Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form, you 					should specify parameters for each subitem. If only the default subitem is used 					with for the item, you specify the parameters for this default subitem; if 					different subitems of the item require different replenishment quantities, you 					specify the parameters that are different. Subitems inherit all other 					replenishment settings from the item. Replenishment Settings for an Item at a Particular Warehouse The many replenishment settings for all items at all warehouses are filled in with 				default values. On the  Replenishment Settings  tab of the 					  ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details (IN204500) form, you can review 				the replenishment parameters to be used for the particular item at the selected 				warehouse. These settings come from the item settings but can be overridden for this 				item stocked in a particular warehouse.  For the item, you cannot use a replenishment source other than the one specified 				for the warehouse where the item is stocked. Also, you can override the values of the replenishment parameters used for particular 				subitems, if in this warehouse they differ from the default values specified for 				subitems on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form. Configuration of Consolidated Purchasing for Replenishment With  Acumatica ERP, you can configure replenishment for a number of warehouses that is performed by 				centralized purchasing to one large warehouse, a distribution center, and by 				transfers to smaller warehouses—this ensures that purchasing is performed more 				efficiently. You have to make sure that for items in the warehouse (which is a distribution center), 					 Purchase  is selected as the replenishment source on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details (IN204500) form with no replenishment warehouse 				selected. For items in the smaller warehouses (which should be replenished by 				purchasing to a distribution center), you specify  Purchase  as the 				replenishment source and select the distribution center as the replenishment 				warehouse on the  Replenishment Info  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details form. First, you must prepare replenishment requests for small warehouses by using the 					  ([~/?ScreenId=IN508000|IN508000]) Prepare Replenishment (IN508000) form and generate transfer orders 				requesting replenishment by using the form. After that, you will be able to generate 				purchase orders on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) Create Purchase Orders (PO505000) form—the system 				will create a single purchase order for all the requested quantities of each item. 				Additionally, you can run the process of preparing replenishment in the distribution 				center before you generate consolidated purchase orders for smaller warehouses, to 				add to consolidated purchase orders the quantities requested for replenishment in 				the distribution center. Upon receipt of the items (once receipts are released), you 				will be able to replenish the stock in the distribution center and to fulfill 				transfer orders by the appropriate number of shipments to all the demand 				warehouses. If the item is replenished by using the  Purchase to Order  source, for each warehouse 				where the item is stocked, you can specify the same replenishment warehouse. Then, 				when you generate purchase orders on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) Create Purchase Orders form, the 				system will create a single purchase order for all the requested quantities of the 				item, no matter what are the demand warehouses. After you create a receipt for the 				merchandise from a vendor for this purchase order and release it, the system 				automatically generates transfer orders to split the received quantity between 				demand warehouses according to the quantities on the original sales orders. Configuration of Replenishment by Transfers If the  Multiple Warehouses  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features 				(CS100000) form, you can configure replenishment for a number of warehouses that is 				performed by transfers from one large warehouse, a distribution center, for which 				centralized purchasing is performed, and perform purchasing efficiently. For items in the smaller warehouses that should be replenished by transfers from the 				distribution center, specify  Transfer  as the replenishment source, while for 				the same items stocked in the distribution center, select  Purchase  as the 				replenishment source. First, you must prepare replenishment for small warehouses by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN508000|IN508000]) Prepare Replenishment (IN508000) form and generate transfer orders 				requesting replenishment—this will create demand for replenishment in the 				distribution center. After that, you will be able to generate replenishment requests 				for the distribution center. The next stage in the replenishment process is 				generating purchase orders on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) Create Purchase Orders (PO505000) 				form—the system will create a single purchase order for all the requested quantities 				of each item. Upon receipt of the items (once receipts are released), you will be 				able to fulfill transfer orders by appropriate number of shipments.  ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500])  ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000])  ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500])  ([~/?ScreenId=IN208800|IN208800])  ([~/?ScreenId=IN206600|IN206600])  ([~/?ScreenId=IN508000|IN508000]) ]]></column>

With Acumatica ERP, you can assign different replenishment methods to different items of inventory stocked at a single warehouse or different warehouses and specify warehouse-specific parameters for these methods. Different items may require different parameters because of different customer demand for them and different numbers of days required to receive the requested quantities from the vendors.{br}

You can use either of the following replenishment methods: ''Min./Max.'' or ''Fixed Order Qty''. For each stock item, the system uses the specified method to calculate the quantities required to replenish the stock of this item, based on the replenishment parameters that you specify on the '''Replenishment Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form. {br}

The available replenishment methods and their parameters are discussed in the sections below. {br}{TOC}
==Min./Max. Method==
You use the ''Min./Max.'' method to maintain the stock level of an inventory item at a particular warehouse between the specified minimum and maximum quantities. To use this method for an item, you should specify the following parameters: [anchor|#ul_wmd_pvt_l3]
*'''Maximum Quantity''': This is the maximum stock quantity allowed for the item at the warehouse. 
*'''Safety Stock''': This is the additional stock of the item maintained to avoid stockouts. A safety stock is required if there are fluctuations in demand and supply. Because safety stock is not used in calculation for this method, add the quantity of the safety stock to both ''maximum quantity'' and ''reorder point quantity''. 
*'''Reorder Point''': The system uses the reorder point quantity in the ''Min./Max.'' replenishment method rather than a minimum quantity. The quantity to be used as the minimum quantity is specified in the '''Reorder Point''' column on '''Replenishment Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. Generally, the reorder point quantity would be estimated as the quantity that may be required during the lead time (the time when the product is being shipped from the vendor location to your company). If you need to maintain safety stock, include the safety stock quantity in the reorder point quantity.

Once the system detects that current stock level (the available quantity) of the particular item has reached or fallen below the reorder point, it calculates the quantity required to replenish the item stock up to the maximum quantity by adding the quantity on demand to the difference between quantities of the maximum, on hand, and on supply. You control the way the system calculates the quantities on demand for classes of stock items by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form as follows:[anchor|#ul_td1_xcw_bq]
*''Hard Demand Only'': For all stock items of the class, the demand is calculated as ''(Qty.SO Allocated) + (Qty SO Back-Ordered) + (Qty SO Shipped)''
* ''Item Class Settings'': For all stock items of the class, the demand is calculated in accordance with the availability options selected for the item class on the '''General Settings '''tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] form.

==Fixed Order Quantity Method==
You use the ''Fixed Order Quantity'' method when you want to replenish the item stock with a fixed quantity each time it falls below the reorder point. This method uses the following parameters: [anchor|#ul_t2p_2w5_l3]
*'''Fixed Quantity''': We recommend that you use as the fixed quantity the '' economical order quantity (EOQ)'' determined by warehouse specialists for a particular item by estimating the cost of ordering the item from a particular vendor. For each vendor from which the stock item can be purchased, the EOQ is specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_20_10_00|Vendor Inventory] ([~/?ScreenId=PO201000|PO201000]) form. You can view EOQs specified for all vendors of the item on the '''Vendor Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form.
*'''Safety Stock''': This is the additional stock of the item maintained to avoid stockouts. The safety stock is required if there are fluctuations in demand and supply.
*'''Reorder Point''': For this method, too, the reorder point is specified as the safety stock plus the quantity that may be required during the lead time.

With the ''Fixed Order Quantity'' method, the system generates request for the economical order quantity (EOQ) for the item once it determines that the available quantity reaches or is lower than the reorder point. 
==Parameter Estimation==
For automated replenishment, you can manually enter estimates of replenishment parameters—such as safety stock, maximum quantity, and reorder point—that were made externally by logistics specialists for each item. Alternatively, you can configure the system to automatically calculate the replenishment parameters.{br}

 In Acumatica ERP, you can use demand forecast models to calculate replenishment parameters by using sales statistics. For overview of the functionality, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Replenishment_Based_on_Demand_Forecast_Model|Replenishment Parameters Based on Demand Forecast ]. With this flexibility, you can lower carrying costs, avoid stockouts, minimize excess or obsolete inventory, improve cash flow, and increase customer loyalty levels. 
==Other Item-Specific Parameters==
The parameters described below are also used in automated replenishment for the inventory item at the specific warehouse:
*'''Launch and Termination Dates''': These dates define the range during which the replenishment settings specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form will affect the item if it is stocked at this warehouse. By default, the dates come from the item settings (which are specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form but can be overridden for the item at the specific warehouse).
*'''Vendor Details''': To replenish the stock of the inventory item at the warehouse, you should specify the vendor from which inventory will be purchased. The system uses the default vendor of the inventory item (as specified on the '''Vendor Details '''tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form) unless you have selected another vendor for the item at the warehouse. The following item-specific parameters are associated with the selected preferred vendor: 
**The lead time required to ship the item from the vendor location to the warehouse
**The lot size, if specified, which rounds up the order quantity for the mix/max method to multiples of lot size
**The minimum order frequency (the minimum number of days between two successive orders)
**The minimum and maximum order quantity
**The EOQ

==Subitem Details==
If your company uses subitems in your implementation of Acumatica ERP, you can also specify the replenishment parameters for each subitem of the item stored at the warehouse. {br}

On the '''Replenishment Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, you can generate the list of all subitems of the inventory item. By default, all subitems have the same parameter values, copied from the values for the default subitem. On the '''Subitem Replenishment Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form, you can create a list of subitems stocked at the warehouse and specify replenishment parameters for each subitem. {br}

Separate replenishment quantities will be calculated for each subitem, based on subitem-specific parameters and the current quantity on hand (of the item with this subitem) at the warehouse.

Different items may require different parameters                 because of different customer demand for them and different numbers of days required                 to receive the requested quantities from the vendors. You can use either of the following replenishment methods:  Min./Max.  or                      Fixed Order Qty . For each stock item, the system uses the specified                 method to calculate the quantities required to replenish the stock of this item,                 based on the replenishment parameters that you specify on the                      Replenishment Info  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details (IN204500) form.  The available replenishment methods and their parameters are discussed in the                 sections below.  Min./Max. Method You use the  Min./Max.  method to maintain the stock level of an inventory item                 at a particular warehouse between the specified minimum and maximum quantities. To                 use this method for an item, you should specify the following parameters:  Maximum Quantity : This is the maximum stock quantity                     allowed for the item at the warehouse.  Safety Stock : This is the additional stock of the item                     maintained to avoid stockouts. A safety stock is required if there are                     fluctuations in demand and supply. Because safety stock is not used in                     calculation for this method, add the quantity of the safety stock to both                          maximum quantity  and  reorder point quantity .  Reorder Point : The system uses the reorder point quantity                     in the  Min./Max.  replenishment method rather than a minimum quantity. The                     quantity to be used as the minimum quantity is specified in the                          Reorder Point  column on  Replenishment                         Info  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500)                     form. Generally, the reorder point quantity would be estimated as the quantity                     that may be required during the lead time (the time when the product is being                     shipped from the vendor location to your company). If you need to maintain                     safety stock, include the safety stock quantity in the reorder point                     quantity. Once the system detects that current stock level (the available quantity) of the                 particular item has reached or fallen below the reorder point, it calculates the                 quantity required to replenish the item stock up to the maximum quantity by adding                 the quantity on demand to the difference between quantities of the maximum, on hand,                 and on supply. You control the way the system calculates the quantities on demand                 for classes of stock items by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes                 (IN204500) form as follows: Hard Demand Only : For all stock items of the class, the demand is                     calculated as  (Qty.SO Allocated) + (Qty SO Back-Ordered) + (Qty SO                         Shipped) Item Class Settings : For all stock items of the class, the demand is                     calculated in accordance with the availability options selected for the item                     class on the  General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes form. Fixed Order Quantity Method You use the  Fixed Order Quantity  method when you want to replenish the item                 stock with a fixed quantity each time it falls below the reorder point. This method                 uses the following parameters:  Fixed Quantity : We recommend that you use as the fixed                     quantity the   economical order quantity (EOQ)  determined by warehouse                     specialists for a particular item by estimating the cost of ordering the item                     from a particular vendor. For each vendor from which the stock item can be                     purchased, the EOQ is specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO201000|PO201000]) Vendor Inventory (PO201000) form. You can view EOQs specified for all                     vendors of the item on the  Vendor Details  tab of the                           ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form. Safety Stock : This is the additional stock of the item                     maintained to avoid stockouts. The safety stock is required if there are                     fluctuations in demand and supply. Reorder Point : For this method, too, the reorder point is                     specified as the safety stock plus the quantity that may be required during the                     lead time. With the  Fixed Order Quantity  method, the system generates request for the                 economical order quantity (EOQ) for the item once it determines that the available                 quantity reaches or is lower than the reorder point.  Parameter Estimation For automated replenishment, you can manually enter estimates of replenishment parameters—such as safety stock, maximum quantity, and reorder point—that were made externally by logistics specialists for each item. Alternatively, you can configure the system to automatically calculate the replenishment parameters.  In  Acumatica ERP, you can use demand forecast models to calculate replenishment parameters by using sales statistics. For overview of the functionality, see  Replenishment Parameters Based on Demand Forecast . With this flexibility, you can lower carrying costs, avoid stockouts, minimize excess or obsolete inventory, improve cash flow, and increase customer loyalty levels.  Other Item-Specific Parameters The parameters described below are also used in automated replenishment for the inventory item at the specific warehouse: Launch and Termination Dates : These dates define the range during which                     the replenishment settings specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details                     (IN204500) form will affect the item if it is stocked at this warehouse. By                     default, the dates come from the item settings (which are specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form but can be overridden for the                     item at the specific warehouse). Vendor Details : To replenish the stock of the inventory item at the                     warehouse, you should specify the vendor from which inventory will be purchased.                     The system uses the default vendor of the inventory item (as specified on the                          Vendor Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form) unless you have selected another vendor for                     the item at the warehouse. The following item-specific parameters are associated                     with the selected preferred vendor:  The lead time required to ship the item from the vendor location to the                             warehouse The lot size, if specified, which rounds up the order quantity for the                             mix/max method to multiples of lot size The minimum order frequency (the minimum number of days between two                             successive orders) The minimum and maximum order quantity The EOQ Subitem Details If your company uses subitems in your implementation of  Acumatica ERP, you can also specify the replenishment parameters for each subitem of the item stored at the warehouse.  On the  Replenishment Info  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items                 (IN202500) form, you can generate the list of all subitems of the inventory item.                 By default, all subitems have the same parameter values, copied from the values for                 the default subitem. On the  Subitem Replenishment Info  tab of                 the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details (IN204500) form, you can create a list of                 subitems stocked at the warehouse and specify replenishment parameters for each                 subitem.  Separate replenishment quantities will be calculated for each subitem, based on subitem-specific parameters and the current quantity on hand (of the item with this subitem) at the warehouse.   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000])  ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500])  ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500])  ([~/?ScreenId=IN206600|IN206600])  ([~/?ScreenId=IN208800|IN208800])  ([~/?ScreenId=IN508000|IN508000]) ]]></column>

Businesses strive to have enough stock for potential sales. Replenishing the stock in time and in the proper quantities helps businesses to retain customers while reducing storage costs. For an overview of the automated replenishment functionality implemented in Acumatica ERP, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Automated_Replenishment|Automated Replenishment]. To predict the demand—that is, the stock level you may need in the future for each item—you can use demand forecast methods. The current version of Acumatica ERP uses the ''moving average'' method, one of the simplest methods.{br}

In Acumatica ERP, you can use the predicted average daily demand, calculated with the help of demand forecasting models, to periodically update the values of replenishment parameters (such as maximum quantity, reorder point, and safety stock) in order to more precisely calculate the quantities required for replenishment. {br}{TOC}
==Using the Moving Average Method==
With the moving average method, you calculate the demand for a specific future period based on historical sales data for multiple consecutive periods in the immediate past. This method works well for items with specific trends in sales or with stable sales not subjected to random significant fluctuations.{br}

The moving average model of forecasting demand is configured at the item level—on the '''Replenishment Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form—and can be defined at the item class level on the same tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form. (A new stock item inherits the settings of the selected item class, but you can override the class settings.){br}

When you select ''Moving Average'' as the '''Demand Forecast Model''' of replenishment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] form, you also specify the following settings:[anchor|#ul_zgd_3tn_yy]
*'''Forecast Period''': The type of time period to be used for the selection of historical data and for demand calculation. The following options are available: ''Quarter'', ''Month'', ''Week'', and ''Day''.
*'''Period to Analyze''': The number of periods of historical data of the specified type to be used for calculation.
*'''Service Level''': The service level, whose default value is 84. In the calculation of replenishment parameters, the system uses the inverse of the standard normal cumulative distribution of the service level as follows: {{NORMSINV(Service Level)}}. With this formula, for a service level of 84%, the result is 1; for a service level of 50%, the result is 0.
*'''Seasonality''': The seasonality, which can be used to normalize the replenishment quantity to accommodate high and low sales seasons.
*'''Launch Date''': The date starting the time period when the specified replenishment settings will be in effect.

This forecast model uses the data available for the specified number of past periods to forecast demand for the period immediately following the last period whose data is used in forecasting. If you select a month as the forecast period and want to perform a forecast on the 15th day of the current month, 15 days&rsquo; worth of data will not be used for forecasting; only data from full periods is used. The system calculates the daily demand for the nearest future period based on daily sales in all days of the specified number of prior periods.{br}

As the actual data for the last forecast period becomes available, you can forecast the demand for the next period by using the data of the previous periods shifted by one period. This method smooths out the data; the more periods you use to calculate the average demand, the greater the smoothing effect.{br}

The ''average lead time'' is calculated for each stock item‒preferred vendor pair based on all purchase orders in the system history. The average lead time is computed as average difference (on all orders) between the date when an order is created (the '''Requested on''' date) and the date of the receipt created for the goods listed on the order.
==Using Seasonality Parameters for Forecasting==
The sales of some products follow certain cycles or patterns. For example, the peak of ski sales is in the winter. These patterns in sales can be described as ''seasonality''. A set of seasonality settings is a list of low and high seasons with appropriate factors (coefficients) that show how sales decline or increase in each of these specific seasons, as compared to average sales volumes calculated over all time. The seasons for particular products or groups of products with similar sales behavior and corresponding factors can be determined by analyzing sales data spanning several financial years. {br}

You define seasonality settings by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_66_00|Replenishment Seasonality] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206600|IN206600]) form. The seasons for one seasonality should not intersect. For date ranges not included in any season, the factor is 1.0 by default. A low season for groups of products may span multiple financial periods or be contained in a single financial period.{br}

The seasonality settings are used as follows: [anchor|#ol_ucn_fsl_b3]
#The system normalizes the historical data available for the specified seasons. The sales volumes for each day of a season are deleted by the appropriate factor to calculate the sales quantities as though it were a normal season.
#The system calculates the average daily sales quantity based on the historical data of the specified number of periods. For seasons within the specified periods, the system uses the normalized data.
#:((({S:Warn}The standard deviation for the daily demand is calculated for actual sales data, not for normalized data.
)))
#The average daily sales quantity is adjusted for seasons if seasons are expected within the forecast period. The average daily sales is multiplied by the average seasonality factor (calculated over all days in the forecast period—normal days and days of seasons).

==Calculating Replenishment Parameters==
By using the calculated average daily demand (daily sales), average lead time, and their standard deviation values, the system computes the following parameters used in automated replenishment: ''' Reorder Point''' and '''Safety Stock'''. The reorder point is calculated by using the following formula:{{{{(Reorder Point) = (Average Daily Demand) * (Average Lead Time) + (Safety Stock)
}}}}The safety stock is calculated as follows to address possible fluctuations in demand (daily sales):{{{{(Safety Stock) = NORMSINV(Service Level) *    
                        SQRT((Average Lead Time * STDEV(Daily Demand))^2 + (Average Daily Demand * STDEV(Lead Time))^2)
}}}}
Parameters used in these formulas are the following:[anchor|#ul_w2k_5b4_ft]
*{{Average Daily Demand}} is the average daily demand (average daily sales), calculated as the item quantity on all sales orders, credit memos, transfers out, and kit assembly documents in all the time periods used to analyze the data divided by the number of days.
*{{STDEV(Daily Demand)}} is the standard deviation of daily demand (daily sales quantity) from the average quantity.
*{{Average Lead Time}} is the average lead time (in days) calculated by using the following formula:{{{{(Average Lead Time) = SUM((Requested on Date) – (Purchase Receipt Date)) / (Amount of Purchase Orders)
}}}}
*{{STDEV(Lead Time)}} is the standard deviation of lead time (in days) from the average value.
*{{NORMSINV(Service Level)}} is the service factor, which is calculated based on the service level specified as a percentage. 
*:The service level is used to optimize the safety stock level. Generally, it is set on the item-class level, but it can be specified for each item in each warehouse if needed. The service level represents the probability of stockout not being reached. The {{NORMSINV(Service Level)}} function provides the factor that adjusts the safety stock required for the specified service level. With the service level selected at 50%, the safety stock is zero (that is, not required). The factor reaches 1.0 with the service level approximately 84%, which is the default value for the service level on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form. To maintain a higher service level, you will need a safety stock that exceeds the calculated quantity.
{br}

Calculation of the daily demand forecast depends on whether the launch date is specified in the '''Launch Date''' box on the '''Replenishment Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form as follows:[anchor|#_2ef425c0-373c-42ea-83b1-18246a9e905b]
*If the launch date is empty, the calculation period starts from the date of the first sales (if this date belongs to the current calculation period).
*If the launch date is specified, the calculation period starts from the launch date and is rounded to the selected forecast period (such as a week or month).
((({S:Warn}For correct calculation of the demand forecast, we recommend that you specify the launch date and select the beginning date of the forecast period close to the launch date.
)))
For an example of the calculation of the replenishment parameters for the moving average method, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Example_Replenishment_Calculation|An Example of Replenishment Parameter Calculation].{br}

The '''Maximum Stock''' is set equal to '''Reorder Point'''; if needed, you can manually increase the value of '''Maximum Stock'''.
==Setting Up Parameter Calculation==
You specify the forecast method and its parameters for each item class by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form, and then the settings are used as default values for items of the class. You can select values that differ from the default ones for particular items of the class by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. Moreover, if the ''Multiple Warehouses'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can adjust the replenishment settings for each warehouse in which the items are stocked. 
==Splitting Parameters by Subitems==
If subitems are used in your system, you can use demand forecasting to calculate replenishment parameters for specific subitems of the items if having enough stock for these subitems is important to your business. For such items, on the '''Replenishment Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, specify the initial replenishment parameters for each of the subitems used. After that, the system will calculate parameters for each listed subitem by using the forecasted daily demand (daily sales) for the specific subitem.((({S:Warn}All subitems of the item should be listed in the '''Subitem Replenishment Parameters''' table. If specific subitems do not require replenishment, specify zero values as their parameters.
)))
==Updating Replenishment Parameters by Using Forecast-based Values==
You use the following Acumatica ERP forms to update replenishment parameters and then prepare the replenishment:[anchor|#ul_xpj_xrf_j3]
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_85_00|Calculate Replenishment Parameters] ([~/?ScreenId=IN508500|IN508500]): You use this form to compute the average daily sales and average lead time, and then to calculate the following parameters used in automated replenishment: '''Max. Qty.''', ''' Reorder Point''', and '''Safety Stock'''.
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_95_00|Apply Replenishment Parameters] ([~/?ScreenId=IN509500|IN509500]): On this form, you review the parameter values suggested by the forecast and replace the old values of replenishment parameters with the suggested (calculated) ones. You can manually adjust the suggested parameters if needed.
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_80_00|Prepare Replenishment] ([~/?ScreenId=IN508000|IN508000]): You use this form to find the items that need replenishment and to calculate replenishment quantities for these items.
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_50_00|Create Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]): You can use this form to generate purchase orders for items requiring replenishment.

                        SQRT((Average Lead Time * STDEV(Daily Demand))^2 + (Average Daily Demand * STDEV(Lead Time))^2) Parameters 				used in these formulas are the following: Average Daily Demand  is the average daily demand (average 						daily sales), calculated as the item quantity on all sales orders, credit 						memos, transfers out, and kit assembly documents in all the time periods 						used to analyze the data divided by the number of days. STDEV(Daily Demand)  is the standard deviation of daily 						demand (daily sales quantity) from the average quantity. Average Lead Time  is the average lead time (in days) 						calculated by using the following 						formula: (Average Lead Time) = SUM((Requested on Date) – (Purchase Receipt Date)) / (Amount of Purchase Orders) STDEV(Lead Time)  is the standard deviation of lead time (in 						days) from the average value. NORMSINV(Service Level)  is the service factor, which is 						calculated based on the service level specified as a percentage.  The 							service level is used to optimize the safety stock level. Generally, it 							is set on the item-class level, but it can be specified for each item in 							each warehouse if needed.

The  NORMSINV(Service 								Level)  function provides the factor that adjusts the safety 							stock required for the specified service level. With the service level 							selected at 50%, the safety stock is zero (that is, not required). The 							factor reaches 1.0 with the service level approximately 84%, which is 							the default value for the service level on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000) form. To maintain a higher 							service level, you will need a safety stock that exceeds the calculated 							quantity. Calculation of the daily demand forecast depends on whether the launch 				date is specified in the  Launch Date  box on the  Replenishment 					Info  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form as 					follows: If the launch date is empty, the calculation period starts from the date of 						the first sales (if this date belongs to the current calculation 						period). If the launch date is specified, the calculation period starts from the 						launch date and is rounded to the selected forecast period (such as a week 						or month). For correct calculation of the demand forecast, we 				recommend that you specify the launch date and select the beginning date of the 				forecast period close to the launch date. For an example of the calculation 				of the replenishment parameters for the moving average method, see  An Example of Replenishment Parameter Calculation. The 					 Maximum Stock  is set equal to  Reorder 					Point ; if needed, you can manually increase the value of 					 Maximum Stock . Setting Up Parameter Calculation You specify the forecast method and its parameters for each item class by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000) form, and then the settings are used as 				default values for items of the class. You can select values that differ from the 				default ones for particular items of the class by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form. Moreover, if the  Multiple 					Warehouses  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features 				(CS100000) form, you can adjust the replenishment settings for each warehouse in 				which the items are stocked.  Splitting Parameters by Subitems If subitems are used in your system, you can use demand forecasting to calculate replenishment 				parameters for specific subitems of the items if having enough stock for these 				subitems is important to your business. For such items, on the 					 Replenishment Info  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form, specify the initial replenishment 				parameters for each of the subitems used. After that, the system will calculate 				parameters for each listed subitem by using the forecasted daily demand (daily 				sales) for the specific subitem. All subitems of the item should be listed in the  Subitem Replenishment 					Parameters  table. If specific subitems do not require replenishment, 				specify zero values as their parameters. Updating Replenishment Parameters by Using Forecast-based Values You use the following  Acumatica ERP forms to update replenishment parameters and then prepare the replenishment:  ([~/?ScreenId=IN508500|IN508500]) Calculate Replenishment Parameters (IN508500): You use this form to compute the average 					daily sales and average lead time, and then to calculate the following 					parameters used in automated replenishment:  Max.

Suppose that on March 1, ABC company first purchased a new gadget for bikers (the ''New Gadget'' stock item) and sold it to a local sporting goods store, Best Sports. Best Sports decided to order 200 units during April and May. {br}

The ABC company&rsquo;s purchasing manager, who is responsible for sales of the ''New Gadget'' item, decided to use the following default replenishment parameters during these three months of sales:[anchor|#ul_jkb_m4v_ft]
*'''Safety Stock''': 20
*'''Reorder Point''': 50
*'''Max Quantity:''' 200

These parameters were specified for the ''New Gadget'' stock item on the '''Replenishment Info''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. {br}

Before extending the sales to other customers, the purchasing manager has decided to collect the relevant sales data during the first three months and then calculate the replenishment parameters based on this data using the following settings:[anchor|#ul_p4w_qtd_ht]
*'''Forecast Type''': ''Month''
