Every Acumatica ERP screen includes basic elements that users use for navigating the system, viewing and managing data, and performing other basic functions. The following screenshot shows a typical Acumatica ERP screen in the user interface with the basic elements that appear on it.[anchor|#_f8828d7a-c669-4ab6-b292-e4e45ceee4a9][anchor|#_48496e7e-cc63-449f-8b8c-cb704fc56dee][image:InterfaceGuide/Images/UIG_Modern_UI_Basic_Elements.png|popup|Basic elements of the user interface|450px][anchor|#_e8dcb954-7f53-4a1b-bc45-5daa6b1707ed]
#Home button
#Search box

#Info area
#Main menu (displayed as a panel)
#Working area
{br}{TOC}
==Home Button==
When you click the Home button, which has the Acumatica logo on it and is located in the top left corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, you are forwarded to the home page of your instance. You can specify a custom home page that will be opened instead of the default home page. For details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS_Managing_User_Profile_Process_Activity|Managing Your Basic Working Environment: Process Activity].{br}

The Home button is displayed on the top pane only if the main menu panel is shown on the left side of the screen. If the main menu is minimized, you see the '''Menu''' button instead of the Home button.
==Search Box==
By using the '''Search''' box on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, you can search for a text string in menu items, form titles, help topics, files, notes, and ''entities'' that have been created using system forms, such as vendors, customers, prospects, employees, leads, and cases. Additionally, you can search for a form by its title and by its ID. For details, see [HelpRoot_Interface\UIG__con_New_UI_Search|Search].[anchor|#_b2bb55a2-55b8-4b55-8294-48a6d5d39385]((({S:Warn}If a link to a form or report has not been added to any of workspaces, you cannot find this form or report by using the '''Search''' box on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen.
)))
==Company and Branch Selection menu==
You can switch between companies and branches by clicking the company and branch selection menu on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen. When you click the selection menu, you can view the list of companies and their branches that you have access to. To switch to a particular company or branch, you click the name of the company or branch. If you have more companies and branches than the system can display, you can use the search box that is also a part of the selection menu. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Interface\UIG__con_New_UI_Company_Branch_Selector|Company and Branch Selection Menu]. 
==Info Area==
The info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, contains the menus and buttons that you can use to sign out from the system, change the settings of your account, and change the business date. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Interface\UIG__con_New_UI_Info_Area|Info Area].
==Main Menu==
The main menu in Acumatica ERP contains the links to your favorites and workspaces (menus with links to forms and reports). By default, the main menu is a panel located on the left side of the Acumatica ERP screen. You can minimize the menu so that it is displayed as a button in the top left corner of the screen (instead of the Home button). For details, see [HelpRoot_Interface\UIG__con_New_UI_Main_Menu|Main Menu].{br}

When you click a workspace item on the main menu, the workspace menu opens. This menu contains the forms and reports dedicated to a particular functional area. For details, see [HelpRoot_Interface\UIG__con_New_UI_Workspaces|Workspaces].
==Working Area==
The working area, which is the large area on the right side of the screen, may display any of the following:[anchor|#ul_ksk_wkk_f3]
*Form: Acumatica ERP has forms of multiple types. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Interface\Forms|Forms].
*Report: A report is a type of a form specifically designed to organize data in a presentable format, as described in [HelpRoot_Interface\Report_Processing_Options|Reports].
*Dashboard: A dashboard is a collection of widgets, displayed on a single page, that give you needed information at a glance. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Interface\DB__mng_UIG_Dashboards|Dashboards].

==Work with Acumatica ERP on Mobile Devices==
If you use Acumatica ERP in a browser of a mobile device, the main menu becomes minimized. In the minimized menu, you can see the icons and the titles of the links to workspaces. To open a workspace, you tap the needed link on the main menu. On the workspace, you can open any entity provided there by doing one of the following:[anchor|#_12874b64-36b0-46ba-b338-fb2ca38adbb6]
*To open a form in the same window, tap the link.
*To open a form with the main menu and header available in a new tab, long-press the link and select '''Open in new tab'''.
*To open only a form with no main menu or header available in a new tab, long-press the link and select '''Open in new window'''.
((({S:Hint}For maximum usability of the system on a mobile device, we recommend that you use the Acumatica mobile app.

Searching in Acumatica ERP gives you the ability to quickly open a form (or a record on a form), find a file, or find a help topic. This topic contains information on performing searches in the user interface of Acumatica ERP.{br}{TOC}
==Search Form==
To begin a search, you type a text string in the '''Search''' box. (You can use the <tt>Ctrl+Q</tt> shortcut key to place the cursor in the '''Search''' box.) The system opens the Search form in the working area, on top of the page (such as a dashboard or a form) that was opened when you started your search. The form is shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_7bbbff2b-8bed-4299-8514-031854bb4a1e][anchor|#_886844cf-a5c4-4af4-ba8c-fcec63d29202][image:InterfaceGuide/Images/UIG_New_UI_Search_Form.png|popup|Search form|450px][anchor|#_dfcac0ff-0aeb-4371-accb-a10189e67933]
#Search filter tabs
#Search results

You can look through the search results on the Search form and go back to the page you had opened before you performed the search. For example, you can start to enter data on some Acumatica ERP form, search for some information, and then go back to the form and continue to enter data because your previous changes have been preserved.
==Search Filter Tabs==
By default, the search in Acumatica ERP is performed in form and report names. You can switch to one of the search filter tabs to change the scope of the search. The following tabs are available:[anchor|#ul_yx2_jsg_g3]
*'''Menu Items''': On this tab, you can scan for specific forms or reports by name or ID.
*'''Transactions and Profiles''': On this tab, you can look for specific system records, such as customers, vendors, prospects, employee accounts, and notes attached to records.
*'''Help Topics''': This tab lists search results in all guides and help topics. When you click a link to a Help topic, the topic is opened in a separate tab of a browser. If you want to open the Help topic over the working area, you should press Ctrl and click the link.
*'''Files''': On this tab, you can view files attached to system records.

When you type a text string in the '''Search''' box and switch between the search filter tabs, your text string is preserved, and search results are automatically displayed for this text string.
==Search Results==
In Acumatica ERP, an intelligent search is implemented. The system performs a flexible search, considering all possible forms of the text string that you have entered in the '''Search''' box, and then lists the search results from the most relevant to the least relevant. For more information about turning on semantic search, see [HelpRoot_Install\how__Semantic_Search|Enabling Semantic Search for Microsoft SQL Server] in the Acumatica ERP Installation Guide.((({S:Warn}If you have searched by entering the name of an Acumatica ERP entry form that has a substitute form, the form name with a link to the substitute form (rather than the entry form) is displayed in the search results, but the entry form is not. When you use the form ID to search for the entry form, the system does not display a link to this entry form in the search results. You can open the entry form by using the substitute form.
)))
The system narrows the search results based on the access rights of the user who performs the search. If you don&rsquo;t have permissive access rights to particular data (such as vendor accounts), these objects do not appear in the search results, even though they match the search criteria. Your access rights to file attachments are determined by your rights to the entities to which the files are attached.{br}

If you are using an Acumatica ERP tenant with demo data you need to build search indexes to accelerate searching in the system. For a procedure, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Search_indexes_update|To Build Search Indexes] in the Acumatica ERP System Administration Guide.
==Search Tips==
Keep the following tips in mind when you use the search capabilities in Acumatica ERP:[anchor|#ul_lmf_hn3_zq]
*To search for all possible forms of a particular word or phrase, you type it as is without any additional characters. For example, if you type ''invoice'' in the '''Search''' box, the system displays all strings that contain ''invoice'', ''invoices'', and ''invoiced''.
*To search for an exact match of a particular word or phrase, you enclose it in quotation marks. For example, if you type ''“Western Star Trucks”'' in the '''Search''' box, the system returns only the customer with this exact name.
*To search for a particular string everywhere in the system (in form names, help topics, system entities, and files), you type the string in the '''Search''' box and then switch to each of the filtering tabs.

==Usage of Online Help System in Search==
The built-in Help is provided with the Acumatica ERP instance. Topics in the built-in Help are relevant to the version of the Acumatica ERP instance in use and are not updated until the instance is updated. {br}

Unlike built-in Help topics, online Help topics are regularly updated to the latest version of Acumatica ERP, and online Help contains the newest topics. The search functionality in online Help also takes into account the relevance of topics to the search term. If the system has been configured to use the online Help functionality, users can get the most relevant search results from the [https://help.acumatica.com/|Online Help Portal], which is the open source of Help topics. {br}

By default, the online Help search functionality is not turned on. To turn it on, you select the '''Use Online Help System''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_05|Site Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200505|SM200505]) form.((({S:Warn}Currently, the online Help functionality is available for only Acumatica ERP instances in a public cloud. 
)))
When the '''Use Online Help System''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_05|Site Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200505|SM200505]) form, the search results for the Help topics are displayed as shown in the following screenshots. [anchor|#_266c7396-1d2e-4658-a449-f8d846235792][anchor|#_39c42345-e683-4417-8212-03c742f63049][image:InterfaceGuide/Images/UIG_ML_Help_UI.png|popup|Interface of the Help Topics tab of the search results|450px][anchor|#_a61ba5ba-c44f-4c60-a19d-3a7d323f992e][anchor|#_4ea6649f-00d6-48d6-808f-2d12057ba75a][image:InterfaceGuide/Images/UIG_Help_UI_Link_Article.png|popup|The '''Open this article at Help Portal''' button|450px][anchor|#_6a0ffc91-d813-4f6c-bb24-49616c19f061]
#Topic preview box: This box displays a preview of the topic that the system has determined is the most relevant. 
#The '''Show Full Version''' button: The user can click this button at the bottom of the preview box to open the whole topic in a preview box. If the user clicks the '''Show Full Version''' button, the preview box is enlarged and the '''Open this article at Help Portal''' button appears, as shown in the second screenshot above.
#Feedback section: The user can leave feedback by selecting '''Yes''' or '''No''' right of '''Was this helpful?''' in the preview box of the topic. 
#Other topics: The system displays the other topics that are relevant to the search string.
#The '''Open in new tab''' button: This button (shown in the second screenshot above) appears only if the user has clicked the '''Show Full Version''' button in the preview box or the topic itself was short. When the user clicks this button, the system navigates to the full version of the topic, opening the online Help in a new browser tab.

You can open the entry form by using the substitute         form. The system narrows the search results based on the access rights of the user who performs         the search. If you don't have permissive access rights to particular data (such as vendor         accounts), these objects do not appear in the search results, even though they match the         search criteria. Your access rights to file attachments are determined by your rights to the         entities to which the files are attached. If you are using an  Acumatica ERP tenant with demo data you need to build search indexes to accelerate searching in the         system. For a procedure, see  To Build Search Indexes         in the  Acumatica ERP System Administration Guide. Search Tips Keep the following tips in mind when you use the search capabilities in  Acumatica ERP: To search for all possible forms of a particular word or phrase, you type it as is           without any additional characters. For example, if you type  invoice  in the              Search  box, the system displays all strings that contain              invoice ,  invoices , and  invoiced . To search for an exact match of a particular word or phrase, you enclose it in quotation           marks. For example, if you type  “Western Star Trucks”  in the              Search  box, the system returns only the customer with this exact           name. To search for a particular string everywhere in the system (in form names, help topics,           system entities, and files), you type the string in the  Search  box           and then switch to each of the filtering tabs. Usage of Online Help System in Search The built-in Help is provided with the  Acumatica ERP instance. Topics in the built-in Help are relevant to the version of the  Acumatica ERP instance in use and are not updated until the instance is updated.  Unlike built-in Help topics, online Help topics are regularly updated to the latest version         of  Acumatica ERP, and online Help contains the newest topics. The search functionality in online Help also         takes into account the relevance of topics to the search term. If the system has been         configured to use the online Help functionality, users can get the most relevant search         results from the  Online Help Portal Online Help Portal, which is the open source of Help topics.  By default, the online Help search functionality is not turned on. To turn it on, you         select the  Use Online Help System  check box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200505|SM200505]) Site Preferences (SM200505) form. Currently, the online Help functionality is available for only  Acumatica ERP instances in a public cloud.  When the  Use Online Help System  check box is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200505|SM200505]) Site Preferences (SM200505) form, the search results for the Help         topics are displayed as shown in the following screenshots.  Interface of the Help Topics tab of the search results The  Open this article at Help Portal  button Topic preview box: This box displays a preview of the topic that the system has           determined is the most relevant.  The  Show Full Version  button: The user can click this button at           the bottom of the preview box to open the whole topic in a preview box. If the user clicks           the  Show Full Version  button, the preview box is enlarged and the              Open this article at Help Portal  button appears, as shown in the           second screenshot above. Feedback section: The user can leave feedback by selecting  Yes  or              No  right of  Was this helpful?  in the           preview box of the topic.  Other topics: The system displays the other topics that are relevant to the search           string. The  Open in new tab  button: This button (shown in the second           screenshot above) appears only if the user has clicked the  Show Full             Version  button in the preview box or the topic itself was short. When the           user clicks this button, the system navigates to the full version of the topic, opening           the online Help in a new browser tab. ]]></column>

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Help In the user interface of  Acumatica ERP, you can click the Help button ( ) to view Help information that is         relevant to your current work. The specific Help information you view depends on the item         that is displayed in the working area when you click this button, as follows: If the working area is displaying a form other than a data entry form or mass processing           form (because forms of types other than data entry and mass processing are not described           in documentation), the Help dashboard, which contains cards with descriptions of guides           and links to them, is opened in a separate tab of a browser. For details, see  Help Dashboard Help Dashboard. If the working area is displaying an  Acumatica ERP a data entry form, processing form, or maintenance form, the Help menu specific to this           form appears over the working area. The Help menu contains links to the conceptual,           procedural, and reference topics that are related to the form. For more information, see              Form-Specific Help Menu Form-Specific Help Menu. If the working area is displaying a dashboard, the Help menu appears over the working           area and displays links to the conceptual, procedural, and reference topics that are           related to dashboards. For more information, see  Form-Specific Help Menu Form-Specific Help Menu. If the working area is displaying a report, the reference topic that describes this           report is opened in a separate tab of a browser. The Help menu covers part of the working area. While viewing it, you can come back to the         page that had been displayed in the working area by clicking the Help button again. The Help         dashboard is opened in a separate browser tab, as are Help topics. If you want to open the         Help dashboard and Help topics over the working area, you should press Ctrl and click the         Help button. Help Dashboard The Help dashboard (see the following screenshot) is the main navigation page of  Acumatica ERP documentation. Help dashboard Topic View button Help section title Guide card Close Help button You click the Topic View button to switch from the Help dashboard to a Help topic. The Help         topic that you last viewed in the current session is displayed. If you haven't opened any         Help topic yet, you see the list of Help guides in the navigation pane. The guides in the Help section are organized in sections, based on the type of system user         these guides are developed for (for example,  End User  or  Administrator ), or         based on the function these guides perform (for example,  Reference  or  Quick           Guides ). A guide card is a card that contains a description of each guide. You click the guide card         to open the guide. You click the Close Help button to close the Help dashboard. The form, report, or dashboard         that was displayed in the working area before you opened Help becomes visible on the         screen. Form-Specific Help Menu A form-specific Help menu is opened when you click the Help ( ) button while viewing the majority of forms         (except for reports and generic inquiries that are not described in Help) and dashboards. In         this menu, you can see links to Help topics that are related to the form if a form is opened         in the working area (see the following screenshot) or to dashboards if a dashboard is opened         in the working area. The menu pane partially overlaps the working area. Form-specific Help menu Help Navigation Toolbar By default, when you click a link in the form-specific Help menu, the Help topic or the         Help dashboard opens in a new tab of your browser. If you click the  Acumatica News          link in the  Help Dashboard  section of the form-specific Help menu, the system opens         the Welcome to Acumatica page in the current tab. For more information, see  Welcome to Acumatica Page in Acumatica ERP. If you want to open the Help topic or the Help dashboard in the same tab of your browser,         you press Ctrl and click the needed link in the form-specific Help menu. You can navigate to         different Help topics within a guide (item 2 in the screenshot below or selecting the topic         in the Help tree) or switch to another guide by clicking the Open Help Dashboard button         (item 1 in the screenshot below), and clicking the needed guide. If you want to return to         the form where you initiated the form-specific Help menu or the Help topic, you click the         Help ( ) button. To return to the form-specific Help         menu, you click the Open Form-Specific Help menu button ( ; item 3 in the screenshot below),         which appears near the Close button. When you open a Help topic, you can see the navigation toolbar, which has tools you can use         to quickly switch between Help topics and to close the Help topic you are viewing (see the         following screenshot). Help Navigation toolbar Open Help Dashboard button Path to the opened topic in the Help tree Open Form-Specific Help menu button (appears only if you have opened the Help topic or           the Help dashboard by pressing Ctrl+click) Close You click the Open Help Dashboard button to open the Help dashboard (for example, if you         want to switch to another guide). Each segment of the path to the opened topic is a link to the corresponding Help topic. By         clicking the link, you can open a parent topic on any level. You click the Close button to close the current topic. The main menu becomes visible on the         screen. Search of Help Topics You can search for information in Help in the following ways: By using the Help button: If you are working with a form or report and have questions           related to the form or report, you can click the Help button to open a form-specific Help           menu with links to related topics (for a form) or a reference topic (for a report). By using the  Search  box: If you want to find information that is           not related to the form you are currently working with, you can type a search string in           the  Search  box, switch to the  Help Topics            search filter tab, and find the necessary information in the search results. By using navigation in Help: If you want to read all information related to a particular           functional area (for example, what tools the system provides for cash management), you           open the Help dashboard, open a particular guide, and in the Help topic tree, click the           title of the chapter you want to read. View of a Help Topic The following screenshot shows a view of an  Acumatica ERP Help topic with the parts that appear on it. Help Topic View Help topic toolbar Help topic title  Topic table of contents (optional) Edit  button (available to users with sufficient access           rights) Back to Top  button By using the buttons on the Help topic toolbar, you can carry out the following common         tasks: Locales : change the language of the topic. Print : print the topic. Export : export the topic to Word or as a plain text. Large Help topics may include a table of contents, so you can navigate through the topic         more easily. The table of contents lists links to sections of the topic; you can click any         link to navigate to that section. By default, the table of contents is open. To minimize the         table of contents or maximize it if it is closed, click  Hide/Show  on         the table of contents.  Acumatica ERP Help topics can be edited or reorganized by a user with sufficient access rights. To edit         the entire topic, you click the  Edit Current Article  button on the         topic toolbar, which is available if you have sufficient access rights. For more information         about access rights, see  Wiki Access Management. To edit         a section in a Help topic, you click the  Edit  button right of the         section title. By default, this button is hidden, even for users with sufficient access         rights to edit the topic. If you have these access rights, to be able to view and click the            Edit  button, you point to the section title.  When you scroll down in a large topic, you may want to easily return to the beginning of         the topic. For this purpose, you can click the  Back to Top  button,         which is also right of each section title. By default, this button is hidden. It appears         when you point to the section title. ]]></column>

==Tiles==
A tile is a special button on a workspace that you click to open a form or report with predefined settings (or, for a data entry form, with most settings blank so you can define a new entity). For example, by clicking a tile, you can open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form with a particular vendor selected in the '''Vendor''' box.{br}

Predefined workspaces contain tiles with the most popular actions and forms for the workspace. You can make a tile your favorite by clicking ([anchor|#_0bcb7a74-75b3-4707-aff8-efcc4ebe3c67][image:Shared/Images/UIG_Tile_Favorite.png|Workspace elements|15px]) in the lower right corner of the tile.{br}

If your user account is assigned the ''Administrator'' role, you can manage the tiles in a workspace for all system users. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\AS__con_User_Interface_Configuration|Customization of the UI] in the System Administration Guide.[anchor|#_f0e79a7c-3693-4497-bf83-9763e12a7536]
==Categories==
In each workspace, categories are used to group items by type, which makes it easier for users to find needed items. For example, the '''Transactions''' category contains forms you can use to process transactions. The system provides a predefined group of categories.{br}

If your user account is assigned the ''Administrator'' role, you can manage the groups of categories in the system. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\AS__con_User_Interface_Configuration|Customization of the UI] in the System Administration Guide.
==Links to Forms and Reports==
On a workspace, you can find links to different types of forms: data entry forms, inquiries, processing forms, report forms, and substitute forms. You use a link on the workspace to open a particular form or report form that you want to work with. {br}

For some forms, you can initiate the creation of a new document or other entity. Usually these forms have substitute forms. A substitute form has a list of records related to the form for which it is being substituted. For substitute forms for data entry forms (on which you can initiate a new record), the '''+ NEW''' button appears on the workspace when you point at the name of the form; this button is not available for reports, inquiry forms, or processing forms. {br}

By using this button, you can open the entry form for creating a new entity directly from the workspace with just one click.

In Acumatica ERP, you can specify a category and the workspace you want to save a form or a report to. On the forms below, you can create entities for which the separate links can be placed to the system. You can easily define the workspace and category in which each entity created on these forms is organized:[anchor|#_400e5608-5968-4263-809f-22fa4d62b879]
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_10_10|Application Resources] ([~/?ScreenId=SM301010|SM301010])

*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_60_00|Report Definitions] ([~/?ScreenId=CS206000|CS206000])

The needed workspace and category of a particular entity are specified in the '''Workspace''' and '''Category''' boxes of the related forms.{br}

Any application resource, dashboard, generic inquiry, pivot table, or ARM report is visible in the system (listed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_20|Site Map] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200520|SM200520]) form) when a user saves the new entity for the first time.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Form Toolbar The form toolbar, available on most forms, is located                                                   near the top of the form, under the form title bar                                                   (see the screenshot below). The form toolbar may                                                   include standard and form-specific buttons. Form toolbar You use the standard buttons on the form toolbar to         navigate through entities that were created by using the current form, insert or delete an         entity, use the clipboard, save the data you have entered, or cancel your work on the         form. A form toolbar on a particular form may include         form-specific buttons in addition to standard buttons. These buttons usually provide         navigation to other forms, invoke specific actions, and perform modifications or processing         related to the functionality of the form. Standard Form Toolbar Buttons The following table lists the standard buttons of the form toolbar. A form toolbar may include                                                   some or all of these buttons. Standard Form Toolbar Buttons Button Icon Description Discard Changes and Close Discards any unsaved changes made to the entity, and navigates to the list as                   entry point that is related to the current form. If the system opened the current form in a pop-up window (from a different                   form), this button is not displayed. To return to the original form, click                      Close . Save & Close Saves the changes made to the entity, and navigates to the list as entry point                 that is related to the current form. Save Saves the changes made to the entity.  Cancel Depending on the context, does one of the following: Discards any unsaved changes you have made to entities and retrieves the last                     saved version. Clears all changes and restores the default settings. Add New Record Clears any values you've specified on the form, restores any default values,                 and initiates the creation of a new entity.  Delete Deletes the currently selected entity, clears any values you have specified on                 the form, and populates elements with the default values that the system inserts                 when a new entity is created. You can delete an entity only if it is not linked                   with another entity.  Clipboard Provides menu commands you can use to do the following:  Copy : Copy the selected entity to the clipboard. Paste : Paste an entity or template from the                     clipboard. Save as Template : Create a template based on the                     selected entity. Import from XML : Import an entity or a template from an                        .xml  file. Export to XML : Export the selected entity to an                        .xml  file. For more information on templates and copy-and-paste operations in  Acumatica ERP, see  Using Forms. For more information on                   importing and exporting  .xml  files, see  Importing and Exporting Data to Excel and XML in the  Acumatica ERP User Guide. Go to First Record Displays the first entity (in the list of entities of the specific type) and                 its details. Go to Previous Record Displays the previous entity and its details. Go to Next Record Displays the next entity and its details. Go to Last Record Displays the last entity (in the list of entities of the specific type) and its                 details. Schedules Gives you the ability to schedule the processing. For more information, see                    To Schedule Processing in the                    Acumatica ERP User Guide. Inquiry Form Toolbar Buttons  Acumatica ERP inquiry forms present data in a tabular format. These forms can be designed by a user         with the appropriate access rights by using the Generic Inquiry tool (for details, see  Managing Generic Inquiries in the  Acumatica ERP Reporting Tools Guide), or can be initially configured in your system. A toolbar of an         inquiry form contains both the standard form toolbar buttons (described in the table above)         and the additional buttons described below.  Button Icon Description Fit to Screen Expands the form to fit on the screen and                                                   adjusts the column widths proportionally. Export to Excel Exports the data to an Excel file. For more                                                   information, see  Integration with Excel in the  Acumatica ERP Getting Started Guide.

After the filter has been                                                   created and saved, the corresponding tab appears                                                   on the table. For more information about                                                   filtering, see  Filters. ]]></column>

In the screenshot below, you can see an Acumatica ERP form with the types of lookup boxes called out.[anchor|#image_whx_kbb_j3][image:InterfaceGuide/Images/lookup_fields.png|popup|Lookup box|220px][anchor|#ol_fsb_nbb_j3]
#Lookup box with drop-down list
#Lookup box with lookup table
#Lookup table
#Additional button: '''Edit'''
#Currency box

==Using Autocomplete==
When you enter values into most lookup boxes with a lookup table, you can use ''autocomplete'': You start typing in the box, and the system displays in the lookup table the list of suggestions that include the string you have typed.((({S:Warn}You can turn off autocomplete on the [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\SM_20_30_10|User Profile] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) form.
))){br}

For example, suppose you wanted to find a customer whose name is ''Nautilus Bar SABL''. In the '''Customer''' box, you might type <tt>bar</tt>, and the list of customers would be filtered down to include only the customers whose ID or name include the string you typed, as shown in the screenshot below. Now you would press the Down Arrow key two times to navigate to Nautilus Bar SABL and press Enter to select the customer.[anchor|#image_c5p_fp5_3k][image:InterfaceGuide/Images/Autocomplete.png|popup|Use of Autocomplete|100px]
==Selecting a Value in the Lookup Box==
To select a value in the lookup box, do one of the following:[anchor|#ul_sgs_vwv_lk]
*If you know the value, type it in the box and press Enter.
*:For example, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, to select a purchase order with the number 100, type <tt>100</tt> in the '''Order Nbr.''' box.
*Click the magnifier icon and select the value in the lookup table.
*:((({S:Hint}You can use filtering options to display only documents with specific properties. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Interface\IB_Filters|Filters].
)))
*If the box supports autocomplete, start typing the value, and then select the value in the table.

==Using Currency Toggle Button ==
For the documents with amounts in foreign currency, the Currency Toggle button switches the currency of the amounts between the base currency and the selected foreign currency. The label on the Currency Toggle button depends on the currently selected currency of the amount:
*'''View Base''': The amount is displayed in the foreign currency; click the button to view the amount in the base currency.
*'''View Cury''': The amount is displayed in the base currency; click the button to view the amount in the foreign currency.

The Currency Toggle button does not affect the documents with amounts in the base currency only.

The '''Translations''' dialog box is a localization tool that you use to provide multiple translations for text that users enter in the text boxes of the system, as well as to view existing translations for the text. This dialog box is available for multiple text boxes in the system; these text boxes are listed in [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__CON_Boxes_MultiLanguage|Boxes that Have Multi-Language Support]. {br}

The '''Translations''' dialog box may contain one text box or multiple text boxes, with each box labeled with a language name, where you can enter translations, as shown in the screenshot below. You enter a translation or multiple translations, close the dialog box, and click '''Save''' on the form toolbar. [anchor|#fig_uhw_44m_hw][anchor|#image_gvx_2dt_n3][image:InterfaceGuide/Images/UIG_Translations_Box.png|popup|Translations dialog box|180px][anchor|#ol_ir3_py2_n3]
#Language labels
#Text boxes for entering translations

You can invoke the dialog box by clicking the link with an ISO code of a language next to a text box. Additionally, when you are editing a value in a cell (of a table) or a box that has multi-language support, you can click <tt>CTRL+SHIFT+L</tt> to invoke the '''Translations''' dialog box. {br}

The number of boxes in the '''Translations''' dialog box is defined by the number of languages that are used in localization of user input. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__CON_Locales_and_Languages|Locales and Languages].[anchor|#_a8f85339-7996-465f-b4be-43ee1b833cb7]
==The Order of the Languages in the Box==
The order of the languages in the '''Translations''' dialog box depends on the locale you are currently logged in to. The system displays the languages of the boxes in the '''Translations''' dialog box in the following order:[anchor|#ul_rrs_nkq_nw]
#The language associated with a locale you are currently logged in to
#The language marked as the default on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_50|System Locales] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200550|SM200550]) form
#Alternative languages displayed in the sequence specified for them in the '''Sequence''' column on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_50|System Locales] form 

The ISO code whose language is displayed as the link depends on the following factors:[anchor|#ul_l1j_bkq_nw]
*Which locale you are currently logged in to
*Whether there is a translation for the language associated with the locale
*Whether there is a translation for the default language

The system determines which ISO code to display as follows:[anchor|#ol_zg1_lsm_hw]
#If a translation is available for the language associated with the locale to which the user is currently logged in, then the system does the following:
#*Displays the translation in the text box that has multi-language support
#*Displays the ISO code of the language as a link that you can click to invoke the '''Translations''' dialog box
#If a translation for the locale language is not available, the system searches for a translation specified for the language marked as the default on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_50|System Locales] form. If a translation for the default language is available, the system does the following:
#*Displays the default translation in the text box that has multi-language support
#*Displays the ISO code of the default language as a link that you can click to invoke the '''Translations''' dialog box
#If a translation for the default language is not available, the system searches for a translation specified for any language marked as an alternative on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_50|System Locales] form. If a translation for an alternative language is available, the system does the following:
#*Displays the alternative translation in the text box that has multi-language support
#*Displays the ISO code of the corresponding alternative language as a link that you can click to invoke the '''Translations''' dialog box
#If there are no available translations, the system does the following:
#*Displays no value in the text box that has multi-language support
#*Displays the ISO code of the language associated with the locale you are currently signed in with as a link that you can click to invoke the '''Translations''' dialog box

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
During the normal course of business, you use forms to add, delete, edit, and manage records, such as documents or business accounts. You use form functionality to facilitate this process. 
==Navigating to a Form==
Forms are divided into suites and modules according to their functionality. To open a form, you either navigate to the form by using the navigation options, as described in [HelpRoot_Interface\Forms__how_Open_a_Form|To Open a Form by Using Acumatica ERP Navigation Options], or search for the form, as described in [HelpRoot_Interface\Forms__how_Search|To Search for a Form].
==Attaching Files to Records==
In Acumatica ERP, files can be attached to any record that Acumatica ERP keeps for the objects—such as invoices, leads, customers, bills, sales orders, and batches of transactions—that users add by using data entry forms. You can attach different files, such as images in various formats, scanned documents, and internal instructions for employees.{br}

You can attach files to the records on data entry forms. The value in parentheses to the right of the '''File''' menu on the form title bar shows the number of files attached to the selected record.((({S:Warn}Files can also be attached to record details. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Interface\Attaching_Files_to_Record_Details|To Attach a File to a Record Detail].
)))
You can easily manage and track files and images attached to Acumatica ERP records and record details for various purposes. For more information on managing attached files, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__mng_File_Attachements|Managing Attached Files] in the Acumatica ERP System Administration Guide and [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS_Working_With_Data_Entry_Forms_Mapref|Working with Data Entry Forms] and [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS_Importing_Exporting_to_Excel_XML|Importing and Exporting Data to Excel and XML] in the Acumatica ERP Getting Started Guide.
==Attaching Notes to Records==
In Acumatica ERP, you can attach text notes to any record that Acumatica ERP keeps for the objects—such as invoices, opportunities, vendors, bills, purchase orders, and batches of transactions—that users add by using data entry forms. You can use these notes to communicate key information about the record or record detail to other users.((({S:Warn}Notes can also be attached to record details. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Interface\Attaching_Notes_to_Record_Details|To Attach a Note to a Record Detail].
)))
==Copying and Pasting==
In Acumatica ERP, you can easily create a new document by copying and pasting an existing document of the same type. This functionality can also be used to create new objects, such as vendor or customer classes, by copying existing objects. For applicable forms, the copying and pasting options are offered on the '''Clipboard''' menu on the form toolbar (shown in the screenshot below). For the detailed procedure, see [HelpRoot_Interface\UIG__how_Copy_Documents|To Copy a Document Contents to a New Document].{br}

For more information, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\SM__con_Copy-and-Paste_Options_and_Document_Templates|Copy-and-Paste Options and Document Templates] in the Acumatica ERP Getting Started Guide.
==Applying a Template==
If templates have been added for a document you want to create, you can use a template to fill the elements for a new document. You can see the available templates on the '''Clipboard''' menu on the form toolbar, as shown in the screenshot below.[anchor|#fig_m4b_jf2_1r][anchor|#image_ghr_tf2_1r][image:InterfaceGuide/Images/clipboard_templates.png|Document templates in the Clipboard menu]
For the detailed procedure, see [HelpRoot_Interface\UIG__how_Use_template|To Create a Document with a Template].{br}

For more information, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\SM__con_Copy-and-Paste_Options_and_Document_Templates|Copy-and-Paste Options and Document Templates] in the Acumatica ERP Getting Started Guide.
==Importing from and Exporting to XML==[anchor|#_19a4d5c7-c9d7-40fd-b5d1-427ae2f99de1]
In Acumatica ERP, some record types, such as generic inquiries and ARM reports, have a complex structure. Sometimes, you may need to export data from these forms, for example, to transfer a generic inquiry to another instance. Then in the other instance, you need to import this generic inquiry. You can import and export these records in XML format. [anchor|#_6f2a8c4c-9418-443b-a424-c466c55bb28d]{br}

A form has XML export and import functionality when the '''Export as XML''' and '''Import from XML''' menu commands are available if you click '''Clipboard''' on the form toolbar after you select an entity. For example, navigate to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_80_00|Generic Inquiry] ([~/?ScreenId=SM208000|SM208000]) form, select an inquiry, and notice that this menu command is available. For details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\IS__how_XML_export|To Export Data to XML] and [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\IS__how_XML_import|To Import Data from XML].

You use form functionality to facilitate         this process.  Navigating to a Form Forms are divided into suites and modules according to their functionality. To open a form,         you either navigate to the form by using the navigation options, as described in  To Open a Form by Using Acumatica ERP Navigation Options, or search for the form, as described in  To Search for a Form. Attaching Files to Records In  Acumatica ERP, files can be attached to any record that  Acumatica ERP keeps for the objects—such as invoices, leads, customers, bills, sales orders, and         batches of transactions—that users add by using data entry forms. You can attach         different files, such as images in various formats, scanned documents, and internal         instructions for employees. You can attach files to the records on data entry forms. The value in parentheses to the         right of the  File  menu on the form title bar shows the number of         files attached to the selected record. Files can also be attached to record details. For more information, see  To Attach a File to a Record Detail. You can easily manage and track files and images attached to  Acumatica ERP records and record details for various purposes. For more information on managing         attached files, see  Managing Attached Files in the  Acumatica ERP System Administration Guide and  Working with Data Entry Forms and  Importing and Exporting Data to Excel and XML in the  Acumatica ERP Getting Started Guide. Attaching Notes to Records In  Acumatica ERP, you can attach text notes to any record that  Acumatica ERP keeps for the objects—such as invoices, opportunities, vendors, bills, purchase         orders, and batches of transactions—that users add by using data entry forms. You can use         these notes to communicate key information about the record or record detail to other         users. Notes can also be attached to record details. For more information, see  To Attach a Note to a Record Detail. Copying and Pasting In  Acumatica ERP, you can easily create a new document by copying and pasting an existing document of the         same type. This functionality can also be used to create new objects, such as vendor or         customer classes, by copying existing objects. For applicable forms, the copying and pasting         options are offered on the  Clipboard  menu on the form toolbar (shown in the         screenshot below). For the detailed procedure, see  To Copy a Document Contents to a New Document. For more information, see  Copy-and-Paste Options and Document Templates in the            Acumatica ERP Getting Started Guide. Applying a Template If templates have been added for a document you want to create, you can use a template to         fill the elements for a new document. You can see the available templates on the            Clipboard  menu on the form toolbar, as shown in the screenshot below. Document templates in the Clipboard menu For the detailed procedure, see  To Create a Document with a Template. For more information, see  Copy-and-Paste Options and Document Templates in the            Acumatica ERP Getting Started Guide. Importing from and Exporting to XML In  Acumatica ERP, some record types, such as generic inquiries and ARM reports, have a complex structure. Sometimes, you may need to export data from these forms, for example, to transfer a generic inquiry to another instance. Then in the other instance, you need to import this generic inquiry. You can import and export these records in XML format.  A form has XML export and import functionality when the  Export as XML  and  Import from XML  menu commands are available if you click  Clipboard  on the form toolbar after you select an entity. For example, navigate to the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM208000|SM208000]) Generic Inquiry (SM208000) form, select an inquiry, and notice that this menu command is available. For details, see  To Export Data to XML and  To Import Data from XML. ]]></column>

In Acumatica ERP, each form designed for the mass processing of data records displays the '''Processing''' pop-up window. This window provides the details of the process you are running in the system. The '''Processing''' pop-up window appears when you invoke the processing; you close the window manually. It consists of a process bar, tabs with statuses, and a table with details, as shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_6e65af51-e62d-47b9-87e2-1556810881b4][anchor|#_2b71a0b0-72e0-4c23-87d9-708a409c1455][image:InterfaceGuide/Images/UIG_NewUI_LongRunningProcess.png|popup|Major parts of the Processing pop-up window|450px][anchor|#_f7d840aa-a7b8-4e95-a792-b499f6c08668]
#Maximize/Minimize button: You use this button to enlarge the pop-up window to the size of the form from which you invoked processing or to minimize the pop-up window if it has already been enlarged. 
#Progress area: You use this area to see the progress of the process you are running in the system. It contains three measurements: percentage of records that have been processed, remaining time, and elapsed time.
#Tabs area: You use this tab to see the status of the records you are processing. This area contains two sections: tab tiles and tab details.
#'''Cancel Processing''' button: You click this button to stop the processing now.
{br}{TOC}
==Progress Area==
When you run the processing of any data records (that is, documents or entities), you can see what percentage of the data records have already been processed, how much time remains in the processing, and how much time has elapsed.[anchor|#_224b1741-b2ed-4f15-b3dc-2799582c6ec7][anchor|#_109e97b4-436f-48e3-ac8c-cf96d2f36aa1][image:InterfaceGuide/Images/UIG_NewUI_LongRunningProcess_Bar.png|popup|Progress area|450px][anchor|#_bd852ae0-7613-4720-9c17-8d6b3900d88b]
#Completed: Displays the percentage of records that have been processed. 
#Remaining: Displays the time remaining until the process finishes running. The remaining time is displayed in the following time format: ''HH:MM:SS''.
#Elapsed: Displays the time that the process takes. The elapsed time is displayed in the following time format: ''HH:MM:SS''.

==Tabs Area==
You use this area to view the details of the process you are running. In the Tabs area, you can see the following tabs:[anchor|#_6a6f2914-3db2-4b77-8ac7-e28b178bff01]
*'''Processed''': Lists all the successfully processed records
*'''Errors''': Lists all the records that were processed with errors
*'''Warnings''': Lists all the records that were processed with warnings
*'''Remaining''': Lists all the remaining records to be processed
*'''Total''': Lists all the records included in the processing (those that have been processed successfully, those for which warnings or errors have occurred, and those that need to be processed)

By default, these tabs are closed. You can expand each of these tabs to open the details of the processed documents. In the screenshot below, the '''Processed''' tab is expanded (1), and the '''Errors''' tab is closed (2).[anchor|#_cd7ac773-e4e1-48f7-9e1c-413f83d84fc9][anchor|#_746bc874-eef3-4576-aa6a-7f395b8a3f66][image:InterfaceGuide/Images/UIG_NewUI_LongRunningProcess_Tabs.png|popup|Status of the tabs|250px]
When you open any tab, the system displays a table with a list of processed records. The records in the lists of the tabs can have links. If you click a link in the list, the system opens the related record on the appropriate form in a new browser tab. 
==The Results of the Process Running and Cancellation==
When the processing of the records finishes, the system displays the results of the processing, whether it has been successful or unsuccessful. The following screenshot shows the Processing pop-up window when the processing has been successful.[anchor|#_cf0a5d4b-58dc-4063-b0ba-84ca71c6d1a3][anchor|#_da646989-615a-42e4-81da-e55b44e3b01c][image:InterfaceGuide/Images/UIG_NewUI_LongRunningProcess_Successfull_Process.png|popup|Processing pop-up window with successful results|450px]
Progress area informs you that the processing of the records has been completed and displays the time this process has taken. If the overall process was successful but there some errors or warnings in the records, the system will display the ''Process completed with errors'' or ''Process completed with warnings'' message, respectively. Tabs area sorts the records by statuses and provides details of these records. {br}

While the system is preparing the records for processing or processing of the records, if an error occurs that is not directly connected with any record, the system will stop the processing and display the following error: ''An error occurred while initializing processing. Show error message''. To know what is the reason of the failed processing, you can click the ''Show error message'' link in the error message. The system will display the error message, as illustrated in the following screenshot. Error messages are unique to each process.[anchor|#_aa03665b-eb1c-488f-9ab8-ab9a0b606342][anchor|#_96889096-bc1f-445b-a00a-12f73198961e][image:InterfaceGuide/Images/UIG_NewUI_LongRunningProcess_Error_Message.png|popup|Processing pop-up window with an error |450px]
If you need to stop the processing of the records, you can click the '''Cancel Processing''' button. When you click this button, the system opens the '''Confirmation''' dialog box, which asks you to confirm that you want to stop processing the records. If you click '''Yes''', the system will prevent the processing of the remaining records and the '''Processing''' pop-up window will have a similar appearance to that of the window displayed in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_10b1eac7-48e4-4118-a749-c7b681f69fda][anchor|#_bf2fdcf0-7428-474b-8287-a566040fd111][image:InterfaceGuide/Images/UIG_NewUI_LongRunningProcess_Cancelled_Process.png|popup|Processing pop-up window after the process has been canceled|450px]

As you work, you may need to adjust layouts of tables to suite your needs; typical operations are discussed below.
==Switching Between Form View and Grid View ==
On data entry forms, tables can be presented in the following views:[anchor|#ul_igt_zl4_xk]
*'''Grid View''': This is a standard tabular view, with all details arranged in a table and each row representing one detail or document row, as shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#image_aqv_mxd_33][image:InterfaceGuide/Images/Details_table_Grid_view.png|popup|Table in grid view|440px]
*'''Form View''': With the form view (shown in the following screenshot), you see a set of elements intended for only one detail or document row, and you use the navigation buttons (in the lower left corner of the form) to move from one row of the table to another.[anchor|#image_lkw_4xd_33][image:InterfaceGuide/Images/Details_table_Form_view.png|popup|Table in form view|440px]

To switch between these two views, do the following:[anchor|#ul_av2_vmf_ps]
*Click '''Switch Between Grid and Form''' ([image:InterfaceGuide/Images/Icons_Form_Grid_Views.png|Table in form view|12px]) on the table toolbar.

==Changing the Table Layout==
You can adjust any table to meet your information needs. Adjustments that you make to a table affect only your user account and are not visible to other users.{br}

You can fine-tune the table in the following ways:[anchor|#ul_jzf_5p1_zq]
*Hide or display columns, as described in [HelpRoot_Interface\Tables__how_Hide_columns|To Hide or Display Table Columns]
*Adjust the column width, as described in [HelpRoot_Interface\Tables__how_Adjust_width|To Adjust Column Widths]
*Change the order of columns, as described in [HelpRoot_Interface\Tables__how_Change_column_order|To Change the Order of Columns]

When you make any of these changes, the table will display them immediately, and the system will save them automatically.{br}

The '''Column Configuration''' dialog box, which is used to adjust the table, is described in [HelpRoot_Interface\TB__con_Table_Rows_and_Columns#_2f357643-1a28-4e29-a8da-17a4f668121e|Column Configuration Dialog Box].{br}

If your user account is assigned the ''Administrator'' role you can set default column configuration for all users of the system and configure table layouts for particular users, as described in [HelpRoot_Interface\UIG__con_Default_Table_Layout|Default Table Layout and Accessibility].

Your organization may have specific requirements for processing documents in Acumatica ERP, which can be reflected in the table layout on particular forms. If your user account is assigned the ''Administrator'' role in Acumatica ERP, you can set the default column configuration for all users of the system or configure table layouts for particular users, as described in this topic.
==Setting and Changing the Default Table Layout==
You can configure the required table layout (such as the order of columns and the set of columns to be displayed) and set this configuration as the new default layout, while logged in to a user account that has the ''Administrator'' role. After you have set the new default layout for a particular table, the system applies this layout to the following users:[anchor|#_479acbc6-63d1-4fa3-854d-736566f784f4]
*All new users added to the system after you set the default layout
*All existing users who haven&rsquo;t changed the default layout

If users have personalized layouts of a particular table, you can override their table settings with these default settings.[anchor|#_51f3cab5-9c03-4c21-9570-db6a058a5d67]
==Setting the Accessibility of the Table Columns==
For each table of a data entry or mass processing form, you can identify the accessibility of the column cells by using the '''Column Configuration''' dialog box. In the '''Selected Columns''' list of this dialog box, the system displays the columns that are visible on the table. These table columns may look like those in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_1823e0da-956d-4dc6-8595-bcd3ad2be910][anchor|#_c0daba33-965f-42e3-94d5-fa792f7e2316][image:Shared/Images/GS_UI_Tab_Buttons_Visibility.png|popup|Accessibility of the column cells|250px][anchor|#_61b54112-1b80-499f-9470-af00ca8ce091]
*[image:Shared/Images/GS_UI_Tab_Button.png|Accessibility of the column cells]: Indicates that the column is accessible through a keyboard. This button is not visible by default and appears only when you point at the column name.
*[image:Shared/Images/GS_UI_Tab_Button_Strikethrough.png|Accessibility of the column cells]: Indicates that the column is not accessible through a keyboard. If accessibility for a column has been turned off, this button is visible by default and stays visible when you point at the column name. The system skips this column when the user selects the Tab key on the keyboard.

To change the state of the accessibility of a column, in the '''Selected Columns''' list of the dialog box, you point at the column name and click the '''Tab''' or [anchor|#_7a50548f-eb25-4e02-8d6a-5a979a287d18][image:Shared/Images/GS_UI_Tab_Button_Strikethrough.png|Accessibility of the column cells] button, which appears.{br}

By default, changes in the column configuration are applied to the current user account. However, a user with administrative access to the system can configure the column accessibility and share its configuration with specific users in the system or make it the default configuration for all users.
==Configuring Table Layouts and Accessibility Settings for Particular Users==
If particular users have specific requirements for the table layout and accessibility on a form, you can set up the required configuration while logged in to a user account that has the ''Administrator'' role, and you can then apply this configuration to these users only. These users will see this table configuration when they navigate to the form, but other users will not. Users can change this default table configuration at any time. To configure the layout and accessibility settings of a table or multiple tables on a form for particular users, you do the following:[anchor|#_5eeacc86-70f6-4c19-a0e6-b4063e73777b]
#You navigate to the form and configure the layout and accessibility settings required by users of the table or tables on the form.
#On the form title bar, you click '''Help''' > '''Share Column Configuration'''. The '''Share Column Configuration''' dialog box is opened. (For a description of the dialog box, see [HelpRoot_Interface\Form_Title_Bar#_a54385c8-f301-4412-8594-405f3ea1cc44|Share Column Configuration Dialog Box].)
#In the dialog box, you do the following:
##On Page 1, you select the table or tables you have configured.
##On Page 2, you clear the '''Set as the Default''' check box.
##In the Users table of Page 2, you select the users to which you want to apply the table layout. If these users are all assigned a particular role, in the '''User Role''' box, you can select this role to filter the list of users in the list and then select the needed users.

If accessibility for a column has been turned                     off, this button is visible by default and stays visible when you point at the                     column name. The system skips this column when the user selects the Tab key on                     the keyboard. To change the state of the accessibility of a column, in the  Selected                     Columns  list of the dialog box, you point at the column name and                 click the  Tab  or   button, which appears. By default, changes in the column configuration are applied to the current user                 account. However, a user with administrative access to the system can configure the                 column accessibility and share its configuration with specific users in the system                 or make it the default configuration for all users. Configuring Table Layouts and Accessibility Settings for Particular Users If particular users have specific requirements for the table layout and accessibility on a         form, you can set up the required configuration while logged in to a user account that has         the  Administrator  role, and you can then apply this configuration to these users         only. These users will see this table configuration when they navigate to the form, but         other users will not. Users can change this default table configuration at any time. To         configure the layout and accessibility settings of a table or multiple tables on a form for         particular users, you do the following: You navigate to the form and configure the layout and accessibility settings required by           users of the table or tables on the form. On the form title bar, you click  Help Share Column Configuration . The  Share Column Configuration  dialog box is           opened. (For a description of the dialog box, see  Share Column Configuration Dialog Box.) In the dialog box, you do the following: On Page 1, you select the table or tables you have configured. On Page 2, you clear the  Set as the Default  check box. In the Users table of Page 2, you select the users to which you want to apply the               table layout. If these users are all assigned a particular role, in the                  User Role  box, you can select this role to filter the list of               users in the list and then select the needed users. ]]></column>

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[To Change the Order of Columns As you work, you might want to change the order of columns so that the information is grouped to                     better fit your work and preferences. For example, you might want to make                     particular columns adjacent or move to the left the columns you consider the                     most important. To rearrange the layout of columns in a table, you can use one of the following ways, described in detail below: On the form, drag a column to a new position Use the Column Configuration dialog box To Move Columns on the Form Drag the column header to the desired position. Note the red arrows, which                         indicate the exact position where you can drop the column between two other                         columns. Repeat this step for each column you want to move. These changes are saved automatically by the system, that is, when you open the                     table in the future you will see this change. To Move Columns by Using Column Configuration Dialog Box In the table, click the Column Configuration button ( ) to open the  Column                             Configuration  dialog box. To shift a column to the left in the table, do the following: In the  Selected Columns  list, click the                                 column you want to move. Click the Move Up ( ) button to move the column                                 one position to the left. Repeat the previous substep until the column is in the appropriate                                 place. To shift a column to the right in the table, do the following: In the  Selected Columns  list, select the                                 column you want to move. Click the Move Down ( ) button to move the column                                 one position to the right. Repeat the previous substep until the column is in the appropriate                                 place. Click  OK  to save the layout changes. To Restore the Default Table Layout Click the Column Configuration button ( ). In the bottom left of the  Column Configuration  dialog box, click                              Reset to Default . All the changes that you have previously made to the table layout will be                     reset. ]]></column>

As you work, you may need to perform specific operations with tables; typical operations are discussed below.{br}

For instructions on adjusting table layout, see [HelpRoot_Interface\Details_Table_Using|Adjusting Table Layout].
==Selecting Objects in the Table==
Some forms have a Select column (with a check box as a header) that you can use to select objects from the table:[anchor|#ul_ijv_4l4_xk]
*To select particular objects, click the check box in the Selected column for each object.
*To select all objects displayed on the current page of the table, click the Selected check box in the column header.

==Using Simple Filters and Sorting==
You might find it helpful to narrow the range and rearrange the order of displayed objects before selecting particular ones. You use the simple filters by selecting the appropriate options in the menu that appears when you click any column header in any table in the system. You can find the detailed procedures in [HelpRoot_Interface\Filter_how_Using_Column_Filters|To Filter the Data in a Table].{br}

You can also use filters to add tabs with only the data you want to see. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Interface\IB_Filters|Filters].
==Attaching Files to Record Details==
In Acumatica ERP, files can be attached to any detail of a record (that is, an object, entity, or document created by using a form). A record detail is a particular row in the record that a user has added by using the data entry form. You can attach different files, such as images in various formats, scanned documents, and internal instructions for employees.((({S:Warn}Files can also be attached to records. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Interface\Attaching_Files_to_Forms_and_Records|To Attach a File to a Record].
)))
You can easily manage and track files and images attached to Acumatica ERP records and record details for various purposes. For more information on managing attached files, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__mng_File_Attachements|Managing Attached Files] in the Acumatica ERP System Administration Guide and [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS_Working_With_Data_Entry_Forms_Mapref|Working with Data Entry Forms] and [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS_Importing_Exporting_to_Excel_XML|Importing and Exporting Data to Excel and XML] in the Acumatica ERP Getting Started Guide.
==Attaching Notes to Record Details==
In Acumatica ERP, a record is an object, entity, or document created by using a form. A record is a particular row in the record, and you can attach text notes to any record detail. By using these notes, you can communicate key information about the record detail to other users.((({S:Warn}Notes can also be attached to records.

==To Set Up a Filter on Table Columns==[anchor|#_31e48427-e5ca-4419-a7fc-7e31052e81b7]
#Open the form with the table for which you want to set up a filter on table columns.
#In the table, do one of the following:
#*Click the header of the column whose values you want to filter.
#*If the '''Drag column header here to configure filter''' box of the filtering area is available above the table (which indicates that you are viewing a generic inquiry form), drag the header of the column whose values you want to filter to this part of the filtering area and click the button that is added to the filtering area once you drop the header there.
#If you want to filter data in a column with a fixed set of options (such as '''Status'''), in the dialog box that has opened, select the required values.
#If you want to filter data in a column with unlimited number of values (such as '''Vendor'''), do the following: 
#*In the dialog box that has opened, select the filter condition from the list of available conditions. The available conditions (such as '''Contains''', '''Equals''', '''Does Not Equal''', '''Is Null''', '''Is Not Null''' or '''Is Empty''') depend on the data type of the column.
#*In the box at the bottom of the dialog box, type the filter value (if needed).
#Click '''OK''' to apply the filter.

Now the table displays only the rows that satisfy the terms of the filter. The column header is highlighted and displays the filter icon ([anchor|#_10618b8d-1a29-4c18-b6fd-cabcd6a21209][image:Shared/Images/filter_icon_filter.png|16px]). If the table is on a generic inquiry form, a button is added to the filtering area and displays the column name and filtering value.{br}

You can set up filters for any number of table columns. If you set up filters for multiple columns, the system displays only the rows that satisfy the terms of all filters.
==To Filter Data by a Selected Cell Value==
You can filter the data in a table on an inquiry or processing form by a value of any cell that you select as follows:[anchor|#_cdd02255-1417-42a7-a1de-7abc31f8d8fa]
#Open the form with the table for which you want to set up filtering by a cell value.
#In the table, right-click the cell that contains the value by which you want to filter the data, and click '''Filter by This Cell Value'''.

As a result, the table displays only the rows for which this column contains this value. The column header is highlighted and displays the filter icon ([anchor|#_37d024d7-e67d-4baf-abce-1958367ef1d8][image:Shared/Images/filter_icon_filter.png|16px]). If the table is on a generic inquiry form, a button is added to the filtering area and displays the column name and filtering value.((({S:Warn}You can also apply this filter by clicking the required cell and pressing SHIFT+F. 
)))[anchor|#_f44eb314-c349-4b11-ae5e-f96643d9d854]
==To Clear a Filter==
On the form with the table for which you want to clear a simple or quick filter, do one of the following:[anchor|#_8a233aa5-60af-4d47-ac5d-fde5d1cb7148]
*If there is a button with the filter in the filtering area, drag the button to the table.
*In the table, click the header of the column for which you want to clear the filter, and do one of the following:
**If you filtered data in a column with fixed set of options, click '''Select All''' and then click '''OK'''.
**If you filtered data in a column with unlimited number of values, click '''Clear Filter'''.

==To Turn On Column Sorting==[anchor|#_efe05c6d-d37b-4f9d-8ab0-c9fa2ef1c33c]
#Open the form with the table for which you want to set up column sorting.
#In the table, click the header of the column whose values you want to sort.
#In the dialog box, select the sorting order—ascending (that is, A to Z for text, lowest to highest for numbers, or newest to latest for dates) or descending (that is, Z to A for text, highest to lowest for numbers, or latest to newest for dates).

The column header displays the ascending ([anchor|#_455cc286-4b9b-4564-8c23-7e20186e16b3][image:Shared/Images/filter_icon_ascending.png|16px]) or descending ([anchor|#_f3543dff-ac50-490a-8615-f24da3e0ab2a][image:Shared/Images/filter_icon_descending.png|16px]) sorting icon.((({S:Warn}You can turn on sorting for only one column in a table at a time.

You can also apply this filter by clicking the required cell and pressing                     SHIFT+F.  To Clear a Filter On the form with the table for which you want to clear a simple or quick filter,                     do one of the following: If there is a button with the filter in the filtering area, drag the button                         to the table. In the table, click the header of the column for which you want to clear the                         filter, and do one of the following: If you filtered data in a column with fixed set of options, click                                      Select All  and then click                                      OK . If you filtered data in a column with unlimited number of values,                                 click  Clear Filter . To Turn On Column Sorting Open the form with the table for which you want to set up column sorting. In the table, click the header of the column whose values you want to sort. In the dialog box, select the sorting order—ascending (that is, A to Z for text, lowest to                         highest for numbers, or newest to latest for dates) or descending (that is,                         Z to A for text, highest to lowest for numbers, or latest to newest for                         dates).

Tabs and panes on the calendar boards and maps contain tables on the calendar boards and maps display relevant objects or details in each row and a key setting of the object or detail in each column. The forms provide interaction between the tables and the calendar or map (such as when a service order is dragged to the appropriate day and time on the calendar). {br}

The table toolbar may have elements (boxes and buttons) you can use to filter the information that is displayed in the table. Also, the table footer may have navigation elements you can use if not all table rows can be viewed at the same time.{br}

The following screenshot show examples of tables and their toolbars. The left table shows a list of service orders (which spans multiple pages, as the table footer illustrates), and the right lists routes.[anchor|#_9df2a800-e719-4fc0-a54b-f2a1a8281f06][anchor|#image_e4g_n5s_cx][image:InterfaceGuide/Images/UIG_CAlendar_Tables.png|popup|A table on a calendar and on a map|400px][anchor|#_29906405-a955-435a-863e-035d9da7dd07]

When you generate a report, you can configure an ad hoc filter for the report data, as described in this topic. For details on filter clauses, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__con_Creating_Advanced_Filters|Creation of Advanced and Ad Hoc Filters].
==To Configure an Ad Hoc Filter on a Report Form==[anchor|#_ecfd83b6-3332-4f61-9bd5-6a0b24c3e7c7]
#Open the report form, and then click the '''Additional Sort and Filter''' tab.
#In the '''Additional Filtering Conditions''' table, click '''Add Row''' to create a filter clause. (An ad hoc filter may consist of one filter clause, represented by one row, or multiple filter clauses, represented by multiple rows.)
#In the '''Property''' column, select the entity type associated with the report from the list.
#In the '''Condition''' column, select the logical operation that will be applied to the value of the selected property.
#In the '''Value''' column, type the value for the logical condition used to filter the data.
#If the logical operation you selected in the '''Condition''' column requires the second value, type it in the '''Second Value''' column.
#Repeat Steps 2-6 for each filter clause in this ad hoc filter.
#If you want to join any of the filter clauses, do the following:
#*In the leftmost '''Brackets''' column of the first clause that should be joined, select the opening bracket or brackets. (The number of opening brackets in the first clause depends on the number of nested clauses.)
#*In the '''Operator''' column of the same clause, select the logical operator that will be used to join the clauses.
#*In the rightmost '''Brackets''' column of the last clause that should be joint, select the closing bracket or brackets. (The number of closing brackets in the first clause depends on the number of nested clauses and should be equal to the number of opening brackets in the first clause that is joint.)
#To apply the filter, be sure the other settings on the report form have the values you need, and click '''Run Report'''.

In Acumatica ERP, a ''dashboard'' is a collection of widgets that are displayed on a single page and are designed to give you needed information at a glance. A ''widget'' is a small component that delivers a particular type of information that you view or manage by using Acumatica ERP. From the dashboard, you can click any widget to further explore the information it contains. The page that displays the collection of widgets is referred to as a ''dashboard page''.{br}

Dashboards may serve different purposes, and if you have appropriate permissions, you can create dashboards that display information from a variety of sources, including Acumatica ERP inquiry forms, wiki articles, and even external pages. If the source of the information shown on the dashboard is an Acumatica ERP inquiry form, the data from the form can be displayed in various types of charts and tables, with the data filtered to meet the particular selection criteria according to your needs.{br}

In this topic, you can find information about the supported types of widgets.
==Types of Widgets==
The following types of widgets can be added to the dashboards: [anchor|#ul_br3_tl2_tp]
*'''Charts''': Graphical representations of data from Acumatica ERP forms. You can use charts of various types, such as bar charts and line charts. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Interface\DB__con_Charts|Chart Widgets].
*'''Data tables''': Data from an Acumatica ERP form arranged into rows and columns. For details, see [HelpRoot_Interface\DB__con_Tables|Data Table Widgets].
*'''Embedded pages''': Documents or images that are stored on external resources, such as cloud storage, and should be displayed on an Acumatica ERP dashboard. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Interface\DB__con_Embedded_Page|Embedded Page Widgets].
*'''Headers''': Titles of widget sections. For details, see [HelpRoot_Interface\DB__con_Header|Header Widgets].
*'''Pivot tables''': Data tables organized to filter, sort, count, total, or give the average of data from an Acumatica ERP generic inquiry, displaying the summarized results in a separate table. For details, see [HelpRoot_Interface\DB__con_Pivot_Tables|Pivot Table Widgets].
*'''Power BI tiles''': Charts, scorecards, and other analytical information that is represented on Power BI dashboards designed by your organization. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Interface\DB__con_PowerBI|Power BI Tile Widgets].
*'''Scorecard KPIs''': Parameters that are important for the business processes of your organization and that should be monitored on a daily basis. For details, see [HelpRoot_Interface\DB__con_Scorecard|Scorecard KPI Widgets].
*'''Trend card KPIs''': Parameters whose dynamic change is important for business processes of your organization. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Interface\DB__con_Trend_Card|Trend Card KPI Widgets].
*'''Wiki pages''': Reference articles, procedures, business plans, and other content that is frequently referenced by users of Acumatica ERP. For details, see [HelpRoot_Interface\DB__con_Articles|Wiki Page Widgets].

For more information on managing widgets, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS_Personalizing_Dashboards_Mapref|Personalizing Dashboards] in the Acumatica ERP Getting Started Guide.[anchor|#_aa442e0a-c69a-4b44-b00d-0cfda7f6864d]
==Cashing of Dashboard Widgets==
When a dashboard with many widgets is refreshed or opened, it may take a lot of time to load data for all widgets. Dashboard widgets can display information that is updated very frequently (such as every five minutes) or very rarely (such as once a week). You, as a dashboard designer, can manage the interval at which the system refreshes data for each widget. {br}

You can specify the interval at which the system refreshes data or switch off caching by using the '''Refresh Data''' box of the '''Widget Properties''' dialog box for any type of widget.{br}

After a dashboard designer specifies the refresh interval for a widget, the system loads the widget data from the database and caches the data when a user opens the dashboard with the widget for the first time. When the dashboard is reopened or the dashboard page is refreshed, by the user, the system displays the data on the widget from the cache (that is, does not load the data from the database) if the data was updated a shorter time ago than the interval specified in the '''Refresh Data''' box.{br}

To switch off caching for a particular widget and make the system to update widget&rsquo;s data each time a dashboard is opened or refreshed, the dashboard designer should select the ''Always'' option in the '''Refresh Data''' box for the widget.{br}

A user can view information about how much time has passed since the last update of a widget’s data in the pop-up pane that appears when the user points to the widget (as shown in the following screenshot). The user can manually update the widget data by clicking this pane.[anchor|#_826a7153-47c2-4d44-a17e-ef98fb76e026][anchor|#_0fd30715-7dbc-4c42-8601-eca27b91ae0b][image:Shared/Images/UI_Caching_Dashboard_Widgets_Last_Updated.png|popup|Date and time of the last update of the widget&rsquo;s data|300px]

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Dashboards and Widgets In  Acumatica ERP, a  dashboard  is a collection of widgets that are displayed on a single                 page and are designed to give you needed information at a glance. A  widget  is                 a small component that delivers a particular type of information that you view or                 manage by using  Acumatica ERP. From the dashboard, you can click any widget to further explore the information                 it contains. The page that displays the collection of widgets is referred to as a                      dashboard page . Dashboards may serve different purposes, and if you have appropriate permissions, you                 can create dashboards that display information from a variety of sources, including                      Acumatica ERP inquiry forms, wiki articles, and even external pages. If the source of the                 information shown on the dashboard is an  Acumatica ERP inquiry form, the data from the form can be displayed in various types of charts                 and tables, with the data filtered to meet the particular selection criteria                 according to your needs. In this topic, you can find information about the supported types of widgets. Types of Widgets The following types of widgets can be added to the dashboards:  Charts : Graphical representations of data from  Acumatica ERP forms. You can use charts of various types, such as bar charts and line                     charts. For more information, see  Chart Widgets. Data tables : Data from an  Acumatica ERP form arranged into rows and columns. For details, see  Data Table Widgets. Embedded pages : Documents or images that are stored on external                     resources, such as cloud storage, and should be displayed on an  Acumatica ERP dashboard. For more information, see  Embedded Page Widgets. Headers : Titles of widget sections. For details, see  Header Widgets. Pivot tables : Data tables organized to filter, sort, count, total, or                     give the average of data from an  Acumatica ERP generic inquiry, displaying the summarized results in a separate table. For                     details, see  Pivot Table Widgets. Power BI tiles : Charts, scorecards, and other analytical information that                     is represented on Power BI dashboards designed by your organization. For more                     information, see  Power BI Tile Widgets. Scorecard KPIs : Parameters that are important for the business processes                     of your organization and that should be monitored on a daily basis. For details,                     see  Scorecard KPI Widgets. Trend card KPIs : Parameters whose dynamic change is important for                     business processes of your organization. For more information, see  Trend Card KPI Widgets. Wiki pages : Reference articles, procedures, business plans, and other                     content that is frequently referenced by users of  Acumatica ERP. For details, see  Wiki Page Widgets. For more information on managing widgets, see  Personalizing Dashboards in the  Acumatica ERP Getting Started Guide. Cashing of Dashboard Widgets When a dashboard with many widgets is refreshed or opened, it may take a lot of time to load data for all widgets. Dashboard widgets can display information that is updated very frequently (such as every five minutes) or very rarely (such as once a week). You, as a dashboard designer, can manage the interval at which the system refreshes data for each widget.  You can specify the interval at which the system refreshes data or switch off caching by using the  Refresh Data  box of the  Widget Properties  dialog box for any type of widget. After a dashboard designer specifies the refresh interval for a widget, the system                 loads the widget data from the database and caches the data when a user opens the                 dashboard with the widget for the first time. When the dashboard is reopened or the                 dashboard page is refreshed, by the user, the system displays the data on the widget                 from the cache (that is, does not load the data from the database) if the data was                 updated a shorter time ago than the interval specified in the  Refresh                     Data  box. To switch off caching for a particular widget and make the system to update widget's                 data each time a dashboard is opened or refreshed, the dashboard designer should                 select the  Always  option in the  Refresh Data  box for                 the widget. A user can view information about how much time has passed since the last update of a                 widget’s data in the pop-up pane that appears when the user points to the widget (as                 shown in the following screenshot). The user can manually update the widget data by                 clicking this pane. Date and time of the last update of the widget's data ]]></column>

You can use various types of charts, which are graphical representations of data, as widgets on dashboards. If it is well designed, a chart can convey ideas, such as trends or comparisons, that might not be apparent if the data were shown in a table or presented as text. {br}

When you use a chart, be careful about its design because poor choices can yield a distorted picture of the data and the relationships it represents. Carefully select the chart type for the data you wish to display. Charts are most effective when the number of data points displayed gives the viewer a clear picture of the underlying information. Some charts, such as line charts, work well with numerous data points, while others, such as doughnut charts, better convey information if you use fewer data points. {br}

In Acumatica ERP, you can add the following types of charts to your dashboards: [anchor|#ul_fqd_rpw_jk]
*Doughnut chart
*Line chart
*Column chart
*Stacked column chart
*Bar chart
*Bar stacked chart
*Funnel chart

You can easily change the type of a particular chart without changing its properties, such as chart axis values or sort order, as long as the data requirements for both charts are equivalent. For example, you can create a line chart widget and later convert this widget to another chart type with just a couple of clicks. {br}

The next sections describe the types of charts that you can add to dashboards, as well as the actions that you can perform with each type.
==Doughnut Chart==
A doughnut chart is a circular chart (with a hole extracted from the middle) divided into sectors or parts that illustrate proportion. This type of chart works best when you want to show how the parts relate to the whole at a fixed point in time. Although a doughnut chart is visually appealing, it is seldom the best chart to use when you want to compare the parts to one another. Also, a doughnut chart is not designed to show changes over time. {br}

To define a doughnut chart, do the following: 
#Select the category—such as customer name, financial period, or cash account—that will be displayed as individual sectors on the doughnut. In the following doughnut chart, the ''Customer Name'' is the category.
#Select one measurable entity (such as total sales, beginning balance, or total payments) that will define the size of the sectors. In the following doughnut chart, the ''Invoiced Item'' is the measurable entity. 

The following doughnut chart demonstrates the top six customers ('''ACCOUNT''' in the widget shown below) by period-to-date purchases ('''INVOICED ITEMS'''). Each section represents a portion of the total amount of customer purchases.[anchor|#image_ury_jvx_r3][image:InterfaceGuide/Images/DB__con_Chart_Widget_Doughnut.png|popup|Doughnut chart|200px]
The chart legend can be opened as a pop-up window or located on the widget near the chart.{br}

When you are viewing a chart legend, you can perform the following actions:[anchor|#ul_qbd_phy_r3]
*Point to the desired legend item to view its details on the chart.
*Click a legend item to exclude the associated sector from the chart. The share of the excluded sector is then proportionally distributed among the remaining sectors on the chart.

With a widget of a doughnut chart, you can do the following:
*Open the form used by this chart as the data source
*Drill down to the details of a particular chart sector
*Update the chart view
*View the chart legend
*Highlight particular sectors on the chart
*Exclude particular sectors from the chart
*View details of particular sectors on the chart

If you have permissions to edit the dashboard, you have the following additional capabilities:[anchor|#_2ed1037d-bf18-4f09-ac4a-b982d3a94291]
*Convert the chart to another chart type
*Change the properties of the chart
{br}

For a detailed description of how to add a doughnut chart, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\DB__how_Adding_a_Doughnut_Chart|To Add a Doughnut Chart].
==Line Chart==
A line chart is a type of chart that displays information as a series of data points connected by straight line segments. Line charts can be especially valuable when you want to plot some type of data over time, such as by financial period. {br}

To define a line chart, do the following: 
#Select one entity to provide the horizontal axis values, such as financial period. In the following line chart, the ''Financial Period'' is displayed on the horizontal axis. 
#Select a measurable entity to provide the vertical axis values, such as total sales, pending balance, or beginning balance. In the following line chart, the ''Salesperson Sales'' is the measurable entity.
#Optional: Select an entity, such as branch or salesperson, to display its values as separate lines on the same chart (series). In the following line chart, the ''Salesperson Name'' is the series. You can customize line colors for particular values.

The following line chart shows sales values by financial period. The horizontal axis entity is the financial period, and the vertical axis entity is the sales amount. Each line on the chart corresponds to a salesperson. [anchor|#_fd2d52ee-7e53-41bd-ab6d-809c6138bc62][anchor|#_f5f354c1-4f5c-42ed-bc8c-450c10381af8][image:InterfaceGuide/Images/DB__con_Chart_Widget_Line2.png|popup|Line chart with multiple lines|200px]{br}

With a line chart widget, you can do the following:[anchor|#_54ae266d-1a34-4411-b96c-6620333a2d6d]
*Open the form used by this chart as the data source
*Drill down to the details of a particular line point
*Update the chart view
*View the details of the data points of the chart
*Zoom in on particular segments of the chart (for details see [HelpRoot_Interface\DB__how_Zoom_In_Out_Line_Chart|To Zoom In on and Out of a Chart Region])
{br}

If you have permissions to edit the dashboard, you have the following additional capabilities:[anchor|#_d581a410-1b9c-4884-9d83-70fc525b535b]
*Convert the chart to another chart type
*Change the properties of the chart.
{br}

For a detailed description of how to add a line chart, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\DB__how_Adding_a_Line_Chart|To Add a Line Chart].
==Column Chart==
A column chart is a chart with bars whose lengths are proportional to the values they represent. Column charts are used for plotting data that has discrete values. They are generally a better choice than doughnut charts when you want to show how parts compare to one another, because it is easier for the viewer to estimate the relative column height than to assess the size of doughnut chart sectors. {br}

To define a column chart, do the following: 
#Select one entity to provide the horizontal axis values, such as customer ID, vendor ID, financial period, or cash account. In the following column chart, the ''Customer Name'' is the displayed on the horizontal axis.
#Select a measurable entity to provide the vertical axis values, such as total sales, pending balance, or beginning balance. In the following column chart, the ''Salesperson Sales'' is the measurable entity.
#Optional: Select an entity, such as branch, to display its values as separate columns for each value on the horizontal axis (series). In the following column chart with series, the ''Salesperson Name'' is the series. You can customize column colors for particular values.

The following chart represents sales values calculated for salespersons. The horizontal axis entity is the salesperson name, and the vertical axis entity is the sales amount.[anchor|#image_a1f_zvx_r3][image:InterfaceGuide/Images/DB__con_Chart_Widget_Column.png|popup|Column chart|200px]
The column chart in the following screenshot shows sales amounts for salespersons divided by financial period. The sales amount for each salesperson is displayed as a separate column within each financial period.[anchor|#_6ba8d577-47e8-4b57-a030-7df817d37626][anchor|#_b7111f8c-e12e-45de-aaac-ba85bc1047cc][image:InterfaceGuide/Images/DB__con_Chart_Widget_Column2.png|popup|Column chart with series|200px]{br}

With a widget based on a column chart, you can do the following:[anchor|#_34df6e92-2d0b-4544-bf7c-42a672231ad6]
*Open the form used by this chart as the data source
*Drill down to the details of a particular column
*Update the chart view
*View details of chart columns
*Zoom in on particular regions of the chart (for details see [HelpRoot_Interface\DB__how_Zoom_In_Out_Line_Chart|To Zoom In on and Out of a Chart Region])
{br}

If you have permissions to edit the dashboard, you have the following additional capabilities:[anchor|#_86165fa8-0ae2-44bc-bc90-6ab448b6e8d5]
*Convert the chart to another chart type
*Change the properties of the chart
{br}

For a detailed description of how to add a column chart, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\DB__how_Adding_a_Column_Chart|To Add a Column Chart].
==Stacked Column Chart==
A stacked column chart illustrates the relationship of the parts to the whole. The columns in a stacked column chart are divided into legend categories, and each column represents a total. {br}

To define a stacked column chart, do the following: 
#Select the entity to provide the horizontal axis values, such as financial period or account class. In the following stacked column chart, the ''Financial Period'' is displayed on the horizontal axis.
#Select a measurable entity, such as sales total, debit total, credit total, ending balance, or beginning balance. In the following stacked column chart, the ''Invoiced Items'' is the measurable entity.
#Select an entity, such as customer ID, vendor ID, currency ID, or account type, to be displayed as column sectors (series). In the following stacked column chart, the ''Customer Name'' is the series. You can customize sector colors for particular values.

The following chart shows the contribution of individual customers to the monthly sales totals ('''INVOICED ITEMS''') over time. The horizontal axis defines the financial periods within the specified time range, and the vertical axis defines the measurable entity—period-to-date sales totals in the base currency. [image:InterfaceGuide/Images/DB__con_Chart_Widget_Stacked_Column.png|popup|Stacked column chart|200px]
With a widget of a stacked column chart, you can do the following:[anchor|#_0dafadfb-933e-4a00-a124-64f59809ca77]
*Open the form used by this chart as the data source
*Drill down to the details of a particular column sector
*Update the chart view
*View details of the chart columns
*Zoom in on particular regions of the chart (for details see [HelpRoot_Interface\DB__how_Zoom_In_Out_Line_Chart|To Zoom In on and Out of a Chart Region])
{br}

If you have permissions to edit the dashboard, you have the following additional capabilities:[anchor|#_1a59a494-8ea6-486e-9b4b-cb0760034738]
*Convert the chart to another chart type
*Change the properties of the chart
{br}

For a detailed description of how to add a stacked column chart, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\DB__how_Adding_a_Stacked_Column_Chart|To Add a Stacked Column Chart].
==Bar Chart==
A bar chart is a chart with rectangular bars that are plotted horizontally and have lengths proportional to the values that they represent. Bar charts are used for clearly showing data that has discrete values. {br}

To define a bar chart, do the following: 
#Select a measurable entity to provide the horizontal axis values, such as total sales, pending balance, or beginning balance. In the following bar chart, the ''Salesperson Sales'' is the measurable entity.
#Select one entity to provide the vertical axis values, such as customer ID, vendor ID, financial period, or cash account. In the following bar chart, the ''Customer Name'' is the displayed on the vertical axis.
#Optional: Select an entity, such as branch, to display its values as separate bars for each value on the vertical axis (series). In the following bar chart with categories, the ''Salesperson Name'' is the series. You can customize bar colors for particular values.

The following bar chart displays sales values calculated for a selection of entities (salespersons). The horizontal axis entity is the total amount of period-to-date sales, and the vertical axis entity is the salesperson name.[anchor|#image_ery_mwx_r3][image:InterfaceGuide/Images/DB__con_Chart_Widget_Bar.png|popup|Bar chart|200px]
Another example of a bar chart, which you can see below, represents sales amounts, divided by salespersons, for each financial period. Sales amount for each salesperson is displayed as a separate bar within a financial period.[anchor|#_b5dfed6f-73a7-4aea-b031-eaae51695dca][anchor|#_1d5fb13c-beab-4d78-9fd2-b3305ef25e66][image:InterfaceGuide/Images/DB__con_Chart_Widget_Bar2.png|popup|Bar chart with series|200px]{br}

With a bar chart widget, you can do the following:[anchor|#_baae0d97-6678-49f7-9b01-d702f0b2394a]
*Open the form used by this chart as the data source
*Drill down to the details of a particular bar
*Update the chart view
*View details of the chart bars
*Zoom in on particular regions of the chart (for details see [HelpRoot_Interface\DB__how_Zoom_In_Out_Line_Chart|To Zoom In on and Out of a Chart Region])
{br}

If you have permissions to edit the dashboard, you have the following additional capabilities:[anchor|#_98a403b2-8e79-4554-ac4a-a6d471a4d3c7]
*Convert the chart to another chart type
*Change the properties of the chart
{br}

For a detailed description of how to add a bar chart, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\DB__how_Adding_a_Bar_Chart|To Add a Bar Chart].
==Stacked Bar Chart==
A stacked bar chart is an inverted stacked column chart in which the horizontal and vertical axes are reversed. A stacked bar chart also illustrates the relationship of the parts to the whole, and its bars are divided into legend categories, with each bar representing a total. {br}

To define a stacked bar chart, do the following: 
#Select a measurable entity to provide the horizontal axis values, such as sales total, debit total, credit total, ending balance, or beginning balance. In the following stacked bar chart, the ''Invoiced Items'' is the measurable entity.
#Select the category for the vertical axis, such as financial period or account class. In the following stacked bar chart, the ''Financial Period'' is displayed on the vertical axis.
#Select an entity, such as customer ID, vendor ID, currency ID, or account type, to be displayed as bar sectors (series). In the following stacked bar chart, the ''Customer Name'' is the series. You can customize sector colors for particular values.

The following chart shows the contribution of individual customers to the monthly sales totals over time. The vertical axis defines a series of financial periods within the specified time range, and the horizontal axis defines the measurable entity—period-to-date sales totals ('''INVOICED ITEMS'''). Each stacked bar represents the monthly sales total, with the parts of different colors indicating the different customers that contribute to the monthly total. [image:InterfaceGuide/Images/DB__con_Chart_Widget_Stacked_Bar.png|popup|Stacked bar chart|200px]
With a widget of a stacked bar chart, you can do the following: [anchor|#_1e2c7c13-81c2-4b0a-8924-3d4e976a2796]
*Open the form used by this chart as the data source
*Drill down to the details of a particular bar sector
*Update the chart view
*View details of chart bars
*Zoom in on particular regions of the chart (for details see [HelpRoot_Interface\DB__how_Zoom_In_Out_Line_Chart|To Zoom In on and Out of a Chart Region])
{br}

If you have permissions to edit the dashboard, you have the following additional capabilities:[anchor|#_2d1e9bf9-9b2d-4063-bd61-b57ff5e898f5]
*Convert the chart to another chart type
*Change the properties of the chart
{br}

For a detailed description of how to add a stacked bar chart, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\DB__how_Adding_a_Stacked_Bar_Chart|To Add a Stacked Bar Chart].
==Funnel Chart==
A funnel chart is a chart with no axes that shows sectors or slices of data in a funnel shape. Each slice represents a portion of the whole, or the slices may represent a process flow, with each slice (or part of the process) having data filtered out from the previous slice. For example, with a sales process, you could use a funnel chart, with each slice corresponding to a stage in the process and showing the amount of potential revenue.{br}

To define a funnel chart, do the following: [anchor|#_428c0d9c-6c85-4e28-8aa8-cd17e27d0634]
#Select the category—such as customer name, financial period, or cash account—that will be displayed as individual slice of the funnel. In the following funnel chart, the ''Customer Name'' is the category.
#Select one measurable entity (such as total sales, beginning balance, or total payments) that will define the size of the slices. In the following funnel chart, the ''Invoiced Item'' is the measurable entity.

The following funnel chart shows the top six customers ('''ACCOUNTS''') by period-to-date purchases ('''INVOICED ITEMS'''). Each slice represents a portion of the total amount of customer purchases.[anchor|#image_vkh_xwx_r3][image:InterfaceGuide/Images/DB__con_Chart_Widget_Funnel.png|popup|Funnel Chart|200px]
The chart legend can be opened as a pop-up window or located on the widget near the chart.{br}

When you are viewing a chart legend, you can perform the following actions:[anchor|#_ea2e5f52-31d2-45c1-9ce6-5d24a3b6099f]
*Point to the desired legend item to view its details on the chart.
*Click a legend item to exclude the associated slice from the chart. The share of the excluded slice is then proportionally distributed among the remaining slices on the chart.

With a funnel chart widget, you can do the following:[anchor|#_1f9c79e1-5d03-4ef0-80e1-b0699bc9939f]
*Open the form used by this chart as the data source
*Drill down to the details of a particular chart slice
*Update the chart view
*View the chart legend
*Highlight particular slices on the chart
*Exclude particular slices from the chart
*View details of particular slices on the chart
{br}

If you have permissions to edit the dashboard, you have the following additional capabilities:[anchor|#_d9b53437-1037-44a8-aee7-a3428a980825]
*Convert the chart to another chart type

Doughnut Chart A doughnut chart is a circular chart (with a hole extracted from the middle) divided                 into sectors or parts that illustrate proportion. This type of chart works best when                 you want to show how the parts relate to the whole at a fixed point in time.                 Although a doughnut chart is visually appealing, it is seldom the best chart to use                 when you want to compare the parts to one another. Also, a doughnut chart is not                 designed to show changes over time.  To define a doughnut chart, do the following:  Select the category—such as customer name, financial period, or cash                     account—that will be displayed as individual sectors on the doughnut. In                     the following doughnut chart, the  Customer Name  is the category. Select one measurable entity (such as total sales, beginning balance, or total                     payments) that will define the size of the sectors. In the following doughnut                     chart, the  Invoiced Item  is the measurable entity.  The following doughnut chart demonstrates the top six customers                     ( ACCOUNT  in the widget shown below) by period-to-date                 purchases ( INVOICED ITEMS ). Each section represents a portion                 of the total amount of customer purchases. Doughnut chart The chart legend can be opened as a pop-up window or located on the widget near the                 chart. When you are viewing a chart legend, you can perform the following actions: Point to the desired legend item to view its details on the chart. Click a legend item to exclude the associated sector from the chart. The share                     of the excluded sector is then proportionally distributed among the remaining                     sectors on the chart. With a widget of a doughnut chart, you can do the following: Open the form used by this chart as the data source Drill down to the details of a particular chart sector Update the chart view View the chart legend Highlight particular sectors on the chart Exclude particular sectors from the chart View details of particular sectors on the chart If you have permissions to edit the dashboard, you have the following additional                     capabilities: Convert the chart to another chart type Change the properties of the chart For a detailed description of how to add a doughnut chart, see  To Add a Doughnut Chart. Line Chart A line chart is a type of chart that displays information as a series of data points                 connected by straight line segments. Line charts can be especially valuable when you                 want to plot some type of data over time, such as by financial period.  To define a line chart, do the following:  Select one entity to provide the horizontal axis values, such as financial                     period. In the following line chart, the  Financial Period  is displayed on                     the horizontal axis.  Select a measurable entity to provide the vertical axis values, such as total                     sales, pending balance, or beginning balance. In the following line chart, the                          Salesperson Sales  is the measurable entity. Optional: Select an entity, such as branch or salesperson, to display its values                     as separate lines on the same chart (series). In the following line chart, the                          Salesperson Name  is the series. You can customize line colors for                     particular values. The following line chart shows sales values by financial period. The horizontal axis                 entity is the financial period, and the vertical axis entity is the sales amount.                 Each line on the chart corresponds to a salesperson.  Line chart with multiple lines With a line chart widget, you can do the following: Open the form used by this chart as the data source Drill down to the details of a particular line point Update the chart view View the details of the data points of the chart Zoom in on particular segments of the chart (for details see  To Zoom In on and Out of a Chart Region) If you have permissions to edit the dashboard, you have the following additional                     capabilities: Convert the chart to another chart type Change the properties of the chart. For a detailed description of how to add a line chart, see  To Add a Line Chart. Column Chart A column chart is a chart with bars whose lengths are proportional to the values they                 represent. Column charts are used for plotting data that has discrete values. They                 are generally a better choice than doughnut charts when you want to show how parts                 compare to one another, because it is easier for the viewer to estimate the relative                 column height than to assess the size of doughnut chart sectors.  To define a column chart, do the following:  Select one entity to provide the horizontal axis values, such as customer ID,                     vendor ID, financial period, or cash account. In the following column chart, the                          Customer Name  is the displayed on the horizontal axis. Select a measurable entity to provide the vertical axis values, such as total                     sales, pending balance, or beginning balance. In the following column chart, the                          Salesperson Sales  is the measurable entity. Optional: Select an entity, such as branch, to display its values as separate                     columns for each value on the horizontal axis (series). In the following column                     chart with series, the  Salesperson Name  is the series. You can customize                     column colors for particular values. The following chart represents sales values calculated for salespersons. The                 horizontal axis entity is the salesperson name, and the vertical axis entity is the                 sales amount. Column chart The column chart in the following screenshot shows sales amounts for salespersons                 divided by financial period. The sales amount for each salesperson is displayed as a                 separate column within each financial period. Column chart with series With a widget based on a column chart, you can do the following: Open the form used by this chart as the data source Drill down to the details of a particular column Update the chart view View details of chart columns Zoom in on particular regions of the chart (for details see  To Zoom In on and Out of a Chart Region) If you have permissions to edit the dashboard, you have the following additional                     capabilities: Convert the chart to another chart type Change the properties of the chart For a detailed description of how to add a column chart, see  To Add a Column Chart. Stacked Column Chart A stacked column chart illustrates the relationship of the parts to the whole. The                 columns in a stacked column chart are divided into legend categories, and each                 column represents a total.  To define a stacked column chart, do the following:  Select the entity to provide the horizontal axis values, such as financial                     period or account class. In the following stacked column chart, the  Financial                         Period  is displayed on the horizontal axis. Select a measurable entity, such as sales total, debit total, credit total,                     ending balance, or beginning balance. In the following stacked column chart, the                          Invoiced Items  is the measurable entity. Select an entity, such as customer ID, vendor ID, currency ID, or account type,                     to be displayed as column sectors (series). In the following stacked column                     chart, the  Customer Name  is the series. You can customize sector colors                     for particular values. The following chart shows the contribution of individual customers to the monthly                 sales totals ( INVOICED ITEMS ) over time. The horizontal axis                 defines the financial periods within the specified time range, and the vertical axis                 defines the measurable entity—period-to-date sales totals in the base currency.  Stacked column chart With a widget of a stacked column chart, you can do the following: Open the form used by this chart as the data source Drill down to the details of a particular column sector Update the chart view View details of the chart columns Zoom in on particular regions of the chart (for details see  To Zoom In on and Out of a Chart Region) If you have permissions to edit the dashboard, you have the following additional                     capabilities: Convert the chart to another chart type Change the properties of the chart For a detailed description of how to add a stacked column chart, see  To Add a Stacked Column Chart. Bar Chart A bar chart is a chart with rectangular bars that are plotted horizontally and have                 lengths proportional to the values that they represent. Bar charts are used for                 clearly showing data that has discrete values.  To define a bar chart, do the following:  Select a measurable entity to provide the horizontal axis values, such as total                     sales, pending balance, or beginning balance. In the following bar chart, the                          Salesperson Sales  is the measurable entity. Select one entity to provide the vertical axis values, such as customer ID,                     vendor ID, financial period, or cash account. In the following bar chart, the                          Customer Name  is the displayed on the vertical axis. Optional: Select an entity, such as branch, to display its values as separate                     bars for each value on the vertical axis (series). In the following bar chart                     with categories, the  Salesperson Name  is the series. You can customize                     bar colors for particular values. The following bar chart displays sales values calculated for a selection of entities                 (salespersons). The horizontal axis entity is the total amount of period-to-date                 sales, and the vertical axis entity is the salesperson name. Bar chart Another example of a bar chart, which you can see below, represents sales amounts,                 divided by salespersons, for each financial period. Sales amount for each                 salesperson is displayed as a separate bar within a financial period. Bar chart with series With a bar chart widget, you can do the following: Open the form used by this chart as the data source Drill down to the details of a particular bar Update the chart view View details of the chart bars Zoom in on particular regions of the chart (for details see  To Zoom In on and Out of a Chart Region) If you have permissions to edit the dashboard, you have the following additional                     capabilities: Convert the chart to another chart type Change the properties of the chart For a detailed description of how to add a bar chart, see  To Add a Bar Chart. Stacked Bar Chart A stacked bar chart is an inverted stacked column chart in which the horizontal and                 vertical axes are reversed. A stacked bar chart also illustrates the relationship of                 the parts to the whole, and its bars are divided into legend categories, with each                 bar representing a total.  To define a stacked bar chart, do the following:  Select a measurable entity to provide the horizontal axis values, such as sales                     total, debit total, credit total, ending balance, or beginning balance. In the                     following stacked bar chart, the  Invoiced Items  is the measurable                     entity. Select the category for the vertical axis, such as financial period or account                     class. In the following stacked bar chart, the  Financial Period  is                     displayed on the vertical axis. Select an entity, such as customer ID, vendor ID, currency ID, or account type,                     to be displayed as bar sectors (series). In the following stacked bar chart, the                          Customer Name  is the series. You can customize sector colors for                     particular values. The following chart shows the contribution of individual customers to the monthly                 sales totals over time. The vertical axis defines a series of financial periods                 within the specified time range, and the horizontal axis defines the measurable                 entity—period-to-date sales totals ( INVOICED ITEMS ).                 Each stacked bar represents the monthly sales total, with the parts of different                 colors indicating the different customers that contribute to the monthly total.  Stacked bar chart With a widget of a stacked bar chart, you can do the following:  Open the form used by this chart as the data source Drill down to the details of a particular bar sector Update the chart view View details of chart bars Zoom in on particular regions of the chart (for details see  To Zoom In on and Out of a Chart Region) If you have permissions to edit the dashboard, you have the following additional                     capabilities: Convert the chart to another chart type Change the properties of the chart For a detailed description of how to add a stacked bar chart, see  To Add a Stacked Bar Chart. Funnel Chart A funnel chart is a chart with no axes that shows sectors or slices of data in a                 funnel shape. Each slice represents a portion of the whole, or the slices may                 represent a process flow, with each slice (or part of the process) having data                 filtered out from the previous slice. For example, with a sales process, you could                 use a funnel chart, with each slice corresponding to a stage in the process and                 showing the amount of potential revenue. To define a funnel chart, do the following:  Select the category—such as customer name, financial period, or cash                     account—that will be displayed as individual slice of the funnel. In the                     following funnel chart, the  Customer Name  is the category. Select one measurable entity (such as total sales, beginning balance, or total                     payments) that will define the size of the slices. In the following funnel                     chart, the  Invoiced Item  is the measurable entity. The following funnel chart shows the top six customers                     ( ACCOUNTS ) by period-to-date purchases                     ( INVOICED ITEMS ). Each slice represents a portion of the                 total amount of customer purchases. Funnel Chart The chart legend can be opened as a pop-up window or located on the widget near the                 chart. When you are viewing a chart legend, you can perform the following actions: Point to the desired legend item to view its details on the chart. Click a legend item to exclude the associated slice from the chart. The share of                     the excluded slice is then proportionally distributed among the remaining slices                     on the chart. With a funnel chart widget, you can do the following: Open the form used by this chart as the data source Drill down to the details of a particular chart slice Update the chart view View the chart legend Highlight particular slices on the chart Exclude particular slices from the chart View details of particular slices on the chart If you have permissions to edit the dashboard, you have the following additional                     capabilities: Convert the chart to another chart type Change the properties of the chart For a detailed description of how to add a funnel chart, see  To Add a Funnel Chart. ]]></column>

You can use tables as widgets on dashboards. A table is an arrangement of numerical data in rows and columns; it is designed to show a set of related facts in a compact, comprehensive form. Although tables are not as eye-catching as charts, they are often the best way to help the viewer grasp key ideas about the data. A table is often a better choice than a chart when you want to show multiple types (columns) of data.{br}

When adding a table, you need to specify the following:[anchor|#ul_snt_g1t_bx]
*The inquiry form to provide data for the dashboard title for the table
*The columns to be displayed on the dashboard
{br}

For an example of a data table widget, see the following screenshot.[anchor|#_3cde7396-bb8d-4807-858d-373a0ffa8cb0][anchor|#_eca86a3d-38bb-477d-869f-0748368cdedf][image:InterfaceGuide/Images/DB__con_Table_Widget.png|popup|Data table widget|200px][anchor|#_747b6ab9-3940-478d-b662-d7549ab87139]{br}

The widget contains the standard toolbar, which is described in [HelpRoot_Interface\DB__ref_Widget_Toolbar|Widget Toolbar].{br}

By using a table widget, you can do the following:[anchor|#ul_sbg_lw2_wk]
*Open the form used by this table as the data source
*Update the widget view
*Drill down to the details of the rows in the table
*Change the order of columns
*Adjust the width of columns
*Add new records to the generic inquiry that is used as a data source for the table widget
((({S:Hint}When you open the source form used by the table or drill down to the details of the table rows, you can perform data navigation and processing actions that apply to the form.
)))

You can embed a page from an external website as a widget on a dashboard. You may want to display important information from external systems (for example, a currency rate or a document from external cloud storage) in Acumatica ERP to provide yourself and your colleagues (if they also use the dashboard) with consolidated information on one page.{br}

When adding a page, you need to specify a link to the external page. For a detailed description of the properties of the embedded page widget, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\DB__ref_Embedded_Page|Add Widget Dialog Box for Embedded Page Widgets].{br}

For an example of an embedded page widget, see the following screenshot.[anchor|#_161ef348-420a-4a47-9ce9-8550d447dafa][anchor|#_eb22c218-1194-4482-beab-8c059ac622a3][image:InterfaceGuide/Images/DB__con_Enbedded_Page.png|popup|Embedded page widget|200px][anchor|#_5aecb44c-d06f-4d72-9ccb-09121fdacdf3]
The widget contains the standard toolbar, which is described in [HelpRoot_Interface\DB__ref_Widget_Toolbar|Widget Toolbar].{br}

By using an embedded page widget, you can open the source webpage and update the widget view. With some cloud storage providers, you can modify views of documents in the application where they are displayed. {br}

You can add a trend card KPI (key performance indicator) widget on a dashboard. A trend card KPI widget is useful when you want to display a trend of metrics that change over time. For example, you can display the total sum of closed deals in the current month in comparison to the sum in the previous month and see if it increases or decreases. {br}

The following screenshot shows an example of the trend card KPI widget and its elements.[anchor|#_aa2b7144-2f33-4595-8c2b-84d660b2ca3b][anchor|#_e957173e-bfb8-469b-8bfa-0fa139afe385][image:InterfaceGuide/Images/DB__con_TrendCard_Widget_new.png|popup|Trend card widget|140px]{br}

The trend card widget consists of the following parts: [anchor|#_b386e935-1fdb-447e-b903-a5da781eaaa7]
#An arrow that shows whether the trend is rising or falling
#The trend card caption
#The absolute difference between the current KPI value and the previous one
#The difference in the percent between the current KPI value and the previous one
#The current KPI value
{br}

The color of the background indicates whether a trend is rising, falling, or flat.[anchor|#_95da02fb-dde0-466f-98d7-99f67922e527]{br}

The widget contains the standard toolbar, which is described in [HelpRoot_Interface\DB__ref_Widget_Toolbar|Widget Toolbar].{br}

When adding a trend card KPI widget to a dashboard, you need to select the following:[anchor|#ul_hdn_gv5_bx]
*The inquiry form to provide data for the dashboard
*The field from the inquiry to be displayed on the dashboard
*The timeline field from the inquiry to provide data about dates
*The period for comparison
For a detailed description of the properties of the trend card KPI widget, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\DB__ref_Trendcard|Add Widget Dialog Box for Trend Card KPI Widgets].{br}

The KPI values to be displayed on the trend card KPI widget are calculated based on the selected period, the aggregate function, and the current business date. For example, if you want to display the number of support cases and compare it with the number in the previous month on the trend card KPI widget, you specify the ''Last Month'' value in the '''Period''' box and the ''Count'' value in the '''Aggregate Function''' box. Suppose that the current business date is July 14, 2016. To find the current KPI value, the system counts the number of cases from July 1, 2016, to July 14, 2016. To find the difference, the system counts the number of cases in the previous calendar month—from June 1, 2016, to June 14, 2016—and calculates the difference between the current value and the previous one. Then the absolute difference, the difference expressed as a in percent, and the current number of cases are displayed on the widget.{br}

By using the trend card KPI widget, you can open the form used as a data source for this widget and update the widget view.{br}

Searching in Acumatica ERP gives you the ability to quickly open a form or a record on form, or find a help topic. This topic contains information on performing searches in Acumatica ERP.
==Semantic Search==
In Acumatica ERP, an intelligent search is implemented. The system performs a flexible search, considering all possible forms of the keyword or phrase that you have entered, and then lists the search results from the most relevant to the least relevant. You can also search for exact matches of the keyword or phrase by enclosing it in quotation marks. For example, searching for ''“Western Star Trucks”'' will return only the customer with this exact name.{br}

For more information on turning on semantic search, see [HelpRoot_Install\how__Semantic_Search|Enabling Semantic Search for Microsoft SQL Server] in the Acumatica ERP Installation Guide.
==The Start of a Search==
You start a search by typing a word, a part of a word, or a phrase into the '''Search''' box in the navigation pane. The system generates a list with suggestions, as shown in the following screenshot. In this list, you can restrict areas where the system will search for the search string and select a form whose name contains the search string.[anchor|#fig_d1b_1zj_xq][anchor|#image_xxs_bwl_rp][image:InterfaceGuide/Images/Search.png|popup|Search box and a Search Suggestions list|120px][anchor|#ol_eys_bwl_rp]
#Search box
#Search suggestions
#Corresponding forms
For detailed procedure, see [HelpRoot_Interface\Search_Form|To Start a Search].
==Search Results and User Access Rights==
The system narrows the search results based on the access rights of the user who performs the search. If you don&rsquo;t have permissive access rights to particular data (such as vendor accounts), these objects will not appear in the search results, even though they match the search criteria. Your access rights to file attachments are determined by your rights to the entities to which the files are attached.
==Search Tips==
As you embark on a search in Acumatica ERP, keep the following points in mind:[anchor|#ul_lmf_hn3_zq]
*The system searches all possible forms of the text you typed. If you want to search for an exact match of the word or phrase, enclose it in quotation marks.
*Because the search functionality is context-related in Acumatica ERP, by default, the search is performed on the entities of the module from which you are starting the search. However, you can select another available search scope in the '''Search Suggestions''' list.

Filters in Acumatica ERP help you find the information you want to view in a table and include only the data you need in a generated report. To help you meet your changing information needs, Acumatica ERP has the following types of filters, each with different functionality: simple, quick, advanced, and ad hoc.((({S:Warn}All Acumatica ERP filters are form-specific—that is, if a filter is designed for one form, you cannot apply it to another form.
))){br}{TOC}
==Simple Filters==
You use ''simple filters'' to quickly filter data in a table. To use a simple filter, you click the header of the column to which you want to apply the filter and specify a condition for the column. This causes the system to display only the table rows for which this column meets the selected condition, as shown in the screenshot below. You can then sort the data to best meet your information needs. [anchor|#fig_ul3_gdq_bs][anchor|#image_dfq_c2q_bs][image:InterfaceGuide/Images/UIG_Simple_Filter.png|popup|A simple filter|450px]
For generic inquiry forms (such as substitutes for entry forms), once you have configured a simple filter, the simple filter is added to the filtering area of the table, where you can work with the simple filter as you can work with a quick filter. For details, see [[#_3ccf0fe3-5fb2-47f9-a1df-883fe5c09576|Quick Filters] below.{br}

For details on using simple filters, see [HelpRoot_Interface\Filter_how_Using_Column_Filters|To Filter the Data in a Table].[anchor|#_3ccf0fe3-5fb2-47f9-a1df-883fe5c09576]
==Quick Filters==
You use ''quick filters'' to filter data in a table on a generic inquiry form (such as a substitute form for a data entry form). To use a quick filter, you drag to the filtering area above the table the header of the column to which you want to apply the filter. In the filtering area, you select the values of each added quick filter (if the column has a fixed set of options) or the filter condition of each quick filter (if the column has an unlimited number of values), as shown in the following screenshot. [anchor|#_44a60b13-2db7-4cd3-9a32-6e1d4186ff31][anchor|#_7ca08a3f-971e-4c13-89f0-c1a610edefe5][image:InterfaceGuide/Images/UIG_Quick_Filter.png|popup|A quick filter|450px]
You can save quick filters for future use. When you save a filter, the system adds to the form a tab with the filter applied. The tab will be shown on the form when you open the form in the future. The tab has the name that you specify during saving of the filter. You can create quick filters for your personal use or share them with other users. {br}

For details on using quick filters, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS_Filtering_and_Sorting_Mapref|Filtering and Sorting in Acumatica ERP] and [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Add_Reusable_Filter|To Save a Filter for Future Use].[anchor|#_fa906328-67d8-454c-9b69-80b553b6fe43]
==Advanced Filters==
You add ''advanced filters'' on processing and inquiry forms to have the data filtered when you open the form; you can create and apply these filters any time you want to, and save them for future use. These filters are considered advanced because you can specify complex and flexible filtering conditions when you set up these filters. For more information on designing advanced filters, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__con_Creating_Advanced_Filters|Creation of Advanced and Ad Hoc Filters] in the Acumatica ERP Getting Started Guide.{br}

You use the '''Filter Settings''' dialog box to add an advanced filter to a form (see item 1 in the following screenshot). When you save the filter, the system adds to the form a tab (item 2) with the filter applied; the tab will be shown on the form when you open the form in the future. You can create advanced filters for your personal use or share them with other users. [anchor|#fig_myq_knq_bs][anchor|#image_yyy_lnq_bs][image:InterfaceGuide/Images/filter_reusable.png|popup|An advanced filter|450px]

==Ad Hoc Filters==
You configure ''ad hoc filters'' on report forms to fine-tune the basic report parameters, as shown in the screenshot below. These filters cannot be saved directly to be reused at a later time; however, you can set up and save report templates that contain the filtering and sorting settings you use for an ad hoc filter.

Reusable filters, which are available on processing and inquiry forms, are created to filter data in the table part of the form and can be reused anytime after you create them. You can reuse quick filters and advanced filters. For details on the filter types, see [HelpRoot_Interface\Filter__con_Filter_Types|Types of Filters].
==Reusable Filters on Forms==
You can reuse filters on a particular processing or inquiry form in one of the following ways: [anchor|#_5b4f3a7d-d609-43c4-a532-8807f836abff]
*By creating and saving a quick filter directly on that form.
*By creating and saving an advanced filter directly on that form by using the '''Filter Settings''' dialog box. For more information on the '''Filter Settings''' dialog box, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__ref_Reusable_Filter_Settings_dialog|Filter Settings Dialog Box].
{br}

You can do the following with quick or advanced filters you have defined for forms:[anchor|#ul_bcm_2f5_1r]
*Create a filter and save it for later use, as described in [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Add_Reusable_Filter|To Save a Filter for Future Use]. For more information on designing complex filter conditions for advanced filters, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__con_Creating_Advanced_Filters|Creation of Advanced and Ad Hoc Filters] and [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Modify_Active_Clauses_Reusable_Filters|To Change the Active Clauses for an Advanced Filter].
*Update the clauses of an existing filter, as described in [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Modify_Reusable_Filter|To Modify a Saved Filter].
*Share a filter with other users, as described in [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS_Filtering_and_Sorting_Process_Activity|Filtering and Sorting in Acumatica ERP: Process Activity]. For more information on working with shared filters, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__mng_Filters|Managing Shared Filters].
*Delete an obsolete filter, as described in [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS_Filtering_and_Sorting_Process_Activity|Filtering and Sorting in Acumatica ERP: Process Activity].

==Shared Filters==
In Acumatica ERP, quick and advanced filters can be shared with other users, no matter who created the filters. You can share your filters with other users and use the filters that have been created and shared by other users. Shared filters are available to all users of the system. {br}

You can modify or delete a shared filter through the form to which it is applied as well as on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_90_10|Filters] ([~/?ScreenId=CS209010|CS209010]) form. For more information on shared filter management, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__mng_Filters|Managing Shared Filters] in the Acumatica ERP System Administration Guide.
==Filters as Tabs==
On a form, the available quick and advanced filters that you have created (or that other users have shared with you) are displayed as tabs, as shown in the following screenshot with item 2. The '''All Records''' tab shows all records without any filter applied, and the name of each other tab corresponds to the name of the filter (item 1 in the following screenshot shows where the name is specified). [anchor|#fig_a4q_fzl_1r][anchor|#image_hgy_xvn_pp][image:InterfaceGuide/Images/Filter_as_tabs.png|popup|Filters as tabs|400px]
When you click a tab, the system displays the list of items filtered according to the settings of the particular filter that corresponds to the tab.

An advanced filter may contain active and inactive clauses; each clause is represented in one row of the table on the '''Filter Settings''' dialog box for the filter. When a filter is applied to a form, the active clauses are applied to the records in the list, and the inactive clauses are ignored. You can easily modify the advanced filter by changing the active status of the clauses before the filter is applied, as described in this topic. For details about the syntax of clauses, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__con_Creating_Advanced_Filters|Creation of Advanced and Ad Hoc Filters].
==To Modify Active Clauses for an Advanced Filter==[anchor|#_2b93c268-c026-4220-943f-bd6d8e1eda0e]
#On the applicable form, open the tab with the filter.
#On the table toolbar, click '''Filter Settings''' ([image:Shared/Images/Icons_Add_Filter.png|12px]).
#In the '''Filter Settings''' dialog box, which the system has opened, if you want to use a clause in the filter, select the '''Active''' check box that precedes the clause. Repeat this step for all clauses you want to make active.
#If you want to exclude a clause from the filter, clear the '''Active''' check box that precedes the clause. Repeat this step for all clauses you want to make inactive.
#If you want to save the state of the clauses, click '''Save'''. (If you have made other changes in the filter settings, they also will be saved.)
#Click '''Apply''' to apply the filter and close the dialog box.

The examples in this topic show you how you can filter records by using ad hoc and advanced filters.
==Ad Hoc Filter==
The [HelpRoot_ReportReference\AP_63_20_00|AP Balance by GL Account] ([~/?ScreenId=AP632000|AP632000]) report displays the balances of the Accounts Payable accounts and activities on the accounts for the selected period. To fine-tune the report to show only payments collected on the ''140000'' account, you can add the following filter in the '''Additional Filtering Conditions''' table of the '''Additional Sort and Filters''' tab of the report form.[anchor|#fig_stt_kwc_cs][anchor|#image_ixf_nwc_cs][image:InterfaceGuide/Images/Filter_example_report.png|popup|250px]
==Advanced Filter with Multiple Clauses==
To view the tasks your workgroup is working on, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_40_40_00|Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=EP404000|EP404000]) form, you can add the following filter.[anchor|#fig_omy_lhd_cs][anchor|#image_azt_lhd_cs][image:InterfaceGuide/Images/filter_example_reusable_multiple_clauses.png|popup|250px]
The filter works as follows: [anchor|#ul_ztl_cbs_cs]
*By grouping the two status clauses, you include the tasks with a status of ''Open'' or ''In Process''.
*By adding the ''Workgroup'' clause, you include only the tasks assigned to your workgroups.

==Advanced Filter with a Date-Relative Clause==
To view the phone calls due next week, you can use the following filter on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_40_40_00|Tasks] form.[anchor|#fig_h3t_csd_cs][anchor|#image_s44_ksd_cs][image:InterfaceGuide/Images/Filter_example_reusable_date.png|popup|250px]
The filter works as follows: [anchor|#ul_crw_fbs_cs]
*By adding the first clause, you include the tasks with a due date of next week.
*By adding the second clause, you include the tasks whose summary includes the phrase ''Phone call'' with any capitalization because filtering is not case-sensitive.

This can occur when the inventory issue is made 								before the necessary quantity of the item arrives at the warehouse. 								To calculate the balance of over-issued inventory items, the most 								recent historical cost will be used until the item is received. When 								the inventory is received, the system will match the receipt cost 								with the issue cost, and generate a cost adjustment for the 								difference. Appropriate warnings are issued on transactions that 								will result in negative inventory balances. See also  inventory item inventory item,  warehouse warehouse. non-stock item  An inventory item that is not stored in a warehouse. Such items can be of different 								types: labor, service (such as product assembly, installation, or 								personalization), charge, expense, and actual non-stock items, such 								as goods used only for drop-shipments. For a non-stock item, you can 								specify the following information in  Acumatica ERP: base, sales, and purchase units; conversion coefficients; price 								and cost information; and the default GL accounts and subaccounts to 								be used for transactions with the items. See also  inventory item inventory item,  warehouse warehouse,  General Ledger General Ledger,  account account. notification template  An article in the Notification Templates Wiki that is an email 								template with variables denoting values in an employee or contact 								record. When the email is sent, the system replaces variables with 								values from the database record associated with each addressee for 								email personalization. numbering sequence  A set of rules the system uses to generate the next unique 								identifier when you create a new object of certain type (such as a 								batch). provides a number of predefined numbering sequences you can 								use. A numbering sequence may have subsequences. If one numbering 								sequence is used for multiple object types, all the objects get 								numbers according to the order in which they were created, so 								successive numbers can be assigned to objects of different types. 								See also  batch batch. O overdue charges  Charges calculated on open Accounts Receivable items that are past due.  Acumatica ERP calculates overdue charges and displays them on customer 								statements. You can configure these charges to be compound charges 								(charges calculated on charges) or not. Overdue charges are based on 								terms that provide a schedule for payment. See also  Accounts Receivable Accounts Receivable,  customer statement customer statement. P payment method  A way in which customers pay for goods they purchase from your 								organization. For each payment method, you can use a number of 								predefined elements: define the element names as you want them to 								appear on the interface, and set up input validation for these 								elements (input masks or regular expressions). Payment methods are 								based on the following general means of payment: credit cards, gift 								certificates, purchase orders, cash cards, and custom methods. See 								also  customer customer,  input mask input mask. PI cycle  The physical inventory cycle assigned to the stock item. PI 								cycles are used to arrange the items into groups for periodic 								counting. For more details on using PI cycles, see Planning for 								Physical Inventory. See also  stock item stock item. posting class  A group of items in the Inventory module that defines the 								default account to be used and the rules for composing the default 								subaccount for transactions with the applicable inventory items. 								Accounts and subaccounts for transactions can be obtained from the 								following sources: inventory item, warehouse, or posting class. See 								also  combined subaccount combined subaccount,  Inventory Inventory,  module module,  account account,  subaccount subaccount,  combined subaccount combined subaccount,  warehouse warehouse,  inventory item inventory item. prepayment  A document that represents amounts paid in advance for future 								purchases. In the Accounts Payable module, a vendor's request for 								prepayment is processed as follows: You use the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP302000|AP302000]) Checks and Payments (AP302000) form to 								enter the prepayment. Then the prepayment is paid in full by an AP 								check in the same currency as the default cash account. If the 								payment method associated with the default cash account requires 								printing a check, print it and release the AP check, which changes 								its status to  Closed  and creates a payment of the 									 Prepayment  type with the reference number of the original 								prepayment request. After that, you can apply the prepayment to 								bills and adjustments. See also  Accounts Payable Accounts Payable,  module module. price list  A list of sales prices that is set for goods sold in a specific currency, offered to 								customers of a particular customer price class, and specified with 								respect to various units of measure available for the items.

Inventory-related reason codes allow you 								to post transactions related to direct inventory operations (such as 								receipts, issues, transfers, adjustments, and physical inventory 								counts) to specific accounts and assign particular subaccounts to 								them to allow for more detailed reporting. See also  reason code reason code,  Inventory Inventory,  module module,  account account,  subaccount subaccount. reconciliation  The process of matching the cash transactions recorded in  Acumatica ERP against those presented on a bank statement. Theoretically, the 								balance of the cash account associated with the bank should 								reconcile to the balance of the bank statement, but there may be 								some discrepancy between account balances. The goal of 								reconciliation is to find discrepancies and determine whether each 								is due to error or timing. In  Acumatica ERP, you mark documents as cleared as you receive preliminary 								information from the bank. Later, when you have received the bank 								statement, you reconcile transactions with the bank statement.  recurring GL 								transactions  GL transactions that repeat regularly. To automate the entering 								of recurring transactions, such as depreciation transactions, allows 								you to create schedules for them. A schedule defines how many times 								and how often specific batches should be repeated. One or several 								batches can be assigned to a schedule, but only batches with the 									 Balanced  status can be scheduled. Once a batch is 								assigned to a schedule, its status changes to  Scheduled . To 								create schedules, use the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL203500|GL203500]) Recurring Transactions (GL203500) form. See also  schedule schedule,  batch batch. replenishment policy  Settings that define how automatic replenishment for the 								inventory item is initiated, as well as its source, quantity, and 								time intervals, including low seasons, during which replenishment is 								initiated in smaller quantities. See also  inventory item inventory item. restriction group  A set of objects (such as users, accounts, and subaccounts) of two or more types 								created to, if the group includes users, restrict users' access to 								only objects in the same group; if the group doesn't include users, 								the restriction group relates its objects in a way that limits their 								use. For instance, one restriction group may include two users and a 								number of special-use accounts that only these two users can update, 								and another restriction group may include several GL expense 								accounts and a subaccount that should be used only with these 								particular accounts. If a restriction group is defined as inverse, 								the objects in the group instead cannot be used with one another. To 								learn more about restriction groups, see the  Managing Visibility with Restriction Groups 								section in System Administration Guide. Retained Earnings 								account  A special system-maintained accounts that is of the 									 Liability  type and must be created before any actual data 								is entered. The Retained Earnings account accumulates the company’s 								net income (or loss) after the dividends have been paid. Retained 								earnings are summarized over the years since the first year of 								company operations. During the financial year closing, this account 								is updated by the amount accumulated on the YTD Net Income account. 								See also  YTD Net Income YTD Net Income. revaluation  The process of revising the value of AP, AR, or GL accounts that 								are maintained in a foreign currency. For more information, see 								Overview of Revaluations.  role  A set of access rights to certain system objects—such as specific Wiki 								articles, forms, form elements, and toolbar actions—to which 								you assign users. When you define roles, give only the access rights 								necessary to perform typical tasks. Sets of access rights by 								different roles should not intersect. We recommend that you assign 								to a user several roles rather than creating a more complicated role 								with the same privileges as multiple already-defined roles.  Acumatica ERP has several preconfigured roles. For more information about 								roles, see Role-Based Security. S Sales Orders  An  Acumatica ERP module with the functionality required to manage sales-related 								activities, such as maintaining multiple price lists, configuring 								the system to calculate discounts, entering quotes, fulfilling sales 								orders, generating pick lists, creating shipments, and adding landed 								costs. See also  module module. sales price  A price you set for a particular item that you sell in a 								specific currency, offer to customers of a particular customer price 								class, and specify with respect to an appropriate unit of measure. 								Sales prices can be maintained with regard to items' sales units or 								base units. See also  customer customer,  customer price class customer price class,  sales unit sales unit,  base unit base unit. sales unit  The unit of measure in which a particular item is sold to a 								customer. See also  customer customer. schedule  A definition in  Acumatica ERP of how many times and how often specific AP batches, AR documents 								should be generated for recurring transactions. Once a batch or a 								document is assigned to a schedule, its status changes to 									 Scheduled . The system uses the original documents or 								batches as templates to generate similar documents or batches with 								only transaction dates being changed as dictated by the schedule. 								See also  batch batch. Search text box  A text box, located on the top of the navigation pane on any 								page, that allows you to perform a quick search in the entities. You 								can click the Search icon to open the Search form, which offers more 								extensive capabilities to search the wikis, files, or entities in 								the system. See also  navigation pane navigation pane. segment In  Acumatica ERP, one of the parts of an identifier of an 										entity—such as account, subaccount, inventory item, 										subitem, warehouse or location reserved to carry special 										meaning. Segments should be populated with values before 										entities are created. Segment values are alphanumeric 										strings of the fixed length, and one of the segments may be 										assigned a numbering sequence. Several input validation 										options can be used to verify the segment values when users 										create new entities of the type. To break the identifier into segments (as described 										above).  See also  account account,  subaccount subaccount,  inventory item inventory item,  location location,  warehouse warehouse. segmented key  A system entity that lets you define the structure of identifiers for a certain type 								of object and then serves as a template when a user creates an 								identifier for a new object. The current version of  Acumatica ERP provides the following segmented keys:  ACCOUNT , for GL 								accounts;  SUBACCOUNT , for GL subaccounts;  BIZACCT , for 								vendor and customer accounts in the Accounts Payable and Accounts 								Receivable modules;  INVENTORY , for inventory items; and 									 SALESPER , for salesperson accounts. For more detailed 								information, see  Segmented Identifiers in the  Acumatica ERP System Administration Guide. See also  General Ledger General Ledger,  account account,  subaccount subaccount,  vendor vendor. standard cost method  A method for inventory item valuation in which standard cost is 								calculated outside the system using company-specific policies. With 								this method, the currently effective standard costs are assigned to 								inventory items on their receipt, issue, adjustment or transfer, 								regardless of their actual costs. When items assigned to this method 								are received at the warehouses, any differences between the actual 								and standard costs are recorded to the specified standard cost 								variance accounts and posted to the General Ledger. Standard costs 								can be updated as often as is needed. See also  inventory item inventory item,  warehouse warehouse. stock item  An inventory item stored and maintained in steady volumes at some warehouse. For each 								stock item,  Acumatica ERP tracks a basic set of item properties, such as the item's 								identifier, description, price, cost, units of measure, and default 								warehouse and vendor information. Stock items can have many 								additional properties, known as attributes in  Acumatica ERP, that do not affect item processing but may be important for 								analyzing the stock movements or item sales. See also  inventory item inventory item,  attribute attribute. statement cycle  The schedule for customer statements. You can also set up four 								aging periods that sort open documents by days past due. You can use 								the aging periods to prepare an AR aging schedule at the end of each 								month, which you can analyze to identify potential cash flow 								problems. Statement cycles can be assigned to customer classes and 								to individual customers. See also  customer statement customer statement,  aging period aging period,  customer class customer class,  customer customer. subaccount  A subcategory of the account that carries identifying information; in  Acumatica ERP, you use subaccounts with accounts to virtually split accounts 								into smaller, more specific ones. This gives you finer 								classification within the account for reporting and internal 								management purposes. While account identifiers carry the information 								about the account type along with the actual account number, 								subaccount identifiers can provide such information as the division, 								department, and cost center. Each journal entry is recorded with the 								appropriate account and subaccount combination. See the Hierarchy of 								Accounts and Subaccounts article for more details. See also  account account,  journal entry journal entry. subitems  Codes that allow further categorization of an inventory items. 								Subitems are used in the system if you have otherwise-identical 								products with different colors, sizes, or other properties tracked 								because of their importance to customers. Thus, under the same 								inventory ID, there may be a number of subitems—records about 								products that share all settings of the inventory item record but 								have additional properties that differ. If your site uses subitems, 								they should be specified for each inventory ID related to a stock 								item.
