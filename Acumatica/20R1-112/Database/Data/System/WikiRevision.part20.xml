*Audit data on the field level: You configure auditing on particular forms to record user activity on these forms. for details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Field_Level_Audit|Field-Level Auditing].

==Segmented Keys and Numbering Sequences==
In Acumatica ERP, different types of accounts and other system entities have identifiers, which you design to meet your organization&rsquo;s requirements, make identifiers more meaningful for users and reduce input errors. These identifiers can have any number of segments. For instance, you can define segments that denote specific divisions, departments, regions, or cost centers. You define segmentation by using segmented keys. Acumatica ERP provides a predefined configuration for each segmented key, which can be used in most cases. For more information about using segmented keys to configure identifiers for various entities, see the following topics: [anchor|#_6569ee78-9cb5-4ed9-b084-10e7308d0825]
*[HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Identifier_Segmentation|Segmented Identifiers]
*[HelpRoot_Financials\GL__con_Account_and_Subaccount_Identifiers|Account Identification]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Inventory_IDs_and_Subitem_Codes|Inventory Subitems]
*[HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Business_Accounts_Identifiers|Business Account Identifiers]

You use a numbering sequence to have the system automatically generate a number for a new object when the object is being created manually or automatically. For example, numbering sequences are used for numbering batches, allocations, schedules, vendors, and payments. Acumatica ERP provides a number of predefined numbering sequences, and your organization can create and use any number of user-defined numbering sequences. For additional information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Multiple_Numbering_Sequences|Numbering Sequence Usage].
==Configuring Input Validation Options==
To validate user input in data entry boxes in Acumatica ERP, you can define input masks and regular expressions. For instance, you can use input masks and regular expressions to validate the text boxes with phone numbers, postal codes, and tax registration numbers. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Examples_Mask_and_RegExp_Usage|Examples of Masks and Regular Expressions Usage ] and [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_CountryStatePostalCode_Validation|Country, State and Postal Code Validation]. 
==Specifying the Common Settings of Acumatica ERP Instance==

*Site structure: If the naming and organization of Acumatica ERP forms does not fit the needs of certain groups of users, you can view and update the order of forms in modules, create and populate new modules, regroup forms into sections, and rename forms. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Site_Map_Management|Managing the Site Map].
*File management: You can import and store different files, such as images in various formats, scanned documents, and internal instructions for employees. For example, you can attach a picture of an inventory item to the related item record, or a copy of an original vendor invoice to the related credit adjustment. You can easily view files, update them, check them out and in, get links to them, and configure access to them. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_File_Attachment_Management|File Attachment Management].

==Managing Emails==
 Acumatica ERP provides functionality to manage emails for the employees involved in customer relationship management (CRM) activities, such as working with leads and contacts, organizing campaigns, and handling cases. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\EP__con_Email_Management|Managing Emails]
==Specifying the Settings for Document Processing and Viewing==
In Acumatica ERP, you can specify the following system-wide settings for processing and viewing documents:[anchor|#_b607ddba-1c22-442b-890c-d4e623b033f9]
*Shared filters: Users can set up filters to list only the records they want to view (that is, only those with the criteria the users specify) on a particular form. By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_90_10|Filters] ([~/?ScreenId=CS209010|CS209010]) form, users can create filters for their personal use or filters to be shared with other users. As a system administrator, you can manage all shared filters created in the system. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__mng_Filters|Managing Shared Filters].
*Segmented identifiers: You can design identifiers, which can be made up of any number of segments, for accounts and other types of system entities to meet your company&rsquo;s needs. For instance, in subaccount identifiers, you can define segments that denote specific divisions, departments, regions, or cost centers. By using segments, you make identifiers more meaningful for users and reduce input errors. You define identifiers by using segmented keys as follows: you can specify the number of segments the key has, the length and type of each, and the possible values of each segment. Acumatica ERP provides a predefined configuration for each segmented key, which can be used in most cases. For more information about segmented keys, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Identifier_Segmentation|Segmented Identifiers].
*Numbering sequences: You use a numbering sequence to have the system automatically generate a number that serves as the identifier (or a segment of the identifier) of a new entity when the object is being created manually or automatically. For example, numbering sequences are used for numbering batches, allocations, schedules, vendors, and payments. Acumatica ERP provides a number of predefined numbering sequences, and your organization can create and use any number of user-defined numbering sequences. For additional information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Multiple_Numbering_Sequences|Numbering Sequence Usage]. 
*Input validation options: To validate user input in data entry boxes, you can define input masks and regular expressions. For instance, you can use input masks and regular expressions to validate the text boxes with phone numbers, postal codes, and tax registration numbers. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Examples_Mask_and_RegExp_Usage|Examples of Masks and Regular Expressions Usage ] and [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_CountryStatePostalCode_Validation|Country, State and Postal Code Validation].
*Notifications: In Acumatica ERP, you can configure custom notifications on any data entry form to be sent to employees. The emails will be sent to employees to inform them that specific documents have been modified or changed status. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Notifications_About_Changes|Notifications About Changes on Data Entry Forms].

==Localizing Acumatica ERP==
You can maintain multiple locales and localize the Acumatica ERP user interface to multiple languages. You can translate strings from the application user interface directly in the application or by exporting the application strings to a third-party product and importing the translated strings back. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__mng_Locales|Managing Locales and Languages].
==Automating Processes==
You can automate particular processes in Acumatica ERP so that users spend less time initiating typical operations. You can automate processes as follows:[anchor|#_5753bbdb-4dd1-4dd7-b2ab-50e2c1f889ff]
*By scheduling processes: In any ERP system, the processing of documents and validation of accounts requires significant time and system resources. As such, these processes should be performed at times when there are no employees at work, such as at night or on the weekend. Other processing, such as releasing or posting documents, takes less time but also should be performed regularly, with a frequency geared toward the needs of your business. In Acumatica ERP, you can set up automated processing for most processing forms instead of initiating the processing manually. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Scheduled_Processing|Scheduled Processing].
*By automating workflows: For some forms in Acumatica ERP, you can create automation steps that redefine the functionality of toolbar buttons, add values to lists in combo boxes, or provide default values for the form elements based on the properties of the records to be processed. A complete set of automation steps is considered an ''automation definition'' and can be saved under the name you specify. You can create multiple automation definitions. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Automation_Maintenance|Automation Maintenance].

==Event Monitoring==
In Acumatica ERP, some executed business processes require the monitoring of particular activities and conditions in the system. You can configure the system to monitor the company data and to perform an action (such as sending a push notification or an email notification or performing the instructions defined by an import scenario) or multiple actions in the system based on various occurrences. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\AI__con_Event_Monitoring|Monitoring and Managing Events].
==Configuring and Managing Dashboards==
Dashboards are an important and convenient tool for monitoring and analyzing critical business information. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_86_00|Dashboards] ([~/?ScreenId=SM208600|SM208600]) form, you can add dashboard pages, locate them in the site map, and set up the access rights to dashboard pages. For more information, see [HelpRoot_ReportingTools\CU__mng_Dashboards|Managing Dashboard Pages].
==Configuring and Managing Pivot Tables==
In Acumatica ERP, you can build pivot tables based on the data from generic inquiries. A pivot table is a program tool that you can use to reorganize and summarize data in a generic inquiry, to view it from different perspectives. Among other functions, a pivot table can automatically sort, count, total, or give the average of the data stored in a generic inquiry, displaying the results in a separate table showing the summarized data. You can configure and change the structure of pivot tables simply by dragging and dropping fields. For details, see [HelpRoot_ReportingTools\Pivot_Tables_Mapref|Managing Pivot Tables].
==Integrating Acumatica ERP with External Applications==
 Acumatica ERP is a web-based application; therefore, you can integrate it with various external web applications as follows:[anchor|#_0e9419cc-3dec-4a38-93f1-4e7ece6b5867]
*Building external web applications in Acumatica ERP: You can build external web applications in Acumatica ERP if the employees of your organization use these applications along with Acumatica ERP in their work. For example, you can build a Microsoft Power BI report into Acumatica ERP if employees analyze the reports based on data sets that are loaded from Acumatica ERP. For details, see [HelpRoot_Integration\SM__mng_Integration_External_Applications|Managing Integration with External Applications].
*Embedding Acumatica ERP forms in external web applications: You can embed Acumatica ERP forms in another web application that your employees use to solve their work tasks. For example, you can embed the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_40_40_00|Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=EP404000|EP404000]) form within your Office 365 page to view and access your Acumatica ERP task list directly in Office 365. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Integration\US__mng_Links|Integrating Acumatica ERP Forms on Your Website].

==Administering Acumatica Self-Service                         Portal==
The Acumatica Self-Service                         Portal provides a solution for you to more efficiently work and communicate with your customers. Self-Service Portal is specifically designed to be the site where your customers can view all the relevant information about their interactions with you as a vendor and perform needed activities online.{br}

If your organization wants to provide its customers with the functionality of Self-Service Portal, you need to install an instance of the portal, as described in [HelpRoot_Install\Installing_Portal|Setting Up Acumatica Self-Service                         Portal].{br}

After you have installed Self-Service Portal, you need to configure various settings so that the portal corresponds to the business processes of your organization. You can find a detailed description of Self-Service Portal configuration in [HelpRoot_SS_Portal_Admin\SP__SP_Portal_Overview|Overview of Acumatica Self-Service                         Portal].
==Customizing the User Interface==
In Acumatica ERP, you can flexibly customize the user interface (in particular, main menu items and workspace links) that all users will see so that it fits the business processes of your organization. Your customization of the user interface will make it easier for users to find and begin working with required forms and reports, speeding document processing in the system. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\AS__mng_User_Interface_Configuration|Customizing the User Interface].{br}

Also, you can define attributes for flexible, meaningful classification of multiple entities. An attribute is a property (such as age or industry) that enables you to specify additional information for objects in the system. For some entities, attributes are defined in the context of a class; for other entities, attributes can be added directly to the data entry form that corresponds to the entity. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Attributes_and_User_Defined_Fields|Managing Attributes and User-Defined Fields].
==Managing Wikis==
 Acumatica ERP provides wiki repository for working materials or a knowledge base where you can store such information as Help articles, internal manuals, instructions, marketing materials, and plans. Wikis can be created for number of different purposes. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__mng_Wikis|Managing Wikis].]]></column>

By automating workflows: For some forms in  Acumatica ERP, you can create automation steps that redefine the functionality of toolbar buttons,           add values to lists in combo boxes, or provide default values for the form elements based           on the properties of the records to be processed. A complete set of automation steps is           considered an  automation definition  and can be saved under the name you specify.           You can create multiple automation definitions. For details, see  Automation Maintenance. Event Monitoring In  Acumatica ERP, some executed business processes require the monitoring of particular activities and         conditions in the system. You can configure the system to monitor the company data and to         perform an action (such as sending a push notification or an email notification or         performing the instructions defined by an import scenario) or multiple actions in the system         based on various occurrences. For more information, see  Monitoring and Managing Events. Configuring and Managing Dashboards Dashboards are an important and convenient tool for monitoring and analyzing critical         business information. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM208600|SM208600]) Dashboards (SM208600) form, you can add         dashboard pages, locate them in the site map, and set up the access rights to dashboard         pages. For more information, see  Managing Dashboard Pages. Configuring and Managing Pivot Tables In  Acumatica ERP, you can build pivot tables based on the data from generic inquiries. A pivot table is a         program tool that you can use to reorganize and summarize data in a generic inquiry, to view         it from different perspectives. Among other functions, a pivot table can automatically sort,         count, total, or give the average of the data stored in a generic inquiry, displaying the         results in a separate table showing the summarized data. You can configure and change the         structure of pivot tables simply by dragging and dropping fields. For details, see  Managing Pivot Tables. Integrating  Acumatica ERP     with External Applications  Acumatica ERP is a web-based application; therefore, you can integrate it with various external web         applications as follows: Building external web applications in  Acumatica ERP: You can build external web applications in  Acumatica ERP if the employees of your organization use these applications along with  Acumatica ERP in their work. For example, you can build a Microsoft Power BI report into  Acumatica ERP if employees analyze the reports based on data sets that are loaded from  Acumatica ERP. For details, see  Managing Integration with External Applications. Embedding  Acumatica ERP forms in external web applications: You can embed  Acumatica ERP forms in another web application that your employees use to solve their work tasks. For           example, you can embed the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP404000|EP404000]) Tasks (EP404000) form within your           Office 365 page to view and access your  Acumatica ERP task list directly in Office 365. For more information, see  Integrating Acumatica ERP Forms on Your Website. Administering  Acumatica Self-Service                         PortalThe  Acumatica Self-Service                         Portal provides a solution for you to more efficiently work and communicate with your customers.            Self-Service Portal         is specifically designed to be the site where your customers can view all the relevant         information about their interactions with you as a vendor and perform needed activities         online. If your organization wants to provide its customers with the functionality of  Self-Service Portal, you         need to install an instance of the portal, as described in  Setting Up Acumatica Self-Service                         Portal. After you have installed  Self-Service Portal, you         need to configure various settings so that the portal corresponds to the business processes         of your organization. You can find a detailed description of  Self-Service Portal         configuration in  Overview of Acumatica Self-Service                         Portal. Customizing the User Interface In  Acumatica ERP, you can flexibly customize the user interface (in particular, main menu items and         workspace links) that all users will see so that it fits the business processes of your         organization. Your customization of the user interface will make it easier for users to find         and begin working with required forms and reports, speeding document processing in the         system. For details, see  Customizing the User Interface. Also, you can define attributes for flexible, meaningful classification of multiple         entities. An attribute is a property (such as age or industry) that enables you to specify         additional information for objects in the system. For some entities, attributes are defined         in the context of a class; for other entities, attributes can be added directly to the data         entry form that corresponds to the entity. For more information, see  Managing Attributes and User-Defined Fields. Managing Wikis  Acumatica ERP provides wiki repository for working materials or a knowledge base where you can store         such information as Help articles, internal manuals, instructions, marketing materials, and         plans. Wikis can be created for number of different purposes. For details, see  Managing Wikis. ]]></column>

You can check the state of your application instances and databases and see which instances and databases you need to update. 
==To Check the State of Application Instances and Databases==[anchor|#ol_ekv_zlq_vl]
#Run the Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard on the server where Acumatica ERP is installed. For example, select '''Start &gt; Acumatica &gt; Acumatica ERP                         Configuration'''.
#On the Welcome page, click '''Perform Application Maintenance'''.

On the Application Maintenance page of the Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard, the system flags each instance in the list of installed sites with one of the following icons:[anchor|#_vcy_3lp_mg]
*''Green check mark'': Indicates that the instance and the associated database are up to date (the versions of the application instance, the database, and the Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard are the same).
*''Yellow triangle with exclamation point'': Indicates that the instance and the instance database are outdated (the version of the application instance is same as the version of the database and is older than that of the installed Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard). You may need to update the application instance and the database. 
*:((({S:Warn}After you update the Acumatica ERP Tools, all your instances installed before the update are marked in this way.
)))
*''Red circle with a white X'': Indicates that the instance or the database (depending on which has an older version) requires update; that is, the versions of the instance and the instance&rsquo;s database are different. You must update the one whose version is older.
*:Also, this marking may indicate that the instance and the database versions are newer than the version of the installed Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard. You won&rsquo;t be able to downgrade the instance or the database.

For example, the following screenshot displays several instances. The database of the ''Acumatica17217...'' instance has been updated to the version of Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard and the site needs to be updated also. The ''Acumatica182070006'' instance has been updated. The ''Acumatica182090021'' and ''AcumaticaF190930...'' instances may be updated if required. The versions of ''Acumatica19101...'', ''Acumatica19191...'', and ''Acumatica19193...'' instances are newer than the version of the running Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard.[image:UserGuide/Images/Upgrading_Instances_state.png|popup|Checking the state of the application instances and databases|240px]]]></column>

For example, select  Start >  Acumatica >  Acumatica ERP                         Configuration. On the Welcome page, click  Perform Application                         Maintenance . On the Application Maintenance page, do the following:  In the  Installed Sites  list, click the instance                             for which you want to specify another database. On the bottom area of the page, click  Change                                 Database . On the Database Server Connection page, specify the Microsoft SQL Server that                     will be used by the  Acumatica ERP instance:  In the  Available Servers  list, select a server to                             connect to.  If the server list does not include the server you are                                 looking for, you should click  Update the List                                  to rescan your network. The list of database servers may not have a                                 particular server even after your network is rescanned (if, for                                 instance, the server blocks broadcasts). In this case, you can type                                 the name or the                                 address  of                                 the Microsoft SQL Server machine in the  Server                                     Name  box. If the problem persists, contact your                                 network administrator for assistance. If you use Microsoft                                 SQL Server Express, the  (local)  option will not work even if                                 the database server is running on the same machine. To use the                                 server, start the SQL Browser service first, and then update the                                 list of servers and select your server. Note that Microsoft SQL                                 Server Express should not be used in a production environment due to                                 its limitations. Select the authentication method to be used to connect to the database                             server. If you select the  SQL Server                                 Authentication  option, specify an account with                             sufficient rights for creating the databases or making changes to them.                          The selected authentication method must be supported by the database                                 server. Note that by default, Microsoft SQL Server 2005 is installed                                 with Windows authentication disabled. Windows authentication works only for a local Microsoft SQL Server                                 or when both application and database servers are members of the                                 same Windows domain. Click  Next . On the Database Configuration page, select the appropriate option as follows:                          To create a new database, click  Create a new                                 database , and then type the name of the database. To connect to an existing database, do the following: Click  Connect to an existing                                     database . In the  Available databases on server                                      list, click a database name. Depending on the schema of the database you have selected,                                     select the relevant check box to update, repair, or set up the                                     database.  To shrink data after the database maintenance, select the                                          Shrink data  check box. Click  Next . On the Tenant Setup page, make any necessary changes to the list of tenants. For                     more information, see  Managing Tenants. Click  Next . Optional: On the Tables Configuration page (which is displayed only if you have                     selected the  Advanced Settings  check box on the Tenant                     Setup page), specify whether you want the database tables to be shared by                     different tenants, and then click  Next .  Table configuration is a dangerous operation that can result                         in database corruption. Any changes you make are at your own risk. If you                         configure tables, be sure to first back up the database. On the Database Connection page, specify the authentication method that this                     application instance of  Acumatica ERP will use to connect to the database, which is one of the following                         options: Windows Authentication : The  Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard will use the default anonymous user account used by Internet                             Information Services (IIS).

For                         more information, see  Cleaning Up the Database.  To open any form, you can navigate to it             or search for it (by its name or by its form ID without periods). For more information             about search capabilities, see  Search. To Optimize a Database Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM203520|SM203520]) Tenants (SM203520) form by                     searching for or navigating to it.  In the  Tenant ID  box, select the tenant whose database                     you want to optimize. On the form toolbar, click  Optimize Database  to trigger                     the validation of the orphaned snapshots and their deletion by the system. In the dialog box that opens, click  Yes . The system                     closes the dialog box and starts the process.  This may take some time, depending on the size of the database. Notice the green icon                 that appears on the form toolbar once the operation has completed successfully. (If                 a red icon appears, move the cursor over the red icon to view the description of the                 problem.) To Shrink the Database Run the  Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard. For example, select  Start >  Acumatica >  Acumatica ERP                         Configuration. On the Welcome page, click  Perform Database                     Maintenance . On the Database Server Connection page, specify the Microsoft SQL Server that                     will be used by the  Acumatica ERP instance:  In the  Available Servers  box, select a server to                             connect to.  If the server list does not include the server you are                                 looking for, click  Update the List  to rescan                                 your network. The list of database servers may not have a particular                                 server even after your network is rescanned (if, for instance, the                                 server blocks broadcasts). In this case, you can type the name or                                 the address of the Microsoft SQL Server machine in the                                      Server Name  box. If the problem persists,                                 contact your network administrator for assistance. If you                                 use Microsoft SQL Server Express, the  (local)  option will not                                 work even if the database server is running on the same machine. To                                 use the server, start the SQL Browser service first, and then update                                 the list of servers and select your server. Note that Microsoft SQL                                 Server Express should not be used in a production environment due to                                 its limitations. Select the authentication method to be used to connect to the database                             server. If you select the  SQL Server                                 Authentication  option, specify an account with                             sufficient rights for creating the databases or making changes to them.  The selected authentication method must be supported by the database                                 server. Note that by default, Microsoft SQL Server 2005 is installed                                 with Windows authentication disabled. Windows authentication works only for a local Microsoft SQL Server                                 or when both application and database servers are members of the                                 same Windows domain. Click  Next . On the Database Configuration page, to connect to an existing database, do the                     following:  Click  Connect to an existing database . In the  Available databases on server  box, select                             a database. Select the  Shrink data after repair  check                             box. Click  Next . On the Tenant Setup page, click  Next . On the Database Connection page, click  Next . On the Confirm Configuration page, click  Finish  to                     complete the process of perform database maintenance. ]]></column>

 Acumatica ERP can send push notifications that make it possible for the external applications to track the changes in the data in Acumatica ERP. For more information on push notifications, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__mng_Push_Notificatons|Configuring Push Notifications].{br}

If you have installed a new version of Acumatica ERP or updated your Acumatica ERP instance by using the Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard, the push notifications are enabled in Acumatica ERP automatically. You can configure the notifications on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_00|Push Notifications] ([~/?ScreenId=SM302000|SM302000]) form, as described in [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__how_Configure_Push_Notifications|To Configure Push Notifications] in the Integration Development Guide. {br}

If you have updated your Acumatica ERP instance through the web interface, before configuring push notifications, you need to manually enable push notifications in Acumatica ERP, as described in [[#_e0ed4a7a-e197-45ed-8c14-c1eab4e5ca1d|To Enable Push Notifications Manually] in this topic. {br}

If you need to enable push notifications on the Acumatica ERP instances in a cluster, you should follow the instructions in [[#_99af8931-2fdf-4cd8-ad09-def60f811197|To Enable Push Notifications in a Cluster] in this topic.[anchor|#_e0ed4a7a-e197-45ed-8c14-c1eab4e5ca1d]

Advanced Financials This group of features is not available in the standard edition of  Acumatica ERP. You can enable any of the features in this group if the group of features is available         in your system.  Subaccounts Gives you the ability to use subaccounts in addition to accounts. The subaccounts, which          are configurable in the Common Settings module, are used to detail account balances, for          more granular financial analysis. For details, see  Subaccounts: General Information.  General Ledger Allocation Templates Enables the creation and maintenance of allocation templates (which define how the         allocations are to be performed) and the automatic application of allocations according to         your definitions. Inter-Branch Transactions Makes possible the automatic generation of balancing entries for transactions between          different companies of one tenant, branches of different companies of one tenant, and          branches that belong to one company and require balancing. For details, see  Configuring Interbranch Account Mapping. If this feature is disabled, users can enter transactions only between branches that          belong to one company and do not require balancing. General Ledger Consolidation Provides consolidating data from specific branches of subsidiaries (or consolidation         units) into specific branch of the parent company. You can configure which data should be         consolidated and how exactly the data should be consolidated. After that, you can         consolidate the data as often as you need within each financial period.  Translation of Financial Statements Gives you the ability to translate amounts from the base currency to another currency at          the account balance level. Translation can be used for reporting purposes in any foreign          currency. For details, see  Translation Processing Workflow. Customer Discounts Gives you the ability to maintain customer discounts in your system: import them or enter          them manually, and update them. The system automatically applies the customer discounts to          sales orders (or invoices if the  Inventory and Order Management  group of features is          not enabled) when a user saves the document.  When the feature is disabled, you can enter the discount percent or amount on a line and document level on data entry forms, but the discount amounts are not posted separately to a discount account. For more information, see  Customer Discounts: General Information. Vendor Discounts Gives you the ability to maintain vendor discounts in your system: import them or enter          them manually, and update them. The system automatically applies the vendor discounts to          purchase orders (or bills if the  Inventory and Order Management  group of features is          not enabled) when a user saves the document. When the feature is disabled, you can enter the discount percent or amount on a line and document level on data entry forms, but the discount amounts are not posted separately to a discount account. For more information, see  Configuring Vendor Discounts. Commissions Makes it possible to configure commission calculations that support your company's         policies.  Overdue Charges Gives you the ability to configure additional charges to be applied to the outstanding         balances of customers who are consistently paying too late or not paying in full.  Dunning Letter Management Provides you with the ability to generate dunning letters to notify customers about their          overdue documents. You can select how you want to manage a level of dunning letter: by          customer or by overdue document. For details, see  Managing Dunning Letters. Deferred Revenue Management Adds the Deferred Revenue module and integrates it with the Accounts Payable and Accounts          Receivable modules, so that users can assign various documents to deferral schedules for          recognizing portions of the deferred amounts. For more information, see   ([~/?ScreenId=DR000000|DR000000]) Deferred Revenue. Parent-Child Customer Relationship Makes it possible to configure parent-child relationships between business accounts of          the  Customer  and  Customer & Vendor  types. A parent-child relationship          includes the ability for the parent account to pay invoices of the child account, to          generate consolidated statements and reports, and to view a consolidated balance for a          parent account that includes the balances of its child accounts. The relationship can be          removed at any time. For details, see  Managing Parent-Child Relationships. Retainage Support Makes it possible to create documents of the  Invoice  and  Bills  type with          retained amounts that will be paid later. Multiple documents are created in the system to          process a retainage: the original document (which has retainage withheld) and the retainage          document or documents (which reflect the retainage amount to be paid). If the  Standard Inventory  feature is enabled in your system in addition to this          feature, you can also create purchase orders with retained amounts. For each purchase          order, you then create an Accounts Payable bill in which the system specifies the retainage          settings based on the purchase order settings. If the  Project Accounting  feature is enabled in your system in addition to this          feature, you can also create pro forma invoices with retained amounts. For each pro forma          invoice, you then create an Accounts Receivable invoice in which the system specifies the          retainage settings based on the pro forma invoice settings. Contract Management This feature provides the support of contracts, including case processing and contract          billing. It adds forms related to contract processing to the Accounts Receivable module and          enables integration of the Accounts Receivable and the Time and Expenses modules. For more          information, see  Managing Contracts. Fixed Asset Management This feature adds the Fixed Assets module, which can be used to create and manage fixed          assets through their useful life, from acquisition to disposal. The Fixed Assets module          integrates with the Requisitions and Purchase Orders modules to facilitate converting          purchases into fixed assets without the need to re-enter data. For more information, see          the   ([~/?ScreenId=FA000000|FA000000]) Fixed Assets chapter.  Monitoring and Automation Group of Features  The features in this group enable the monitoring of user activities and the automation of      workflows.

In Acumatica ERP, you can create tenant snapshots containing your tenant&rsquo;s full or partial data. Snapshots can be saved locally in the same database, or at a specified location. Later, any snapshot can be imported and restored to another tenant. {br}

Snapshots can be used as tenant templates when you create new tenants in Acumatica ERP that are similar in configuration. Also, you can use snapshots to set up a test environment for your tenant where you test the configuration changes required for your tenant before you apply them to your live tenant.
==Taking Snapshots==
You can take a snapshot of the tenant configuration and data by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_20|Tenants] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203520|SM203520]) form. For a snapshot, you specify which data you want to include by selecting one of the available content options, which are described in detail in [[#section_Snapshot_Contents|Selecting the Content of Snapshots].{br}

Data from published customizations is a part of the database and is always included in snapshots.{br}

You can take a virtually unlimited number of snapshots. The only limitation is disk space: Snapshots are stored in the database, thus occupying disk space. We recommend that before you take a snapshot, you open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_25|Space Usage] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203525|SM203525]) form and make sure that you have enough free space in the Acumatica ERP database. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Database_Size_Monitoring|Database Size Monitoring and Management].((({S:Warn}When you take a snapshot, any previously taken snapshots are not included in the new snapshot.
)))
The process of creating a snapshot may take a significant amount of time because the database tables are copied one by one for a snapshot, and this process sometimes results in errors. For example, a user may introduce changes to documents that have been partially backed up; consequently, the data in the snapshot would be corrupted. Therefore, if you intend to restore the snapshot in a production system, we strongly recommend that you create snapshots in maintenance mode (that is, when the system is locked out for maintenance, as described in [HelpRoot_Install\Updating__how_Enable_Lockout|To Schedule the System Lockout]).{br}

For testing purposes, you can create snapshots without first locking out the system. In this case, a warning message will appear, and the system will mark this snapshot as unsafe. (The '''Is Safe''' column on the '''Snapshots''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_20|Tenants] form reflects whether the snapshot is safe or not.)((({S:Warn}Because the process of taking a snapshot could result in errors, we do not recommend that you use snapshots to back up data. We recommend that you instead use database management applications to back up the database of your Acumatica ERP instance.
)))
For details about taking a snapshot, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Snapshots_Add|To Take a Snapshot].[anchor|#section_Snapshot_Contents]
==Selecting the Contents of Snapshots==
When you take a snapshot, you select one of the content options, depending on the intended use of the snapshot. The following content options are available by default:[anchor|#ul_nhd_hzs_tr]
*''Full'': All data related to the tenant
*''Full except Attachments and Wiki'': The full data related to the tenant, excluding attachments and wiki articles
*''Full except Attachments'': The full data related to the tenant, excluding attachments
*''Settings and Business Accounts'': The tenant&rsquo;s complete set of configuration settings and business accounts, including attachments
*''Settings and Business Accounts except Attachments'': The tenant&rsquo;s complete set of configuration settings and business accounts, excluding attachments
*''Settings except Attachments'': The tenant&rsquo;s configuration settings, excluding attachments
*''Settings only'': The tenant&rsquo;s configuration settings, including attachments

The contents of the snapshot—that is, the SQL database tables that are included in the snapshot—are defined by snapshot configuration files with the ''.esc'' extension. Usually these files can be located in '''%Program Files%\Acumatica ERP\&lt;instance name&gt;\App&#95;Data\SnapshotConfigs''', where ''&lt;instance name&gt;'' is the name of the application instance website. {br}

To preserve sensitive data—for example, user passwords and settings for connecting with third-party applications—you can modify snapshot configuration files to preserve such data, down to SQL table fields. You can either exclude tables and table fields from snapshots or replace data in table fields with predefined values. For examples of configuration settings, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Snapshot_Sensitive_Data|Examples of Sensitive Data Preservation in Snapshots].
==Storing Snapshots==
Once a snapshot is created, it appears on the '''Snapshots''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_20|Tenants] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203520|SM203520]) form. Tenant snapshots are stored in the database as tenants with special tenant IDs (negative integers). When you update the application and the database, the stored snapshots are updated as well.{br}

To free disk space, you can export snapshots to store them in an external storage, and then delete obsolete snapshots. Exported snapshots can later be imported back into the application. For details, see [[#export_snapshot|Exporting Snapshots] and [[#import_snapshot|Importing Snapshots] below.((({S:Warn}Snapshots stored in an external storage are not updated when you update your application instance.
)))
Deleting a snapshot is a permanent operation—you won&rsquo;t be able to recover a deleted snapshot. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Snapshots_Delete|To Delete a Snapshot].[anchor|#export_snapshot]
==Exporting Snapshots==
To be exported to external storage, a snapshot should be ''prepared''—that is, the snapshot&rsquo;s data should be saved to a file.  When a snapshot is exported, the system copies the prepared file to an external storage; the snapshot itself remains in the database. For the detailed procedure, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Snapshots_Export|To Export a Snapshot].{br}

An exported snapshot is saved as an archive in ''.zip'' format. It contains the exported data in a collection of either ''.adb'' or ''.xml'' files and the description of the snapshot in ''manifest.xml''. ''Manifest.xml'' carries the snapshot description generated when the snapshot was created and the version of the instance that has been used to prepare the snapshot before export. [anchor|#import_snapshot]
==Importing Snapshots==
You can import an exported snapshot back to an Acumatica ERP instance. The version of the snapshot (that is, the version of the instance used to take the snapshot) must match the version of the destination application instance.((({S:Warn}You can check the snapshot version in ''manifest.xml''.
)))
We recommend that before you import a snapshot, you open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_25|Space Usage] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203525|SM203525]) form and make sure that you have enough free space in the Acumatica ERP database. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Database_Size_Monitoring|Database Size Monitoring and Management].{br}

When you import a snapshot, you can choose whether you want to import customization data or not; if the imported snapshot includes customization data, the data will be automatically restored when you restore the snapshot. 
Thus, if you import the snapshot in a tenant in the same database as the source tenant, you should include all customization data because any customization is database-wide.  If you import the snapshot to another instance with a different set of customizations applied, do not include customization data in the snapshot, or restoration of the snapshot will likely fail.{br}

Customizations may include changes in the database structure (such as changing a field length). These changes may cause conflicts during the insertion of data from the snapshot to your current Acumatica ERP instance (for example, if the length of the inserted field exceeds the maximum length in the database of your current Acumatica ERP instance). You can select whether you want the system to preliminarily match the data from the snapshot with the database structure in your current Acumatica ERP instance, to reveal any conflicts before the system imports the snapshot . When this check is performed and there are conflicts, the system returns an error message that lists all fields from the snapshot that have caused the conflicts. You can resolve these conflicts by changing the database structure in your current Acumatica ERP instance.{br}

An imported snapshot is stored in the database, and you can restore the data from the snapshot whenever you want. For the detailed procedure, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Snapshots_Import|To Import a Snapshot].
==Toggling the Visibility of Snapshots==
In a multitenant configuration, you can sign in to one tenant, and then take a snapshot of any tenant available to you, be it the tenant you signed in to or another tenant that you can access. The snapshots you take are stored within the tenant you are signed in to (the ''base'' tenant); you won&rsquo;t be able to access them if you sign in to another tenant.{br}

Within the base tenant, when a snapshot is taken, it is associated with its source tenant—that is, you must select the tenant the snapshot is associated with in the '''Tenant ID''' box of the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_20|Tenants] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203520|SM203520]) form to see the snapshot in the list on the '''Snapshots''' tab. The ''visibility'' of the snapshot is normal; the associated tenant is displayed for the snapshot in the '''Tenant ID''' column on the '''Snapshots''' tab. To make the snapshot available regardless of the selected tenant, you can increase the visibility of the snapshot. Snapshots with increased visibility are available on the '''Snapshots''' tab regardless of the tenant you select in the '''Tenant ID''' box of the Summary area; the '''Tenant ID''' column on the '''Snapshots''' tab is blank for such snapshots. If you decrease the visibility of a snapshot, the snapshot is associated with the tenant selected on the form. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Snapshots_Visibility|To Toggle the Visibility of a Snapshot].
==Restoring Snapshots==
By restoring a snapshot, you set your tenant data to its state when the snapshot was taken.((({S:Hint}In the destination tenant, a restored snapshot overwrites all the data that is not specifically protected. For more information, see [[#section_Snapshot_Contents|Selecting the Contents of Snapshots] section in this topic.
)))
You can restore a snapshot to only the tenant you are signed in to, regardless of the origin of the snapshot. If the snapshot from which you want to restore data includes customization data, the customization data will be restored automatically.((({S:Warn}If you are going to restore the snapshot in an external database where a different customization set has been applied, the restore operation will likely fail.
)))
If you restore an unsafe snapshot (one that was not taken in maintenance mode), the system displays a warning message, and adds a warning to the '''Help''' > '''About...''' box. We do not recommend that you restore unsafe snapshots in production system because these snapshots can create corrupted data.{br}

We recommend that before you restore a snapshot, you open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_25|Space Usage] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203525|SM203525]) form and make sure that you have enough free space in the Acumatica ERP database. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Database_Size_Monitoring|Database Size Monitoring and Management].{br}

In the destination tenant, a restored snapshot overwrites all the data that 				is not specifically protected. For more information, see  Selecting the Contents of Snapshots Selecting the Contents of Snapshots section in this 				topic. You can restore a snapshot to only the tenant you are signed in to, regardless of the origin 				of the snapshot. If the snapshot from which you want to restore data includes 				customization data, the customization data will be restored automatically. If you are going to restore the snapshot in an external database where a different 				customization set has been applied, the restore operation will likely fail. If you restore an unsafe snapshot (one that was not taken in maintenance mode), the system 				displays a warning message, and adds a warning to the  Help About...  box. We do not recommend that you restore unsafe snapshots in 				production system because these snapshots can create corrupted data. We recommend that before you restore a snapshot, you open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM203525|SM203525]) Space Usage 				(SM203525) form and make sure that you have enough free space in the  Acumatica ERP database.

In Acumatica ERP, the data for all tenants and snapshots is stored in the database and may take a lot of space.

)))
==Monitoring the Database Size==
When you take, import, or restore a snapshot, or when you copy a tenant, the system checks whether the database contains enough space to perform these operations. If the database has enough space available, the system continues the needed operation after the check. If the database does not have enough space, the system returns an error message and interrupts the operation. We recommend that before you perform one of these operations (copying a tenant, or taking, importing, or restoring a snapshot), you make sure that you have enough database space available for your instance.{br}

Before you take a snapshot, you do the following:[anchor|#_ff72342e-a8f1-4270-91eb-bd3f7cce3407]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_25|Space Usage] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203525|SM203525]) form, and click '''Calculate Used Space''' on the form toolbar. (The form initially shows the previously calculated statistics, so you must invoke this action to see the current statistics.)
#On the '''Tenants''' tab, in the '''Size in DB (MB)''' column, find the size of the tenant for which you want to take a snapshot.
#In the '''Free Space''' box of the Summary area, find the free space available for your instance and compare with the tenant size you found in Step 2.

Before you import a tenant, you do the following:[anchor|#_9119f876-20ff-40bb-a5bb-db8baec1cf13]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_25|Space Usage] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203525|SM203525]) form, and click '''Calculate Used Space''' on the form toolbar. (The form initially shows the previously calculated statistics, so you must invoke this action to see the current statistics.)
#In the snapshot folder on you hard drive, find the size of the <tt>manifest.xml</tt> file.
#In the '''Free Space''' box of the Summary area, find the free space available for your instance and compare with the size of the <tt>manifest.xml</tt> file you found in Step 2.

Before you restore a snapshot, you do the following:[anchor|#_8003a043-f3f7-46cf-9208-f95688b6e410]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_25|Space Usage] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203525|SM203525]) form, and click '''Calculate Used Space''' on the form toolbar. (The form initially shows the previously calculated statistics, so you must invoke this action to see the current statistics.)
#On the '''Snapshots''' tab, in the '''Size in DB (MB)''' column, find the size of the snapshot that you want to restore.
#On the '''Tenants''' tab, in the '''Size in DB (MB)''' column, find the size of the destination tenant.
#Subtract the size of the snapshot to restore from the size of the destination tenant.
#In the '''Free Space''' box of the Summary area, find the free space available for your instance and compare with the size difference you have calculated in Step 4.

Before you copy a tenant, you do the following:[anchor|#_f1de7657-a609-4f2a-b3f8-8ca162ebd222]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_25|Space Usage] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203525|SM203525]) form, and click '''Calculate Used Space''' on the form toolbar. (When you first open the form, it shows the previously calculated statistics, so you must invoke this action to see the current statistics.)
#On the '''Tenants''' tab, in the '''Size in DB (MB)''' column, find the size of the tenant that you want to copy, and the size of the destination tenant.
#Subtract the size of the tenant to copy from the size of the destination tenant.
#In the '''Free Space''' box of the Summary area, find the free space available for your instance and compare it with the size difference you have calculated in Step 3.
[anchor|#_b777b43d-c86a-4da6-894e-b815e68066fc]
==Cleaning Up the Database==
To clean up the database so that it has sufficient space for users to perform needed operations, you can open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_25|Space Usage] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203525|SM203525]) form, view the system calculations of the used space, find the tenants and snapshots that can be removed, and view the tables that are consuming a lot of database space. You can then remove the unnecessary tenants, snapshots, attachments, and schedule histories by using the forms on which they were created or initiated.{br}

After you have viewed the system calculations of the current space usage, to delete unused tenants from the database, you do the following:[anchor|#_6b357e36-7a23-41fe-bdec-02a28db44654]
#On the '''Tenants''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_25|Space Usage] form, you find the tenants with the ''Unlicensed''or ''Test Tenant'' status, neither of which reflects a tenant in use.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_20|Tenants] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203520|SM203520]) form, you delete these unused tenants. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Multitenancy_Delete_Tenant|To Delete a Tenant by Using the Web Interface].

After you have viewed the system calculations of the current space usage, to delete unused snapshots from the database, you do the following:[anchor|#_b8c2ece5-54a4-413a-9460-609e8b162cc3]
#On the '''Snapshots''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_25|Space Usage] form, you find the snapshots that have already been exported, that are unused, or that can be stored on disk rather than in the database.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_20|Tenants] form, you export to a file all snapshots that you may need in the future. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Snapshots_Export|To Export a Snapshot].
#:((({S:Warn}Exported snapshots are not updated when you update your instance. Thus, if you export these snapshots, they will become unusable after you update the instance, so you should import them again before any updates are performed.
)))
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_20|Tenants] form, you delete from the database unused snapshots and snapshots that have been exported. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Snapshots_Delete|To Delete a Snapshot].

On the '''Tables''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_25|Space Usage] form, you can view the list of tables with data related to all tenants and snapshots in your instance, including the size of each table in the Acumatica ERP database. This can help you to identify the actions you should take to reduce the size of these tables. The following tables generally use most of the database space of the Acumatica ERP instance:[anchor|#_23935b8c-46fb-42c8-b31e-aa0b9cd532f7]
*''UploadFileRevision'': Contains information about the database size used for attachments. To find the unused attachments (so that you can delete them), you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_20|Search in Files] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202520|SM202520]) form. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Delete_Attachment|To Delete an Attachment File].
*''AUScheduleHistory'': Contains information about the database size used for saving the history of the schedules. To review the forms where the automatic processes are scheduled, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_30|Automation Schedule Statuses] ([~/?ScreenId=SM205030|SM205030]) form. For information on how to delete the history of schedules, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Delete_Schedule_History|To Delete Histories of Scheduled Processes].
*''AuditHistory'': Contains information about the database size used for saving the audit history. To review the audit history, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_55_30|Audit History] ([~/?ScreenId=SM205530|SM205530]) form. You cannot delete the audit history, so we recommend that you turn on the field-level audit for no more than few forms.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[To Take a Snapshot To take a snapshot of the tenant configuration and data, you use the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM203520|SM203520]) Tenants (SM203520) form. Published customization are         also included in the snapshot. For more information, see  Tenant Snapshots. To Take a Snapshot of Your Tenant We strongly recommend that you create             snapshots in maintenance mode (that is, when the system is locked out for maintenance,             as described in  To Schedule the System Lockout).             Otherwise, snapshots can contain corrupted data (for example, if any transactions were             in progress during the creation of the snapshot). If required, sign in to the tenant whose data you want to copy. Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM203520|SM203520]) Tenants (SM203520) form. In the  Tenant ID  box, select the tenant whose snapshot you want           to create. On the form toolbar, click  Create Snapshot  to open the              Create Snapshot  dialog box.  In the dialog box, notice the             source tenant in the  Source Tenant  box. In the  Description  box, type a short description of the           snapshot. In the  Export Mode  box, select the data to be included in the           snapshot. Published customization are included in the snapshot automatically. If you want to create a backup of your data we recommend that you back up             the  Acumatica ERP database rather than create a snapshot with the  Full  export mode. Optional: If you want to export the snapshot immediately after creation, select the              Prepare for Export  check box.  Alternatively, you can prepare a             snapshot for export later, before exporting the snapshot, as described in  To Export a Snapshot. Optional: If you have selected the  Prepare for Export  check box,           you should specify the format the system uses to save exported data. Select one of the             following: Binary : The exported data is saved in a collection of  .adb  files. XML : The exported data is saved in a collection of  .xml  files. Click  OK  to close the dialog box and initiate the process of           creating the snapshot.  Creating a snapshot may take a significant amount             of time, depending on the volume of data entered for the tenant. If you plan to restore the snapshot in another tenant of your  Acumatica ERP instance, click  Change Visibility  on the table toolbar to make           the snapshot visible in other tenants of the instance. A snapshot appears in the list of snapshots on the  Snapshots  tab         under the source tenant. You can restore the data from the snapshot any time you want         to. ]]></column>

To access Acumatica ERP, an individual must have a user account in the system. Each account includes a login, a password, and other properties, such as the user&rsquo;s first and last name, email address, password policy options, and access rights.{br}

User accounts in Acumatica ERP can be local (created and managed directly in Acumatica ERP) or created and managed in external identity management systems, such as Microsoft Active Directory and Microsoft Azure Active Directory. To use the user accounts of external identity management systems, you must set up integration in Acumatica ERP. For details, see [HelpRoot_Integration\US__con_Integration_with_Active_Directory|Integration with Active Directory] and [HelpRoot_Integration\US__con_AzureAD_Integration|Integration with Azure Active Directory]. {br}

To make the authentication process easier for your users, you can configure single sign-on with external identity providers, such as Google and Microsoft Account. For details, see [HelpRoot_Integration\US__con_SSO_with_Google|Single Sign-On with Google] and [HelpRoot_Integration\US__con_SSO_with_Microsoft_Account|Single Sign-On with Microsoft Account].{br}

==Security Policies for a User Account==
You can use the following capabilities of Acumatica ERP to apply your organization&rsquo;s security policies to individual user accounts on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) form: [anchor|#_63164dc9-7332-4906-ba32-1f4356f30865]
*Specifying password policy settings for an individual user. You can do the following:
**Allow the user to recover the user name and reset the password through email. If this capability is enabled, the user can click the '''Forgot Your Credentials?''' link on the Sign-In page of Acumatica ERP and receive an email with a link to the password reset form. For more information, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\Login_and_Logout|Access to Your Acumatica ERP Instance]. 
**Allow the user to change the password at will.
**Prevent the user from ever being prompted to change the password.
**Require the user to change the password on the next login.
*:((({S:Warn}User account password policy settings are not available for domain users.
)))
*Limiting the range of IP addresses from which a user can sign in to your Acumatica ERP instance. If the user attempts to access the system from a computer with an IP address that is outside of the specified range, access will be denied.
*Disabling a user account to temporarily prevent the user from signing in to your Acumatica ERP instance.

If you use the user types functionality (for details, see [[#_775858a7-972a-4226-ac5d-7e74ae894419|User Types]) you can specify the following security settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_25_00|User Types] ([~/?ScreenId=EP202500|EP202500]) form that will be applied to all users of this type:[anchor|#_9fc1df49-697e-41fd-8806-da0d40d7fcbc]
*Allow users with linked contacts to use their emails as their login to the system.
*Force new users to change their password at the first login.
*Force new users to activate their account.

If you need to audit activity of a particular user, you can track the following information on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) form:[anchor|#_8cdf6c92-e809-408c-ab73-c308304cc83f]
*The date and time of the last login.
*The most recent date when the account was temporarily locked out.
*The date and time of the most recent password change.
*The number of unsuccessful attempts the user made to sign into the account. 

For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Site_Security_Options|Security Policies in Acumatica ERP].
==Management of User Accounts==
During ongoing maintenance of Acumatica ERP, you may have tasks to add a new user account or to change settings of an existing user account. You perform the following steps to configure a user account on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) form:[anchor|#_0c7c906e-f315-49b6-8794-972554b4046c]
#You specify or change the login, password, user&rsquo;s first and last name, and email address.
#Optional: You assign the user account the appropriate user type. For details, see [[#_775858a7-972a-4226-ac5d-7e74ae894419|User Types].
#Optional: You set up password policies for the user account. For details, see [[#_a4dc92fd-b47a-4ac1-8cf0-951188abd256|Security Policies for a User Account].
#You assign the user account the appropriate user roles. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Role-Based_Access|Role-Based Access]. 

For a detailed procedure of creating a user account, see [HelpRoot_Administration\US__how_Create_User_Account|To Create a Local User Account].{br}

If users of the system are using the Acumatica mobile app, the information about their devices that allow push notifications from the app is stored in their Acumatica ERP user profiles on the '''Devices''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) form. When a user signs in to the mobile app for the first time, the application sends details about the device to Acumatica ERP, and then the information is updated with each subsequent sign-in. {br}

You can delete any device listed on this tab by clicking it and using the standard button on the table toolbar, or you can delete all devices for a user by clicking the '''Delete All''' button on this toolbar. Also, you can control to which devices the system can send push notifications. You can use the '''Turn On Notifications''' check box to selectively allow or disallow these notifications for devices. You can also enable or disable sending push notifications for all user&rsquo;s devices by clicking the '''Enable All''' and '''Disable All''' buttons, respectively, on the table toolbar.
==Location Tracking of Users==
In Acumatica ERP, you can view the GPS location coordinates of users that are tracked through their mobile devices. To be able to view a user&rsquo;s coordinates in the system, you have to configure location tracking for each necessary user on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) form. You use the '''Location Tracking''' tab to turn on the tracking functionality for the selected user, specify the time and distance intervals at which the coordinates will be tracked in the system, and specify on which days and during which time periods the system registers the user location. For detailed instructions on how to turn on and configure the location tracking, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__HOW_To_Turn_on_Location_Tracking|To Turn On Location Tracking of a User].((({S:Warn}For GPS location coordinates to be tracked, on the user&rsquo;s device, GPS location recording has to be switched on.
)))
You can view the history of the location coordinates of all users that have been tracked in the system on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_20_00|Location Tracking History] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202000|SM202000]) form.[anchor|#_775858a7-972a-4226-ac5d-7e74ae894419]
==User Types==
Your company may need to give your partners limited access to Acumatica ERP—for instance, to facilitate the process of entering contacts or customer orders. In such a scenario, you may need some way to segregate users that are internal to your company from external users, or even to give your partners the means to create and manage their own users in Acumatica ERP, thus freeing your administrators of the responsibility to manage these users. You can address these requirements through the use of user types in Acumatica ERP.{br}

Each user type can be either employee-related or contact-related:[anchor|#_d3017f42-de9e-4007-ba83-9e79356bbd44]
*An employee-related user type is associated with employees in your system. These user types are intended for users who are internal to your company (generally employees of your company and possibly consultants that you consider part of your company).
*A contact-related user type is associated with a contact in your system. These user types are intended for users who are external to the company—for example, partners or contacts. As opposed to employee-related user types, you can use contact-related user types to delegate the right to create users, as described in [HelpRoot_Administration\US__how_Delegation_User_Creation_Rights|To Delegate the Right to Create Users].

For each user type, you need to specify the set of roles that can be assigned to users of this type. For the procedure to add a user type, see [HelpRoot_Administration\US__how_Add_Contact_User_Type|To Add a User Type].
==Ability to Track User Accounts==
You can use the following forms to track details on user accounts:[anchor|#_69492678-841d-4501-bfb2-9d0482d244ef]
*Print or view a list of users in your Acumatica ERP instance by using the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\SM_65_05_00|User List] ([~/?ScreenId=SM650500|SM650500]) report.
*View the access rights for each user to any system objects (suites, modules, forms, and form elements) by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_55|Access Rights by User] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201055|SM201055]) form.

The user type you have selected                     determines whether this box can be left blank and what type of account you can                     select. If you have selected an employee-related user type in the                          User Type  box or left it blank, you can select an                     employee account or leave the  Linked Entity  box blank. If you have                     selected a contact-related user type in the  User Type                      box, you must select a contact account here or add a new contact.  Optional: Fill in the  First Name  and  Last Name  boxes. If you                     selected an employee or contact account in the previous step, these boxes will                     be filled in automatically. Optional: In the  Email  box, type the user's email                     address. If you selected an employee or contact account in the previous step,                     this box will be filled in automatically. If an email is not specified in the                     employee or contact account you need to add it by using a corresponding form:                     the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) Employees (EP203000) form or the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) Contacts (CR302000) form. The email will be used for                     sending information to the user, such as login information. On the  Roles  tab, select the necessary user roles that                     will be assigned to the user. They will determine the user's access rights to                     the system objects.

To access Acumatica ERP, users must pass authentication to confirm their identity (see [HelpRoot_Administration\US__con_User_Accounts|User Accounts in Acumatica ERP]). Then users pass authorization to determine their access rights to the system objects, such as forms. Users can access only the objects they are allowed to use and perform only the actions they are authorized to based on their access rights. In Acumatica ERP, a system object to which access rights can be set up can be a particular form, container of form elements, form element, or wiki.{br}

If Acumatica ERP is integrated with Microsoft Active Directory, Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services, or Microsoft Azure Active Directory, the user&rsquo;s roles may be automatically assigned, based on Active Directory groups. For details, see [HelpRoot_Integration\US__con_Integration_with_Active_Directory|Integration with Active Directory], [HelpRoot_Integration\US__con_ADFS_Integration|Integration with AD FS], and [HelpRoot_Integration\US__con_AzureAD_Integration|Integration with Azure Active Directory].{br}

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
 Acumatica ERP uses roles to restrict access to the system. You assign users one role or multiple roles, and based on these assignments, the users are then granted the appropriate levels of access to system objects. You never assign access rights to individual users. With this approach, you can quickly and easily control access to system objects because changing the access rights of a role affects all the users with the role assigned. A user with no role assigned has no access to system objects.{br}{TOC}
==Roles==
Users who work with Acumatica ERP have specific job responsibilities that define their access level to forms, records, and operations on the records. User roles in Acumatica ERP are sets of access rights designed for convenient management of access rights for users with similar responsibilities in the system.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_05|User Roles] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201005|SM201005]) form, you create a role and assign it to as many user accounts as needed. If you need to change access rights for all users assigned to a role, you change the settings of the role instead of editing each user's permissions. When new users are hired in your organization, you assign a role to a new user. When existing users change their position in the company, you simply change set of roles according to their new responsibilities. {br}

We recommend that you configure the roles so that a user with a role has only the access rights necessary to perform typical tasks. It is better to give a user multiple roles than to create complicated roles that overlap with existing ones. For example, suppose that the ''Accounting Manager'' role has broader access rights than the ''Accountant'' role. Instead of giving the ''Account Manager'' role the same privileges the ''Accountant'' role has, give a user in a managerial position the ''Accountant'' role along with the ''Accounting Manager'' role. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Role_Configuration|Access Rights for Roles].((({S:Hint}The process of defining task-based roles requires in-depth knowledge of both the organization&rsquo;s business processes and the Acumatica ERP approach to security. 
)))
==Built-In Roles==
For ease of defining and administering roles, Acumatica ERP provides a set of built-in roles that are stored in the System company (for details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Support_of_Multiple_Companies|Support of Multiple Tenants]). Built-in roles are always supplied with the system and cannot be deleted. {br}

Some of these roles grant the users access to special functionality, and some of the roles are used by the system and should not be assigned to users manually.{br}

The following built-in roles are available in the system:[anchor|#ul_bgy_lrm_gk]
*''Administrator'': A user with this role has full access to all system objects, and any access restrictions to system objects are not applied to this role.

==Guest Roles==
Users from outside your organization may need access to your Acumatica ERP instance if they are partners or customers of your organization. We recommend that they access necessary data through Acumatica Self-Service                         Portal. You can perform the following steps to provide external users with the rights to use Acumatica Self-Service                         Portal: [anchor|#_93f4fbee-d751-4cae-a090-48e843273ead]
#You create a contact-related user type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_25_00|User Types] ([~/?ScreenId=EP202500|EP202500]) form, as described in [HelpRoot_Administration\US__how_Add_Contact_User_Type|To Add a User Type].
#You add at least one user role with the '''Guest Role''' check box selected in the list of allowed roles of the created user type. You can use the built-in ''Portal User'' role or create a new one.
#You assign the external user account with the created user type, as described in [HelpRoot_Administration\US__how_Create_User_Account|To Create a Local User Account]. 

 For more information, see [HelpRoot_SS_Portal_Admin\SP__mng_Access|Managing Access to Self-Service Portal].
==Roles and Access Rights==
In Acumatica ERP, you can control a role&rsquo;s access to system entities, from the workspace level, which is the most broad, down to the form element level, which is the most specific. The available levels of access depend on the system entity type. For more information about configuring access rights, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Role_Configuration|Access Rights for Roles]. 
==An Example of Roles and Access Rights==
Consider an example of some roles a business might set, as shown in the illustration below (with full or ''Delete'' access rights shown in blue and ''View Only'' access rights shown in purple): [anchor|#ul_q42_mfn_gk]
*''Accountant'': Allows its members full access to journal entries and schedules, and limited (''View Only'') access to allocations.
*''AR Administrator'': Allows its members full access to accounts receivable documents; these members may also view accounts payable documents and budgets.
*''AP Administrator'': Allows its members full access to accounts payable documents; in addition, users with the role may view accounts receivable documents and budgets.
*''Accounting Manager'': Allows its members full access to allocations and budgets; these members may view other user accounts too.
*''Security Officer'': Allows its members full access rights to user accounts, roles, and restriction groups.
 Roles and User Access to Entities[anchor|#image_kbh_v1t_th][image:UserGuide/Images/Role-Based_Access_Roles_access.gif|popup|250px]
Note that some users have only one role assigned, while other users have multiple roles, in accordance with their responsibilities. A user&rsquo;s access to an entity is defined by the most permissive level of access among the roles assigned to this user. With the roles shown here, User 6 (with both the ''Accounting Manager'' and ''AP Administrator'' roles assigned) has full access to budgets from the ''Accounting Manager'' role, rather than view-only access from the ''AP Administrator'' role.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Role-Based Access  Acumatica ERP uses roles to restrict access to the system. You assign users one role or                 multiple roles, and based on these assignments, the users are then granted the                 appropriate levels of access to system objects. You never assign access rights to                 individual users. With this approach, you can quickly and easily control access to                 system objects because changing the access rights of a role affects all the users                 with the role assigned. A user with no role assigned has no access to system                 objects. Roles Users who work with  Acumatica ERP have specific job responsibilities that define their access level to forms,                 records, and operations on the records. User roles in  Acumatica ERP are sets of access rights designed for convenient management of access rights for                 users with similar responsibilities in the system. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201005|SM201005]) User Roles (SM201005) form, you create a role and                 assign it to as many user accounts as needed. If you need to change access rights                 for all users assigned to a role, you change the settings of the role instead of                 editing each user's permissions. When new users are hired in your organization, you                 assign a role to a new user. When existing users change their position in the                 company, you simply change set of roles according to their new responsibilities.  We recommend that you configure the roles so that a user with a role has only the                 access rights necessary to perform typical tasks. It is better to give a user                 multiple roles than to create complicated roles that overlap with existing ones. For                 example, suppose that the  Accounting Manager  role has broader access rights                 than the  Accountant  role. Instead of giving the  Account Manager  role                 the same privileges the  Accountant  role has, give a user in a managerial                 position the  Accountant  role along with the  Accounting Manager  role.                 For more information, see  Access Rights for Roles. The process of defining task-based roles requires in-depth knowledge of                 both the organization's business processes and the  Acumatica ERP approach to security.  Built-In Roles For ease of defining and administering roles,  Acumatica ERP provides a set of built-in roles that are stored in the System company (for                 details, see  Support of Multiple Tenants). Built-in                 roles are always supplied with the system and cannot be deleted.  Some of these roles grant the users access to special functionality, and some of the                 roles are used by the system and should not be assigned to users manually. The following built-in roles are available in the system: Administrator : A user with this role has full access to all system                     objects, and any access restrictions to system objects are not applied to this                     role. Therefore we recommend that you assign users to this role only during                     initial system setup so they can define roles and enter users. Then assign the                     role only in extraordinary cases. We recommend that you create a user role for                     system administrators with access only to  Acumatica ERP forms that are used for configuration and management of the system. A                         user with this role cannot publish reports and modify original dashboards                         (which have an owner role other than  Administrator ).

Users with the  CS Admin  role also have                     full access to row-level security settings and most of the integration                     functions.

Guest Roles Users from outside your organization may need access to your  Acumatica ERP instance if they are partners or customers of your organization. We recommend                 that they access necessary data through  Acumatica Self-Service                         Portal. You can perform the following steps to provide external users with the rights to                 use  Acumatica Self-Service                         Portal:  You create a contact-related user type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP202500|EP202500]) User Types                     (EP202500) form, as described in  To Add a User Type. You add at least one user role with the  Guest Role  check                     box selected in the list of allowed roles of the created user type. You can use                     the built-in  Portal User  role or create a new one. You assign the external user account with the created user type, as described in                          To Create a Local User Account.   For more information, see  Managing Access to Self-Service Portal. Roles and Access Rights In  Acumatica ERP, you can control a role's access to system entities, from the workspace level,                 which is the most broad, down to the form element level, which is the most specific.                 The available levels of access depend on the system entity type. For more                 information about configuring access rights, see  Access Rights for Roles.  An Example of Roles and Access Rights Consider an example of some                 roles a business might set, as shown in the illustration below (with full or                      Delete  access rights shown in blue and  View Only  access rights                 shown in purple):  Accountant : Allows its members full access to journal entries and                     schedules, and limited ( View Only ) access to allocations. AR Administrator : Allows its members full access to accounts receivable                     documents; these members may also view accounts payable documents and                     budgets. AP Administrator : Allows its members full access to accounts payable                     documents; in addition, users with the role may view accounts receivable                     documents and budgets. Accounting Manager : Allows its members full access to allocations and                     budgets; these members may view other user accounts too. Security Officer : Allows its members full access rights to user accounts,                     roles, and restriction groups.  Roles and User Access to Entities Note                 that some users have only one role assigned, while other users have multiple roles,                 in accordance with their responsibilities. A user's access to an entity is defined                 by the most permissive level of access among the roles assigned to this user. With                 the roles shown here, User 6 (with both the  Accounting Manager  and  AP                     Administrator  roles assigned) has full access to budgets from the                      Accounting Manager  role, rather than view-only access from the  AP                     Administrator  role.

In Acumatica ERP access rights can be set to particular system objects: forms, containers (of form elements), form elements, and wikis.{br}

To restrict the access rights that users have to system objects, you assign users ''roles'', as described in [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Role-Based_Access|Role-Based Access]. For example, suppose that you define the ''Junior Accountant'' and ''Senior Accountant'' roles. Users with both roles will work with the forms related to accounts payable. Users with the ''Junior Accountant'' role assigned can only enter bills, while users with the ''Senior Accountant'' role assigned can enter bills and approve them for payment. {br}

There are two ways to set up access rights for roles in Acumatica ERP:[anchor|#_cf00f343-8e1a-493c-ae8a-7d5f255901a0]
*To set up access rights for a particular role to multiple system objects, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_25|Access Rights by Role] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201025|SM201025]) form. For example, you use this way when you have created a new role and want to set up access to all necessary forms for it. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\US__how_Access_Rights_by_Role_Configuration|To Configure Access Rights for a Selected User Role].
*To set up access rights to a particular system object for multiple roles, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_20|Access Rights by Screen] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201020|SM201020]) form. You use this way primarily when you want to configure access rights workspace by workspace, or form by form. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\US__how_Access_Rights_by_Screen_Configuration|To Configure Access Rights to System Objects].

The specific levels of access rights to system objects you select for roles depend on the object type for which you are specifying access rights. For some objects, you can only permit or deny access, but for others you can set up partial access (for example, view-only access). For details about levels of access rights for system objects in Acumatica ERP, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Roles_and_Access_Rights|Levels of Access Rights].[anchor|#_3cdf7488-d72b-468c-b640-c82a84cda4f3]((({S:Warn}You have to be very careful when you assign multiple roles to a user account because these roles may have different levels of access rights to system objects. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Roles_and_Access_Rights#_2708bbea-95b1-4a47-8cc5-3bbcb3dc961f|Access Rights Level for a User Account].
)))
You can set the access each role has to the wikis available in your company by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_20_15|Wiki Access by Role] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202015|SM202015]) form. To view and update the map of any wiki, use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_20_10|Wiki Site Map]  ([~/?ScreenId=SM202010|SM202010]) form. For details about managing access to wikis, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Wiki_Access_Setup|Wiki Access Management].{br}

This topic describes the most common tasks of access rights configuration.{br}{TOC}
== Initial Setup of Access Rights==
After you have installed Acumatica ERP and created user roles, all roles that you have created have the ''Not Set'' access level set to all forms. The nested objects (containers and elements) have the ''Inherited'' access level. [anchor|#_8c4725fa-1fab-4e32-b2b8-511e411750a8]((({S:Danger}The ''Not Set'' access level indicates that all roles have access to the forms until at least one role is assigned the ''Revoked'' or ''Granted'' access rights. This role can be any role in the system. All roles with the ''Not Set'' level are then denied access to the form.
)))
You need to set up the access rights that roles have to the system objects that will be used by users with the roles in their work. The most frequent scenarios of access rights setup are the following:[anchor|#_1b65e78f-d81d-412d-bdee-2103a4e118cd]
*The role should have access to all forms within a particular workspace (or particular workspaces). For example, suppose that chief accountants should work with all the forms related to the financial functionality. These forms are grouped into several workspaces. For the role you define for chief accountants, you can specify the access rights level to a system object at the workspace level, and the system will automatically apply this access rights level to all nested objects. For a detailed procedure, see [HelpRoot_Administration\US__how_Initial_Access_Rights_Configuration|To Initially Configure Access Rights].
*Users with the role should work with particular forms. For example, suppose that junior accountants should work only with particular forms within the '''Payables''' workspace. For the role you set up for these accountants, you need to set up access rights to the nested system objects manually. For a detailed procedure, see [HelpRoot_Administration\US__how_Access_Rights_by_Role_Configuration|To Configure Access Rights for a Selected User Role].
[anchor|#section_wgv_hbd_yl]
==Management of Access Rights==
During ongoing maintenance of Acumatica ERP, you may have tasks to change roles&rsquo; access rights to some system objects. You can change these access rights in different ways, depending on your task, as shown in the following examples:[anchor|#_fffb2a7c-2b1a-4dbf-bbce-ef93b13f91ed]
*If you want users with a particular role to work with all forms within a workspace or multiple workspaces (for example, users with the ''Chief Accountant'' role should have access to all the workspaces related to the financial functionality). For the role, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_25|Access Rights by Role] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201025|SM201025]) form, you set the ''Granted'' access level for all needed workspaces, and the system will automatically set the ''Delete'' access level for all forms and the ''Granted'' access level for all reports within the workpaces.
*If you want to hide all forms that belong to a workspace from users with a particular role so these users cannot work with the forms of the workspace (for example, warehouse workers should work only with the inventory and order management functionality and view Help; these users should not see the forms in other workspaces in the system). For the role, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_25|Access Rights by Role] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201025|SM201025]) form, you set the ''Revoked'' access rights level for all the workspaces to whose forms you want to restrict access. The system hides from the main menu workspaces within which the ''Revoked'' level is set to all forms.
*Suppose that you want to permit access to a particular form for a particular role so that a user with the role can access this form from another form. For example, a user with the ''Junior System Administrator'' role should not have access to the workspaces that relate to company organization, but the user needs to use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) forms to create user accounts. (For details on user accounts creation, see [HelpRoot_Administration\US__con_User_Accounts|User Accounts in Acumatica ERP].) In this case, for the role, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_25|Access Rights by Role] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201025|SM201025]) form, you set the ''Revoked'' access rights level to the related workspaces and the ''Delete'' access level to the forms. The system displays restricted workspaces in the main menu, but only links to allowed forms are visible inside a workspace.
*If you want to restrict access to a particular form element (for example, only a user with the ''Chief Accountant'' role can release documents on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_20_00|Payments and Applications] ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) form), you set the ''Edit'' access rights level to this element for the role that should use it, and the ''Revoked'' access rights level for all roles that should not use it.
*If you need to reset access rights for a user role to all forms, you can reset access rights to ''Not Set'' for this role to all workspaces; the system will automatically apply the access level to all nested objects. For a detailed procedure, [HelpRoot_Administration\US__how_Reset_Access_Rights|To Reset Access Rights to All Forms in a Workspace]. 
*If you want to configure a role for the users who will be working with wikis, including Help wiki, you give the role access to the following:
**The wiki-related forms by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_25|Access Rights by Role] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201025|SM201025]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_20|Access Rights by Screen] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201020|SM201020]) form
**The wiki articles by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_20_15|Wiki Access by Role] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202015|SM202015]) form
*:For details about managing access to wikis, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Wiki_Access_Setup|Wiki Access Management].

With Acumatica ERP, you can control access to system objects at broad and granular levels, down to the control of form elements, such as buttons, text boxes, and check boxes.

You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_25|Access Rights by Role] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201025|SM201025]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_20|Access Rights by Screen] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201020|SM201020]) forms to manage access rights. For more information about access rights, see [HelpRoot_Administration\US__con_Access_Rights|User Access Rights].{br}

You can set the access each role has to the wikis available in your company by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_20_15|Wiki Access by Role] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202015|SM202015]) form.

This topic describes the levels of access rights available to system objects.{br}{TOC}
==Access Rights at the Workspace Level==
In Acumatica ERP, you do not set up access to a particular workspace itself. Instead, by setting access rights at the workspace level, you set up access for all the nested objects. If you change the access level to any nested object of a workspace, the system will change the access level to ''Multiple Rights'' at the workspace level. {br}

The system displays a workspace with the ''Multiple Rights'' level in the main menu. On the workspace dashboard, the system displays only forms for which access is not restricted for a particular user.{br}

 Keep in mind that a form may belong to multiple workspaces. If you set an access level to one of these workspaces (that is, to all forms in the workspace), the system will assign to a form that belongs to multiple workspaces the access level set most recently for one of these workspaces. The system will then change the access level for other workspaces to which the form belongs to the ''Multiple Rights'' option, if these workspaces had a different access level. For example, the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_40_20_00|Vendor Details] form can be accessed from the '''Payables''' and '''Purchases''' workspaces. Both workspaces have the ''Granted'' access level for the ''Purchasing'' role. You change an access level for the form under the '''Payables''' workspace to ''Revoked''. The system displays the new access level of the form under the '''Purchases''' workspace and changes access level to ''Multiple Rights'' for both workspaces.{br}

The following table summarizes the levels of access rights that roles can have to all forms that belong to a particular workspace of Acumatica ERP.[anchor|#table_fzs_pqd_wj]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="20%" ! Level
!width="80%" ! Description
|- 
| ''Multiple Rights''
| Means that a role has different access levels to the nested objects of a workspace. If you change the access level for the workspace, the system will automatically apply the new level to all nested objects.
|- 
| ''Not Set''
| Allows all roles to have access to all forms in a workspace until ''Revoked'' or ''Granted'' access level is set to the workspace for at least one role. After that, a role with this level is denied access to the forms in the workspace.
|- 
| ''Revoked''
| 
Denies the role access to all the forms in a workspace; for users with the role, the workspace and its forms do not appear in the main menu. 
|- 
| ''Granted''
| Allows the role access to all the forms in a workspace. You can, however, limit or revoke access to particular forms within the workspace for the role. In this case, the system will change the access level for the workspace to ''Multiple Rights''. 
|}((({S:Warn}You can set up access rights to individual forms in the '''Hidden''' node (which cannot be accessed from the main menu), but not to the node itself.
)))
You can reset a role&rsquo;s access level at the workspace level (that is, the access level to all the forms in a workspace) to ''Not Set'' any time you want. For a procedure that describes how to reset access rights, see [HelpRoot_Administration\US__how_Reset_Access_Rights|To Reset Access Rights to All Forms in a Workspace].[anchor|#section_whj_vn2_wj]
==Access Rights at the Form Level==
Within each workspace, you can set the access rights that roles have to Acumatica ERP forms, which affects what users with those roles can access. The level of access rights to the form is inherited by the entities and records that can be created by using the form. You can set any of the following levels of access rights to forms. [anchor|#table_y1t_pqd_wj]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="20%" ! Level
!width="80%" ! Description
|- 
| ''Not Set''
| When assigned to all roles, allows all roles to have access to the form until access rights are set to any other level for at least one role. After at least one role has been assigned another level of access rights, access to the form is denied for a role with this access level.
|- 
| ''Revoked''
| Denies the role access to the form and its functionality.
|- 
| ''View Only''
| Gives the role restricted access to the form and its functionality. This level allows users with the role to view the form and any records associated with the form (in drop-down lists on other forms).
This level forbids users with the role to edit details about any record, create new records or entities of the type, and delete records.
|- 
| ''Edit''
| Gives the role restricted access to the form and its functionality. This level allows users with the role to view the form, select records, and edit details about any record.
This level forbids users with the role to create new records or entities of the type, and to delete records.The '''Clipboard''' button is available on the form toolbar for users with the role.
|- 
| ''Insert''
| Gives the role restricted access to the form and its functionality. This level allows users with the role to view the form, select records, edit details about any record, and create new records or entities of the type.
This level forbids users with the role to delete records.The '''Clipboard''' and '''Insert''' buttons are available on the form toolbar for users with the role.
|- 
| ''Delete''
| Gives the role complete access to the form and its functionality. This level encompasses the capabilities of the ''View Only'', ''Edit'', and ''Insert'' levels, while also giving users with the role the ability to delete records. 
For users with the role, the '''Clipboard''', '''Insert''', and '''Delete''' buttons are available on the form toolbar.
|}
By default, a new role has the ''Not Set'' access level.{br}

If you change access rights for a user role to a form or a form element, your changes affect only this form or form element. To make the form available in the navigation pane to a user with this role, set the access level for the form to the ''View Only'' level or more permissive.
==Access Rights to Containers of Form Elements==
Each form includes containers of elements, such as nested forms, tabs, and grids. Each container includes multiple elements and actions. You can restrict access to any of these containers on the form. The level of access rights a role has to the container is inherited by the entities and records created by using the container, if applicable. For example, if you permit access for a user role to a grid, a user with this role can access all records in this grid. By default, containers inherit access level from the form to which they belong. You can set any of the following levels of access rights to the containers.{br}

==Access Rights to Form Elements==
By default, a role&rsquo;s access rights to the form elements and actions are inherited from the role&rsquo;s access level to the container of form elements to which elements and actions belong. Thus, you should set the role&rsquo;s access level to the container of form elements before setting an access level to an element or an action. Then you can set access rights to the form elements and actions. You can set up the following levels of access rights to form elements.[anchor|#table_kgx_3h2_wj]

If a particular form toolbar contains form-specific buttons, you can deny access for the role to these buttons, by setting ''Revoked'' for the buttons. You can revoke access to some of the elements to hide their contents from users with ''View Only'' access level. ((({S:Hint}Configuring a role&rsquo;s access rights at the form control level requires in-depth knowledge of Acumatica ERP functionality.

==Access Rights Level for a User Account==
The level of access rights a user account has to a system object is defined by the user roles assigned to the user. If a user has multiple roles assigned and the roles have different access levels to the system object, the following general rule is used: Acumatica ERP applies the most permissive access level among the roles. For example, suppose that a user is assigned the ''Employee'' and ''Sales Manager'' roles. The ''Employee'' role has the ''Revoked'' access level at the '''Inventory''' workspace level, and the ''Sales Manager'' role has the ''Granted'' access level at the same level. With these settings, the user has the ''Granted'' access level to the forms in the '''Inventory''' workspace.{br}

The algorithm of calculating access rights differs from the general rule described in the previous paragraph for a user with multiple roles assigned, some or all of which have the ''Inherited'' access level (which is applied to form element containers and form elements by default). For this user, the following rules are used to calculate access rights to a form element container or form element:{br}

[anchor|#_1531e08b-650b-4e5c-8952-2de11b28aa2a]
*If all roles have the ''Inherited'' access level to the particular form element container or form element, the resulting access level is the most permissive access level of the system object at the next highest level—the form (for a form element container) or the form element container (for a form element).
*If you have explicitly specified an access level to the particular form element container or form element for at least one role, while the other roles have the ''Inherited'' access level to this system object, then the resulting level of access rights is the most permissive access level among only the roles with explicitly defined access levels. The system ignores the roles with the ''Inherited'' level of access rights. This algorithm is used to optimize the speed of loading the form.
{br}

The following examples illustrate the system behavior described in this section: [anchor|#_a1d81239-dffc-44cf-b21e-79f4022c8978]
#Suppose that a user is assigned the ''Employee'' and the ''Accountant'' user roles. The ''Employee'' role has the ''Revoked'' access level to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form, and the ''Accountant'' role has the ''Edit'' access level to this form. The default access level both roles have to the form elements is ''Inherited''. The user with these roles, then, has the ''Edit'' access level to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form and its elements.
#Suppose that a user is assigned the ''Employee'' and ''Accountant'' user roles. Both roles have the ''Insert'' access level to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form. You have decided to forbid users with the ''Accountant'' role to release invoices. For the ''Accountant'' role, you specify the ''Revoked'' access level for the '''Release''' button on this form. The ''Employee'' role has the ''Inherited'' access level to the '''Release''' button. With the settings you have specified, the user has the ''Revoked'' access level to the '''Release''' button.
#Suppose that a user is assigned the ''Employee'', ''Warehouse Worker'', and ''Sales Assistant'' user roles. All these roles have the ''Insert'' access level to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) form. The ''Employee'' role has the ''Inherited'' access level to the '''Release''' button on this form, the ''Warehouse Worker'' role has the ''Revoked'' access level to this button, and the ''Sales Assistant'' role has the ''View Only'' access level to this button. As a result, the user has the ''View Only'' access level (the most permissive level of the two explicitly defined levels) to this button.

You can view the user access level for a particular form, containers or form element by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_55|Access Rights by User] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201055|SM201055]) form. On the form, you select the user account for which you want to view the access level. In the left pane, you select a node that contains the nested objects (forms or form elements) you are interested in. Then in the right pane, you select the form or container and click the '''View Roles''' button on the pane toolbar. The system opens the '''View Roles''' dialog box, where you can view the access rights of the user to the selected object in the '''Computed Access Rights''' column.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Levels of Access Rights With  Acumatica ERP, you can control access to system objects at broad and granular levels, down to                 the control of form elements, such as buttons, text boxes, and check boxes. Users                 are assigned to roles, and you give these roles the appropriate levels of access                 rights (or access levels) to system objects— forms, containers of form                 elements, form elements, and wikis. You have to be very careful when you assign             multiple roles to a user account  because these roles may have different levels of             access rights to system objects. For details, see  Access Rights Level for a User Account Access Rights Level for a User Account. You use the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201025|SM201025]) Access Rights by Role (SM201025) and   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201020|SM201020]) Access Rights by Screen (SM201020) forms to manage access rights. For more                 information about access rights, see  User Access Rights. You can set the access each role has to the wikis available in your company by using                 the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202015|SM202015]) Wiki Access by Role (SM202015) form. To                 view and update the map of any wiki, use the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202010|SM202010]) Wiki Site Map (SM202010) form. For details about managing access to wikis, see  Wiki Access Management. This topic describes the levels of access rights available to system objects. Access Rights at the Workspace Level In  Acumatica ERP, you do not set up access to a particular workspace itself. Instead, by setting                 access rights at the workspace level, you set up access for all the nested objects.                 If you change the access level to any nested object of a workspace, the system will                 change the access level to  Multiple Rights  at the workspace level.  The system displays a workspace with the  Multiple Rights  level in the main                 menu. On the workspace dashboard, the system displays only forms for which access is                 not restricted for a particular user.  Keep in mind that a form may belong to multiple workspaces. If you set an access                 level to one of these workspaces (that is, to all forms in the workspace), the                 system will assign to a form that belongs to multiple workspaces the access level                 set most recently for one of these workspaces. The system will then change the                 access level for other workspaces to which the form belongs to the  Multiple                     Rights  option, if these workspaces had a different access level. For                 example, the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP402000|AP402000]) Vendor Details form can be accessed from the                      Payables  and  Purchases  workspaces.                 Both workspaces have the  Granted  access level for the  Purchasing  role.                 You change an access level for the form under the  Payables                  workspace to  Revoked . The system displays the new access level of the form                 under the  Purchases  workspace and changes access level to                      Multiple Rights  for both workspaces. The following table summarizes the levels of access rights that roles can have to all                 forms that belong to a particular workspace of  Acumatica ERP. Level Description Multiple Rights Means that a role has different access levels to the nested                                 objects of a workspace. If you change the access level for the                                 workspace, the system will automatically apply the new level to all                                 nested objects. Not Set Allows all roles to have access to all forms in a workspace until                                      Revoked  or  Granted  access level is set to the                                 workspace for at least one role. After that, a role with this level                                 is denied access to the forms in the workspace. Revoked Denies the role access to all the forms in a workspace; for users                                     with the role, the workspace and its forms do not appear in the                                     main menu.  Granted Allows the role access to all the forms in a workspace. You can,                                 however, limit or revoke access to particular forms within the                                 workspace for the role. In this case, the system will change the                                 access level for the workspace to  Multiple Rights .  You can set up access rights to individual forms in the                      Hidden  node (which cannot be accessed from the main                 menu), but not to the node itself. You can reset a role's access level at the workspace level (that is, the access level                 to all the forms in a workspace) to  Not Set  any time you want.                  For                 a procedure that describes how to reset access rights, see  To Reset Access Rights to All Forms in a Workspace. Access Rights at the Form Level Within each workspace, you can set the access rights that roles have to  Acumatica ERP forms, which affects what users with those roles can access. The level of access                 rights to the form is inherited by the entities and records that can be created by                 using the form. You can set any of the following levels of access rights to forms.  Level Description Not Set When assigned to all roles, allows all roles to have access to                                 the form until access rights are set to any other level for at least                                 one role. After at least one role has been assigned another level of                                 access rights, access to the form is denied for a role with this                                 access level. Revoked Denies the role access to the form and its functionality. View Only Gives the role restricted access to the form and its                                 functionality. This level allows users with the role to view the                                 form and any records associated with the form (in drop-down lists on                                 other forms). This level forbids users with the role to edit                                     details about any record, create new records or entities of the                                     type, and delete records. Edit Gives the role restricted access to the form and its                                 functionality. This level allows users with the role to view the                                 form, select records, and edit details about any record. This                                     level forbids users with the role to create new records or                                     entities of the type, and to delete records. The                                      Clipboard  button is available on the form toolbar for                                 users with the role. Insert Gives the role restricted access to the form and its                                 functionality. This level allows users with the role to view the                                 form, select records, edit details about any record, and create new                                 records or entities of the type. This level forbids users with the                                     role to delete records. The  Clipboard  and                                      Insert  buttons are available on the form toolbar for                                 users with the role. Delete Gives the role complete access to the form and its functionality.                                 This level encompasses the capabilities of the  View Only ,                                      Edit , and  Insert  levels, while also giving users                                 with the role the ability to delete records.  For users with the                                     role, the  Clipboard ,  Insert , and  Delete                                      buttons are available on the form toolbar. By default, a new role has the  Not Set  access level. If you change access rights for a user role to a form or a form element, your changes                 affect only this form or form element. To make the form available in the navigation                 pane to a user with this role, set the access level for the form to the  View                     Only  level or more permissive. Access Rights to Containers of Form Elements Each form includes containers of elements, such as nested forms, tabs, and grids.                 Each container includes multiple elements and actions. You can restrict access to                 any of these containers on the form. The level of access rights a role has to the                 container is inherited by the entities and records created by using the container,                 if applicable. For example, if you permit access for a user role to a grid, a user                 with this role can access all records in this grid. By default, containers inherit                 access level from the form to which they belong. You can set any of the following                 levels of access rights to the containers. Level Description Inherited Indicates that the role's access to the container is                                     inherited from its access level to the form. Revoked Denies the role access to the container and hides it from the                                     form for users with the role. These users will not see the                                     container on the form. View Only Gives the role restricted access to the container and its                                     functionality. This level allows users with the role to view the                                     container and any records associated with the container (in                                     drop-down lists on other forms), if applicable. The level                                         forbids users with the role to edit details about any                                         record, create new records or entities of the type, and                                         delete records, if applicable. Edit Gives users with the role restricted access to the container                                     and its functionality. This level allows users with the role to                                     view the container, select records, and edit details about any                                     record, if applicable. The level forbids users with the role                                         to create new records or entities of the type, and delete                                         records, if applicable. Insert Gives the role restricted access to the container and its                                     functionality. This level allows users with the role to view the                                     container, select records, edit details about any record, and                                     create new records or entities of the type, if                                         applicable. This level forbids users with the role to                                         delete records, if applicable. Delete Gives the role complete access to the container and its                                     functionality. This level encompasses the capabilities of the                                          View Only ,  Edit , and  Insert  levels,                                     while also giving users with the role the ability to delete                                     records, if applicable.  Access Rights to Form Elements By default, a role's access rights to the form elements and actions are inherited                 from the role's access level to the container of form elements to which elements and                 actions belong. Thus, you should set the role's access level to the container of                 form elements before setting an access level to an element or an action. Then you                 can set access rights to the form elements and actions. You can set up the following                 levels of access rights to form elements. Level Description Inherited Indicates that the role's access level to the element is                                 inherited from its access level to the container of form                                 elements. Revoked Denies the role access to the element and hides the element. A                                 user with the role will not see the element on the form. View Only Makes the element read-only for users with the role. A user with                                 the role will see the element on the form but will not be able to                                 use it. Edit Allows the use of the element for users with the role. If a particular form toolbar contains form-specific buttons, you can deny access for                 the role to these buttons, by setting  Revoked  for the buttons. You can revoke                 access to some of the elements to hide their contents from users with  View                     Only  access level.                  Configuring a role's access rights at the form control level requires                 in-depth knowledge of  Acumatica ERP functionality. Access Rights Level for a User Account The level of access rights a user account has to a system object is defined by the                 user roles assigned to the user. If a user has multiple roles assigned and the roles                 have different access levels to the system object, the following general rule is                 used:  Acumatica ERP applies the most permissive access level among the roles. For example, suppose                 that a user is assigned the  Employee  and  Sales Manager  roles. The                      Employee  role has the  Revoked  access level at the                      Inventory  workspace level, and the  Sales Manager                  role has the  Granted  access level at the same level. With these settings, the                 user has the  Granted  access level to the forms in the                      Inventory  workspace. The algorithm of calculating access rights differs from the general rule described in                 the previous paragraph for a user with multiple roles assigned, some or all of which                 have the  Inherited  access level (which is applied to form element containers                 and form elements by default). For this user, the following rules are used to                 calculate access rights to a form element container or form element: If all roles have the  Inherited  access level to the particular form                         element container or form element, the resulting access level is the most                         permissive access level of the system object at the next highest level—the                         form (for a form element container) or the form element container (for a                         form element). If you have explicitly specified an access level to the particular form                         element container or form element for at least one role, while the other                         roles have the  Inherited  access level to this system object, then the                         resulting level of access rights is the most permissive access level among                         only the roles with explicitly defined access levels. The system ignores the                         roles with the  Inherited  level of access rights. This algorithm is                         used to optimize the speed of loading the form. The following examples illustrate the system behavior described in this section:  Suppose that a user is assigned the  Employee  and the  Accountant                      user roles. The  Employee  role has the  Revoked  access level to the                           ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000) form, and the  Accountant                      role has the  Edit  access level to this form. The default access level                     both roles have to the form elements is  Inherited . The user with these                     roles, then, has the  Edit  access level to the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers form and its elements. Suppose that a user is assigned the  Employee  and  Accountant  user                     roles. Both roles have the  Insert  access level to the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form. You have decided to forbid users                     with the  Accountant  role to release invoices. For the  Accountant                      role, you specify the  Revoked  access level for the                          Release  button on this form. The  Employee  role                     has the  Inherited  access level to the  Release                      button. With the settings you have specified, the user has the  Revoked                      access level to the  Release  button. Suppose that a user is assigned the  Employee ,  Warehouse Worker ,                     and  Sales Assistant  user roles. All these roles have the  Insert                      access level to the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) Receipts (IN301000) form. The                          Employee  role has the  Inherited  access level to the                          Release  button on this form, the  Warehouse                         Worker  role has the  Revoked  access level to this button, and the                          Sales Assistant  role has the  View Only  access level to this                     button. As a result, the user has the  View Only  access level (the most                     permissive level of the two explicitly defined levels) to this button. You can view the user access level for a particular form, containers or form element                 by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201055|SM201055]) Access Rights by User (SM201055) form. On the form, you                 select the user account for which you want to view the access level. In the left                 pane, you select a node that contains the nested objects (forms or form elements)                 you are interested in. Then in the right pane, you select the form or container and                 click the  View Roles  button on the pane toolbar. The system                 opens the  View Roles  dialog box, where you can view the                 access rights of the user to the selected object in the  Computed Access                     Rights  column.

==Configuring Permissions to Change the Business Date==
Some companies might want to restrict the availability of changing the business date in the system. This can be done to avoid issues with generated documents that have the dates of closed periods inserted into them. {br}

By default, all users can change the business date in the Acumatica ERP system. To restrict the availability to change it, you should enable the ''Secure Business Date'' feature on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. This will make the Business Date menu button generally unavailable for clicking and editing.{br}

In your company, only some employees might need the ability to change the business date in the system. You can grant these users access rights to change it by assigning the ''BusinessDateOverride'' role to them on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) form or the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_05|User Roles] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201005|SM201005]) form.((({S:Warn}This role is available only if the ''Secure Business Date'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form.

==Incrementing of the Business Date==
The system handles the incrementing of the business date at midnight individually for each user session: The date is automatically incremented at midnight only if you have not modified the business date in any way during your user session. {br}

That is, if you do not change the business date during your user session and your session is active at midnight, the system increments the date. If you have modified the business date somehow, the system will keep the changed date as long as your user session is active.

After Acumatica ERP is installed, you create user roles (see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Role-Based_Access|Role-Based Access]) to provide users with access to system objects according to their responsibilities. By default, each user role has the access level specified as ''Not Set'' (see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Roles_and_Access_Rights|Levels of Access Rights]) to all forms. The nested objects (containers and elements) have the ''Inherited'' access level. Initially, this means that all users can view and use all system objects.

You can configure access rights to the '''Export to Excel''' action of only those generic inquiries that replace entry screens or for which a workspace and category have been specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_80_00|Generic Inquiry] ([~/?ScreenId=SM208000|SM208000]) form. Do the following:[anchor|#ol_e5x_zyw_1cb]
#If the generic inquiry has been added to a workspace as a separate screen, do the following:
##Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_20|Access Rights by Screen] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201020|SM201020]) form.
##In the left pane, expand the nodes to the necessary level to find the generic inquiry to which you want to set up access rights.
##Expand the generic inquiry.
##Expand the ''Generic Inquiry Result''container.
##Click the ''Export'' action.
##In the right pane, select the required access rights level for all necessary user roles. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Roles_and_Access_Rights|Levels of Access Rights].
##On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.
#If the generic inquiry is configured to replace an entry screen, do the following:

 Acumatica ERP provides a wide range of tools for security control. You can implement your organization&rsquo;s security regulations by configuring and maintaining system-wide security policies for user accounts, password policies, and security auditing. You can also specify password security policies for individual user accounts, as described in [HelpRoot_Administration\US__con_User_Accounts|User Accounts in Acumatica ERP].{br}

This topic describes system-wide security policies in Acumatica ERP and ways you can audit security events.{br}{TOC}
==System-Wide Account Lockout Policies==
You can configure the system to lock out a user account after a particular number of failed login attempts. This configuration option helps to stop an unauthorized person who might be trying to gain system access by guessing a user&rsquo;s password.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_60|Security Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201060|SM201060]) form, you can specify the following system-wide parameters:[anchor|#ul_n14_jjg_zj]
*The number of failed login attempts that will cause a user account to be locked out
*The duration of the account lockout—that is, the number of minutes the user account remains locked before the system automatically unlocks it
*The time period before the system resets the counter of the failed login attempts
[anchor|#section_ohp_pbm_5j]
==System-Wide Password Policies==
In Acumatica ERP, you can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_60|Security Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201060|SM201060]) form to set up the password policies for all user accounts defined in the system.((({S:Warn}If your Acumatica ERP instance is integrated with Active Directory, the password policy for domain users is set at the domain level through Active Directory. For more information about the integration of Acumatica ERP with Active Directory, see [HelpRoot_Integration\US__con_Integration_with_Active_Directory|Integration with Active Directory].
)))
You can set up any of the following system password policy parameters:[anchor|#ul_utv_vxd_pj]
*''Password duration'': For maximum security, we recommend that users change passwords periodically, such as every 90 to 180 days. Shorter ranges can reduce the security of accounts, because users may use simple passwords or struggle to create complex, memorable passwords often, which encourages them to write down these passwords.
*''Password length'': You can set up a minimum required password length.
*''Password complexity'': You can enforce password complexity requirements, which means that a new password must include at least three of the following:
**Latin uppercase letters (A–Z)
**Latin lowercase letters (a–z)
**Digits (0 through 9)
**Special characters (such as ''+'', '':'', ''='', and ''-'')
*''Password validation mask'': You can configure an additional password validation mask to enforce your company&rsquo;s password policy. You can specify a regular expression to enforce additional regulations—for example, to exclude some special characters that are not supported by third-party software (if used).

To improve password security, a hashing algorithm is used to process passwords, and only hash values are stored in the database.
==Security Auditing==
 Acumatica ERP can monitor and record system events with the security auditing provided by the User Security module. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_60|Security Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201060|SM201060]) form, you can select the types of events the system will monitor and set up the time period for which the audit trail must be kept. Events to be audited can include any of the following: [anchor|#ul_fkc_dgm_pj]
*Successful login.
*Unsuccessful login attempts.
*User logout.
*Session expiration.
*Form access.
*:((({S:Warn}The event is logged only once for each form during a user session (when the user first opens the form).
)))
*Exceeding the maximum number of users specified in the license.
*Successful sending of an email.
*Failed sending of an email.
*Customization publishing. For more information, see the Acumatica ERP Customization Guide.
*Access of an Acumatica ERP data through a generic inquiry that has been exposed by using the OData protocol. For more information on support for OData in Acumatica ERP, see [HelpRoot_ReportingTools\CU__con_OData|OData Support].

You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_45|Access History] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201045|SM201045]) form to view the audit trails. The audit trail for the event type shows the time when the event took place, the user who performed the operation, the IP address from which the user signed in to the system, and other parameters, depending on the event type. You can filter the events by user, date range, and operation type.

 Acumatica ERP implements a role-based, task-oriented approach to security. You assign roles to users and give the roles appropriate access rights to the system resources—such as modules, specific forms, form elements, and toolbar buttons—that the users need to perform their work tasks. For more information about user roles, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Role-Based_Access|Role-Based Access].{br}

To give your organization the ability to apply more complex security policies, Acumatica ERP provides restriction groups, which you can administer in the Row-Level Security module. A ''restriction group'' is a set of entities of two or more types that you define to achieve one of these goals:[anchor|#_712b604d-a1a5-457a-9099-da56cf73a4fc]
*To restrict employees&rsquo; visibility of sensitive data processed by using Acumatica ERP
*To relate particular entities to each other so as they are used only together on Acumatica ERP forms.

In the sections of this topic, you can find brief information on restriction groups in general, types of restriction groups, and common usage scenarios for restriction groups.{br}{TOC}
==Restriction Groups==
You can use restriction groups to control the visibility of system entities to employees of your organization. For more information about restriction groups, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Overview_of_Restriction_Groups|Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP].{br}

Your work with restriction groups in the Row-Level Security module includes the following tasks:[anchor|#_d2d1dba3-2fe0-43b1-a210-b7fd7af50694]
*Creating a restriction group and including users and entities in it to control the visibility of entities in the system. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Configuration_Restriction_Groups|Configuration of Restriction Groups].
*Adding objects or users to an existing group when you add new objects and users in the system and need to configure visibility.
*Removing objects or users from a group when you want to display the objects to all users or when the users&rsquo; functional roles are changed in your organization.
*Deactivating a group when you no longer need the visibility restrictions provided by this group.

For details on all operations with restriction groups, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Operations_Restriction_Groups|Operations with Restriction Groups].
==Types of Restriction Groups==
 Acumatica ERP provides two basic types of restriction groups—A and B. Restriction groups of both types can limit the visibility of system entities in a direct way (types ''A'' and ''B'') and an inverse way (types ''A Inverse'' and ''B Inverse''). The differences between ''A'' and ''B'' and between ''A Inverse'' and ''B Inverse'' are in how these groups work if the same entity is added to multiple groups. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Types_of_Restriction_Groups|Types of Restriction Groups].[anchor|#_ac0776d8-d777-4c6b-a2e8-6d595aff8285]
==Combinations of Restriction-Group Entities==
 Acumatica ERP supports a variety of scenarios of configuring the visibility of entities within the system. With the most common scenarios, you can create restriction groups that include the following system entities:
*Users and General Ledger (GL) accounts: With these restriction groups, if your organization has sensitive GL accounts, you can make these accounts visible to a limited number of employees. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Account_and_Subaccount_Security|Account and Subaccount Security].
*Users and subaccounts: As with groups that include users and GL accounts, you can limit the visibility of sensitive subaccounts to employees. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Account_and_Subaccount_Security|Account and Subaccount Security].
*:((({S:Warn}For performance reasons, visibility restrictions by user for subaccounts do not affect analytical (ARM) and form-based reports or general inquiries. This means that users who can view the reports and general inquiries that include subaccounts will see the full list of subaccounts.
)))
*Users and vendor accounts: You can define these restriction groups to make particular vendors visible in the system to only employees who work with these vendors. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Vendor_Security|Vendor Security].
*Users and customer accounts: With these restriction groups, you can make particular customers visible to only employees who work with these customers. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Customer_Security|Customer Security].
*Users and GL budget articles: With these restriction groups, you can limit the visibility of sensitive budget articles so that only particular users can see and work with these articles. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_GL_Budget_Security|Security of GL Budget Articles].
*Users and warehouses: You can create restriction groups to display a particular warehouse (or set of warehouses) for only employees who work with this warehouse (or this set of warehouses). For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Warehouse_Security|Warehouse Security].
*Users and inventory items: You can define these restriction groups to reduce the number of items in the lists with inventory items, depending on the particular employee signed in to the system. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Restriction_Groups_for_Subitems|Inventory Item Security].
*Users and projects: You can define these restriction groups to configure the visibility of particular projects only to a responsible project team. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Project_Security|Project Security].
*Users and printers: If the ''DeviceHub'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]), you can define these restriction groups to configure the visibility of printers to particular users. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__how_Configure_Printer_Access|To Configure Printer Access].
*Branches, GL accounts, and users: With these restriction groups, you can allow users to work with only branch-specific accounts. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Account_and_Subaccount_Security|Account and Subaccount Security].
*Branches, subaccounts, and users: You can set up these restriction groups so that the system displays to users only the branch-specific subaccounts. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Account_and_Subaccount_Security|Account and Subaccount Security].
*Branches and cash accounts: If there are multiple branches in your organization, with these restriction groups, you can allow users in each branch to work with only branch-specific cash accounts. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Security_of_Cash_Accounts|Security of Cash Accounts].
*GL Accounts and Subaccounts: If you have subaccounts that employees must use only with particular GL accounts, by defining these restriction groups, you can set up lists of available subaccounts for each GL account. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Account_and_Subaccount_Security|Account and Subaccount Security].

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Overview of Row-Level Security  Acumatica ERP implements a role-based, task-oriented approach to security. You assign roles to 				users and give the roles appropriate access rights to the system 				resources—such as modules, specific forms, form elements, and toolbar 				buttons—that the users need to perform their work tasks. For more information 				about user roles, see  Role-Based Access. To give your organization the ability to apply more complex security policies,  Acumatica ERP provides restriction groups, which you can administer in the Row-Level Security 				module. A  restriction group  is a set of entities of two or more types that 				you define to achieve one of these goals: To restrict employees' visibility of sensitive data processed by using  Acumatica ERPTo relate particular entities to each other so as they are used only together on 						 Acumatica ERP forms. In the sections of this topic, you can find brief information on restriction groups 				in general, types of restriction groups, and common usage scenarios for restriction 				groups. Restriction Groups You can use restriction groups to control the visibility of system entities to 				employees of your organization. For more information about restriction groups, see 					 Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP.

The differences between  A  and  B  and between  A 					Inverse  and  B Inverse  are in how these groups work if the same entity 				is added to multiple groups. For details, see  Types of Restriction Groups. Combinations of Restriction-Group Entities  Acumatica ERP supports a variety of scenarios of configuring the visibility of entities within                 the system. With the most common scenarios, you can create restriction groups that                 include the following system entities: Users and General Ledger (GL) accounts: With these restriction groups, if your                     organization has sensitive GL accounts, you can make these accounts visible to a                     limited number of employees. For details, see  Account and Subaccount Security. Users and subaccounts: As with groups that include users and GL accounts, you                     can limit the visibility of sensitive subaccounts to employees. For more                     information, see  Account and Subaccount Security. For performance reasons, visibility restrictions by             user for subaccounts do not affect analytical (ARM) and form-based reports or general             inquiries. This means that users who can view the reports and general inquiries that             include subaccounts will see the full list of subaccounts. Users and vendor accounts: You can define these restriction groups to make                     particular vendors visible in the system to only employees who work with these                     vendors. For details, see  Vendor Security. Users and customer accounts: With these restriction groups, you can make                     particular customers visible to only employees who work with these customers.                     For details, see  Customer Security. Users and GL budget articles: With these restriction groups, you can limit the                     visibility of sensitive budget articles so that only particular users can see                     and work with these articles. For more information, see  Security of GL Budget Articles. Users and warehouses: You can create restriction groups to display a particular                     warehouse (or set of warehouses) for only employees who work with this warehouse                     (or this set of warehouses). For details, see  Warehouse Security. Users and inventory items: You can define these restriction groups to reduce the                     number of items in the lists with inventory items, depending on the particular                     employee signed in to the system. For more information, see  Inventory Item Security. Users and projects: You can define these restriction groups to configure the                     visibility of particular projects only to a responsible project team. For more                     information, see  Project Security. Users and printers: If the  DeviceHub  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features form (CS100000), you can define                     these restriction groups to configure the visibility of printers to particular                     users. For more information, see  To Configure Printer Access. Branches, GL accounts, and users: With these restriction groups, you can allow                     users to work with only branch-specific accounts. For details, see  Account and Subaccount Security. Branches, subaccounts, and users: You can set up these restriction groups so                     that the system displays to users only the branch-specific subaccounts.

 Acumatica ERP provides you with restriction groups, which are flexible tools for limiting the visibility and use of entities, such as General Ledger accounts, inventory items, and customer and vendor accounts.{br}

In this topic, you can find information about situations where restriction groups are useful, types of restriction groups, and types of entities that you can include in restriction groups.{br}{TOC}
==Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP==
You can use restriction groups to do the following:[anchor|#_321658d4-45b5-4f90-b64f-879c2ce4ecd9]
#Control the visibility of sensitive data for employees of your organization. To do this, you include in a restriction group the entities for which you need to restrict the visibility, and the users who should or should not be able to view these entities. For details, see [[#_0af57538-82a6-4d16-af40-490af350626d|Restriction Groups with Users].
#To relate entities to one another so that they are used only together on Acumatica ERP forms (or so that they cannot be used together). To do this, you include in a group only related entities and do not include users. For more information, see [[#_47c5a9b2-7df7-4186-980d-ceee777c8e94|Restriction Groups Without Users].

You can find details on configuring restriction groups in [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Configuration_Restriction_Groups|Configuration of Restriction Groups].{br}

In Acumatica ERP, you can use specific forms to create restriction groups, view the entities included in a group, and manage the list of entities of a particular type in a restriction group. For details on the typical operations you can perform with restriction groups, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Operations_Restriction_Groups|Operations with Restriction Groups].[anchor|#_0af57538-82a6-4d16-af40-490af350626d]
==Restriction Groups with Users==
To understand how restriction groups with users are used, consider a typical case with restriction groups that include users and General Ledger (GL) accounts. Suppose that a role allows all its users to access all GL accounts, but for two groups of accounts, you want to provide visibility to only particular users.[anchor|#_6b014dde-f9e7-44da-8a91-2c4d3149a719][anchor|#_b9ed6e6c-b6f5-4076-880e-28e542131881][image:UserGuide/Images/RestrictionGroups_Direct_Restriction.png|popup|Restriction groups for GL accounts and users|450px]{br}

The diagram above shows how restriction groups can address these security needs. You define Group 1 as a restriction group that includes only appropriate accountants (User C and User D) and accounts (1, 2, and 3). Similarly, you create Group 2, which includes User Y and User Z, as well as the accounts they should work with (4, 5, and 6).{br}

Among all users in the system, only User C and User D will see the first group of sensitive accounts (1, 2, and 3), and only User X and User Z will see the second group of sensitive accounts (4, 5, and 6). Users who are not assigned to any restriction group will not see the accounts associated with either group.[anchor|#_47c5a9b2-7df7-4186-980d-ceee777c8e94]
==Restriction Groups Without Users==
If a restriction group does not include users, all users may view the entities that are members of the group (if their roles provide access to forms with these entities), but entities included in the group become related in a way that limits their use. For example, suppose that you create two groups with GL accounts and subaccounts as follows:[anchor|#_e3a4ed20-9e08-427b-9952-3bea3ab3f011]
*Group 1 includes Account 1, Subaccount K, Subaccount L, and Subaccount M.
*Group 2 includes Account 2, Subaccount P, Subaccount Q, and Subaccount R.

For simplicity, suppose that there are no other accounts and subaccounts in the system.{br}

The result of these settings is the following:[anchor|#_6a47b272-5611-4ac3-90af-1aa0d8714c0b]
*If a user selects Account 1 on an entry form, he or she will be able to select only Subaccount K, Subaccount L, or Subaccount M in a box with subaccounts. The subaccounts included in Group 2 will be hidden from the list.
*If the user selects Account 2, he or she will see Subaccount P, Subaccount Q, and Subaccount R in the box with subaccounts; the user will not see Subaccount K, Subaccount L, and Subaccount M.
[anchor|#_1b34b3cd-f7b3-432c-b48c-aa8ea7a031f4]((({S:Warn}If you are using restriction groups to control the accounts and subaccounts that can be used together, you must create at least two groups and include all subaccounts in either of the groups. For example, suppose that you need to restrict visibility of subaccounts for only one account. To solve this task, you create two restriction groups. In the first group with direct restriction, you include a GL account and the list of subaccounts that should be related to this account. In the second group with inverse restriction, you include the same account and subaccounts that should not be displayed after users select this account. As a result, when users select the account on a form, they will see only one of the subaccounts included in the first group.

==Types of Restriction Groups==
 Acumatica ERP provides two basic types of restriction groups—A and B. Restriction groups of both types can limit the visibility of system entities in a direct way (types ''A'' and ''B'') and an inverse way (types ''A Inverse'' and ''B Inverse'' in the Acumatica ERP user interface). The differences between ''A'' and ''B'' and between ''A Inverse'' and ''B Inverse'' are in how these groups work if the same entity is added to multiple groups. For detailed descriptions of each group type, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Types_of_Restriction_Groups|Types of Restriction Groups].[anchor|#_7f648b60-eb14-4c1c-aadb-ce882531e2c9]
==Combinations of Restriction-Group Entities==
 Acumatica ERP supports a variety of scenarios of configuring the visibility of entities within the system. With the most common scenarios, you can create restriction groups that include the following system entities:
*Users and General Ledger (GL) accounts: With these restriction groups, if your organization has sensitive GL accounts, you can make these accounts visible to a limited number of employees.

*Users and warehouses: You can create restriction groups to display a particular warehouse (or set of warehouses) for only employees who work with this warehouse (or this set of warehouses). For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Warehouse_Security|Warehouse Security].
*Users and inventory items: You can define these restriction groups to reduce the number of items in the lists with inventory items, depending on the particular employee signed in to the system.

Users and customer accounts: With these restriction groups, you can make                     particular customers visible to only employees who work with these customers.                     For details, see  Customer Security. Users and GL budget articles: With these restriction groups, you can limit the                     visibility of sensitive budget articles so that only particular users can see                     and work with these articles. For more information, see  Security of GL Budget Articles. Users and warehouses: You can create restriction groups to display a particular                     warehouse (or set of warehouses) for only employees who work with this warehouse                     (or this set of warehouses). For details, see  Warehouse Security. Users and inventory items: You can define these restriction groups to reduce the                     number of items in the lists with inventory items, depending on the particular                     employee signed in to the system. For more information, see  Inventory Item Security. Users and projects: You can define these restriction groups to configure the                     visibility of particular projects only to a responsible project team. For more                     information, see  Project Security. Users and printers: If the  DeviceHub  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features form (CS100000), you can define                     these restriction groups to configure the visibility of printers to particular                     users. For more information, see  To Configure Printer Access. Branches, GL accounts, and users: With these restriction groups, you can allow                     users to work with only branch-specific accounts. For details, see  Account and Subaccount Security. Branches, subaccounts, and users: You can set up these restriction groups so                     that the system displays to users only the branch-specific subaccounts. For more                     information, see  Account and Subaccount Security. Branches and cash accounts: If there are multiple branches in your organization,                     with these restriction groups, you can allow users in each branch to work with                     only branch-specific cash accounts. For details, see  Security of Cash Accounts. GL Accounts and Subaccounts: If you have subaccounts that employees must use                     only with particular GL accounts, by defining these restriction groups, you can                     set up lists of available subaccounts for each GL account. For more information,                     see  Account and Subaccount Security. ]]></column>

Restriction groups in Acumatica ERP provide additional flexibility to the configuration of access rights for suites, modules, and forms. (For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\US__mng_Roles|Managing User Access Rights].) You can use restriction groups when users should have access to a form, but on this form they are allowed to see one set of entities and are not allowed to see another set of entities. {br}

With different types of restriction groups, you can configure simple and complicated rules of visibility for entities. In this topic, you will find descriptions of the types of restriction groups, the differences between the types, and usage examples.((({S:Warn}In this topic, the restriction groups in the examples contain users and entities, but the same principles apply to groups that contain only entities. 
When you add users and entities to a group, the system restricts the visibility of the entities to the users. When you add entities of two different types to the group and don&rsquo;t add users, these entities can be used only with one another when users select values of the entities on forms. For example, if you add a GL account and subaccounts to the group, and a user selects the included account on a form, only the included subaccounts are available for selection.
))){br}{TOC}
==Types of Restriction Groups==
 Acumatica ERP provides two basic types of restriction groups—A and B. Restriction groups of both types can limit the visibility of system entities in a direct way (types ''A'' and ''B'') and an inverse way (types ''A Inverse'' and ''B Inverse''). The differences between ''A'' and ''B'' and between ''A Inverse'' and ''B Inverse'' are in how these groups work if the same entity is added to multiple groups. For detailed descriptions of each group type, see [[#_ecbb9908-440a-4b11-a163-3d54838b8b85|Descriptions of Types of Restriction Groups].{br}

You use groups of types ''A'' or ''B''—groups with direct restriction—when you need to make entities visible to users within the group. (For groups with only entities, the direct restriction group includes entities that must be used together.) The following diagram shows how groups with direct restriction work. In the diagram, you can see four users (for example, accountants) and six entities (for example, GL accounts). Initially, all users can see all accounts. Group 1 is defined to include Users С and D and Accounts 1, 2, and 3. These accounts are visible to Users С and D and hidden from Users Y and Z. Group 2 is defined to include Accounts 4, 5, and 6 and Users Y and Z. Users Y and Z can see Accounts 4, 5, and 6, and Users С and D cannot see these accounts.[anchor|#_a4e5a847-c1bc-45bb-8aa2-bc9e2d4067ee][anchor|#_7d1be201-56ee-44d0-bc93-ccb2063953a0][image:UserGuide/Images/RestrictionGroups_Direct_Restriction.png|popup|Example of groups with direct restriction|450px]{br}

You use groups of types ''A Inverse'' or ''B Inverse''—groups with inverse restriction—when you need to hide entities from a small number of users. (For groups without users, an inverse restriction group includes entities that may not be used together.) See the following diagram, which illustrates how groups with an inverse restriction work. Group 1 is defined to include Users С and D and Accounts 1, 2, and 3. Accounts 1, 2, and 3 become invisible to Users С and D and remain visible to users Y and Z. Group 2 is defined to include Accounts 4, 5, and 6 and Users Y and Z. This hides Accounts 4, 5, and 6 from Users Y and Z, but Users С and D still can see these accounts. The final visibility for groups with inverse restriction is the opposite of the final visibility for groups with direct restriction.[anchor|#_23b4deb5-bb1b-4939-ab33-8f2da9a2a060][anchor|#_756c9045-792a-45f2-9bdc-3040e5adf0b0][image:UserGuide/Images/RestrictionGroups_Inverse_Restriction.png|popup|Example of groups with inverse restriction|450px]{br}

For more examples of using restriction groups of all types, see [[#_2c295d9e-d1c4-45d7-bc03-2ce9f3360a0f|Usage Example 1], [[#_13a4a93a-3489-441d-aa68-106a175a8618|Usage Example 2], and [[#_6c0e0845-aab1-4959-bcfd-aca68aeeac84|Usage Example 3].{br}

The following table summarizes the types of restriction groups and describes how the visibility of entities is affected if a particular entity belongs to multiple groups of the type.[anchor|#_ecbb9908-440a-4b11-a163-3d54838b8b85]

==Usage Example 1==
'''Problem statement:''' Suppose that as a system administrator, you have to configure the visibility of accounts to the appropriate users considering the following:[anchor|#_5f2e8d99-77c0-4715-9cfd-46749aa300b1]
*There are four accountants in your organization: User C, User D, User Y, and User Z.
*User M is the accounting manager who controls work of the accounting department.
*There are six accounts in the General Ledger module: Account 1, Account 2, Account 3, Account 4, Account 5, and Account 6.
*Users C and D are allowed to see Accounts 1, 2, and 3.
*Users Y and Z are allowed to see Accounts 4, 5, and 6.
*User M is allowed to see all accounts.

So Accounts 1, 2, and 3 should be visible to Users C, D, and M (and should be hidden from all other users), and Accounts 4, 5, and 6 should be visible to Users Y, Z, and M (and should be hidden from all other users).{br}

You can use either of two solutions (described below) to configure the visibility of accounts to users.{br}

'''Solution 1:''' To address the problem of Usage Example 1, you can create three restriction groups of type ''A''—Group 1, Group 2, and Group 3 (see the diagram below, including the user visibility shown in ''Final Visibility (Group Type A)''):[anchor|#_888d274b-682a-4c0a-8c97-ccf1f9928140]
*Group 1: In this group, you include Accounts 1, 2, and 3 and Users C and D.
*Group 2: In this group, you include Accounts 4, 5, and 6 and Users Y and Z.
*Group 3: In this group, you include User M and all six accounts.
((({S:Warn}If you were to use groups of type ''B'' instead of type ''A'', all accounts would be hidden from the users included in Groups 1, 2, and 3. See ''Final Visibility (Group Type B)'' in the diagram below. (To make this approach work with groups of type ''B'', you would need to include User M in Groups 1, 2, and 3.)
)))[anchor|#_8a7e96ae-699f-44a9-8681-0876c94e5d60][anchor|#_abaf060c-7240-4a27-841d-6bd968c5c51c][image:UserGuide/Images/RestrictionGroups_Example1_1.png|popup|Example of groups with direct restriction and intersecting entities|450px]
'''Solution 2:''' As a second way to address the problem of Usage Example 1, you can create two restriction groups of type ''A'' or ''B''—Group 1 and Group 2 (see the following diagram):[anchor|#_ba289b5d-e3c6-4724-bd63-f69a1d2f1834]
*Group 1: In this group, you include Accounts 1, 2, and 3 and Users C and D.
*Group 2: In this group, you include Accounts 4, 5, and 6 and Users Y and Z.
*You include User M in both groups.

==Usage Example 2==
'''Problem statement:''' Suppose that as a system administrator, you have to configure the visibility of accounts to the appropriate users considering the following:[anchor|#_caf1124d-9300-40e6-824e-c49996bb0013]
*There are four accountants: User C, User D, User Y, and User Z.
*There are six accounts in the General Ledger module: Account 1, Account 2, Account 3, Account 4, Account 5, and Account 6.
*User Y works with only one sensitive account, Account 1; User Y is not allowed to see the following accounts: Account 2, Account 3, Account 4, Account 5, and Account 6.
*The other accountants work with all accounts except Account 1.
*Only accountants have access to the Finance suite. (Thus, there is no need to hide accounts from other system users.)

'''Solution:''' To address the problem of Usage Example 2, you can create two restriction groups—Group 1 of type ''A'' or ''B'', and Group 2 of type ''A Inverse'' or ''B Inverse''. (If you select type ''A'' for Group 1, you should select type ''A Inverse'' for Group 2. If you select type ''B'' for Group 1, you should select type ''B Inverse'' for Group 2.) These groups are defined as follows:[anchor|#_cd1dea4e-3b82-4c36-b1da-d4f8322d5295]
*Group 1: In this group, you include User Y and Account 1. (Other users will not see Account 1.)
*Group 2: In this group, you include User Y and Accounts 2 to 6. (User Y will not see these accounts.)

The following diagram illustrates the proposed solution.[anchor|#_16a05c24-ea76-4f51-99a3-181717ab63c7][anchor|#_7c2223a3-d1f1-4bc7-98b7-cf94f7af3c29][image:UserGuide/Images/RestrictionGroups_Example2.png|popup|Example of combined use of groups with direct and inverse restriction|450px][anchor|#_6c0e0845-aab1-4959-bcfd-aca68aeeac84]
==Usage Example 3==
'''Problem statement:''' Suppose that as a system administrator, you have to configure the visibility of accounts to the appropriate users considering the following:[anchor|#_3e722326-ddd4-405d-a1a2-6583494ab948]
*There are four accountants in your organization: User C, User D, User Y, and User Z.
*There are six accounts in the General Ledger module of your organization: Account 1, Account 2, Account 3, Account 4, Account 5, and Account 6.
*Users С and D should work with all six accounts.
*User Y should work with Accounts 1, 2, and 3 but is not allowed to see Accounts 4, 5, and 6.
*User Z is a junior accountant, so this user is not allowed to see the accounts.

You can use either of two solutions (described below) to configure the visibility of accounts to users.{br}

'''Solution 1:''' To address the problem of Usage Example 3, you can create two groups of type ''B Inverse''—Group 1 and Group 2 (shown in the diagram below, with the user visibility shown in ''Final Visibility (Group Type B Inverse)''):[anchor|#_4b45f6c8-4de6-438c-8882-33838ec77a82]
*Group 1: In this group, you include User Y and Accounts 4, 5, and 6.
*Group 2: In this group, you add User Z and Accounts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
((({S:Warn} If you were to use groups of type ''A Inverse'' instead of ''B Inverse'' in this example, Accounts 4, 5, and 6 would be visible to all users because they are added in two restriction groups (see ''Final Visibility (Group Type A Inverse'') in the following diagram).

'''Solution 2:''' As a second way to address the problem of Usage Example 3, you can create two groups of the ''A Inverse'' or ''B Inverse'' type—Group 1 and Group 2:[anchor|#_f12d0ccd-dd99-41c9-8c9c-3537e97b8b84]
*Group 1: In this group, you include User Z and Accounts 1, 2, and 3.
*Group 2: In this group, you include Users Y and Z and Accounts 4, 5, and 6.

The following diagram illustrates Solution 2.[anchor|#_a8a3d37b-f222-4157-93bb-95d27fba4236][anchor|#_1fd6d127-6eb3-4ec7-ad5c-92d1d0e4b471][image:UserGuide/Images/RestrictionGroups_Example3_2.png|popup|Example of groups with an inverse restriction and no intersecting entities|450px]
==Recommendations for Selecting the Restriction Group Type ==
As you decide which type of restriction group best meets your security needs, consider the following recommendations:[anchor|#_95604798-edd6-4027-a103-1082e9ab6ef0]
*When you create multiple groups with entities of the same combination of types (for example, suppose that you have two restriction groups that include users and customers), use groups of the same basic type (either A or B). (Otherwise, if you were to add the same entity to multiple groups of different types, the result may not be what you expect.)
*To configure the required visibility of entities, you can combine direct and inverse restriction groups of the same basic type (either A or B), as was done in the solution of [[#_13a4a93a-3489-441d-aa68-106a175a8618|Usage Example 2]. Thus, you can combine groups of types ''A'' and ''A Inverse'', and groups of types ''B'' and ''B Inverse''.
*If you want to hide particular entities from the majority of users, include the entities and the users who should see the entities in a group with direct restriction (type ''A'' or ''B'').
*If you want to hide particular entities from a small number of users, add the entities and the users who shouldn&rsquo;t see the entities to a group with inverse restriction (type ''A Inverse'' or ''B Inverse'').

Types of Restriction Groups  Acumatica ERP provides two basic types of restriction groups—A and B. Restriction groups of both types         can limit the visibility of system entities in a direct way (types  A  and  B )         and an inverse way (types  A Inverse  and  B Inverse ). The differences between            A  and  B  and between  A Inverse  and  B Inverse  are in how these         groups work if the same entity is added to multiple groups. For detailed descriptions of         each group type, see  Descriptions of Types of Restriction Groups Descriptions of Types of Restriction Groups. You use groups of types  A  or  B —groups with direct restriction—when you need         to make entities visible to users within the group. (For groups with only entities, the         direct restriction group includes entities that must be used together.) The following         diagram shows how groups with direct restriction work. In the diagram, you can see four         users (for example, accountants) and six entities (for example, GL accounts). Initially, all         users can see all accounts. Group 1 is defined to include Users С and D and Accounts 1, 2,         and 3. These accounts are visible to Users С and D and hidden from Users Y and Z. Group 2 is         defined to include Accounts 4, 5, and 6 and Users Y and Z. Users Y and Z can see Accounts 4,         5, and 6, and Users С and D cannot see these accounts. Example of groups with direct restriction You use groups of types  A Inverse  or  B Inverse —groups with inverse         restriction—when you need to hide entities from a small number of users. (For groups without         users, an inverse restriction group includes entities that may not be used together.) See         the following diagram, which illustrates how groups with an inverse restriction work. Group         1 is defined to include Users С and D and Accounts 1, 2, and 3. Accounts 1, 2, and 3 become         invisible to Users С and D and remain visible to users Y and Z. Group 2 is defined to         include Accounts 4, 5, and 6 and Users Y and Z. This hides Accounts 4, 5, and 6 from Users Y         and Z, but Users С and D still can see these accounts. The final visibility for groups with         inverse restriction is the opposite of the final visibility for groups with direct           restriction. Example of groups with inverse restriction For more examples of using restriction groups of all types, see  Usage Example 1 Usage Example 1,  Usage Example 2 Usage Example 2, and  Usage Example 3 Usage Example 3. The following table summarizes the types of restriction groups and describes how the         visibility of entities is affected if a particular entity belongs to multiple groups of the         type. Descriptions of Types of Restriction Groups Group Type Restriction Description A Direct Makes entities included in the group visible to users who are also included in                   the group. Other users cannot view these entities. When a particular entity belongs to multiple groups of type  A , if you want                   a user to see this entity in the system, you add the user to at least one of these                   groups. A Inverse Inverse Hides the entities included in the group from users who are also included in the                   group. Users who are not assigned to this group can view and use the entities. When a particular entity belongs to multiple groups of type  A Inverse , if                   you don't want a user to see this entity, you must include this user in each of                   these groups. If you include the user in only one of the groups, he or she will                   see the entity in the system. B Direct Makes entities included in the group visible to users who are also included in                   the group. Other users cannot view these entities. When a particular entity belongs to multiple groups of type  B , if you want                   a user to see this entity in the system, you need to include this user in each of                   these groups. B Inverse Inverse Hides the entities included in the group from users who are also included in the                   group. Users who are not assigned to this group can view and use the entities. When a particular entity belongs to multiple groups of type  B Inverse , if                   you don't want a user to see this entity in the system, you include the user in at                   least one of these groups. Usage Example 1 Problem statement:  Suppose that as a system administrator, you have to configure the         visibility of accounts to the appropriate users considering the following: There are four accountants in your organization: User C, User D, User Y, and User           Z. User M is the accounting manager who controls work of the accounting department. There are six accounts in the General Ledger module: Account 1, Account 2, Account 3,           Account 4, Account 5, and Account 6. Users C and D are allowed to see Accounts 1, 2, and 3. Users Y and Z are allowed to see Accounts 4, 5, and 6. User M is allowed to see all accounts. So Accounts 1, 2, and 3 should be visible to Users C, D, and M (and should be hidden from         all other users), and Accounts 4, 5, and 6 should be visible to Users Y, Z, and M (and         should be hidden from all other users). You can use either of two solutions (described below) to configure the visibility of         accounts to users. Solution 1:  To address the problem of Usage Example 1, you can create three         restriction groups of type  A —Group 1, Group 2, and Group 3 (see the diagram         below, including the user visibility shown in  Final Visibility (Group Type A) ): Group 1: In this group, you include Accounts 1, 2, and 3 and Users C and D. Group 2: In this group, you include Accounts 4, 5, and 6 and Users Y and Z. Group 3: In this group, you include User M and all six accounts. If you were to use groups of type  B  instead of type  A , all accounts would         be hidden from the users included in Groups 1, 2, and 3. See  Final Visibility (Group Type           B)  in the diagram below. (To make this approach work with groups of type  B , you         would need to include User M in Groups 1, 2, and 3.) Example of groups with direct restriction and intersecting entities Solution 2:  As a second way to address the problem of Usage Example 1, you can         create two restriction groups of type  A  or  B —Group 1 and Group 2 (see         the following diagram): Group 1: In this group, you include Accounts 1, 2, and 3 and Users C and D. Group 2: In this group, you include Accounts 4, 5, and 6 and Users Y and Z. You include User M in both groups. Example of groups with direct restriction and no intersecting entities Usage Example 2 Problem statement:  Suppose that as a system administrator, you have to configure the         visibility of accounts to the appropriate users considering the following: There are four accountants: User C, User D, User Y, and User Z. There are six accounts in the General Ledger module: Account 1, Account 2, Account 3,           Account 4, Account 5, and Account 6. User Y works with only one sensitive account, Account 1; User Y is not allowed to see           the following accounts: Account 2, Account 3, Account 4, Account 5, and Account 6. The other accountants work with all accounts except Account 1. Only accountants have access to the Finance suite. (Thus, there is no need to hide           accounts from other system users.) Solution:  To address the problem of Usage Example 2, you can create two restriction         groups—Group 1 of type  A  or  B , and Group 2 of type  A Inverse  or            B Inverse . (If you select type  A  for Group 1, you should select type  A           Inverse  for Group 2. If you select type  B  for Group 1, you should select type            B Inverse  for Group 2.) These groups are defined as follows: Group 1: In this group, you include User Y and Account 1. (Other users will not see           Account 1.) Group 2: In this group, you include User Y and Accounts 2 to 6. (User Y will not see           these accounts.) The following diagram illustrates the proposed solution. Example of combined use of groups with direct and inverse restriction Usage Example 3 Problem statement:  Suppose that as a system administrator, you have to configure the         visibility of  accounts to the appropriate users considering the following: There are four accountants in your organization: User C, User D, User Y, and User           Z. There are six accounts in the General Ledger module of your organization: Account 1,           Account 2, Account 3, Account 4, Account 5, and Account 6. Users С and D should work with all six accounts. User Y should work with Accounts 1, 2, and 3 but is not allowed to see Accounts 4, 5,           and 6. User Z is a junior accountant, so this user is not allowed to see the accounts. You can use either of two solutions (described below) to configure the visibility of         accounts to users. Solution 1:  To address the problem of Usage Example 3, you can create two groups of         type  B Inverse —Group 1 and Group 2 (shown in the diagram below, with the user         visibility shown in  Final Visibility (Group Type B Inverse) ): Group 1: In this group, you include User Y and Accounts 4, 5, and 6. Group 2: In this group, you add User Z and Accounts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  If you were to use groups of type  A Inverse  instead of  B Inverse  in this         example, Accounts 4, 5, and 6 would be visible to all users because they are added in two         restriction groups (see  Final Visibility (Group Type A Inverse ) in the following         diagram). Example of groups with inverse restriction and intersecting entities Solution 2:  As a second way to address the problem of Usage Example 3, you can         create two groups of the  A Inverse  or  B Inverse  type—Group 1 and Group         2: Group 1: In this group, you include User Z and Accounts 1, 2, and 3. Group 2: In this group, you include Users Y and Z and Accounts 4, 5, and 6. The following diagram illustrates Solution 2. Example of groups with an inverse restriction and no intersecting entities Recommendations for Selecting the Restriction Group Type  As you decide which type of restriction group best meets your security needs, consider the         following recommendations: When you create multiple groups with entities of the same combination of types (for           example, suppose that you have two restriction groups that include users and customers),           use groups of the same basic type (either A or B). (Otherwise, if you were to add the same           entity to multiple groups of different types, the result may not be what you expect.) To configure the required visibility of entities, you can combine direct and inverse           restriction groups of the same basic type (either A or B), as was done in the solution of              Usage Example 2 Usage Example 2. Thus, you can combine groups of types  A  and  A Inverse ,           and groups of types  B  and  B Inverse . If you want to hide particular entities from the majority of users, include the entities           and the users who should see the entities in a group with direct restriction (type              A  or  B ). If you want to hide particular entities from a small number of users, add the entities           and the users who shouldn't see the entities to a group with inverse restriction (type              A Inverse  or  B Inverse ). ]]></column>

The operations that you can perform with restriction groups (such as creating the groups, adding entities to a group, deleting entities from a group, and viewing group details) depend on the form. This topic describes the operations that you can perform with restriction groups.{br}{TOC}
==Creating a Restriction Group==
You create a restriction group to restrict the visibility of some system entities. You do the following:[anchor|#_d11170e0-ca32-4d1e-bd26-095c2af20979]
#You open one of the forms in the '''Manage''' node of the Row-Level Security module, which you can use to create restriction groups with the particular system entities you want to add. For the list of entities, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Overview_of_Restriction_Groups|Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP].
#You enter a group name that reflects what the group limits visibility to.
#You select the group type. For information about the types of restriction groups, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Types_of_Restriction_Groups|Types of Restriction Groups].
#If the group includes users, on the '''Users''' tab, you select the users that will be included in the group.
#On the tab with the list of entities, you select the values of the entity that should be included in the group. (For example, if the entity is warehouses, you select the particular warehouses you want to include in the group.) Repeat this step for each entity type that you want to include in the group.
#You save your changes.

==Deactivating a Restriction Group==
If you do not want to apply the restrictions of some group to the system entities included in the group, you do the following:[anchor|#_f0ab518f-4e15-4f09-88d4-5f05164f6b30]
#You open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_30|Restriction Groups] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201030|SM201030]) form.
#In the Selection area, you select the restriction group you want to edit. 
#You clear the '''Active''' check box.
#You save your changes.
#:Restrictions configured in the group are no longer applied to the entities.
[anchor|#_769aca82-01cf-49ce-8b23-342ac7eaef5b]
==Setting Up Default Restriction Groups for Vendor and Customer Classes==
To ease the addition of new vendors and customers to restriction groups, you can specify a default restriction group for a vendor or customer class, so that vendors and customers of the selected class will be included in the restriction group automatically.{br}

You specify a default restriction group for a vendor class by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_10_00|Vendor Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AP201000|AP201000]) form and for a customer class by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_10_00|Customer Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR201000|AR201000]) form. You perform the following steps to specify a default restriction group for a vendor class:[anchor|#_e36a1beb-440f-4b2e-9e3d-cafc90efeff2]
#In the '''Class ID''' box, you select the vendor class for which you want to specify the default restriction group.
#In the '''Default Restriction Group''' box of the '''Default General Settings''' section on the '''General Settings''' tab, you select the default restriction group that will be used for the selected vendor class.
#You click '''Apply Restriction Settings to All Vendors''' to include all entities of the class in the default restriction group
#You save your changes.

You perform similar steps on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_10_00|Customer Classes] form when you want to specify a default restriction group for a customer class.
==Removing Class Entities from a Default Restriction Group==
If you want to cancel the visibility restriction for entities of a vendor class, you can remove all class entities from a default restriction group as follows:[anchor|#_b33cce15-efa1-41ea-ba22-bd866f17d87e]
#You open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_10_00|Vendor Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AP201000|AP201000]) form.
#In the '''Default General Settings''' section on the '''General Settings''' tab, you clear the value in the '''Default Restriction Group''' box
#You click '''Apply Restriction Settings to All Vendors'''.
#You save your changes.

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_10_00|Customer Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR201000|AR201000]) form, you can perform similar steps to remove customers of a class from the default restriction group.[anchor|#_5352f349-5e81-434f-9121-0ee8532d0797]
==Adding Entities to an Existing Restriction Group==
While addressing your everyday tasks, you may need to add users and entities to restriction groups that you have created and configured previously. For example, suppose that a new employee of your organization should use accounts with limited visibility, or that new inventory items have been added to the system and should be in a particular restriction group.{br}

When you need to add an entity to an existing group, you perform the following steps:[anchor|#_b250cd71-71bb-4cde-8f52-3611a09a15f7]
#In the '''Explore''' node of the Row-Level Security module, you open the form that displays restriction groups for the entity you want to add to the restriction group. For example, for a user, you open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_35|Restriction Groups by User] form.
#In the Selection area, you select the entity that you want to add to a restriction group. For example, in the '''Login''' box, you select ''Todd Bloom''.
#In the table with the list of restriction groups, you select the unlabeled Included check box for each group in which you want to include the selected entity.
#You save your changes.

After you have included the entity in the restriction groups, the system applies the visibility limitations to the entity.{br}

Similarly, you can remove entities from a restriction group by clearing the Included check box for this group.

In Acumatica ERP, you can control which users will use particular General Ledger (GL) accounts and subaccounts.{br}

To configure the security of GL accounts and subaccounts, you can use a combination of user roles and restriction groups. By using user roles, you can configure the access of users to branches and to all branch-specific accounts and subaccounts. With restriction groups, you can set up the visibility of particular accounts and subaccounts within branches and for certain users, and you can limit the use of subaccounts with particular accounts. For details on restriction groups, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Overview_of_Restriction_Groups|Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP].[anchor|#_8040b35f-bdec-4857-b155-1ef19b4c418f]((({S:Warn}In Acumatica ERP, you can configure groups with direct and inverse restriction. In this topic, for simplicity, groups with direct restriction are used in examples. You can use inverse restriction groups in the same way as you use direct restriction groups. For details on the types of restriction groups, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Types_of_Restriction_Groups|Types of Restriction Groups].
)))
In this topic, you will read about using restriction groups and branch-specific roles to configure and manage the security of accounts and subaccounts.{br}{TOC}
==Usage Scenarios==
The most common scenarios of managing the security of accounts and subaccounts are the following:[anchor|#_e6b0b41f-fbf9-44f1-bb2d-7b129d82e2d4]
*Managing the visibility by branch: When your organization consists of multiple branches (and you have created multiple branches in Acumatica ERP), you can configure the system so that it narrows the lists of accounts and subaccounts by branch on data entry forms. For details, see [[#_0008c803-e68d-4b0d-af8f-af0ccc8f7b29|Visibility by Branch].
*:((({S:Warn}You can configure and use the restriction groups that include branches only if the ''Multi-Branch Support'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
)))
*Managing the visibility by user: If your organization has sensitive GL accounts and subaccounts, you can provide the visibility of these objects to only a limited set of users. For more information, see [[#_3784a915-29bd-4938-949a-e3136beed6fa|Visibility by User].
*:((({S:Warn}For performance reasons, visibility restrictions by user for subaccounts do not affect analytical (ARM) and form-based reports or general inquiries. This means that users who can view the reports and general inquiries that include subaccounts will see the full list of subaccounts.
)))
*Managing the visibility of subaccounts by account: If you have subaccounts that users must use with only particular GL accounts, you can set up lists of available subaccounts for each GL account. For details, see [[#_c746c2da-64e0-4837-b30d-dd16bddd00d5|Visibility of Subaccounts by Account].
*Adding the needed objects to one restriction group to control visibility by multiple factors: For example, if you need to limit the users who use sensitive accounts, and only particular subaccounts must be used with these sensitive accounts, you can configure restriction groups to address this task. For details, see [[#_bdd367d1-d817-42b0-8174-16f93a0e40cf|Visibility of Accounts, Subaccounts, and Users].
[anchor|#_1450ad3c-e249-451f-a96c-ed52c848bc1a]((({S:Warn}If the ''By Segment: All Avail. Segment Values'' lookup mode is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form for the ''SUBACCOUNT'' segmented key (that is, if the users of your Acumatica ERP instance enter subaccounts by segments on forms), you manage the security of subaccount segments instead of entire subaccounts. In this case, you need to add to a restriction group all subaccount segments that form a subaccount whose visibility should be restricted.
)))
Cash accounts are one type of sensitive accounts that you may need to secure in the system. The ways of managing the security of cash accounts differ from the ways of managing the security of GL accounts. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Financials\CA__CON_Access_to_CashAccounts|Security of Cash Accounts ].[anchor|#_0008c803-e68d-4b0d-af8f-af0ccc8f7b29]
==Visibility by Branch==
If your organization has users who have access to multiple branches, you can use restriction groups to narrow the lists of accounts and subaccounts on data entry forms by branch. With restriction groups set up in this way, users will make fewer mistakes when selecting accounts and subaccounts on data entry forms.{br}

For example, suppose that your organization has two branches—the Headquarters office (''HQ'' in the system) and the Regional Sales office (''RS''). The accounting department processes documents for both branches. To configure the visibility restrictions of accounts and subaccounts by branch, you need to do the following:[anchor|#_91db1acc-caa5-479e-959b-bea56607a839]
#You configure user roles for each branch (for example, ''Branch HQ'' and ''Branch RS'') and assign both roles to the user accounts of the accountants. With the roles assigned, the accountants will see information for both branches in Acumatica ERP. For details, see [HelpRoot_Organization\CS__con_Branch_Security_Administration|Security of Organization Branches].
#To configure the visibility of accounts within branches, you do the following on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_10_30_40|GL Accounts by Branch Access] ([~/?ScreenId=GL103040|GL103040]) form:
##You create two restriction groups of type ''A'' (with direct restriction): the ''HQ Accounts'' group for the Headquarters office and the ''RS Accounts'' group for the Regional Sales office.
##In the ''HQ Accounts'' group, you include the Headquarters branch (''HQ'') and the accounts that should be visible within the ''HQ'' branch.
##In the ''RS Accounts'' group, you include the Regional Sales branch (''RS'') and the accounts specific to the ''RS'' branch.
#To configure the visibility of subaccounts within branches, you do the following on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_10_30_60|Subaccounts by Branch Access] ([~/?ScreenId=GL103060|GL103060]) form:
##You create two restriction groups of type ''A'' (with direct restriction): the ''HQ Subaccounts'' group for the Headquarters office and the ''RS Subaccounts'' group for the Regional Sales office.
##In the ''HQ Subaccounts'' group, you include the ''HQ'' branch and the subaccounts that should be visible within this branch.
##In the ''RS Subaccounts'' group, you include the ''RS'' branch and the subaccounts specific to this branch.

After you have configured restriction groups for accounts and branches, or subaccounts and branches, the system will narrow the lists of accounts or the list of subaccounts on data entry forms after a user selects a branch. For example, suppose that an accountant is adding a bill on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form and selects the ''HQ'' branch in the '''Branch''' column of the '''Document Details''' tab. In the '''Account''' column of the same tab, the accountant will see only accounts added to the ''HQ Accounts'' restriction group.[anchor|#_3784a915-29bd-4938-949a-e3136beed6fa]
==Visibility by User==
Within branches, your organization may have sensitive or confidential accounts and subaccounts which must be invisible for majority of users. You can control the visibility of these accounts and subaccounts for users (that is, which users can view the accounts and subaccounts) by using restriction groups.{br}

For example, suppose that only a chief accountant of your organization can work with the tax payable account. To make this account visible to the chief accountant only, you need to do the following on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_10_40_00|GL Account Access] ([~/?ScreenId=GL104000|GL104000]) form:[anchor|#_2a8de4d5-0d8c-4e3d-b35d-301b22b67de8]
#You create a restriction group (for example, ''Access to Tax Payable Account'') with direct restriction.
#You add to the group the user account of the chief accountant.
#You add to the group the tax account.

As another example, suppose that the subaccount for the financial department can be used only by accountants (and not by other users). To make this subaccount visible to only accountants, you need to do the following on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_10_40_00|GL Account Access] form:[anchor|#_bc9911c7-de05-47fd-9838-e7de99e407b0]
#You create a restriction group (for example, ''Access to Financial Subaccount'') with direct restriction.
#You add to the group the user accounts of the accountants.
#You add to the group the subaccount for the financial department.

==Visibility of Subaccounts by Account==
You can specify which subaccounts can be used with only a particular account on forms in Acumatica ERP; thus, the specified subaccounts will appear for selection only if that account is selected. This limitation will help users to avoid errors when they select accounts and subaccounts on forms.[anchor|#_7a6b0dd3-6c19-499f-9b1c-1fedab8c5acf]((({S:Warn}If you are using restriction groups to control the accounts and subaccounts that can be used together, you must create at least two groups and include all subaccounts in either of the groups. For example, suppose that you need to restrict visibility of subaccounts for only one account. To solve this task, you create two restriction groups. In the first group with direct restriction, you include a GL account and the list of subaccounts that should be related to this account. In the second group with inverse restriction, you include the same account and subaccounts that should not be displayed after users select this account. As a result, when users select the account on a form, they will see only one of the subaccounts included in the first group.
))){br}

For example, suppose that the ''ELE-000'' subaccount, which is used for electronics and computers, should be visible only after a user has selected the ''12100'' warehouse account, and the ''NSS-000'' subaccount should be related to the ''12200'' warehouse account. To restrict the visibility of the subaccounts by account, you should create the following restriction groups on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_10_40_00|GL Account Access] ([~/?ScreenId=GL104000|GL104000]) form:[anchor|#_38cb3986-ec94-4292-bb24-5af9547e7600]
#''Stock Item Subaccounts'': In this group, you need to include the ''12100'' warehouse account and the ''ELE-000'' subaccount.
#''Non-Stock Item Subaccounts'': To this group, you should add the ''12200'' warehouse account and the ''NSS-000'' subaccount.

==Visibility of Accounts, Subaccounts, and Users==
By using restriction groups, you can combine the functionality of the following scenarios:[anchor|#_7ce5a7bc-5399-4ed4-9828-64b22c89f22f]
*Managing the visibility of accounts to users
*Managing the visibility of subaccounts by account

To implement this functionality, you need to add users, accounts, and subaccounts (or subaccount segments) to the same group. In this case, the visibility will be restricted as follows:[anchor|#_5b141f7b-b07a-4a53-83d2-30894639c167]
*Only users included in the restriction group will see the accounts and subaccounts added to the group.
*If a user included in the group selects an account in the group when processing a document, he or she will be able to select a subaccount from the list of only subaccounts added to the group.

For example, suppose that the ''ELE-000'' (electronics and computers) and ''FUR-000'' (furniture) subaccounts should be visible only if a user has selected the ''12100'' warehouse account, and that only the warehouse workers User Y and User Z should work with these accounts and subaccounts. To restrict the visibility of the ''ELE-000'' and ''FUR-000'' subaccount by the ''12100'' account and to make the account and the subaccounts visible to only User Y and User Z, you should do the following on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_10_40_00|GL Account Access] ([~/?ScreenId=GL104000|GL104000]) form:[anchor|#_d2cad010-b135-4528-a919-e0cbcace8399]
#You create a restriction group (for example, ''Restriction of Warehouse Accounts'').
#You add to the group the ''12100'' warehouse account.
#You add to the group the ''ELE-000'' and ''FUR-000'' subaccounts.
#You add to the group User Y and User Z.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Account and Subaccount Security In  Acumatica ERP, you can control which users will use particular General Ledger (GL) accounts                     and subaccounts. To configure the security of GL accounts and subaccounts, you can use a                     combination of user roles and restriction groups. By using user roles, you can                     configure the access of users to branches and to all branch-specific accounts                     and subaccounts. With restriction groups, you can set up the visibility of                     particular accounts and subaccounts within branches and for certain users, and                     you can limit the use of subaccounts with particular accounts. For details on                     restriction groups, see  Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP. In  Acumatica ERP,             you can configure groups with direct and inverse restriction. In this topic, for             simplicity, groups with direct restriction are used in examples. You can use inverse             restriction groups in the same way as you use direct restriction groups. For details on             the types of restriction groups, see  Types of Restriction Groups. In this topic, you will read about using restriction groups and branch-specific                     roles to configure and manage the security of accounts and subaccounts. Usage Scenarios The most common scenarios of managing the security of accounts and subaccounts                     are the following: Managing the visibility by branch: When your organization consists of                         multiple branches (and you have created multiple branches in  Acumatica ERP), you can configure the system so that it narrows the lists of accounts                         and subaccounts by branch on data entry forms. For details, see  Visibility by Branch Visibility by Branch. You can configure and use the restriction groups                             that include branches only if the  Multi-Branch Support  feature is                             enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features                             (CS100000) form. Managing the visibility by user: If your organization has sensitive GL                         accounts and subaccounts, you can provide the visibility of these objects to                         only a limited set of users. For more information, see  Visibility by User Visibility by User. For performance reasons, visibility restrictions by             user for subaccounts do not affect analytical (ARM) and form-based reports or general             inquiries. This means that users who can view the reports and general inquiries that             include subaccounts will see the full list of subaccounts. Managing the visibility of subaccounts by account: If you have subaccounts                         that users must use with only particular GL accounts, you can set up lists                         of available subaccounts for each GL account. For details, see  Visibility of Subaccounts by Account Visibility of Subaccounts by Account. Adding the needed objects to one restriction group to control visibility by                         multiple factors: For example, if you need to limit the users who use                         sensitive accounts, and only particular subaccounts must be used with these                         sensitive accounts, you can configure restriction groups to address this                         task. For details, see  Visibility of Accounts, Subaccounts, and Users Visibility of Accounts, Subaccounts, and Users. If the  By Segment: All Avail. Segment Values              lookup mode is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) Segmented Keys             (CS202000) form for the  SUBACCOUNT  segmented key (that is, if the users of             your  Acumatica ERP             instance enter subaccounts by segments on forms), you manage the security of subaccount             segments instead of entire subaccounts. In this case, you need to add to a restriction             group all subaccount segments that form a subaccount whose visibility should be             restricted. Cash accounts are one type of sensitive accounts that you may need to secure in                     the system. The ways of managing the security of cash accounts differ from the                     ways of managing the security of GL accounts. For more information, see  Security of Cash Accounts . Visibility by Branch If your organization has users who have access to multiple branches, you can use                     restriction groups to narrow the lists of accounts and subaccounts on data entry                     forms by branch. With restriction groups set up in this way, users will make                     fewer mistakes when selecting accounts and subaccounts on data entry forms. For example, suppose that your organization has two branches—the Headquarters                     office ( HQ  in the system) and the Regional Sales office ( RS ). The                     accounting department processes documents for both branches. To configure the                     visibility restrictions of accounts and subaccounts by branch, you need to do                     the following: You configure user roles for each branch (for example,  Branch HQ  and                              Branch RS ) and assign both roles to the user accounts of the                         accountants. With the roles assigned, the accountants will see information                         for both branches in  Acumatica ERP. For details, see  Security of Organization Branches. To configure the visibility of accounts within branches, you do the                         following on the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL103040|GL103040]) GL Accounts by Branch Access (GL103040)                             form: You create two restriction groups of type  A  (with direct                                 restriction): the  HQ Accounts  group for the Headquarters                                 office and the  RS Accounts  group for the Regional Sales                                 office. In the  HQ Accounts  group, you include the Headquarters branch                                     ( HQ ) and the accounts that should be visible within the                                      HQ  branch. In the  RS Accounts  group, you include the Regional Sales                                 branch ( RS ) and the accounts specific to the  RS                                  branch. To configure the visibility of subaccounts within branches, you do the                         following on the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL103060|GL103060]) Subaccounts by Branch Access (GL103060)                             form: You create two restriction groups of type  A  (with direct                                 restriction): the  HQ Subaccounts  group for the Headquarters                                 office and the  RS Subaccounts  group for the Regional Sales                                 office. In the  HQ Subaccounts  group, you include the  HQ  branch                                 and the subaccounts that should be visible within this branch. In the  RS Subaccounts  group, you include the  RS  branch                                 and the subaccounts specific to this branch. After you have configured restriction groups for accounts and branches, or                     subaccounts and branches, the system will narrow the lists of accounts or the                     list of subaccounts on data entry forms after a user selects a branch. For                     example, suppose that an accountant is adding a bill on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form and selects the                          HQ  branch in the  Branch  column of the                          Document Details  tab. In the                          Account  column of the same tab, the accountant will                     see only accounts added to the  HQ Accounts  restriction group. Visibility by User Within branches, your organization may have sensitive or confidential accounts                     and subaccounts which must be invisible for majority of users. You can control                     the visibility of these accounts and subaccounts for users (that is, which users                     can view the accounts and subaccounts) by using restriction groups. For example, suppose that only a chief accountant of your organization can work                     with the tax payable account. To make this account visible to the chief                     accountant only, you need to do the following on the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL104000|GL104000]) GL Account Access (GL104000) form: You create a restriction group (for example,  Access to Tax Payable                             Account ) with direct restriction. You add to the group the user account of the chief accountant. You add to the group the tax account. As another example, suppose that the subaccount for the financial department can                     be used only by accountants (and not by other users). To make this subaccount                     visible to only accountants, you need to do the following on the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL104000|GL104000]) GL Account Access form: You create a restriction group (for example,  Access to Financial                             Subaccount ) with direct restriction. You add to the group the user accounts of the accountants. You add to the group the subaccount for the financial department. Visibility of Subaccounts by Account You can specify which subaccounts can be used with only a particular account on                     forms in  Acumatica ERP; thus, the specified subaccounts will appear for selection only if that                     account is selected. This limitation will help users to avoid errors when they                     select accounts and subaccounts on forms. If you are using restriction groups to             control the accounts and subaccounts that can be used together, you must create at least             two groups and include all subaccounts in either of the groups. For example, suppose             that you need to restrict visibility of subaccounts for only one account. To solve this             task, you create two restriction groups. In the first group with direct restriction, you             include a GL account and the list of subaccounts that should be related to this account.             In the second group with inverse restriction, you include the same account and             subaccounts that should not be displayed after users select this account. As a result,             when users select the account on a form, they will see only one of the subaccounts             included in the first group. For example, suppose that the  ELE-000  subaccount, which is used for                     electronics and computers, should be visible only after a user has selected the                          12100  warehouse account, and the  NSS-000  subaccount should be                     related to the  12200  warehouse account. To restrict the visibility of the                     subaccounts by account, you should create the following restriction groups on                     the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL104000|GL104000]) GL Account Access (GL104000)                         form: Stock Item Subaccounts : In this group, you need to include the                                  12100  warehouse account and the  ELE-000                              subaccount. Non-Stock Item Subaccounts : To this group, you should add the                                  12200  warehouse account and the  NSS-000                              subaccount. Visibility of Accounts, Subaccounts, and Users By using restriction groups, you can combine the functionality of the following                     scenarios: Managing the visibility of accounts to users Managing the visibility of subaccounts by account To implement this functionality, you need to add users, accounts, and subaccounts                     (or subaccount segments) to the same group. In this case, the visibility will be                     restricted as follows: Only users included in the restriction group will see the accounts and                         subaccounts added to the group. If a user included in the group selects an account in the group when                         processing a document, he or she will be able to select a subaccount from                         the list of only subaccounts added to the group. For example, suppose that the  ELE-000  (electronics and computers) and                          FUR-000  (furniture) subaccounts should be visible only if a user has                     selected the  12100  warehouse account, and that only the warehouse workers                     User Y and User Z should work with these accounts and subaccounts. To restrict                     the visibility of the  ELE-000  and  FUR-000  subaccount by the                          12100  account and to make the account and the subaccounts visible to                     only User Y and User Z, you should do the following on the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL104000|GL104000]) GL Account Access (GL104000) form: You create a restriction group (for example,  Restriction of Warehouse                                 Accounts ).

Cash is a company&rsquo;s most liquid asset, which is why an organization must have adequate controls to secure it.

))){br}{TOC}
==Usage Scenarios==
The most common scenarios of managing the security of cash accounts are the following:[anchor|#_2c644be6-e994-414d-bd7d-56065e78fa06]
*Managing the visibility by branch: If your organization consists of multiple branches, you can allow users in each branch to work with only branch-specific cash accounts. For details, see [[#_84a967e4-a322-442f-b327-34979e6f09c1|Visibility of Cash Accounts by Branch].
*:((({S:Warn}You can configure multiple branches only if the ''Multi-Branch Support'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. If the ''Multi-Branch Support'' feature is disabled, all cash accounts belong to a single branch and are visible to all users who are allowed to view the accounts, based on their membership in restriction groups.
)))
*Managing the visibility by user: If only a limited number of users can work with cash accounts, you can configure the visibility of the cash accounts to only these users. For more information, see [[#_8e70b875-2447-4064-bfad-b4835ba63c94|Visibility of Cash Accounts by User].
[anchor|#_84a967e4-a322-442f-b327-34979e6f09c1]
==Visibility of Cash Accounts by Branch==
The visibility of a cash account can be restricted based on the branch the account belongs to. Consider a user who is allowed to view multiple branches due to this user&rsquo;s assigned branch roles. On the data entry forms, this user can view the cash accounts of all the branches this user is allowed to view, based on the branch selected in the '''Branch''' box of the data entry form (which is filled by default with the branch to which the user is currently signed in).{br}

To restrict the visibility of a cash account by the branch, you should do the following:[anchor|#_a2126868-74bd-44f2-9be0-0f92318a9ea0]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you enable the ''Inter-Branch Transactions'' feature, which gives you the ability to configure the automatic generation of inter-branch transactions for each document that involves multiple branches. With this feature enabled, the '''Restrict Visibility by Branch''' check box appears on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_20_00|Cash Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CA202000|CA202000]) form.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_20_00|Cash Accounts] form, you select a cash account, select the '''Restrict Visibility by Branch''' check box, and save your changes. You repeat this step for each cash account whose visibility you want to control. 
#:With this check box selected, the cash account is visible to only users who can select the branch (specified for the cash account) in the '''Branch''' box on the data entry forms. (If the '''Restrict Visibility by Branch''' check box is cleared for a cash account, this cash account will be visible regardless of the selected branch.)
#:((({S:Warn}If the '''Branch''' box is absent on a data entry form, then the visibility of the cash account is defined by the branch to which the user is currently signed in.
)))
#If you have a company with branches not requiring balancing (the ''Multi-Branch Support'' feature is enabled and the ''Inter-Branch Transactions'' feature is disabled), you can still control the visibility of cash accounts across branches by selecting or clearing the '''Restrict Visibility by Branch''' check box.

Alternatively, you can restrict access to cash accounts by using branch roles in the same way as for GL accounts. For details, see [HelpRoot_Financials\GL__con_Account_and_Subaccount_Security|Account and Subaccount Security].[anchor|#_8e70b875-2447-4064-bfad-b4835ba63c94]
==Visibility of Cash Accounts by User==
You can control the visibility of a specific cash account to users (that is, which users can view the account) with the help of restriction groups.{br}

For example, suppose that there is only one accountant in your organization and only this person should work with a cash account in the system. To restrict the visibility of the cash account, you should do the following on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_10_40_00|GL Account Access] ([~/?ScreenId=GL104000|GL104000]) form:[anchor|#_bd122767-0196-4b01-8c54-e42f16c9abff]
#You create a restriction group (for example, ''Access to Cash Account'') with direct restriction.
#You add to the group the user account of the accountant.
#You add to the group the GL account the cash account is linked to.
((({S:Hint}We recommend that you carefully design and configure restriction groups containing accounts, so that a user can view the accounts he or she needs for work. Otherwise, a user may encounter problems with processing transactions of the linked cash accounts.

In  Acumatica ERP,             you can configure groups with direct and inverse restriction. In this topic, for             simplicity, groups with direct restriction are used in examples. You can use inverse             restriction groups in the same way as you use direct restriction groups. For details on             the types of restriction groups, see  Types of Restriction Groups.

In Acumatica ERP, organizations implement general access restrictions by assigning roles to users of the system. The roles assigned to users allow them to access the needed resources to perform specific tasks required for their jobs. If a role allows a user to view or edit General Ledger (GL) budget articles, the user can view all the articles, including those that might be sensitive. {br}

By using restriction groups, you can limit the visibility of sensitive budget articles so that only particular users can see and work with these articles. In this topic, you will read about configuring restriction groups for managing the security of sensitive GL budget articles.[anchor|#_6d04be2d-b048-40fe-a08d-f7168d52d727]((({S:Warn}In Acumatica ERP, you can configure groups with direct and inverse restriction.

)))
==Managing the Visibility of GL Budget Articles by User==
You can configure restriction groups that will limit the visibility of GL budget articles (leaf articles or nodes at any level) for users. As a result, the users not included in the group will not be able to see the budget articles (and these articles&rsquo; subarticles, if there are any). {br}

For example, suppose that the ''Wages'' budget article should be available to only the chief financial officer of your organization. To configure the visibility of this budget article, you need to do the following on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_10_50_30|GL Budget Access] ([~/?ScreenId=GL105030|GL105030]) form:[anchor|#_70c10c62-2fdc-492e-9f1c-d9c55db94678]
#You create a restriction group (for example, ''Group for Wages Budget Article'') with direct restriction.
#You add to the group the user account of the chief financial officer.
#You add to the group the ''Wages'' budget article.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Security of GL Budget Articles In  Acumatica ERP, organizations implement general access restrictions by assigning roles to                     users of the system. The roles assigned to users allow them to access the needed                     resources to perform specific tasks required for their jobs. If a role allows a                     user to view or edit General Ledger (GL) budget articles, the user can view all                     the articles, including those that might be sensitive.  By using restriction groups, you can limit the visibility of sensitive budget                     articles so that only particular users can see and work with these articles. In                     this topic, you will read about configuring restriction groups for managing the                     security of sensitive GL budget articles. In  Acumatica ERP,             you can configure groups with direct and inverse restriction. In this topic, for             simplicity, groups with direct restriction are used in examples. You can use inverse             restriction groups in the same way as you use direct restriction groups. For details on             the types of restriction groups, see  Types of Restriction Groups. Managing the Visibility of GL Budget Articles by User You can configure restriction groups that will limit the visibility of GL budget articles (leaf                     articles or nodes at any level) for users. As a result, the users not included                     in the group will not be able to see the budget articles (and these articles'                     subarticles, if there are any).  For example, suppose that the  Wages  budget article should be available to only the chief                     financial officer of your organization. To configure the visibility of this                     budget article, you need to do the following on the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL105030|GL105030]) GL Budget Access (GL105030) form: You create a restriction group (for example,  Group for Wages Budget Article ) with direct                         restriction. You add to the group the user account of the chief financial officer. You add to the group the  Wages  budget article. For more details about restriction groups, see  Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP. Forms for Security of GL Budget Articles In the following table, you can find the list of forms that you can use to manage restriction                     groups with GL budget articles and tasks that you can resolve by using each                     form.

An organization can have multiple warehouses in Acumatica ERP, and different groups of employees may work with these warehouses in the system. To limit in the system the set of employees who work with a particular warehouse, you can create restriction groups to display the warehouse for only employees who are responsible for tasks that involve this warehouse. If the employees who work with the same warehouse perform only specific tasks (such as accepting goods and creating purchase orders), you can provide these employees with access to only the forms that they should use.{br}

In this topic, you can find information about configuring the security of warehouses in Acumatica ERP.[anchor|#_3dc39780-7419-4315-b23c-c64039127789]((({S:Warn}In Acumatica ERP, you can configure groups with direct and inverse restriction.

))){br}{TOC}
==Usage Scenarios==
The most common scenarios of managing the security of warehouses are the following:[anchor|#_e6c4ab3e-0a34-4d0a-835c-56649986b384]
*Managing access to forms based on employees&rsquo; functional roles: If employees perform specific tasks (such as receiving goods and creating purchase orders), you can provide the employees access to the forms they use in their work, and revoke access for forms that they shouldn&rsquo;t use. For details, see [[#_07c5704c-91d2-4625-8b6a-6f976845f25d|Access to Forms Based on Roles].
*Managing the visibility of particular warehouses by user: If you have created multiple warehouses in Acumatica ERP, you can restrict the visibility of warehouses to users on forms by using restriction groups. For details, see [[#_cc2d2b92-df2e-456d-b7ee-ab5deeec2d22|Visibility of Warehouses by User].
*:((({S:Warn}You can create and manage multiple warehouses in Acumatica ERP only if the ''Multiple Warehouses'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
)))

In addition to managing the visibility of warehouses in whole, you can restrict the visibility of particular inventory items. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Restriction_Groups_for_Subitems|Inventory Item Security].[anchor|#_07c5704c-91d2-4625-8b6a-6f976845f25d]
==Access to Forms Based on Roles==
By using the forms of the User Security submodule, you can use user roles in Acumatica ERP to give employees access to forms related to working with warehouses. A role can correspond to an area of responsibility for an employee who performs warehouse-related tasks, such as creating purchase orders, accepting goods, and preparing replenishment. If needed, you can assign multiple roles to an employee. For more information about user roles, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Role-Based_Access|Role-Based Access].{br}

Consider the following examples of roles for employees who work with inventory and order management:[anchor|#_9e9ef9aa-0e2f-4340-8ef5-36bde20a93a7]
*''Supervisor'': A role for an employee who configures the Inventory submodule and manages work with the submodule. This role should have access to the forms related to inventory processes, such as the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form.
*''Data Entry Clerk'': A role for an employee who creates documents on data entry forms. You should provide access to such forms as [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]), or [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_40_00|Transfers] ([~/?ScreenId=IN304000|IN304000]).
*''Purchasing Manager'': A role for an employee who is responsible for replenishment. For this role, you should provide access to the '''Replenishment''' node of the '''Processes''' tab of the Inventory module.
[anchor|#_cc2d2b92-df2e-456d-b7ee-ab5deeec2d22]
==Visibility of Warehouses by User==
By default, all employees who have access to forms of the inventory and order management modules can see all warehouses created in the system. By using the forms of the Row-Level Security module, you can configure the system so that each warehouse is displayed only to users who work with this warehouse. You can use restriction groups to set up the visibility of warehouses to employees. For details on restriction groups, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Overview_of_Restriction_Groups|Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP].{br}

For example, suppose that your system has the ''Wholesale'' and ''Retail'' warehouses defined, and you need to configure the visibility of these warehouses to users as follows:[anchor|#_d28ad978-019a-42db-89b7-4320726d9902]
*User S is a supervisor who should configure and manage both warehouses.
*User C1 is a clerk who enters documents for the ''Wholesale'' warehouse.
*User C2 is a clerk who enters documents for the ''Retail'' warehouse.

To configure the visibility of warehouses according to this example, you do the following on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_20_00|Warehouse Access] ([~/?ScreenId=IN102000|IN102000]) form:[anchor|#_c872b40b-bf0f-461a-9ad6-d909da9c4444]
#You create two restriction groups of type ''A'' (with direct restriction): ''Group 1'' for the ''Wholesale'' warehouse, and ''Group 2'' for the ''Retail'' warehouse.
#In Group 1, you include User S, User C1, and the ''Wholesale'' warehouse.
#In Group 2, you include User S, User C2, and the ''Retail'' warehouse.

The resulting visibility of warehouses will be the following:[anchor|#_ad5a1175-faf2-4029-8609-c5be36236d83]
*User S can see both the ''Wholesale'' and ''Retail'' warehouses.
*User C1 can see only the ''Wholesale'' warehouse.
*User C2 can see only the ''Retail'' warehouse.

==Forms for Warehouse Security==
In the following table, you can find the list of forms that you can use to manage restriction groups with warehouses and tasks that you can solve by using each form.[anchor|#_388ccace-9ad0-41c6-9ba7-dc51bdc7f83b]

==Visibility of Inventory Items to Users==
The list of inventory items from which employees should select an item can be very long, which increases the probability of an entry error. By using restriction groups, you can reduce the list of inventory items that users see on forms. For more information about restriction groups, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Overview_of_Restriction_Groups|Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP].((({S:Warn}The ''N/A'' item cannot be specified in restriction groups.
)))
For example, suppose that your organization sells furniture, and that each sales manager works with furniture for a particular room, such as kitchen, living room, and bedroom. When managers create a sales order, they should select items from only the list of furniture they sell to avoid entry mistakes. Further suppose that User K sells kitchen furniture, User L sells living room furniture, and User M sells bedroom furniture. To restrict the visibility of inventory items to the appropriate users in the system, you would create the following restriction groups with direct restriction on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_30_00|Inventory Item Access] ([~/?ScreenId=IN103000|IN103000]) form:[anchor|#_d3e771f4-a7a5-4aef-a4aa-ce4290b79fd7]
#Group K: In this group, include User K and all inventory IDs for kitchen furniture items.
#Group L: To this group, add User L and all inventory IDs for items of living room furniture.
#Group M: In this group, include User M and all inventory IDs for bedroom furniture items.

As a result, the visibility of the inventory items in sales orders will be restricted in the system as follows:[anchor|#_c62dd817-8592-48ae-a390-2379eebec4cd]
*User K can view and select only inventory items for kitchen furniture.
*User L can work with only inventory items for living room furniture.
*User M can see and select only inventory items for bedroom furniture.
*Other users cannot see the inventory items that have been added to the three restriction groups in the system.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Inventory Item Security An organization that distributes goods may have many items in stock. In this                     case, users who work with inventory items in the system may have specific tasks                     and work with only particular item classes. When users create a sales order,                     they need to enter an inventory ID for each product. You can define restriction                     groups to limit the lists of inventory items particular users see. In this topic, you will read about managing the visibility of inventory items to                     users in the system. In  Acumatica ERP,             you can configure groups with direct and inverse restriction. In this topic, for             simplicity, groups with direct restriction are used in examples. You can use inverse             restriction groups in the same way as you use direct restriction groups. For details on             the types of restriction groups, see  Types of Restriction Groups. Visibility of Inventory Items to Users The list of inventory items from which employees should select an item can be                     very long, which increases the probability of an entry error. By using                     restriction groups, you can reduce the list of inventory items that users see on                     forms. For more information about restriction groups, see  Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP. The  N/A  item cannot be specified in restriction groups. For example, suppose that your organization sells furniture, and that each sales                     manager works with furniture for a particular room, such as kitchen, living                     room, and bedroom. When managers create a sales order, they should select items                     from only the list of furniture they sell to avoid entry mistakes. Further                     suppose that User K sells kitchen furniture, User L sells living room furniture,                     and User M sells bedroom furniture. To restrict the visibility of inventory                     items to the appropriate users in the system, you would create the following                     restriction groups with direct restriction on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN103000|IN103000]) Inventory Item Access (IN103000) form: Group K: In this group, include User K and all inventory IDs for kitchen                         furniture items. Group L: To this group, add User L and all inventory IDs for items of living                         room furniture. Group M: In this group, include User M and all inventory IDs for bedroom                         furniture items. As a result, the visibility of the inventory items in sales orders will be                     restricted in the system as follows: User K can view and select only inventory items for kitchen furniture. User L can work with only inventory items for living room furniture. User M can see and select only inventory items for bedroom furniture. Other users cannot see the inventory items that have been added to the three                         restriction groups in the system. Forms for Inventory Item Security In the following table, you can find the list of the forms that you can use to manage restriction                     groups with inventory items and the tasks that you can perform by using each                     form.

If your organization has multiple branches defined in Acumatica ERP, you may need to control which employees get access to which branches. Because branches share some data, you may also need to control access to the shared data. Acumatica ERP provides user access roles, which you can use to control users&rsquo; access to branches, and restriction groups to limit the visibility of shared data. In this topic, you will read about ways to manage the security of a branch.[anchor|#_d9baded4-28e7-43b8-ba26-7fa8d4a2a6ba]((({S:Warn}In Acumatica ERP, you can configure groups with direct and inverse restriction.

))){br}{TOC}
==Usage Scenarios==
The most common scenarios of managing the security of company branches are the following:[anchor|#_b9b8c5e3-80eb-4c1e-a945-383b6acb6d58]
*Managing user access to branches: If your organization has multiple branches (and you have created multiple branches in Acumatica ERP), you can configure access to branches for employees who work in these branches. For details, see [[#_4ed4413f-2feb-413f-9575-2e6418759f77|User Access to Branches].
*Managing the visibility of data shared between branches: If you need to make data shared between branches (such as General Ledger accounts and subaccounts) visible only within a particluar branch, you can use restriction groups to resolve this task. For more information, see [[#_8c88a8b6-c04d-4e81-8867-655182496a2a|Visibility of Data Within a Branch].
((({S:Warn}You can create and maintain multiple branches in your Acumatica ERP instance only if the ''Multi-Branch Support'' feature is enabled in your system on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form (for details, see [HelpRoot_Organization\CS__con_Multiple_Branch_Support|Multiple Branch Support]).
)))[anchor|#_4ed4413f-2feb-413f-9575-2e6418759f77]
==User Access to Branches==
After multiple branches have been defined in the system, you provide access to the branches for users who will work in the system as follows:[anchor|#_1a58cb12-9a85-4478-9f93-061649fd28b3]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_05|User Roles] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201005|SM201005]) form, you create branch-specific user roles (one role per branch) and assign these roles to user accounts. For details on user roles, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Role-Based_Access|Role-Based Access].
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_20_00|Branches] ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) form, you assign the roles to branches as follows: For each branch, in the '''Access Role''' box, you select the user role created for this branch.
((({S:Hint}[anchor|#_645dd439-2d31-4735-89cd-946c9395fb7a]
*Once a role is assigned to one of the branches, other branches also must have roles assigned. A branch with no role assigned will be inaccessible to any user.
*To allow a user to access multiple branches, assign to him or her the roles for the branches to which the user should have access.
)))
If a user, based on his or her role, has access to a data entry form where this user enters a document and specifies the branch of origin, only the branches to which the user has access are available on the drop-down list. The users who have access to multiple branches can select the specific branch from the '''Branches''' menu on the form&rsquo;s title toolbar and create documents on behalf of the selected branch.{br}

No matter which branch users have access to, users who have access to the following forms, based on their roles, will see and work with all branches (because users configure system objects by using these forms):[anchor|#_434f742c-c59e-499c-897a-95672a63807e]

[anchor|#_8c88a8b6-c04d-4e81-8867-655182496a2a]
==Visibility of Data Within a Branch==
Branches have some data shared between branches and some data kept as branch-specific (for details, see [HelpRoot_Organization\CS__con_Multiple_Branch_Support|Multiple Branch Support]). You may need to restrict the visibility of data that is shared but may contain sensitive information, such as General Ledger accounts and subaccounts. Acumatica ERP provides restriction groups so you can control which accounts and subaccounts are used with which branch. For details on configuring restriction groups for accounts and subaccounts, see [HelpRoot_Financials\GL__con_Account_and_Subaccount_Security|Account and Subaccount Security].
==Forms for Branch Security==
In the following table, you can find the list of the forms that you can use to manage restriction groups with branches and the tasks that you can resolve by using each form.[anchor|#_6beb2f98-1899-4f5d-9411-15c719bbf2f8]

If your organization sells goods and provides services to customers, you may have a great deal of customer-related information stored in Acumatica ERP. When the employees of your organization create documents for customers, they have to select the required customer from the full list of customers. If certain employees work with only very important customers, and other employees are not allowed to see these customers in the system for security reasons, you can create restriction groups to manage the visibility of your customers to users of Acumatica ERP, as described in this topic.[anchor|#_008d6e41-2ca4-4248-acbf-47899060924d]((({S:Warn}In Acumatica ERP, you can configure groups with direct and inverse restriction. In this topic, for simplicity, groups with direct restriction are used in examples. You can use inverse restriction groups in the same way as you use direct restriction groups. For details on the types of restriction groups, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Types_of_Restriction_Groups|Types of Restriction Groups].
)))
==Visibility of Customers by User==
By using restriction groups, you can show or hide particular customers on Acumatica ERP forms, depending on the user who is logged in to the system. For example, if some customers are very important to your organization, dedicated employees might be assigned to process documents that contain information about these customers in the system. For details about restriction groups, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Overview_of_Restriction_Groups|Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP].{br}

For example, suppose that your organization provides cleaning services and Megabank is a very important customer of your organization. Manager M is responsible for all operations in the systems related to Megabank, and other managers should not see Megabank on any forms of the system. To configure the visibility of this customer in the system, you need to do the following on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_20_00|Customer Access] ([~/?ScreenId=AR102000|AR102000]) form:[anchor|#_eaabd147-33e1-4fc7-b6e0-9947336ebfec]
#You create a restriction group (for example, ''Group for Megabank'') with direct restriction.
#You add to the group the user account of the Manager M.
#You add to the group the Megabank customer.

If you use customer classes and want to include each new customer of a particular class in a restriction group automatically, you can specify a default restriction group for this class, as described in the [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Operations_Restriction_Groups#_769aca82-01cf-49ce-8b23-342ac7eaef5b|Setting Up Default Restriction Groups for Vendor and Customer Classes] section of [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Operations_Restriction_Groups|Operations with Restriction Groups].
==Forms for Customer Security==
In the following table, you can find the list of the forms that you can use to manage restriction groups with customers and the tasks that you can resolve by using each form.[anchor|#_26b3e1fb-7041-4352-880a-d535a4568594]

When the employees of your organization create documents for customers, they have to select the required customer from the full list of customers. If certain employees work with only very important customers, and other employees are not allowed to see these customers in the system for security reasons, you can create restriction groups to manage the visibility of your customers to users of  Acumatica ERP, as described in this topic. In  Acumatica ERP,             you can configure groups with direct and inverse restriction. In this topic, for             simplicity, groups with direct restriction are used in examples. You can use inverse             restriction groups in the same way as you use direct restriction groups. For details on             the types of restriction groups, see  Types of Restriction Groups. Visibility of Customers by User By using restriction groups, you can show or hide particular customers on  Acumatica ERP forms, depending on the user who is logged in to the system. For example, if some customers are very important to your organization, dedicated employees might be assigned to process documents that contain information about these customers in the system. For details about restriction groups, see  Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP. For example, suppose that your organization provides cleaning services and Megabank is a very important customer of your organization. Manager M is responsible for all operations in the systems related to Megabank, and other managers should not see Megabank on any forms of the system. To configure the visibility of this customer in the system, you need to do the following on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR102000|AR102000]) Customer Access (AR102000) form: You create a restriction group (for example,  Group for Megabank ) with direct restriction. You add to the group the user account of the Manager M. You add to the group the Megabank customer. If you use customer classes and want to include each new customer of a particular class in a restriction group automatically, you can specify a default restriction group for this class, as described in the  Setting Up Default Restriction Groups for Vendor and Customer Classes section of  Operations with Restriction Groups.

#You create a restriction group with direct restriction (for example, ''Group for ABComputers'').
#You add to the group the user account of the senior accountant.
#You add to the group the ABComputers vendor.

If you have configured vendor classes, you can specify a default restriction group for a vendor class. With this setting, all new vendors of the class will be automatically added to the restriction group.

Many organizations use projects to achieve their business objectives efficiently. An organization may have multiple projects in progress. By limiting users&rsquo; access to and visibility of information about particular projects and related transactions, managers can properly organize the work on each project. In Acumatica ERP, you can use roles to provide access to forms according to employees&rsquo; responsibilities and restriction groups to configure the visibility of particular projects only to a responsible team, as described in this topic.[anchor|#_38599cf5-ed1c-4b2a-a1df-5acb7ce919d8]((({S:Warn}In Acumatica ERP, you can configure groups with direct and inverse restriction.

))){br}{TOC}
==Usage Scenarios==
The most common scenarios of managing the security of projects are the following:[anchor|#_6a8eb288-ece6-413f-8269-d91bae495e26]
*Managing access to forms based on functional role: Each employee involved with a project has his or her specific tasks. You can configure user roles that will provide employees access to forms of the Projects module according to their responsibilities. For details, see [[#_f902b0f5-43ae-48e4-8ede-0ad0a554032c|Access to Forms Based on Roles].
*Managing the visibility of particular projects by user: If your organization has multiple project teams and multiple employees have the same functional responsibilities in different projects, you can make particular projects available to employees of only a particular project team by using restriction groups. For more information, see [[#_9e2ec220-fc26-4102-afd1-7db5cc190179|Visibility of Projects by Users].
*Managing the visibility of projects by module: If a project should be associated with transactions in a particular module (such as Accounts Payable), you can make it visible only within this module. For details, see [[#_b3b38f4c-66e4-48d1-b908-a79704bcdf22|Visibility of Projects by Modules].
[anchor|#_f902b0f5-43ae-48e4-8ede-0ad0a554032c]
==Access to Forms Based on Roles==
By using the forms of the User Security module, you can configure access rights to the forms of the Projects module for each employee in accordance with the employee&rsquo;s typical responsibilities. For more information about user roles, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Role-Based_Access|Role-Based Access].{br}

For example, you can create the following roles for employees of your organization who work with projects: [anchor|#_8441686b-b520-4443-b632-1b90b807bb09]
*''Project Manager:'' A role for an employee who coordinates the project and is responsible for achieving the project goals. In the system, this person sets up pricing in projects, creates tasks, and configures projects and project templates. This role should have access to forms on the '''Configuration''' tab in the Projects module. Also, this role may have access to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) form so that the users with this role can approve projects.
*''Project Controller'': A role for an employee who controls project transactions, performs allocations, and runs project billing. This role should have full access to forms on the '''Processes''' tab of the Projects module.
*''Project Accountant'': A role for an employee who plans and executes the project budget and enters project transactions. This role should have access to forms on the '''Work Area''' tab of the Projects module.
*''Project Team Member:'' A role for an employee who works for a project and enters time sheets and time cards. This role should have access to the forms on the '''Work Area''' tab of the Projects module and to the forms on the '''Work Area''' tab of the Time and Expenses module.
[anchor|#_9e2ec220-fc26-4102-afd1-7db5cc190179]
==Visibility of Projects by Users==
By using the forms of the Row-Level Security module, you can configure the system to hide or display particular projects for employees, in addition to implementing task-based roles. Employees who have access to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form will be able to view or edit all the projects available in your organization. You may need to use restriction groups to restrict the visibility of specific projects to only employees of the project team. For details on restriction groups, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Overview_of_Restriction_Groups|Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP].{br}

For example, suppose that you need to restrict the visibility of projects to employees in your organization considering the following: [anchor|#_0d1f8263-516c-4cad-b8f3-662f3d747c5c]
*There are two projects in your organization: ''Project Y'' and ''Project Z''.
*User PM is a project manager who controls all projects in your organization.
*User AC is an accountant who plans budgets and performs transactions for all projects in your organization.
*Users E1 and E2 are engineers who work on ''Project Y''.
*Users E3 and E4 are engineers who work on ''Project Z''.

To configure the visibility of projects according to the listed statements, you would do the following on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_20_00|Project Access] ([~/?ScreenId=PM102000|PM102000]) form:[anchor|#_574d3838-e5b1-42a3-be14-b5555a76de85]
#You create two restriction groups of type ''A'' (with direct restriction): Group 1 for ''Project Y'' and Group 2 for ''Project Z''.
#In Group 1, you include ''Project Y'', User PM, User AC, Users E1 and E2.
#In Group 2, you include ''Project Z'', User PM, User AC, Users E3 and E4.

With the settings you have made, the visibility of projects would be the following:[anchor|#_07596fee-a213-428e-9b85-a14b8be50f50]
*Users PM and AC can see both ''Project Y'' and ''Project Z''.
*Users E1 and E2 can see only ''Project Y''.
*Users E3 and E4 can see only ''Project Z''.
[anchor|#_b3b38f4c-66e4-48d1-b908-a79704bcdf22]
==Visibility of Projects by Modules==
After you have created a project in Acumatica ERP, the project is available system-wide by default. You can control the visibility of projects within modules in the following ways:[anchor|#_18441670-4f05-4592-bb43-c799d0660b58]
*Display or hide the '''Project''' boxes and columns on forms: If you use projects in a particular module (for example, Accounts Receivable), you can configure the system to display the boxes and columns where a user can select a project on forms only within this module. In the '''Visibility Settings''' section of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form, you can select all such modules.
*Display or hide a project: If the project transactions should be performed within a particular module (for example, Inventory), you can make the project visible only in this module so that users can select only appropriate projects when they are preparing documents. You can select modules in the '''Visibility Settings''' section of the '''General Info''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. After you have selected a module, users can select the project in documents generated on the module forms, and the release of these documents automatically updates the project data.
*Display or hide tasks of a project: If employees need to process documents related to a project in multiple modules, but the users perform particular tasks of a project in a certain module (for example, the ''Warehouse operations'' task is performed in the Inventory module and the ''Customer payments'' task is performed in the Accounts Receivable module), you can select the modules where the task will be displayed. You select these modules in the '''Visibility Settings''' section of the '''General Info''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form.

By limiting users'                     access to and visibility of information about particular projects and related                     transactions, managers can properly organize the work on each project. In  Acumatica ERP, you can use roles to provide access to forms according to employees'                     responsibilities and restriction groups to configure the visibility of                     particular projects only to a responsible team, as described in this topic. In  Acumatica ERP,             you can configure groups with direct and inverse restriction. In this topic, for             simplicity, groups with direct restriction are used in examples. You can use inverse             restriction groups in the same way as you use direct restriction groups. For details on             the types of restriction groups, see  Types of Restriction Groups. Usage Scenarios The most common scenarios of managing the security of projects are the                     following: Managing access to forms based on functional role: Each employee involved                         with a project has his or her specific tasks. You can configure user roles                         that will provide employees access to forms of the Projects module according                         to their responsibilities. For details, see  Access to Forms Based on Roles Access to Forms Based on Roles. Managing the visibility of particular projects by user: If your organization                         has multiple project teams and multiple employees have the same functional                         responsibilities in different projects, you can make particular projects                         available to employees of only a particular project team by using                         restriction groups. For more information, see  Visibility of Projects by Users Visibility of Projects by Users. Managing the visibility of projects by module: If a project should be                         associated with transactions in a particular module (such as Accounts                         Payable), you can make it visible only within this module. For details, see                              Visibility of Projects by Modules Visibility of Projects by Modules. Access to Forms Based on Roles By using the forms of the User Security module, you can configure access rights to the forms of the Projects module for each employee in accordance with the employee's typical responsibilities. For more information about user roles, see  Role-Based Access. For example, you can create the following roles for employees of your organization who work with projects:  Project Manager:  A role for an employee who coordinates the project and is responsible for achieving the project goals. In the system, this person sets up pricing in projects, creates tasks, and configures projects and project templates. This role should have access to forms on the  Configuration  tab in the Projects module. Also, this role may have access to the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) Approvals (EP503010) form so that the users with this role can approve projects. Project Controller : A role for an employee who controls project transactions, performs allocations, and runs project billing. This role should have full access to forms on the  Processes  tab of the Projects module. Project Accountant : A role for an employee who plans and executes the project budget and enters project transactions. This role should have access to forms on the  Work Area  tab of the Projects module. Project Team Member:  A role for an employee who works for a project and enters time sheets and time cards. This role should have access to the forms on the  Work Area  tab of the Projects module and to the forms on the  Work Area  tab of the Time and Expenses module. Visibility of Projects by Users By using the forms of the Row-Level Security module, you can configure the system to hide or display particular projects for employees, in addition to implementing task-based roles. Employees who have access to the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form will be able to view or edit all the projects available in your organization. You may need to use restriction groups to restrict the visibility of specific projects to only employees of the project team. For details on restriction groups, see  Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP. For example, suppose that you need to restrict the visibility of projects to employees in your organization considering the following:  There are two projects in your organization:  Project Y  and  Project Z . User PM is a project manager who controls all projects in your organization. User AC is an accountant who plans budgets and performs transactions for all projects in your organization. Users E1 and E2 are engineers who work on  Project Y . Users E3 and E4 are engineers who work on  Project Z . To configure the visibility of projects according to the listed statements, you would do the following on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM102000|PM102000]) Project Access (PM102000) form: You create two restriction groups of type  A  (with direct restriction): Group 1 for  Project Y  and Group 2 for  Project Z . In Group 1, you include  Project Y , User PM, User AC, Users E1 and E2. In Group 2, you include  Project Z , User PM, User AC, Users E3 and E4. With the settings you have made, the visibility of projects would be the following: Users PM and AC can see both  Project Y  and  Project Z . Users E1 and E2 can see only  Project Y . Users E3 and E4 can see only  Project Z . Visibility of Projects by Modules After you have created a project in  Acumatica ERP, the project is available system-wide by default. You can control the visibility of projects within modules in the following ways: Display or hide the  Project  boxes and columns on forms: If you use projects in a particular module (for example, Accounts Receivable), you can configure the system to display the boxes and columns where a user can select a project on forms only within this module. In the  Visibility Settings  section of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form, you can select all such modules. Display or hide a project: If the project transactions should be performed within a particular module (for example, Inventory), you can make the project visible only in this module so that users can select only appropriate projects when they are preparing documents. You can select modules in the  Visibility Settings  section of the  General Info  tab on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. After you have selected a module, users can select the project in documents generated on the module forms, and the release of these documents automatically updates the project data. Display or hide tasks of a project: If employees need to process documents related to a project in multiple modules, but the users perform particular tasks of a project in a certain module (for example, the  Warehouse operations  task is performed in the Inventory module and the  Customer payments  task is performed in the Accounts Receivable module), you can select the modules where the task will be displayed. You select these modules in the  Visibility Settings  section of the  General Info  tab on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) Project Tasks (PM302000) form. Forms for Project Security In the following table, you can find the list of the forms that you can use to manage restriction groups with projects. The table also includes the tasks that you can solve by using each form.

Before you start configuring restriction groups, you need to gather the information that will help you to plan your restriction groups, as described in this topic.
==Preparation for the Configuration of Restriction Groups==
Before you create and configure restriction groups, you need to do the following for each visibility-related task you want to resolve:[anchor|#_a578f7b8-6291-4355-96b9-3c3e5c93bb5f]
#Determine whether or not users will be included in your restriction group. The restriction group consists of users and entities if you need to limit the visibility of entities (for example, customers) for users. The restriction group consists of only entities (and no users) if you need to restrict the visibility of entities (for example, subaccounts) when they are used with particular entities of a different type (for example, GL accounts). For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Overview_of_Restriction_Groups|Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP].
#Select the restriction group type:
#*For a group with users:
#**If a smaller number of users ''should'' see the entities, you select a group with direct restriction. When you configure a restriction group, you will add the entities and the users who should see the entities to the group.
#**If a smaller number of users ''should not'' see the entities, you select a group with inverse restriction. You will add the entities and the users who shouldn’t see the entities to the group.
#*For a group without users:
#**If the number of entities of Type 1 (such as subaccounts) that ''should'' be visible when the entity of Type 2 (such as an account) is selected is smaller than the number of entities of Type 1 that shouldn&rsquo;t be visible, you select a group with direct restriction. When you configure a restriction group, the group will include entities of Type 1 that should be visible and the entity of Type 2.
#**If the number of entities of Type 1 that ''shouldn’t'' be visible when the entity of Type 2 is selected is smaller than the number of entities of Type 1 that should be visible, you select a group with inverse restriction. The group will include entities of Type 1 that shouldn’t be visible and the entity of Type 2.
#Estimate the number of restriction groups you need to resolve this task: You determine how many groups you need to create by using the following guidelines:
#*If a particular user or a set of users should (or shouldn&rsquo;t) see entities of different types (such as customers or GL accounts), you need to create a separate restriction group for each entity type.
#*If multiple sets of users should (or shouldn&rsquo;t) see different values of entities of the same type (such as warehouses), you need to create a separate group for each entity value or set of entity values.
#*You can include particular combinations of entities in one group with users. For supported combinations of entities, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Configuration_Restriction_Groups|Configuration of Restriction Groups].
#*If you need to control the accounts and subaccounts that can be used together, you must create at least two groups and include all subaccounts in either of the groups.

For examples of using restriction groups, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Types_of_Restriction_Groups|Types of Restriction Groups].{br}

After you plan the restriction groups, you can create and configure them. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Configuration_Restriction_Groups|Configuration of Restriction Groups].

After you have prepared all necessary information about restriction groups, you can start configuring them, as described in this topic.{br}{TOC}
==Overview of the Configuration Process==
The configuration process of row-level security in Acumatica ERP includes the following steps:[anchor|#_46fb1241-2856-4fee-b4b6-e4a27740bdae]
#You create the restriction group of a required type by using the appropriate form (which depends on the entities that you want to add to a restriction group). For the list of entities, see [[#_e812c21c-b02e-4356-be92-f77825911a31|Scenarios of Using Restriction Groups].
#If the group should include users, you add entities and users to the group.
#If the group should not include users, you add related entities to the group.
#Optional: You specify default restriction groups for entity classes as needed to simplify adding new entities of these classes to the restriction groups. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Operations_Restriction_Groups#_769aca82-01cf-49ce-8b23-342ac7eaef5b|Setting Up Default Restriction Groups for Vendor and Customer Classes] in [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Operations_Restriction_Groups|Operations with Restriction Groups].

At any time, you can include entities in previously created restriction groups (for example, when you need to make an entity visible to a new user). For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Operations_Restriction_Groups#_5352f349-5e81-434f-9121-0ee8532d0797|Adding Entities to an Existing Restriction Group] in [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Operations_Restriction_Groups|Operations with Restriction Groups].[anchor|#_e812c21c-b02e-4356-be92-f77825911a31]
==Combinations of Restriction-Group Entities==
 Acumatica ERP supports a variety of scenarios of configuring the visibility of entities within the system. With the most common scenarios, you can create restriction groups that include the following system entities:
*Users and General Ledger (GL) accounts: With these restriction groups, if your organization has sensitive GL accounts, you can make these accounts visible to a limited number of employees. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Account_and_Subaccount_Security|Account and Subaccount Security].
*Users and subaccounts: As with groups that include users and GL accounts, you can limit the visibility of sensitive subaccounts to employees. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Account_and_Subaccount_Security|Account and Subaccount Security].
*:((({S:Warn}For performance reasons, visibility restrictions by user for subaccounts do not affect analytical (ARM) and form-based reports or general inquiries. This means that users who can view the reports and general inquiries that include subaccounts will see the full list of subaccounts.
)))
*Users and vendor accounts: You can define these restriction groups to make particular vendors visible in the system to only employees who work with these vendors. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Vendor_Security|Vendor Security].
*Users and customer accounts: With these restriction groups, you can make particular customers visible to only employees who work with these customers. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Customer_Security|Customer Security].
*Users and GL budget articles: With these restriction groups, you can limit the visibility of sensitive budget articles so that only particular users can see and work with these articles. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_GL_Budget_Security|Security of GL Budget Articles].
*Users and warehouses: You can create restriction groups to display a particular warehouse (or set of warehouses) for only employees who work with this warehouse (or this set of warehouses). For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Warehouse_Security|Warehouse Security].
*Users and inventory items: You can define these restriction groups to reduce the number of items in the lists with inventory items, depending on the particular employee signed in to the system. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Restriction_Groups_for_Subitems|Inventory Item Security].
*Users and projects: You can define these restriction groups to configure the visibility of particular projects only to a responsible project team. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Project_Security|Project Security].
*Users and printers: If the ''DeviceHub'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]), you can define these restriction groups to configure the visibility of printers to particular users. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__how_Configure_Printer_Access|To Configure Printer Access].
*Branches, GL accounts, and users: With these restriction groups, you can allow users to work with only branch-specific accounts. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Account_and_Subaccount_Security|Account and Subaccount Security].
*Branches, subaccounts, and users: You can set up these restriction groups so that the system displays to users only the branch-specific subaccounts. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Account_and_Subaccount_Security|Account and Subaccount Security].
*Branches and cash accounts: If there are multiple branches in your organization, with these restriction groups, you can allow users in each branch to work with only branch-specific cash accounts. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Security_of_Cash_Accounts|Security of Cash Accounts].
*GL Accounts and Subaccounts: If you have subaccounts that employees must use only with particular GL accounts, by defining these restriction groups, you can set up lists of available subaccounts for each GL account. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Account_and_Subaccount_Security|Account and Subaccount Security].

At any time, you can include entities in previously created restriction groups (for         example, when you need to make an entity visible to a new user). For details, see  Adding Entities to an Existing Restriction Group in  Operations with Restriction Groups. Combinations of Restriction-Group Entities  Acumatica ERP supports a variety of scenarios of configuring the visibility of entities within                 the system. With the most common scenarios, you can create restriction groups that                 include the following system entities: Users and General Ledger (GL) accounts: With these restriction groups, if your                     organization has sensitive GL accounts, you can make these accounts visible to a                     limited number of employees. For details, see  Account and Subaccount Security. Users and subaccounts: As with groups that include users and GL accounts, you                     can limit the visibility of sensitive subaccounts to employees. For more                     information, see  Account and Subaccount Security. For performance reasons, visibility restrictions by             user for subaccounts do not affect analytical (ARM) and form-based reports or general             inquiries. This means that users who can view the reports and general inquiries that             include subaccounts will see the full list of subaccounts. Users and vendor accounts: You can define these restriction groups to make                     particular vendors visible in the system to only employees who work with these                     vendors. For details, see  Vendor Security. Users and customer accounts: With these restriction groups, you can make                     particular customers visible to only employees who work with these customers.                     For details, see  Customer Security. Users and GL budget articles: With these restriction groups, you can limit the                     visibility of sensitive budget articles so that only particular users can see                     and work with these articles. For more information, see  Security of GL Budget Articles. Users and warehouses: You can create restriction groups to display a particular                     warehouse (or set of warehouses) for only employees who work with this warehouse                     (or this set of warehouses). For details, see  Warehouse Security. Users and inventory items: You can define these restriction groups to reduce the                     number of items in the lists with inventory items, depending on the particular                     employee signed in to the system. For more information, see  Inventory Item Security. Users and projects: You can define these restriction groups to configure the                     visibility of particular projects only to a responsible project team. For more                     information, see  Project Security. Users and printers: If the  DeviceHub  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features form (CS100000), you can define                     these restriction groups to configure the visibility of printers to particular                     users. For more information, see  To Configure Printer Access. Branches, GL accounts, and users: With these restriction groups, you can allow                     users to work with only branch-specific accounts. For details, see  Account and Subaccount Security. Branches, subaccounts, and users: You can set up these restriction groups so                     that the system displays to users only the branch-specific subaccounts. For more                     information, see  Account and Subaccount Security. Branches and cash accounts: If there are multiple branches in your organization,                     with these restriction groups, you can allow users in each branch to work with                     only branch-specific cash accounts. For details, see  Security of Cash Accounts. GL Accounts and Subaccounts: If you have subaccounts that employees must use                     only with particular GL accounts, by defining these restriction groups, you can                     set up lists of available subaccounts for each GL account. For more information,                     see  Account and Subaccount Security. ]]></column>

 Acumatica ERP provides you with the capability to specify the structure of identifiers of different objects in the system, such as general ledger accounts and subaccounts, customer and vendor accounts, warehouses, locations, and item classes. These structured identifiers usually consist of multiple parts separated by a predefined character (such as a hyphen or slash). In the system, these parts are called ''segments'', and the structure definition of the object identifier is called a ''segmented key''. You can use segmented keys to help users remember long identifiers and enter the identifiers on data entry forms, because smaller parts are easier to remember and enter than long sequences of letters and digits are.{br}

For example, general ledger subaccounts can have the following structure for a six-character identifier: a two-character regional branch code, a one-digit department number, and a three-character product type. Thus, the subaccount identifier ''CA-1-T32'' denotes a subaccount of the California branch (''CA''), department ''1'', related to the product ''T32''.{br}

 Acumatica ERP also provides the automatic numbering option for segmented keys. You can configure the numbering sequence to be used in a specific segmented key. An auto-numbered numbering sequence can be applied to only one segment of the multi-segmented key. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Multiple_Numbering_Sequences|Numbering Sequence Usage].{br}

 Acumatica ERP provides you a number of preconfigured segmented keys. You can use preconfigured segmented keys, either as they have been designed or with changes to the settings to better meet your needs. You can also configure your own segmented keys.{br}{TOC}

 Acumatica ERP provides a number of preconfigured segmented keys. Also you can configure your own segmented keys and the settings of the keys. In this topic, you will read about the preconfigured segmented keys, the steps you perform to configure segmented keys, and the settings of the keys.{br}{TOC}
==Configuration and Maintenance of Segmented Keys==
The process of configuring a segmented key consists of the following general steps:[anchor|#_0b9ce9db-25a5-4331-87a1-07e4a4134303]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form, you select the predefined key that you want to configure, or you add a new key. Then you specify the settings of the key, such as the module where the segmented key will be used, the identifier of the numbering sequence that will be applied to the segment that is auto-numbered, and the lookup mode. (For details on the lookup mode, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Lookup_Modes|Lookup Modes for Segmented Keys ].)
#In the table on the same form, you specify the settings of each segment of the segmented key, such as the length, mask, and separator. You can define one segment per key as auto-numbered, which means that the system will automatically increase the value of this segment by the numbering step specified for the numbering sequence. You can add any number of segments (but you must specify at least one) as long as the total length of all segments does not exceed the maximum length specified for the segmented key. The maximum length does not include the segment separators.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_30_00|Segment Values] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203000|CS203000]) form, you add the values of each segment that will not be auto-numbered. When you add new values for a segment on this form, the system automatically converts case of each value (if the '''Case Conversion''' check box has been selected for the segment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form) and checks whether the value meets the input mask requirements (which are specified in the '''Edit Mask''' column for the segment). Users will use these segment values to create the object identifiers described by the segmented key and to enter the identifiers on data entry forms.
#On the form that you use to manage the objects whose identifiers are described by the segmented key (such as [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_20_30_00|Subaccounts] ([~/?ScreenId=GL203000|GL203000]), which is used to manage subaccounts), you add the objects and their identifiers. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Business_Accounts_Identifiers|Business Account Identifiers].
[anchor|#_d4f43fb4-2390-4d6f-b250-9579986772a3]
==Changes to the Structure of Segmented Keys==
You can change the structure of the segmented key after the identifiers were created as follows:[anchor|#_66630010-1281-4d8d-9f51-657bea60c6ff]
*Add a segment to the segmented key. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__how_Add_Segment_to_Segmented_Key|To Add a Segment to an Existing Segmented Key].
*Remove a segment from the segmented key. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__how_Remove_Segment_from_Segmented_key|To Remove a Segment from an Existing Segmented Key].
*Split a one-segment identifier into multiple segments. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__how_Split_Segment_to_Multiple_Segments|To Split a One-Segment Identifier into Multiple Segments].
*Change the length of a segment. For more information, see [[#_87152ff2-a86a-43e6-a549-aee450adacbf|Change of Segment Length].

If you need to make other changes to the segmented keys, contact your Acumatica support provider.[anchor|#_87152ff2-a86a-43e6-a549-aee450adacbf]
==Change of Segment Length==
Due to changes in business processes of your organization, you may need to change a segment length. When you change the length of an existing segment, the system checks the following:[anchor|#_6f40ed81-9728-4ce6-93e0-5e17efc033cd]
#Whether any values of this segment have been defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_30_00|Segment Values] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203000|CS203000]) form. The system acts based on this check as follows:
#*Segment values have been defined: The system does not change the segment length; it instead displays an error message.
#*No values have been defined: The system performs the next check.
#Whether any identifiers with the segment have been defined in the system. (If they have, you can see these values on the form that is used to manage the object identifiers, such as the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_20_30_00|Subaccounts] ([~/?ScreenId=GL203000|GL203000]) form.) The system acts based on this check as follows: 
#*No identifiers defined: The system changes the segment length.
#*Identifiers defined: The system estimates the length of each segment and acts based on this estimation as follows:
#**If the length of any found value exceeds the new length of the segment, the system does not change the segment length; it instead displays an error message. In this case, you need to specify a longer segment length or delete identifiers that contain longer values of the segment.
#**If the length of all found values is equal to or shorter than the new length, the system changes the segment length. For found segment values whose length is shorter than the new segment length, the system adds spaces to the end of each value to make its length equal to the new segment length.

For example, suppose that there are three segments in the ''INSUBITEM'' segmented key: ''Color'', ''Size'', and ''Material''. You want to reduce the length of the ''Size'' segment from 4 to 3. Suppose that no values are defined for the segment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_30_00|Segment Values] form. The system acts as follows based on its check for values of segmented keys with the segment:[anchor|#_953b5c45-ed07-407e-9e11-513365a01b59]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_50_00|Subitems] ([~/?ScreenId=IN205000|IN205000]) form, suppose that only the ''BLK-6-Leather'' identifier is defined. The system will change the length of the ''Size'' segment and will add spaces to the end of the segment in the found segmented key: ''BLK-6&#95;&#95;-Leather''.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_50_00|Subitems] form, suppose that the ''WHT-XXXL-Cotton'' identifier is defined. The system will not change the length of the ''Size'' segment because the length of the ''XXXL'' value is 4 (which is greater than 3).

For 					details, see  Business Account Identifiers. Changes to the Structure of Segmented Keys You can change the structure of the segmented key after the identifiers were created 				as follows: Add a segment to the segmented key. For details, see  To Add a Segment to an Existing Segmented Key. Remove a segment from the segmented key. For more information, see  To Remove a Segment from an Existing Segmented Key.

==Lookup Modes for Segmented Keys==
In the '''Lookup Mode''' box of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form, you can select one of the following modes:[anchor|#_53dfc226-3645-498c-b4c3-05f826835041]
*''By Segment: All Avail. Segment Values'': In this mode, a user enters an identifier segment by segment. While typing a segment value, the user can press F3 to open the list of the segment values (as specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_30_00|Segment Values] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203000|CS203000]) form) and select a value from this list.
*:If you select this mode, the '''Allow Adding New Values On the Fly''' check box becomes selected and unavailable for the segmented key. If the '''Validate''' check box is cleared for the segment whose value a user is typing while entering an identifier, the user can enter a new segment value. The system automatically saves this value to the list of segment values and creates a new segmented key value. If the '''Validate''' check box is selected for the segment whose value the user is typing, the user cannot enter a new segment value.
*''By Segment: Child Segment Values'': In this mode, a user enters an identifier segment by segment. While typing a segment value, the user can press F3 to open the list of the segment values that have been specified on the object management form (such as the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form). This list is filtered by the value of the previous segment or segments. When the user is typing segment values, the system lists existing object identifiers. This mode is displayed for only the segmented keys that support the hierarchical structure of segments: ''INITEMCLASS''. For details on hierarchy in item class identifiers, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Item_Classes_GeneralInfo|Item Classes for Stock Items: General Information].
*:With this mode selected, the '''Allow Adding New Values On the Fly''' check box is cleared by default but is available for editing.
*:We recommend that you clear the '''Validate''' check box for all segments of a key that supports the hierarchical structure of segments, because this check box controls the validation of segment values based on the values added to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_30_00|Segment Values] form.
*''By Segmented Key'': In this mode, a user enters the entire identifier. When the user is typing the identifier on the data entry form, the system displays the list of existing identifiers. The user can select one of the existing values from the list. 
*:When you select this mode, the '''Allow Adding New Values On the Fly''' check box is cleared and unavailable for the segmented key. That is, a user cannot enter a new value of either the segments or the identifier on the fly.
*:If you select the '''Validate''' check box for one segment or multiple segments of the segmented key, the system makes sure the segment values are among those that are specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_30_00|Segment Values] form after a user saves the changes made on the data entry form.

==Guidelines for Selecting a Lookup Mode==
For the majority of predefined segmented keys, you cannot change the default ''By Segmented Key'' mode because usually identifiers that these segmented keys describe are one-segmented.{br}

The most common objects with multi-segmented identifiers are General Ledger subaccounts and inventory subitems. For the segmented keys that describe these identifiers, you can select a lookup mode that best meets you business requirements. For the ''INSUBITEM'' and ''SUBACCOUNT'' segmented keys, consider the following guidelines as you select the lookup mode:[anchor|#_9b8be426-a342-451b-9b20-809286f5feba]
*If the segmented key has only one segment, you can select the ''By Segmented Key'' mode. In this case, entering identifiers segment-by-segment is the same thing as entering identifiers as a whole.
*You can select the ''By Segmented Key'' mode if all of the following conditions are met: The segmented key includes multiple segments, the number of identifiers based on the segmented key is between two and ten, and users are not allowed to enter new identifiers on the fly on data entry forms. In this case, users can select the entire identifier more quickly than they could select the values of each segment.
*If the segmented key includes multiple segments and users are allowed to enter new values on the fly, you can select the ''By Segment: All Avail. Segment Values'' mode and clear the '''Validate''' check box for all segments. Entering new identifiers on the fly is useful when the number of segments and the number of values in each segment could produce so many combinations that it would be labor-intensive to enter all identifiers in advance.
*You can select the ''By Segment: All Avail. Segment Values'' mode and select the '''Validate''' check box for each segment if all of the following conditions are met: The segmented key includes multiple segments, the number of identifiers based on the segmented key is more than ten, and users are not allowed to enter new identifiers on the fly. In this case, the system will display an error message if a user enters a segment value not from the list and saves his or her changes.

For segmented keys that support a hierarchical structure (''INITEMCLASS''), you can select the ''By Segment: Child Segment Values'' mode.

 Acumatica ERP uses numbering sequences to automatically generate identifiers (IDs) for new objects of a certain type when they are created, whether manually by users or automatically by the system. Numbering sequences are used, for example, for customer invoices, vendor bills, inventory receipts and issues, Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable payments, batches, schedules, and allocations. {br}

You can use the predefined numbering sequences without changes, or you can modify them to suit your organization&rsquo;s needs. Also, you can create new sequences. If your organization has branches, numbering sequences for documents associated with branches can be split into subsequences that have different prefixes or specify different ranges of numbers. {br}{TOC}
==Numbering Sequence Parameters==
Each numbering sequence is defined by parameters set on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_10_10|Numbering Sequences] ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) form. The system uses the following parameters to calculate the numbers it assigns to new objects: 
*'''Start Number''': The number to be used first in this numbering sequence.
*'''Last Number''': The number most recently assigned to an object in this numbering sequence. Each time the system assigns a number to a new object, it updates this value.
*'''Numbering Step''': The increment used in the numbering sequence to generate the next number; for each new number, this increment is added to the rightmost numerical portion of the last number used.
*'''End Number''': The number to be used last in this numbering sequence.

You can set other parameters on the form, too, such as the following: 
*'''Start Date''': The date when this sequence will take effect. For sequences that include subsequences, you can specify the date when each subsequence first becomes effective.
*'''New Number Symbol''': An alphanumeric string (of up to 15 characters) used to indicate that a new number for an object will be assigned.
*'''Warning Number''': The minimum number that generates a warning that available numbers will be used up soon. When this number (and each number that exceeds it) is assigned, the system displays a warning. If the end number is near or has been reached for a numbering sequence, you should create a new sequence in the appropriate module and assign it to this object type.

==Format of Identifiers==
 Acumatica ERP generates numbers or object IDs for a numbering sequence as alphanumeric strings. The precise format of the numbers is defined by the numbering sequence parameters, such as the start number and the end number, set on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_10_10|Numbering Sequences] form. The same number of characters must be used for all parameters in a numbering sequence; the system issues a warning if the format of any parameter differs. {br}

A numbering sequence may have numbers that start with a ''prefix'', an alphanumeric string that ends in an alphabetic character. The system automatically detects a prefix in the start number when alphabetic characters are used. If a prefix is used, auto-numbering is applied to only the rightmost numeric positions. The same prefix must be used for the start, warning, and end numbers. {br}

Suppose, for example, that you want to create sequences to automatically assign meaningful IDs to sales orders of different types. For different order types, different two-letter abbreviations are used. For general sales orders (the ''SO'' type), you might set the start number as ''S0000001'', the warning number as ''S0995000'', and the end number as ''S0999999''. For cash sales orders, you might set the start number, warning number, and end number as ''CS000001'', ''CS997000'', and ''CS999999'', respectively. Note that all these numbers use the same prefix followed by six digits. 
==Subsequences==
A numbering sequence may consist of any number of sequences or subsequences, each intended for a different branch or starting on a specific date. Subsequences can be helpful when, for example, an organization uses different invoice numbers in each season of the year. If the organization has branches, it is convenient when document reference numbers indicate a specific branch of origin by a branch-specific prefix or range of numbers. {br}

Each subsequence is defined by a branch, start date, start number, end number, numbering step, and start date. Numbers are assigned as follows: 
#The first new object is assigned the start number depending on the branch and the start date. (The start number is also assigned to the last used number.)
#The rightmost numerical portion of the second number and subsequent numbers for the same branch is equal to that of the last number plus the numbering step. The last number value is updated.
#When the start date specified for any subsequence occurs, the system switches to using that subsequence.
((({S:Hint}The numbers available in one subsequence cannot be used in another subsequence of the same sequence. 
)))
==Usage Tips==
Follow these tips when you define numbering sequences: 
*Objects get numbers in the order in which they are created. Thus, if you use the same numbering sequence to identify objects of different types, successive numbers can be assigned to objects of different types. The disadvantage of this approach is that objects&rsquo; identifiers won&rsquo;t help you distinguish between their types.
*If you use similar numbering sequences for different document or objects that might be listed on the same form, duplicate numbers may occur, which could confuse users. It is better to define a numbering sequence so that the start number of one sequence exceeds the end number of the previous one, or to use different prefixes for each numbering sequence. These approaches ensure that duplicate numbers will not occur.

In Acumatica ERP, business accounts are used to store information related to customers, vendors, and employees, as well as similar information about your organization&rsquo;s companies and branches (this information is used on outgoing documents). Acumatica ERP gives you flexibility in configuring identifiers for these business accounts, as described in this article. If needed, you can use similar but distinct identifiers for customers, vendors, and employees. {br}

The same business can be both your customer and your vendor, with a separate identifier for each capacity. Also, customers and vendors can be organized into a hierarchy that reflects their actual business relationships. {br}{TOC}[anchor|#_d6c04c46-eb0b-4da8-bba6-f9723297a7f5]
==Creation of Objects with Identifiers Based on Segmented Keys==
After you have configured the segmented key and populated its segments, you can create objects with identifiers based on this key on forms that are designed for managing the objects. For example, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_20_30_00|Subaccounts] ([~/?ScreenId=GL203000|GL203000]) form to create subaccounts. If the '''Allow Adding New Values On the Fly''' check box is selected for the segmented key, users can create the objects when they are filling in data entry forms.{br}

When you create an object identifier defined by a segmented key with multiple segments, you see the input mask (for example, ''––/–/–––'', where the slash is a segment separator) that shows the number of segments and the length of each segment.{br}

You can configure the system to make sure that users create correct identifiers by selecting the '''Validate''' check box for each segment of the key on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form. With this check box selected, users can enter the identifier that consists of only existing segment values that have been created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_30_00|Segment Values] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203000|CS203000]) form.{br}

If you clear the '''Validate''' check box for a segment, users can create an identifier that contains new segment values. In this case, the system validates the new segment values only in accordance with the segment definition: the type of the string and its length. The system does not copy the new segment values that users enter on the fly to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_30_00|Segment Values] form. If needed, you can add these values manually to the list of segment values.((({S:Warn}For objects with identifiers that support hierarchical structure (such as inventory item classes), the system does not perform validation of segments controlled by the '''Validate''' check box because you enter segment values for these objects on a form used for managing the objects (such as the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form).
)))
==Defining Identifiers for Business Accounts==
You can decide upon and configure the rules for creating business account identifiers during system deployment. The ''BIZACCT'' segmented key, which you define by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form, is used for configuring the general structure of identifiers for business accounts, including accounts for your companies and branches. This structure includes the overall identifier length, the number of segments, and the type of segments. {br}

Before you configure the key, consider the information you would like to include in company, branch, vendor, customer, and employee IDs. Make such decisions as how many segments the identifiers will have, whether auto-numbering should be used for one of the segments, and whether values for each segment should be validated. (These options are described in more detail in [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Identifier_Segmentation|Segmented Identifiers].) You also need to decide whether to use the ''BIZACCT'' segmented key directly for companies, branches, vendors, customers, and employees or to configure separate keys based on ''BIZACCT'', as the following sections describe. {br}

Once you have defined all needed segmented keys, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_30_00|Segment Values] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203000|CS203000]) form to enter the valid values for segments that should be validated. 
==Using BIZACCT Directly for Companies, Branches, Vendors, Customers, and Employees==
Once you have configured the ''BIZACCT'' segmented key, it can be used by default for company, branch, vendor, customer, and employee identifiers. However, in this case, if you turn on auto-numbering for ''BIZACCT'', entities of different types (such as companies, vendors, or employees) will not be easy to distinguish by their identifiers.
==Configuring Separate Identifiers for Companies, Branches, Vendors, Customers, and Employees==
If you want these types of identifiers to look different at a glance, use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] form to configure the ''COMPANY'', ''BRANCH'', ''VENDOR'', ''CUSTOMER'', and ''EMPLOYEE'' segmented keys, all of which inherit their structure (number of segments, segment types, and overall length) from the ''BIZACCT'' key. If ''BIZACCT'' has an auto-numbered segment, consider using different prefixes for numbering sequences for each type of identifier. ((({S:Hint}
For the ''COMPANY'', ''BRANCH'', ''CUSTOMER'', ''VENDOR'', and ''EMPLOYEE '' segmented keys, you can configure only limited differences, such as different sets of values for validated segments, or different prefixes for the auto-numbering sequences if one of the segments in the ''BIZACCT '' key was configured as an auto-numbered segment.
)))
==Using Parent Accounts==
In Acumatica ERP, your company&rsquo;s customers and vendors can be organized into hierarchies with ''parent'' and ''child'' companies to reflect the relations among the companies while allowing you to preserve each as a separate entity in the system, if needed. Any of your vendors or customers can be a parent of another vendor or customer. When you create a vendor or customer business account, you can select the ID of its parent in the '''Parent Account''' list on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form. On either form, this list includes all vendor and customer identifiers based on the ''BIZACCT '' segmented key, so that you can pick the appropriate vendor or customer as a parent. {br}

On some forms, users can select objects of different types from the same lookup list. For example, when preparing time cards, employees can select in the same box either a project or a contract on which they spent their work hours. To make this possible, identifiers of these objects should have similar structures. The structure that should be common for multiple segmented keys, is defined in the ''parent'' segmented key. Segmented keys for object identifiers that should have similar structure are called ''child'' keys and inherit their structure from the ''parent'' key. That is, the child key has the same number of segments as the parent key, and all its segments have the same lengths as the respective segments of the parent key.{br}

By default, the child key has the same structure as the parent key, and the segment values specified for the parent key are available for identifiers based on the child key. However, you can make identifiers based on a child key distinguishable at a glance from identifiers based on the parent key in the following ways:[anchor|#ul_ubk_pkn_xh]
*For an alphanumeric segment, you can enter different sets of values for the parent and child key segments.
*For an auto-numbered segment, you can assign numbering sequences with different properties—for example, with different prefixes.

In the example of time cards mentioned in the beginning of the section, the ''CONTRACT'' segmented key inherits its structure from the ''PROJECT'' segmented key. For overview of other keys with inheritance relations, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Business_Accounts_Identifiers|Business Account Identifiers].

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Business Account Identifiers In  Acumatica ERP, business accounts are used to store information related to customers, vendors, 				and employees, as well as similar information about your organization's companies 				and branches (this information is used on outgoing documents).  Acumatica ERP gives you flexibility in configuring identifiers for these business accounts, as 				described in this article. If needed, you can use similar but distinct identifiers 				for customers, vendors, and employees.  The same business can be both your customer and your vendor, with a separate 				identifier for each capacity. Also, customers and vendors can be organized into a 				hierarchy that reflects their actual business relationships.  Creation of Objects with Identifiers Based on Segmented Keys After you have configured the segmented key and populated its segments, you can 				create objects with identifiers based on this key on forms that are designed for 				managing the objects. For example, you use the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL203000|GL203000]) Subaccounts (GL203000) form to create subaccounts. If the  Allow 					Adding New Values On the Fly  check box is selected for the segmented 				key, users can create the objects when they are filling in data entry forms. When you create an object identifier defined by a segmented key with multiple 				segments, you see the input mask (for example,  ––/–/––– , where the slash is a 				segment separator) that shows the number of segments and the length of each 				segment. You can configure the system to make sure that users create correct identifiers by 				selecting the  Validate  check box for each segment of the key 				on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) Segmented Keys (CS202000) form. With this check box 				selected, users can enter the identifier that consists of only existing segment 				values that have been created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203000|CS203000]) Segment Values 				(CS203000) form. If you clear the  Validate  check box for a segment, users can 				create an identifier that contains new segment values. In this case, the system 				validates the new segment values only in accordance with the segment definition: the 				type of the string and its length. The system does not copy the new segment values 				that users enter on the fly to the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203000|CS203000]) Segment Values 				form. If needed, you can add these values manually to the list of segment 				values. For objects with identifiers that support hierarchical structure (such as 				inventory item classes), the system does not perform validation of segments 				controlled by the  Validate  check box because you enter 				segment values for these objects on a form used for managing the objects (such as 				the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000) form). Defining Identifiers for Business Accounts You can decide upon and configure the rules for creating business account identifiers 				during system deployment. The  BIZACCT  segmented key, which you define by 				using the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) Segmented Keys (CS202000) form, is used for 				configuring the general structure of identifiers for business accounts, including 				accounts for your companies and branches. This structure includes the overall 				identifier length, the number of segments, and the type of segments.  Before you configure the key, consider the information you would like to include in 				company, branch, vendor, customer, and employee IDs. Make such decisions as how many 				segments the identifiers will have, whether auto-numbering should be used for one of 				the segments, and whether values for each segment should be validated. (These 				options are described in more detail in  Segmented Identifiers.) You also need to 				decide whether to use the  BIZACCT  segmented key directly for companies, 				branches, vendors, customers, and employees or to configure separate keys based on 					 BIZACCT , as the following sections describe.  Once you have defined all needed segmented keys, you use the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203000|CS203000]) Segment Values (CS203000) form to enter the valid 				values for segments that should be validated.  Using BIZACCT Directly for Companies, Branches, Vendors, Customers, and 				Employees Once you have configured the  BIZACCT  segmented key, it can be used by default 				for company, branch, vendor, customer, and employee identifiers. 				 However, 				in this case, if you turn on auto-numbering for  BIZACCT , entities of 				different types (such as companies, vendors, or employees) will not be easy to 				distinguish by their identifiers . Configuring Separate Identifiers for Companies, Branches, Vendors, Customers, and 				Employees If you want these types of identifiers to look different at a glance, use the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) Segmented Keys form to configure the  COMPANY ,  BRANCH , 					 VENDOR ,  CUSTOMER , and  EMPLOYEE  segmented keys, all of which 				inherit their structure (number of segments, segment types, and overall length) from 				the  BIZACCT  key. If  BIZACCT  has an auto-numbered segment, consider 				using different prefixes for numbering sequences for each type of identifier.  For the  COMPANY ,  BRANCH ,  CUSTOMER ,  VENDOR , and 						 EMPLOYEE   segmented keys, you can configure only limited differences, 					such as different sets of values for validated segments, or different prefixes 					for the auto-numbering sequences if one of the segments in the  BIZACCT   					key was configured as an auto-numbered segment. Using Parent Accounts In  Acumatica ERP, your company's customers and vendors can be organized into hierarchies with 					 parent  and  child  companies to reflect the relations among the 				companies while allowing you to preserve each as a separate entity in the system, if 				needed. Any of your vendors or customers can be a parent of another vendor or 				customer. When you create a vendor or customer business account, you can select the 				ID of its parent in the  Parent Account  list on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors (AP303000) or   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000) form. On either form, this 				list includes all vendor and customer identifiers based on the  BIZACCT   				segmented key, so that you can pick the appropriate vendor or customer as a parent.  On some forms, users can select objects of different types from the same lookup list. 				For example, when preparing time cards, employees can select in the same box either 				a project or a contract on which they spent their work hours. To make this possible, 				identifiers of these objects should have similar structures. The structure that 				should be common for multiple segmented keys, is defined in the  parent  				segmented key. Segmented keys for object identifiers that should have similar 				structure are called  child  keys and inherit their structure from the 					 parent  key. That is, the child key has the same number of segments as the 				parent key, and all its segments have the same lengths as the respective segments of 				the parent key. By default, the child key has the same structure as the parent key, and the segment 				values specified for the parent key are available for identifiers based on the child 				key. However, you can make identifiers based on a child key distinguishable at a 				glance from identifiers based on the parent key in the following ways: For an alphanumeric segment, you can enter different sets of values for the 					parent and child key segments. For an auto-numbered segment, you can assign numbering sequences with different 					properties—for example, with different prefixes.

If you have created a one-segment identifier (for example, for the ''SUBACCOUNT'' segmented key) and then realized that it is more convenient for users if the identifier has more segments, you can split the segment into multiple parts without losing the existing values of the identifier.{br}

In this topic, you will read about how to split a one-segment ''SUBACCOUNT'' key into two segments.
==To Split a One-Segment ''SUBACCOUNT'' Segmented Key into Two Segments==
For example, suppose that the ''SUBACCOUNT'' key has the following values: ''AAA000'', ''AAA010'', ''BBB000'', and ''BBB010''; also suppose that you need to split the values into two segments of three characters each. To resolve this task, you do the following:[anchor|#_c284ea7f-508e-486d-a28e-e7732bdd52e8]

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[To Split a One-Segment Identifier into Multiple Segments If you have created a one-segment identifier (for example, for the  SUBACCOUNT                  segmented key) and then realized that it is more convenient for users if the                 identifier has more segments, you can split the segment into multiple parts without                 losing the existing values of the identifier. In this topic, you will read about how to split a one-segment  SUBACCOUNT  key                 into two segments. To Split a One-Segment  SUBACCOUNT  Segmented Key into Two Segments For example, suppose that the  SUBACCOUNT  key has the following values:                      AAA000 ,  AAA010 ,  BBB000 , and  BBB010 ; also suppose                 that you need to split the values into two segments of three characters each. To                 resolve this task, you do the following: Add the second segment as follows: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) Segmented Keys (CS202000) form. In the  Segmented Key ID  box of the Summary area,                             select the  SUBACCOUNT  segmented key. On the table toolbar, click  Add Row  to add a new                             segment. In the  Description  column, add a description of                             the new segment. In the  Length  column, type                                  3 . Save your changes. Change the existing values of the  SUBACCOUNT  key as follows: Navigate to the Subaccounts (GL203000) form. For each subaccount value, move the last three characters of the first                             segment to the second segment. For example, change  AAA000  to                                  AAA___-000 . Save your changes. Change the length of the first segment as follows: Navigate to the Segmented Keys form. In the  Segmented Key ID  box of the Summary area,                             select the  SUBACCOUNT  segmented key. In the  Length  column of the row with the first                             segment, type  3 . Save your changes. As a result, the  SUBACCOUNT  key will have the following values:                  AAA-000 ,  AAA-010 ,  BBB-000 , and  BBB-010 . ]]></column>

 Acumatica ERP provides a range of tools to control the format of passwords, user and object names, phone numbers, email addresses, and postal codes that are entered in the system. You can use ''input masks'' to implement restrictions to allow particular types of characters in certain positions of these entities. Also, you can use regular expressions to define specific requirements for text strings entered by a user.{br}{TOC}
==Input Masks==
You create input masks by using the following symbols: [anchor|#_f9cb5363-4686-4184-b633-06fabe427b7c]
*''C'': Designates any character
*''A'': Designates any letter or digit
*''L'': Designates a letter only
*''#'': Designates a digit only
*''?'': Designates an optional letter
*''9'': Designates an optional digit

You can also use the following control symbols (which are not placeholders) to affect the characters that follow them: [anchor|#_5f1a7b3b-4baa-4b22-a646-3aae12815d4a]
*&gt;: Requires that all letters that follow &gt; are uppercase letters. If a lowercase letter is typed, the system will automatically convert it to uppercase. Subsequent &gt; symbols will toggle the uppercase functionality. For example, the mask ''&gt;LL&gt;LL&gt;LL'' will cause the uppercase to be turned off for the second ''LL'' characters, but then turned back on for the third LL characters.
*&lt;: Requires that all letters that follow &lt; are lowercase letters. If an uppercase letter is typed, the system converts it to lowercase. Subsequent &lt; characters will toggle the lowercase functionality. For example, the mask'' &lt;LL&lt;LL&lt;LL'' will cause the lowercase to be turned off for the second ''LL'' characters, but then turned back on the third ''LL'' characters.
*\: Causes the next character to be displayed literally, as it is.
*&ldquo;&ldquo;: Causes the characters within the quotation marks to be displayed literally.
{br}{TOC}
==Regular Expressions==
You can use standard syntax for regular expressions in Acumatica ERP. For more information on regular expressions, see the [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ae5bf541(v=vs.100)|Microsoft Software Developer Network].{br}{TOC}

==Examples of Masks and Regular Expressions==
The following table provides examples of masks and regular expressions you might use. 
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="20%" ! Object
!width="80%" ! Description
|- 
|  United States Phone Numbers
|  The input mask ''(###) ###-####'' forces users to enter the three-digit area code in parentheses, with the other seven digits separated by a hyphen (''-'') in two groups: one with three digits and the other with four digits. ((({S:Hint} If certain input values will always have the same characters, just type the characters within the mask.
)))
|- 
|  United States Postal Codes
|  If you want users to enter a five-digit ZIP code followed by a mandatory four-digit extension, use the mask ''#####-####''. If, however, you want to make the four-digit extension optional, use a regular expression, such as {{/^\d{5}([\-]\d)?$/;}}
|- 
|  Canadian Postal Codes
|  The mask ''&gt;L#L #L#'' ensures that the postal code will be entered as two three-character groups separated by a space: 
*The first group contains an uppercase letter and a digit, and an uppercase letter.
*The second group contains a digit, an uppercase letter, and a digit.

Only the following letters are actually allowed: ''A, B, C, E, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, R, S, T, V, X,'' and ''Y''. The following regular expression ensures that the postal code will comply with this rule too: {{/^\s*[a-ceghj-npr-tvxy]\d[a-z](\s)?\d[a-z]\d\s*$/i;}}
|- 
|  United Kingdom Postcodes
|  The format of United Kingdom postcodes may be represented by a set of masks: 
*L# #LL
*L## #LL
*L## #LL
*LL# #LL
*LL## #LL
*LL#L #LL

Some letters (''CIKMOV'') are not allowed in these codes. Because only one mask is allowed, you can create a regular expression such as the following for United Kingdom postal codes: {{[[A-Z]{1,2}[0-9R][0-9A-Z]? [0-9][A-Z-[CIKMOV]]{2};}}. (For more information about the format of postcodes in the United Kingdom, see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postcodes_in_the_United_Kingdom|Postcodes in the United Kingdom].)

==Regular Expressions Usage in Password Masks==
In some cases, you may need to set a regular expression to enforce the company&rsquo;s password policies. For example, a regular expression could define valid and invalid characters, specific formats (for example, the password must begin with a letter), or minimum and maximum password lengths. Below are some examples of regular expressions and their explanations: 
*{{^(?=.*\d).{4,8}$}}: The password must be four to eight characters long and include at least one numeric digit.
*{{^[a-zA-Z]\w{3,9}$}}: The password must be four to ten characters long, the first character must be a letter, and no character is permitted except letters, numbers, and underscores.

Input masks may be created to help users enter data in the required format. Masks are used, for example, for phone numbers and postal codes. Moreover, regular expressions can be created to validate the entered values, because the values for some elements must meet not only input format requirements but also specific rules. {br}

For more details on the format of masks, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Examples_Mask_and_RegExp_Usage|Examples of Masks and Regular Expressions Usage ]. 
==Country and State Validation==
In Acumatica ERP, countries are identified by a two-letter code in accordance with ISO 3166. In data that is imported to the system, the country field may contain a name instead of the required code. A similar situation can occur with states or provinces within countries. To help the system identify each country or state during import, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_40_00|Countries/States] ([~/?ScreenId=CS204000|CS204000]) form, you can select the appropriate validation modes for countries and for states.{br}

In the '''Validation Mode''' box in the '''Country Validation''' section of this form, you can select one of the following modes, which the system will use to validate each value in a country field during import:[anchor|#_8662f7d2-a223-4eed-9df4-bc88406ea27c]
*''By Country ID'' (default): The system validates the entered value by using the ID of the selected country. 
*:You use this mode if users enter the country on forms manually or when imported data usually contains country codes and you want to ensure that these codes are valid codes in accordance with ISO 3166.
*''By Country ID and Name'': The system validates the entered value by using the ID and name of the selected country.
*:You use this mode when data is imported to Acumatica ERP and it contains either country IDs or country names that are spelled as they are in the system.
*''By Country ID, Name, and Regexp'': The system validates the entered value by using the ID, the name of the selected company, and the regular expression (which is specified in the '''Lookup Regexp''' box of the '''Country Validation / Lookup''' section of this form).
*:You use this mode if imported data may contain a country name typed with errors or differences from the country name entered in the system. (For example, suppose that the imported data contains ''England'' but the country name is ''United Kingdom of Great Britain'' in the system.)
{br}

For each country with states or provinces, in the '''Validation Mode''' box in the '''State Validation''' section of this form, you can select one of the following modes, which the system will use to validate each value in a state field during import:[anchor|#_5ddef4f2-f073-4785-9818-690249df9a39]
*''No Validation'' (default): The system does not validate the state ID or name. You do not need to change this mode if states were not defined for the selected country on this form.
*''By State ID'': The system validates the entered value by using the list of state IDs defined for the selected country on this form.
*:You use this mode if users enter states on forms manually or when imported data usually contains state IDs that are spelled as they are in the system.
*''By State ID and Name'': The system validates the entered value by using the lists of state IDs and state names defined for the selected country on this form.
*:You use this mode when data is imported to Acumatica ERP and it contains either state IDs or names spelled as they are in the system.
*''By State ID, Name, and Regexp'': The system validates the entered value by using the state ID, state name, and regular expression (which is specified in the '''Validation Regexp''' box of the '''States/Provinces''' table of this form).
*:You use this mode if imported data may contain a state name typed with errors or differences from the state name entered in the system.
{br}

When a country data is imported to the system along with other data, the system validates the value in the country field as follows:[anchor|#_57d59b63-6a51-4657-80de-5904f56c38ba]
#Regardless of the validation mode specified for countries, checks whether the imported value is one of the country IDs defined in the system. The system processes the results of this check as follows:
#*The imported value is found in the database: The system regards the entered value as a valid country ID.
#*The imported value is not found in the database: If the ''By Country ID and Name'' or ''By Country ID, Name, and Regexp'' validation mode is specified for at least one country defined in the system, the system proceeds to Step 2. If the ''By Country ID'' validation mode is specified for all countries, the system returns an error message for the import task.
#Checks whether the imported value is one of the names of the countries with the ''By Country ID and Name'' or ''By Country ID, Name, and Regexp'' validation mode specified. The system searches all matches of the imported value with the country names. The system processes the results of this check as follows:
#*Multiple matches are found in the database: The system returns an error message for the import task.
#*Only one match is found in the database: The system regards the imported value as valid and replaces the value with the country ID that corresponds to the country name it has found.
#*No match is found in the database: If the ''By Country ID, Name, and Regexp'' validation mode is specified for at least one country in the system, the system proceeds to Step 3. If there are no countries with the ''By Country ID, Name, and Regexp'' validation mode in the system, an error message is returned for the import task.
#Checks whether the imported value matches any of the regular expressions specified for the countries with the ''By Country ID, Name, and Regexp'' validation mode specified. The system searches all matches of the entered value with regular expressions. The system processes the results of this check as follows:
#*Multiple matches are found in the database: The system returns an error message for the import task.
#*Only one match is found in the database: The system regards the imported value as valid and replaces the value with the country ID that corresponds to the country name it has found.
#*No match is found in the database: The system returns an error message for the import task.

If any of the states defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_40_00|Countries/States] form has a validation mode other than ''No Validation'' (that is, if state validation is required for any state of the country), the system performs similar checks to those described above to validate the value in the state field.
==Postal codes==
Input masks for postal codes are set on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_40_00|Countries/States] ([~/?ScreenId=CS204000|CS204000]) form. They are used for input validation on the following forms: 
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_20_00|Branches] ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) 
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) 
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000])

By Country ID and Name : The system validates the entered value by using the ID and name                 of the selected country. You use this mode when data is imported to  Acumatica ERP and it contains either country IDs or country names that are spelled as they                     are in the system. By Country ID, Name, and Regexp : The system validates the entered value by using the ID,                 the name of the selected company, and the regular expression (which is specified in                 the  Lookup Regexp  box of the  Country Validation /                     Lookup  section of this form). You use this mode if imported data                     may contain a country name typed with errors or differences from the country                     name entered in the system. (For example, suppose that the imported data                     contains  England  but the country name is  United Kingdom of Great                         Britain  in the system.) For each country with states or provinces, in the  Validation 					Mode  box in the  State Validation  section of 				this form, you can select one of the following modes, which the system will use to 				validate each value in a state field during import: No Validation  (default): The system does not validate the state ID or name. You do not                 need to change this mode if states were not defined for the selected country on this                 form. By State ID : The system validates the entered value by using the list of state IDs                 defined for the selected country on this form. You use this mode if users enter                     states on forms manually or when imported data usually contains state IDs that                     are spelled as they are in the system. By State ID and Name : The system validates the entered value by using the lists of state                 IDs and state names defined for the selected country on this form. You use this                     mode when data is imported to  Acumatica ERP and it contains either state IDs or names spelled as they are in the                     system. By State ID, Name, and Regexp : The system validates the entered value by using the state                 ID, state name, and regular expression (which is specified in the                      Validation Regexp  box of the                      States/Provinces  table of this form). You use this mode                     if imported data may contain a state name typed with errors or differences from                     the state name entered in the system. When a country data is imported to the system along with other data, the system 				validates the value in the country field as follows: Regardless of the validation mode specified for countries, checks whether the 					imported value is one of the country IDs defined in the system. The system 					processes the results of this check as follows: The imported value is found in the database: The system regards the 							entered value as a valid country ID. The imported value is not found in the database: If the  By Country ID 								and Name  or  By Country ID, Name, and Regexp  validation 							mode is specified for at least one country defined in the system, the 							system proceeds to Step 2. If the  By Country ID  validation mode 							is specified for all countries, the system returns an error message for 							the import task. Checks whether the imported value is one of the names of the countries with the 						 By Country ID and Name  or  By Country ID, Name, and Regexp  					validation mode specified. The system searches all matches of the imported value 					with the country names. The system processes the results of this check as 						follows: Multiple matches are found in the database: The system returns an error 							message for the import task. Only one match is found in the database: The system regards the imported 							value as valid and replaces the value with the country ID that 							corresponds to the country name it has found. No match is found in the database: If the  By Country ID, Name, and 								Regexp  validation mode is specified for at least one country in 							the system, the system proceeds to Step 3. If there are no countries 							with the  By Country ID, Name, and Regexp  validation mode in the 							system, an error message is returned for the import task. Checks whether the imported value matches any of the regular expressions 					specified for the countries with the  By Country ID, Name, and Regexp  					validation mode specified. The system searches all matches of the entered value 					with regular expressions. The system processes the results of this check as 						follows: Multiple matches are found in the database: The system returns an error 							message for the import task. Only one match is found in the database: The system regards the imported 							value as valid and replaces the value with the country ID that 							corresponds to the country name it has found. No match is found in the database: The system returns an error message 							for the import task. If any of the states defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS204000|CS204000]) Countries/States form has a 				validation mode other than  No Validation  (that is, if state validation is 				required for any state of the country), the system performs similar checks to those 				described above to validate the value in the state field.

 Acumatica ERP provides GDPR compliance tools that enable you to do the following:[anchor|#_1d7e7b44-0994-42f3-84a6-2ee0655d729c]
*Track in the system whether the consent of individuals for the processing of personal data has been obtained or recalled
*Restrict the processing of personal data for particular individuals
*Erase and restore personal data
*Audit who restricted the processing of personal data or erased personal data in the system, when the event occurred, and what data was restricted

==Availability of GDPR Compliance Tools==
GDPR compliance tools become available in the system if the ''GDPR Compliance Tools'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

To be able to access GDPR compliance tools, you need to have the ''Data Privacy Controller'' role. This predefined role has ''View Only'' access to all forms that contain personal data. Also, it is the only role that has access (of the ''Delete'' type, which means that the role has complete access) to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GD_10_20_10|Restrict Personal Data] ([~/?ScreenId=GD102010|GD102010]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\GD_10_20_20|Erase Personal Data] ([~/?ScreenId=GD102020|GD102020]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\GD_10_20_30|Restricted Personal Data] ([~/?ScreenId=GD102030|GD102030]), and [HelpRoot_FormReference\GD_10_10_10|Privacy Tools Audit] ([~/?ScreenId=GD101010|GD101010]) forms.
==Affected Entities==
In the out-of-the-box Acumatica ERP instance, GDPR compliance tools affect the following entities:[anchor|#_d4d6e792-440c-4b43-9ae6-dad8df058aae]
*Business accounts, including customers, vendors, and prospects
*Documents associated with business accounts, such as sales orders, invoices, and purchase orders
*Contacts
*Leads
*Employees
*Opportunities

Also, you can mark a user-defined attribute as containing personal data by selecting the '''Contains Personal Data''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_50_00|Attributes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) form; the values of this attribute will then be treated by the system as personal data.
==Consent Settings==
To record that an individual has given his or her consent for the processing of the person&rsquo;s personal data and to specify the time interval during which the system should consider the individual&rsquo;s consent to be effective, you can use the settings in the '''Personal Data Privacy''' section, which is available on the following forms: [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]), and [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]).{br}

These settings can be mass-updated for leads, contacts, and business accounts through the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_50_30_20|Update Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR503020|CR503020]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_50_30_21|Update Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR503021|CR503021]), and [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_50_33_20|Update Business Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR503320|CR503320]) forms.
==Obfuscation of Personal Data==
To restrict the processing of personal data for individuals whose consent has expired or has been revoked, you can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GD_10_20_10|Restrict Personal Data] ([~/?ScreenId=GD102010|GD102010]) form. On the form toolbar of this form, the '''Pseudonymize''' and '''Pseudonymize All''' actions are available. These actions obfuscate the personal data contained in the selected records or in all listed records, respectively, and make this data unavailable for further processing; however, this data remains stored in the database and can be restored at any time on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GD_10_20_30|Restricted Personal Data] ([~/?ScreenId=GD102030|GD102030]) form.{br}

Records with pseudonymized personal data are not shown on generic inquiry forms, and the system does not include these records in mass processes, such as the validation of records for duplicates.{br}

By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GD_10_20_20|Erase Personal Data] ([~/?ScreenId=GD102020|GD102020]) form, you can permanently obfuscate personal data. Permanently obfuscated data cannot be restored.{br}

If the ''Scheduled Processing'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, automation schedules can be set up for the restriction or deletion of personal data.
==Restoration of Personal Data==
Sometimes you may need to restore an individual&rsquo;s personal data (for instance, if the previously expired consent has been given again). You can restore obfuscated personal data by using the '''Restore''' action on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GD_10_20_30|Restricted Personal Data] ([~/?ScreenId=GD102030|GD102030]) form. The system marks an entity with restored personal data as inactive, so you may need to manually mark the needed entity as active by using the respective entry form.
==Privacy Tools Audit==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GD_10_10_10|Privacy Tools Audit] ([~/?ScreenId=GD101010|GD101010]) form, you can monitor the history of record changes, track who restricted the processing of personal data or erased personal data in the system, when this user restricted processing or erased personal data, and what data was restricted.
==Custom Fields with Personal Data==
Any custom fields will be treated by the system as fields that contain personal data if all of the following conditions are met:[anchor|#_3d29f808-ce15-41de-9ceb-18a2988554d1]
*<tt>PXPersonalDataTable</tt> is specified for the customized DAC or cache extension.
*The <tt>PXPersonalDataField</tt> attribute is appended to the corresponding fields.
*The <tt>pseudonymizationStatus</tt> class is declared, with <tt>PXPseudonymizationStatusField</tt> specified in it.

 Acumatica ERP uses digital certificates to store sensitive information in the database encrypted and to authenticate documents (PDF files) that are shared or sent electronically. These certificates can be purchased from a recognized certification authority. Each certificate has a password that is used to validate the owner of the certificate if you need to reinstall the system or move the database.{br}

This topic describes the ways of using digital certificates in Acumatica ERP in more detail.{br}{TOC}
==Configuration Steps==
When you want to use a digital certificate in Acumatica ERP, you do the following:[anchor|#_8c2ce3e6-0296-439d-b23b-880159caf5ec]
#You import your certificate on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_30|Encryption Certificates] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200530|SM200530]) form. For a detailed procedure that describes how to import certificates, see [HelpRoot_Administration\US__How_to_Import_Digital_Certificate|To Import Certificates].
#:((({S:Hint}Digital certificates used by Acumatica ERP have the {{.pfx}} extension. Before you can import digital certificates into the system, make sure {{.pfx}} is on the list of allowed extensions on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_50|File Upload Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202550|SM202550]) form.
)))
#You apply the uploaded certificate to one of the following processes:
#*Encrypting the database: You can replace the encryption algorithm used in Acumatica ERP to encrypt sensitive data by using your encryption certificate on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_35|Certificate Replacement] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200535|SM200535]) form. For more information, see [[#_ad9bf929-99d9-40f4-becb-c813a9e40bc2|Database Encryption].
#*Signing PDF documents: You can use the imported encryption certificate for signing PDF files generated in Acumatica ERP. You can specify a default certificate (which will be used for all PDF documents generated in Acumatica ERP) in the '''PDF Signing Certificate''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_60|Security Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201060|SM201060]) form. Individual users can also select an imported certificate as a personal certificate (which overrides the default one) in the '''PDF Signing Certificate''' box on the [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\SM_20_30_10|User Profile] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) form. For details, see [[#_c05808be-e98b-42ab-a1ea-f38fefab0386|PDF Signature].
[anchor|#_ad9bf929-99d9-40f4-becb-c813a9e40bc2]
==Database Encryption==
 Acumatica ERP database stores sensitive data, such as credit card numbers and passwords, encrypted. If no encryption certificate is loaded, the base64-encryption is used. You can find the list of encrypted data on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_35|Certificate Replacement] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200535|SM200535]) form. You can replace the encryption algorithm used in Acumatica ERP with your encryption certificate. If the database of your Acumatica ERP instance is large, encryption may take a lot of time and may cause slowdowns in responses from the database. For large databases, we recommend that you postpone the start of encryption by scheduling it at a time when nobody uses the system (for example, at night). For a procedure that describes how to encrypt the database, see [HelpRoot_Administration\US__How_to_Encrypt_Database|To Encrypt the Database].[anchor|#_c05808be-e98b-42ab-a1ea-f38fefab0386]
==PDF Signature==
You can use encryption certificates to sign PDF files generated in the system. A PDF certificate protects the authenticity of a document throughout its life cycle. For example, when a company employee emails the company&rsquo;s digitally signed quarterly financial statements, the recipients of the documents can be sure of the identity of the sender and the integrity of the financial information.{br}

You can specify a default certificate that will be used for signing all the PDF documents generated by the system. You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_60|Security Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201060|SM201060]) form to specify a default certificate.{br}

In addition, you (or any other user of your Acumatica ERP instance) can select another certificate to be used as a personal certificate on the [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\SM_20_30_10|User Profile] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) form. For a user with a personal certificate, the personal certificate is used instead of the default certificate for signing PDF documents when the user creates PDF documents in the system.

Individual users can also select an imported certificate as a personal 							certificate (which overrides the default one) in the  PDF 								Signing Certificate  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) User Profile (SM203010) form. For 							details, see  PDF Signature PDF Signature. Database Encryption  Acumatica ERP database stores sensitive data, such as credit card numbers and passwords, 				encrypted. If no encryption certificate is loaded, the base64-encryption is used. 				You can find the list of encrypted data on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200535|SM200535]) Certificate Replacement 				(SM200535) form. You can replace the encryption algorithm used in  Acumatica ERP with your encryption certificate. If the database of your  Acumatica ERP instance is large, encryption may take a lot of time and may cause slowdowns in 				responses from the database. For large databases, we recommend that you postpone the 				start of encryption by scheduling it at a time when nobody uses the system (for 				example, at night). For a procedure that describes how to encrypt the database, see 					 To Encrypt the Database. PDF Signature You can use encryption certificates to sign PDF files generated in the system. A PDF 				certificate protects the authenticity of a document throughout its life cycle. For 				example, when a company employee emails the company's digitally signed quarterly 				financial statements, the recipients of the documents can be sure of the identity of 				the sender and the integrity of the financial information. You can specify a default certificate that will be used for signing all the PDF 				documents generated by the system. You use the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201060|SM201060]) Security Preferences (SM201060) form to specify a default certificate. In addition, you (or any other user of your  Acumatica ERP instance) can select another certificate to be used as a personal certificate on 				the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) User Profile (SM203010) form. For a user 				with a personal certificate, the personal certificate is used instead of the default 				certificate for signing PDF documents when the user creates PDF documents in the 				system.

The development of automatic data processing has made it necessary to consider protecting sensitive information. In certain highly regulated industries, companies must implement auditing to address identity-management concerns related to compliance issues. Regulations such as Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) all have extensive requirements on auditing user identity and access to system resources.{br}

If your company must comply with such regulations, wants to ensure accountability and the ability to track user actions in the system, or wants to implement sound auditing procedures, you can use the field-level auditing available in Acumatica ERP.{br}

By using the field-level auditing functionality, you can monitor and record user actions on Acumatica ERP forms as they are recorded in the system. The audit trail holds records of every change users have made on the monitored forms, such as changes to documents and their properties, modifications to customer accounts or employee records, and changes in security policies. You can also see who made the changes and when they took place.{br}{TOC}
==Managing Access to Field-Level Audit Feature==
Before you start configuring and turning on auditing for specific forms, you must enable the ''Field-Level Audit'' feature. To give users the ability to configure, turn on, and turn off auditing of forms, as well as view the audit trails, you assign them the ''Field-Level Audit'' role and give them access to the forms used to manage field-level auditing. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Managing_Field_Level_Audit_Access|Management of Access to Field-Level Audit Functionality].
==Configuring and Turning on Auditing of a Form==
If you want to maintain a record of user activity on any form, you can configure and turn on auditing of the form. Granular auditing is configured, turned on, and turned off on a per-form basis. After the form audit is configured, you can quickly turn on and off auditing of the form. When you turn on the audit, every time a user makes changes to a document associated with the form and clicks '''Save''', a record is added to the audit trail the system maintains for the form. This record contains the details of the modification, including who modified the document, what changes were made, and when the changes occurred.{br}

For more granular control, you can perform auditing of individual database tables associated with the forms and specific database table fields. You can audit entire database tables or only certain database table fields, such as the fields associated with the interface elements on the form. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__How_to_Configure_Field_Level_Audit|To Configure and Turn On Field-Level Auditing for a Form].
==Viewing an Audit Trail==
When auditing is turned on for a form, you can select a document and view the changes made to the document directly from the form by clicking '''Audit History''' on the '''Tools''' menu. The audit trail shows who modified the document and when, what form was used, when the modification took place, and what changes were made.{br}

Also, you can view all the changes made in the database tables of the audited form. The audit trail shows the user who modified the document, the date and time of the update, and the details of the modification of the selected database table. You can filter the modifications that you view in any audited database table by user and by date range. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__How_to_view_Field_Level_Audit|To View a Field-Level Audit Trail].

 Acumatica ERP is an application with multitenant architecture, in which any instance includes at least one tenant that is a separate tenant. By running one instance of the application with one instance of a database, you can give multiple tenants web access to the same database. You can manage tenants locally or by using the web interface.{br}

All tenants of your instance can be split by status on active and test tenants. Active tenants are used in production; the number of active tenants you may use depends on your license. Test tenants are used to set up test environments that can be used for training purposes or for testing the system before performing potentially hazardous operations. You can have a virtually unlimited number of test tenants, although test tenants cannot be converted back to active tenants. For more information on licensing in Acumatica ERP, see [HelpRoot_Install\Licensing_Acumatica|Licensing and Activating Acumatica ERP].
==Managing Tenants Locally==
By using the Tenant Setup page of the Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard, you can do the following:[anchor|#ul_ncy_xks_tl]
*Add a new tenant to the selected instance. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\Managing_Companies_Add_new|To Add a New Tenant by Using Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard].

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
==Tenants==
When you install the Acumatica ERP application, you create at least one tenant. You can create more tenants with the help of the Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard, or directly from the Acumatica ERP application by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_20|Tenants] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203520|SM203520]) form. Because the functionality of creating new tenants is available within the application, you can create multiple tenants in the same application without signing out of the application. For details on creating tenants, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_MultiCompany_Add_Company|To Add a New Tenant by Using the Web Interface].((({S:Warn}We recommend that before you create the second and next tenants you open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_25|Space Usage] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203525|SM203525]) form and make sure that you have enough free space in the Acumatica ERP database.
)))
You can configure each tenant from scratch or create tenants by using templates based on snapshots. For more information on using snapshots as tenant templates, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Company_Templates|Snapshots as Tenant Templates]. Once the tenant is configured, users can initialize it by importing or entering the data. A tenant&rsquo;s configuration settings and entered data are not accessible from other tenants of the same application. 
==Active and Test Tenants==
You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_30|Tenant List] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203530|SM203530]) form to view the list of tenants and the statuses of the tenants (that is, if the tenant is active, test, or unlicensed) and the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_20|Tenants] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203520|SM203520]) form to add, delete, and manage particular tenants.{br}

''Active'' tenants are the tenants that have the ''Active'' status and are used in the production environment. Your license determines the number of active tenants you can add to the instance, the number of concurrent users allowed, and the set of features you can activate for the instance. {br}

''Test'' tenants are the tenants that have the ''Test'' status. You can create a virtually unlimited number of test tenants because the test tenants do not count toward the maximum number of allowed tenants, based on your license. At the same time, all test tenants have the following limitations:[anchor|#ul_ipd_2xg_ks]
*Only two concurrent users are allowed
*A test tenant cannot be converted back to an active tenant

You can use test tenants in a test environment for the following purposes:[anchor|#ul_yzg_wdn_nm]
*To test application features in a demo tenant. You can try any application feature in a tenant with demo data.
*To test whether specific configuration changes are applicable to the tenant configuration.
*To train your employees through a copy of a live tenant.

For details on setting up a test environment, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Test_Environment|Configuration of the Test Environment]. [anchor|#_55903026-815a-4006-ba6a-52e31388461b]
==The System Tenant==
When you install Acumatica ERP, the System tenant (with a '''Tenant ID''' set to ''1'') is always created automatically. {br}

The System tenant contains the preconfigured system data, such as roles, numbering sequences, and the wiki-based documentation. The system data is used by all tenants of the same application instance. {br}

By default, the System tenant is hidden on all end-user forms. All other user-created tenants inherit the initial configuration and system data (predefined data) from the System tenant. That is, all the data available in System tenant is visible to other tenants in the same database. An application update or upgrade replaces all data available in the System tenant, while the data created by users in user-created tenants remains unchanged. {br}

A snapshot created for a user-defined tenant includes all custom data available in the database for the tenant account and does not include any data contained in the System tenant. When a snapshot is being restored in the same database or another database, it uses the system data from the System tenant available in that database. [anchor|#_00438cad-c503-4843-b289-a4e202879e79]
==The Parent Tenant==
If you would like to replace the preconfigured roles, numbering sequences, and other data similarly for multiple new tenants, you can create a ''parent'' tenant that will serve as a system tenant for your new tenants. {br}

To configure a custom parent tenant, create a new tenant and provide a name that clearly indicates how this tenant will be used (for example, ''MyParent''). This tenant inherits all the data from the System tenant. In the MyParent tenant, override the preconfigured settings as needed and specify other configuration settings to be used in all the new tenants. Then when you create a new tenant by using the Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard, you specify MyParent as the new tenant&rsquo;s parent tenant; the new tenant will inherit all the data from the MyParent tenant, not the System tenant. You can create a virtually unlimited number of parent tenants; a parent tenant can be a child of another parent tenant. Users won&rsquo;t be able to sign in to a parent tenant.((({S:Warn}You can create new tenants based on the parent tenant only by using the Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard.
)))
If you create a snapshot of a tenant based on a custom parent that is not the System tenant, this snapshot will not contain the parent&rsquo;s data; when the snapshot is restored in another database with no custom parent tenant, the custom parent&rsquo;s data will be replaced by the original system data. To fully restore such a tenant from its snapshot in another database, perform the following steps: 
#Create the first new tenant.
#Restore the snapshot of the parent tenant in the first new tenant. This tenant will serve as the custom parent tenant.
#Create the second new tenant, and select the first tenant as the parent tenant for the second tenant.
#Restore the tenant snapshot with all the required data in this new tenant. 
[anchor|#_aef32d79-655d-4926-9ad3-0cab76a0d85a]
==Signing in to a Specific Tenant==
In a multitenant Acumatica ERP instance, the Tenant box appears on Sign-In page by default. Thus, the users can select the tenant to sign in to from the list of all available tenants.{br}

If you want to restrict the list of tenants a user can see only to the tenants the user has access to, select the '''Secure Tenant on Login Screen''' check box on the Tenant Setup page of the Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard. In this case, the '''Tenant''' box does not appear on the Sign-In page by default and all users first authenticate themselves by entering their login and password. Depending on the user, one of the following occurs:[anchor|#_5b6af4ed-9f91-48c8-a1bb-6cfb0f0d0b6c]
*A user who has access to only one tenant will be automatically signed in to this tenant after entering the login and password.
*A user who has access to multiple tenants and has the same credentials in these tenants must select a tenant in the Tenant box, which appears after the user has been authenticated and contains the list of tenants available for the user.
*A user who has access to multiple tenants and has different credentials for different tenants is signed in to the tenant whose credentials the user entered on the Sign-In page.
*A user who has access to multiple tenants and logs in to Acumatica ERP instance using single sign-on with an external identity provider, is signed in to the first tenant with enabled single sign-on.

==Data Sharing Between Tenants==
 Acumatica ERP provides shared data access in a multitenant configuration. You can set up the data sharing mode for all tenants on a per-table basis and the mode is applied to every tenant immediately. ((({S:Hint}Table configuration is a dangerous operation that can result in database corruption. Any changes you make are at your own risk. If you configure tables, be sure to first back up the database.
)))
You can select one of the available data sharing modes: ''Split'', ''Shared'', or ''Separate''.

If you need to create multiple similar tenants, you don&rsquo;t have to configure each tenant from scratch as described in the Acumatica ERP Implementation Guide. To speed up the implementation of new tenants, you can create and use tenant templates. In Acumatica ERP, you use the functionality of snapshots to create tenant templates.{br}

You create snapshots by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_20|Tenants] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203520|SM203520]) form. A ''snapshot'' may contain all custom data available in the database for the tenant account or only some of the data. For details on snapshots, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__mng_Snapshots|Managing Snapshots].{br}

When a tenant snapshot is restored in a newly created empty tenant, this new tenant will contain all the data that you included in the snapshot. You can restore a snapshot in the same database where it was created or import it to another website and restore it in another database. Any snapshot can be used multiple times. {br}

This topic outlines several possible method of using snapshots as tenant templates. {br}{TOC}
==Method I==
To create a new tenant that is very similar in configuration to an existing tenant without any customizations, follow the basic steps below: ((({S:Warn}A snapshot carries information about the version of the database where it was created, so before you restore a snapshot, make sure that the versions match.

#Sign in to the tenant you want to use as a template
#Take a snapshot of the tenant and do the following on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_20|Tenants] form:
#*In the '''Export mode''' box, select ''Settings only'' to include the tenant&rsquo;s configuration settings only and exclude actual documents.
#*Select the '''Prepare Data for Export''' check box.
#:For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Snapshots_Add|To Take a Snapshot]. 
#Export the snapshot, as described in [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Snapshots_Export|To Export a Snapshot]. 
#Sign in to the new the tenant.
#Import the prepared snapshot without customization data, as described in [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Snapshots_Import|To Import a Snapshot].
#Restore the data from the snapshot, as described in [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Snapshots_Restore|To Restore a Snapshot].

After the snapshot is restored, the new tenant has the same settings as the source tenant does.
==Method II==
If you need to create multiple related tenants with similar configurations, first configure the most typical one (which you will use as a prototype). At each stage of implementation, create a snapshot that includes the full data of the prototype tenant. If the tenants are related businesses, you can enter business accounts that are used by more than one tenant and add them to another snapshot that can be used for each tenant. {br}

When you create a snapshot, it appears on the list of available snapshots for the tenant on the '''Snapshots''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_20|Tenants] form. Snapshots of a specific tenant, by default, are visible to (and can be restored in) only this tenant. However, if needed, you can change the visibility of the snapshots to allow these snapshots to be visible to (and restored in) other tenants in the same database. 
When you create another related tenant, select the snapshot to be used as a template for the new tenant by following these guidelines: 
*Select a snapshot of a later stage of implementation if the new tenant is very similar to the prototype.
*Select a snapshot that features an earlier implementation stage if the new tenant is similar to the prototype only at some extent (to include only those configuration features that present in the new tenant).

==Method III==
Suppose you need to create multiple related tenants for which you need to replace some preconfigured settings (such as roles and numbering sequences), add custom reports and inquiries, and customize specific forms similarly. Preconfigured settings are provided by the System tenant, which is available in each installation as a hidden tenant with tenant ID ''1''. These settings are available to each tenant created in the same database. {br}

You can create a custom ''parent'' tenant that contains all the data that is shared between these tenants. To configure a custom parent tenant, perform the following general steps: 
#Create the tenant that will contain the shared data.
#Change the preconfigured settings as needed, and configure other functionality that will be used in all tenants.
#Take a snapshot of the tenant and do the following on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_20|Tenants] form:
#*In the '''Export mode''' box, select ''Full'' to include the tenant&rsquo;s configuration settings only and exclude actual documents.
#*Select the '''Prepare Data for Export''' check box.
#:For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Snapshots_Add|To Take a Snapshot]. 
#Create a new tenant in the same instance of application by using the Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard. Specify the configured tenant as the parent for the new tenant; the new tenant will inherit all the data from the parent tenant. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\Managing_Companies_Add_new|To Add a New Tenant by Using Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard] in Acumatica ERP Installation Guide.
#Repeat Step 4 to add as many new tenants as needed, all based on the custom parent tenant.

If you want to create a similar tenant in another instance of application by using the snapshot of a tenant based on the custom parent tenant, you first restore the parent tenant from its snapshot. Then you create a new empty tenant based on this custom parent tenant, and restore the snapshot with actual tenant data.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Snapshots as Tenant Templates If you need to create multiple similar tenants, you don't have to configure each tenant from 				scratch as described in the  Acumatica ERP Implementation Guide. To speed up the implementation of new tenants, you can 				create and use tenant templates. In  Acumatica ERP, you use the functionality of snapshots to create tenant templates. You create snapshots by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM203520|SM203520]) Tenants (SM203520) 				form. A  snapshot  may contain all custom data available in the database for 				the tenant account or only some of the data. For details on snapshots, see  Managing Snapshots. When a tenant snapshot is restored in a newly created empty tenant, this new tenant will 				contain all the data that you included in the snapshot. You can restore a snapshot 				in the same database where it was created or import it to another website and 				restore it in another database. Any snapshot can be used multiple times.  This topic outlines several possible method of using snapshots as tenant templates.  Method I To create a new tenant that is very similar in configuration to an existing tenant without any 				customizations, follow the basic steps below:  A snapshot carries information about the version of the database where it was 				created, so before you restore a snapshot, make sure that the versions match.

Protecting data is very important for every business. Thus, before you make any significant configuration changes or perform an irreversible operation, you should perform the required changes in a test environment—that is, a test tenant that contains the full or partial data of your tenant.

You can create as many accounts as you may need, each serving a different purpose—for instance, one account for communications with your customer support department, and another account for sending newsletters. For each system email account, you specify the outgoing mail server, the incoming mail server (optional), and the protocol to be used. Also, you must specify ports, login information for servers of both types, and the type of encrypted connection (if required by the server).{br}

For any system account, you can enable processing of incoming mail and select processing options that define how emails received to the account should be processed, such as whether to create a case for each email message or a new lead record (for details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\EM__con_Mail_Processing|Incoming Mail Processing]). Also, you can specify the types of attachments that are permitted, if attachments are permitted at all. You can allow the deletion of processed emails or forbid it (if your organization requires emails to be kept for a particular period of time, for instance). If needed, you can set up automatic confirmation of received emails or automatic replies to unassigned emails.{br}

To make it faster for users to select a system email account for sending emails on the related forms, you can select one of the system accounts as the default system email account by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_01|Email Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM204001|SM204001]) form. If a user has access to system email accounts, the user can select one of these accounts as this user's personal default email account by using the '''Email Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\SM_20_30_10|User Profile] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) form.

In Acumatica ERP, all incoming mail that is received by system email accounts is processed in a series of consecutive steps.{br}

The processing of incoming emails consists of the basic processing, which is enabled out of the box and cannot be additionally configured, and the advanced processing that can be set up individually for each system email account.{br}

This topic describes the rules that the system follows when processing incoming emails and how you can set up this functionality.{br}{TOC}
==Basic Processing==
The basic processing consists of the following steps, which are performed by default upon each email received by a system email account:[anchor|#_aea7b8b0-bce4-4a67-9cd3-4521919d405a]
#Based on a received email, the system creates an email in Acumatica ERP, with the sender&rsquo;s name, sender&rsquo;s email address, subject, and description specified. The email has the ''Pending Processing'' status and the current date specified as the start date.
#If the sender is recognized as an employee, the system assigns that employee as the owner of the email. (The system does not verify whether the employee has the ''Active'' status.)
#The system analyzes hidden tags attached to the email and determines if the email has a parent activity in Acumatica ERP. If such an activity is found, the email becomes linked to it and also associated with the related entity, contact, business account, owner, and workgroup (if any) from the parent activity. (When assigning the owner, the system does not verify whether the employee has the ''Active'' status.)

==Advanced Processing==
Depending on your business, the mail you receive through Acumatica ERP may consist of requests for information, emails related to customer contracts, or emails received from contacts or leads as replies to emails sent during specific marketing campaigns. You can configure incoming mail processing so that based on an incoming email, the system creates a case or a lead and attaches the email to the created entity as a related activity. Also, an incoming email may be attached to an existing lead, contact, or business account that is related to the email exchange. You can activate and configure the processing of incoming mail individually for each of the system email accounts. You can also specify an email assignment map, which the system will use when it cannot assign incoming emails based on email history. All these options are included in the advanced functionality of incoming mail processing.{br}

 You can activate the processing of incoming mail by selecting the required account on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_02|System Email Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=SM204002|SM204002]) form, and then selecting the '''Incoming Mail Processing''' check box on the '''Incoming Mail Processing''' tab. ((({S:Warn}Before you activate this processing, make sure that email addresses are specified for all employees involved in customer support and CRM activities on either the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form or the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) form.
))){br}

The advanced processing can be divided into two parts: the mandatory part, which is executed whenever processing is enabled for the system email account, and the optional part, which you can tailor through the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_02|System Email Accounts] form to fit your needs.{br}

The mandatory part includes the following steps, if the related entity that is linked to the email is a case with the ''Open'' or ''Pending Customer'' status and if the email sender is not the owner of the case:[anchor|#_99fa01a8-dfa0-435f-bbbb-98ca6f467610]
#The status of the case changes to ''Open'' with the reason set to ''Updated''.
#A notification about the updated status is sent to the case owner.
#:((({S:Hint}No such notification is sent if the incoming email is a part of internal communication between employees.
)))

The optional part includes the following steps, which you can configure by using the '''Incoming Mail Processing''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_02|System Email Accounts] form:[anchor|#ul_nyd_thw_v3]
*''Initial processing'': You can configure the system to confirm the receipt of incoming emails by sending replies based on a specific template created through the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_03|Notification Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=SM204003|SM204003]) form.
*''Main Processing'': You can select options corresponding to any of the following actions:
**Create a new case for each processed email and attach the email to the case as a related activity.
**Route the email to the email addresses specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form for the owners of the parent activity (the owner of the outgoing email to which the sender of the incoming email has replied), related entity (such as the opportunity, contact, or case), and associated business account. 
**:((({S:Warn}Emails are routed to only those employees that have the '''Route Emails''' check box selected on the '''General Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form. Emails are not sent to deleted employees or to employees that have the ''Inactive'' status.
)))
**Attach each processed email to the business account, contact, or lead related to the email exchange.
**Create a new lead for each processed email and attach the email to the lead as a related activity.
**Reply to unassigned emails by using a specific template created through the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_03|Notification Templates] form.
*''Final processing'': You can decide whether the system should remove processed messages and whether it should add available source information to the bottom of each processed email.

==Processing Steps==
Depending on the selected options, the system processes each email as follows (skipping the step if the corresponding option is not selected or if it is not applicable):[anchor|#ul_ggc_nfq_v3]
#A receipt confirmation is generated and sent to the email sender.
#The email undergoes the basic processing steps.
#The system updates the status of the linked case.
#The email is routed to the email addresses of the relevant employees.
#A new case is created based on the email information.
#The email is attached to the business account, contact, or lead related to the email exchange.
#A notification is sent to the case owner.
#An automatic reply is sent if the system has failed to assign the email.
#The email is deleted if the specified conditions are met.
#If the email remains unassigned, the system uses the email assignment map specified on the '''Assignment Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_02|System Email Accounts] form to assign the email.
#A new lead is created based on the email sender.
((({S:Warn}Generally, the subjects for outgoing mass emails are system-generated and contain values from particular contact records, cases, and activities that will help later with processing replies to the emails if addressees do not change the email subjects.

To Set Up the Default System Email Account Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM204001|SM204001]) Email Preferences (SM204001) form. In the  Default Email Account  box, select the system email                     account that you want to be used for sending automatic emails. Click  Save  on the form toolbar to save the changes. Now                         all emails sent on behalf of  Acumatica ERP will be sent from this address. ]]></column>

 Acumatica ERP provides email management functionality to employees involved in customer relationship management (CRM) activities, such as working with leads and contacts, organizing campaigns, and handling cases.{br}

In Acumatica ERP, users can use their favorite email programs for communication with customer contacts and leads, and use their personal email accounts if these email addresses are registered with the system.{br}

For every user involved in CRM or case processing, you should specify the user&rsquo;s personal email account on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form, the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) form, or both forms. If incoming mail processing is activated for a system email account, before the system forwards incoming emails to a specific employee, it checks whether the employee has an email address specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] form; if there is no such address, the system uses the email address specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] form. {br}

On the [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\SM_20_30_10|User Profile] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) form, the user can create a signature, which will be inserted at the end of each email this user sends. The '''Email Settings''' tab provides a text box and a toolbar with tools to format the text of the signature. For more details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__con_Personal_Document_Processing|Personal Settings for Document Processing]. {br}

On the forms used for creating emails, personal email addresses are available for selection (that is, they appear on the '''From''' list) to only their owners.{br}

 Acumatica ERP tracks the history of email exchanges—that is, the system stores all emails along with references to the related entities (such as contacts or cases). This history is used for automatic processing of incoming emails. For more info, see [HelpRoot_Administration\EM__con_Email_Exchange_History|Email Exchange History].{br}

Users can use templates for their emails or set up automatic notifications based on specific templates. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\EM__con_Notification_Templates|Notification Templates].{br}

For each system email account, you can manually initiate the processes of sending and receiving mail, or you can set up an automatic schedule for these processes. Also, you can suspend sending and receiving emails for all system email accounts at once. For more info, see [HelpRoot_Administration\EM__con_Sending_and_Receiving_Emails|Mail Sending and Receipt].{br}

To prevent the system from slowing down due to a large number of emails, both incoming and outgoing, accumulated over a long time, you can archive processed emails. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\EM__con_Email_Archiving|Email Archiving].

System email accounts for outgoing mail are used mainly to send mass emails for campaigns or mailing lists, or for automatic replies to incoming mail. When users involved with CRM activities create a mass email by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_80_00|Mass Emails] ([~/?ScreenId=CR308000|CR308000]) form, they can select in the '''From''' box the system email account to which they have access (for details, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CR__con_Mass_Mail|Mass Emails]). When a user clicks '''Send''' on the form toolbar, the SMTP server associated with the selected system email account generates each message of the mass email in accordance with the specified template and replaces placeholders in the email properties and the message body with the data of one of the recipients on the list, until the complete mailing list is processed. However, no emails are actually sent as a result of this process.{br}

To initiate the sending of outgoing emails, use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_50_70_10|Send and Receive Email] ([~/?ScreenId=SM507010|SM507010]) form. To send the emails selectively, use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_50_70_00|Emails Pending Processing] ([~/?ScreenId=SM507000|SM507000]) form. {br}

Once the system accounts are configured, you can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_50_70_10|Send and Receive Email] ([~/?ScreenId=SM507010|SM507010]) form to initiate the receipt of incoming emails and schedule the operations of sending and receiving mail. To process selected incoming and outgoing emails, use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_50_70_00|Emails Pending Processing] ([~/?ScreenId=SM507000|SM507000]) form.{br}

To allow the system to automatically resend outgoing emails whose processing has failed, you can use the '''Automatic Resend Attempts''' setting on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_01|Email Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM204001|SM204001]) form. This setting defines the number of times that the scheduled processing is allowed to fail for an email before the email's status changes from ''Pending Processing'' to ''Failed''. However, the system ignores this setting if a critical error (that is, an error whose code starts with 5, such as 550) occurs on the mail server or if you run the processing manually.((({S:Hint}You can suspend the operations of sending and receiving emails for all system email accounts at once by selecting the '''Suspend Email Processing''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_01|Email Preferences] form. You may need to do this if you have troubles with your mail servers and need to suspend all operations on these servers to diagnose the problem.

Over time, system email accounts may accumulate an extremely large number of emails, both incoming and outgoing, which may result in considerable system slowdown, especially if incoming mail processing has been enabled for these accounts.{br}

In Acumatica ERP, you can archive emails that are too old to be relevant. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_01|Email Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM204001|SM204001]) form, you can enable email archiving by specifying the minimum age of emails to be archived. The actual archiving is performed when you apply this setting to a particular system email account by executing the ''Send All'', ''Receive All'', or ''Send/Receive All'' action, which you can do on any of the following forms:[anchor|#ul_kfs_4m2_dr]
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_02|System Email Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=SM204002|SM204002]): On this form, you can process only one email account at a time.
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_50_70_10|Send and Receive Email] ([~/?ScreenId=SM507010|SM507010]): On this form, you can process multiple email accounts at once.
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_20|Automation Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=SM205020|SM205020]): You can use this form to create an automation schedule for the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_50_70_10|Send and Receive Email] form so that you can regularly process the selected email accounts. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\EM__HOW_To_Create_a_Send_and_Receive_Schedule|To Create a Send and Receive Email Schedule].

Only emails that have the ''Processed'' status can be archived. After the archiving process is completed, the archived emails disappear from the lists on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CO_40_90_00|Incoming] ([~/?ScreenId=CO409000|CO409000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\CO_40_90_80|Sent] ([~/?ScreenId=CO409080|CO409080]) forms; instead, they are all listed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CO_40_90_30|Archived] ([~/?ScreenId=CO409030|CO409030]) form. Thus, archived emails do not get in your way when you are browsing through incoming or outgoing emails, although you still can search for an archived item, or even perform regular actions, such as '''Reply''' or '''Forward''', on it.{br}

Regardless of the settings specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_01|Email Preferences] form, you can use the '''Archive''' action on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CO_40_90_00|Incoming] and [HelpRoot_FormReference\CO_40_90_80|Sent] forms to archive selected emails at any time. Also, you can archive any email that has the ''Processed'' status by opening it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_15|Email Activity] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306015|CR306015]) form and using the '''Archive''' action on the form toolbar.((({S:Warn}After it has been archived, an email associated with a particular entity remains listed on the '''Activities''' tab of the respective data entry form. Also, if time tracking has been enabled for this email, the billable time spent on this email (if any) will be billed to the customer even if the email has been archived. (For more information on time tracking for activities, see [HelpRoot_Organization\EP__con_Time_Tracking|Time Activities].)

An archived email can be restored from the archive. When it has been restored, the email disappears from the table on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CO_40_90_30|Archived] form and is again listed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CO_40_90_00|Incoming] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\CO_40_90_80|Sent] form, depending on whether it is an incoming or outgoing email; the status of the email changes back to ''Processed''. You can restore an individual email by opening it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_15|Email Activity] form and clicking '''Actions''' > '''Restore from Archive''' on the form toolbar, or you can restore emails in bulk by selecting these emails in the table on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CO_40_90_30|Archived] form and clicking '''Restore from Archive''' on the form toolbar.

Sometimes you might need a faster way to access particular information in the system—such as the contacts of a particular vendor or the list of customers. Generally in Acumatica ERP, you can access such information by opening the corresponding data entry or maintenance form and clicking the magnifier icon in the appropriate box; the list of records then opens in the pop-up window. This sequence of events, however, may not give you the information you need quickly enough. The data entry and maintenance forms are convenient for entering new data, but once you have entered most data, you may have a greater need to instead view the list of records created on the data entry form.{br}

In Acumatica ERP, you can create a generic inquiry or custom form that presents the data of a data entry or maintenance form (which is called the ''entry form'' in this context) in a tabular format. The generic inquiry or custom form that you create is called the ''substitute form'' in this context. Once you have created the substitute form, you can replace the entry form with it. Thus, when you click the name of the entry form, you will access the substitute form that contains the list of records. When you click a record name in the list, the entry form (data entry or maintenance) will open.{br}{TOC}
==Configuring a Generic Inquiry to Be Used as a Substitute Form==
To configure a generic inquiry to be used as a substitute form, select the entry form, configure the list of records to be displayed on the substitute form, and then select the place of the form on the site map. You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_80_00|Generic Inquiry] ([~/?ScreenId=SM208000|SM208000]) form to configure an inquiry. For an example of configuring a generic inquiry, see [HelpRoot_ReportingTools\SM__how_How_to_Design_an_Inquiry_In_Inventory|Example: Designing a Generic Inquiry Based on Inventory Data].{br}

If you might need from time to time to add or delete the records in the list (that is, not only view the list of records, but also add records to the system or permanently delete existing records), or make edits to the data shown in the list, you can add the required buttons and menu commands to the form toolbar of the substitute form. You can add any of the following options to a substitute form:[anchor|#ul_ic3_p1c_vp]
*Enabling the creation of new records: If you enable this capability, the '''New Record''' button will be available on the substitute form. When a user clicks the button, the entry form opens to let the user add a new record.
*:((({S:Warn}If you enable the creation of new records on the substitute form, you can define the default values for the fields that appear when you add a record. The system will automatically enter these values in the specified fields when a user adds a new record. You define the default values in the '''New Record Defaults''' table on the '''Entry Point''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_80_00|Generic Inquiry] form. 
)))
*Enabling mass removal of records: If you enable mass removal of records, the '''Delete''' button and the '''Selected''' column will be available on the substitute form. A user can select one record or multiple records and then delete them. Additionally, you can configure the system to automatically confirm the deletion of records after this button is clicked and before the records are actually deleted.
*Enabling mass update of records: If you enable this capability, the '''Update''' and '''Update All''' commands will be available in the '''Actions''' menu on the form toolbar and the '''Selected''' column in the table of the substitute form. When you configure this capability, you select the field or fields that should be updated if the user clicks one of these options. A user can select one record or multiple records and then change the specified fields of the selected records.
*Enabling mass actions on records: When you configure this setting, you can select any of the available options according to your needs. The available options depend on the content of the entry form for which you create the inquiry. For example, the following options might be available for the form: ''Copy'', ''Paste'', ''Validate Address'', and ''Mark As Validated''. After you have selected the required options and saved the list, the selected commands will appear in the '''Actions''' menu on the form toolbar and the '''Selected''' column in the table of the substitute form. A user can select one record or multiple records and then apply any available command to the selected records.
*:((({S:Warn}We do not recommend to use mass actions that involve redirecting to other pages, such as Customer Details or Analytical Reports. This scenario may cause performance issues and is not guaranteed to work properly. 
)))

For details on configuring a generic inquiry to be used as a substitute form, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_To_Set_Up_Primary_Screen_As_List|To Configure a Generic Inquiry to Replace an Entry Form].
==Configuring a Custom Form to Be Used as a Substitute Form==
With Acumatica ERP, you can design your own custom forms that you can use to replace the entry forms. Each substitute form must include fields that are mapped to the key fields of the corresponding entry form. For more information on designing custom forms, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Customization\CG_GL_Forms_DevelopCustom|To Develop a Custom Form] in the Customization Guide.{br}

When the custom form is ready, you match the form to the corresponding entry form (that is, specify the entry form that will be replaced with the custom form) by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_85_00|Lists as Entry Points] ([~/?ScreenId=SM208500|SM208500]) form. For details of configuring such a custom form to be used as a substitute form, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CU__how_PrimaryScreen_Custom|To Replace an Entry Form with a Custom Form].
==Accessing Substitute Forms==
In Acumatica ERP, every form has its own level of access that you can configure by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_20|Access Rights by Screen] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201020|SM201020]) form. You can change the level of access to the entry and substitute forms independently of each other. However, when a substitute form replaces the corresponding entry form, the substitute form inherits the level of access the users have to the entry form. Thus, to change the level of access users have to the substitute form, you change the level of access to the entry form.{br}

If required, you can cancel the replacement, which involves configuring the system to direct users to the entry form (instead of the substitute form) when they try to open the entry form; canceling the replacement does not involve deleting forms. If you cancel the replacement, the level of access to the substitute form reverts to the initial state (that is, the level of access the substitute form had before you used it to replace an entry form). 
==Replacing the Entry Form with the Substitute Form==
After you have configured a substitute form, you match the substitute form to the corresponding entry form (that is, specify the substitute form that will replace the entry form), with each pair of entry and substitute forms taking its own row on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_85_00|Lists as Entry Points] ([~/?ScreenId=SM208500|SM208500]) form. ((({S:Warn}A generic inquiry is automatically matched to the entry form when you select the entry form in the '''Entry Screen''' box and select the '''Replace Entry Screen with This Inquiry in Menu''' check box on the '''Entry Point''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_80_00|Generic Inquiry] form. The selection on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_80_00|Generic Inquiry] form is removed if you delete the row that contains the inquiry on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_85_00|Lists as Entry Points] form.
)))
You can activate or cancel the replacement of any entry form in the list any time you want. Canceling the replacement does not remove the form pair from the list. For details of activating and canceling the replacement of an entry form, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CU__how_Primary_Screen_Replacement|To Activate the Replacement of an Entry Form] and [HelpRoot_Administration\CU__how_Primary_ScreenReplacement_Cancel|To Cancel the Replacement of an Entry Form].{br}

If you delete the row containing the entry form and the corresponding substitute form, you remove the matching between the forms; the replacement is canceled, but the forms are not deleted.

#To define how to open the entry form from the substitute form when a user is adding a new record or viewing the details of an existing record (if you haven&rsquo;t replaced the entry form with the substitute form), do the following:
##In the '''Screens''' section of the '''Navigation''' tab, select the entry screen, which was added automatically when you selected the entry screen on the '''Entry Point''' tab.
##In the '''Navigation Parameters''' section, select one of the following values in the '''Window Mode''' box:
##*''Same Tab'' (default value): The entry form opens in the same browser tab.
##*''New Tab'': The entry form opens in a new browser tab.
##*''Pop-Up Window'': The entry form opens in a new pop-up window.
#Optional: In the '''Navigation Parameters''' section of the '''Navigation''' tab, modify the inquiry parameters that should be passed to the key fields of the entry form.
#Optional: In the '''New Record Defaults''' table, specify the default parameters for the fields to be added while the new records are created on the inquiry form.
#:((({S:Warn}The '''New Record Defaults''' table is available only if the '''Enable New Record Creation''' check box is selected.
)))
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

As a result of these steps, the inquiry form will be displayed as the entry form in the defined site map location.

To replace the selected entry screen with the substitute form, select                             the  Replace Entry Screen with this Inquiry in                                 Menu  check box.  If you select this check box, the                                 entry form always opens in the same browser tab when a user is                                 adding a new record from this inquiry or viewing the details of an                                 existing record from the inquiry. To give the user the ability to add new records from the substitute form, in the                          Operations With Records  section, select the                          Enable New Record Creation  check box. The                              New Record  button appears on the form toolbar of                         the substitute form. When the user clicks this button, the system opens the                         entry form that the user can use to add a new record.  To give the user the ability to delete existing records from the system by using                     the substitute form, select the  Enable Mass Record                         Deletion  check box. The  Delete  button                         appears on the form toolbar and the  Selected  column                         appears in the table of the substitute form. A user can select one record or                         multiple records, and then delete any of these records from the system. The                         user will have to confirm the deletion of every record. To make the system automatically confirm the deletion of records on the                     substitute form, select the  Auto-Confirm Custom Delete                         Confirmations  check box. With this check box selected, when a                         user tries to delete one record or multiple records, the records will be                         deleted without confirmation. To give the user the ability to update particular fields of the records by using                     the substitute form, do the following: Select the  Enable Mass Record Update  check                             box. On the  Mass Update Fields  tab, add the fields to                             the table. The  Update  and  Update All                          commands appear on the  Actions  menu of the form                         toolbar and the Selected column appears in the table of the substitute                         form. To give the user the ability to use particular commands (such  Copy  or                          Add Note ) on the substitute form, do the following: Select the  Enable Mass Actions on Records  check                             box. On the  Mass Actions  tab, add to the table the                             actions you want to provide. The added commands appear on the  Actions  menu of                         the form toolbar, and the Selected column appears in the table of the                         substitute form. To define how to open the entry form from the substitute form when a user is                     adding a new record or viewing the details of an existing record (if you haven't                     replaced the entry form with the substitute form), do the following: In the  Screens  section of the                                  Navigation  tab, select the entry screen,                             which was added automatically when you selected the entry screen on the                                  Entry Point  tab. In the  Navigation Parameters  section, select one                             of the following values in the  Window Mode                                  box: Same Tab  (default value): The entry form opens in the                                     same browser tab. New Tab : The entry form opens in a new browser tab. Pop-Up Window : The entry form opens in a new pop-up                                     window. Optional: In the  Navigation Parameters  section of the                          Navigation  tab, modify the inquiry parameters that                     should be passed to the key fields of the entry form. Optional: In the  New Record Defaults  table, specify the                     default parameters for the fields to be added while the new records are created                     on the inquiry form. The  New Record Defaults  table                         is available only if the  Enable New Record Creation                          check box is selected. On the form toolbar, click  Save . As a result of these steps, the inquiry form will be displayed as the entry form in                 the defined site map location.  ]]></column>

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
With Acumatica ERP, you can conveniently store files, such as temporary internal instructions, inventory item images, or scanned images of original vendor invoices. You import the files to the system and attach them to ERP records, record details, documents, notification templates, and wiki articles. You can easily manage and track the imported files.{br}{TOC}
==File Type and Size Preferences==
In Acumatica ERP, you can allow or deny the importing of specific file types (by their extensions) and set a maximum size for imported files. Use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_50|File Upload Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202550|SM202550]) form to view and edit the file types and sizes that users may import to the site.
==File Attachments==
You use the '''Files''' dialog box to import the file and attach it to the ERP record, document, notification template, wiki article, or record detail. {br}

Also, you can attach any other files that have been uploaded to the system. You click '''Add Link''' button in the '''Files''' dialog box and the system navigates you to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_20|Search in Files] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202520|SM202520]) form where you can search for needed files and attached them to the entity.{br}

For more information on importing and attaching files, see the following topics:[anchor|#ul_rk3_swm_5j]
*[HelpRoot_Interface\Attaching_Files_to_Forms_and_Records|To Attach a File to a Record] and [HelpRoot_Interface\Attaching_Files_to_Record_Details|To Attach a File to a Record Detail] in the Acumatica ERP Interface Guide
*[HelpRoot_Administration\DM__how_Wiki_Adding_Pictures|To Add a Graphic ] and [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Attach_Existing_Files_to_Entity|To Attach Existing Files to a Record or a Record Detail]

==Attachment of Scanned Files==
You can scan documents and attach these files to documents and document lines if the ''DeviceHub'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form and at least one scanner has been configured in Acumatica ERP through integration with the DeviceHub application. {br}

For more information on configuring scanners in DeviceHub, see the topics of the [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__mng_Configuring_DeviceHub_Tool|Configuring Hardware Devices in DeviceHub] chapter. For more information on scanning and attaching files, see [HelpRoot_Interface\UIG__how_Attach_File_Record|To Scan a File and Attach It to a Record] and [HelpRoot_Interface\UIG__how_Attach_File_Record_Detail|To Scan a File and Attach It to a Record Detail].
==File Name Changes==
When files are imported, the system modifies their names as follows: 
*For a file attached to a record (that is, an entity or a document created on a data entry form), the resulting name consists of the form name, a record ID in parentheses, a backslash, and the name of the file. Example: {{Journal Transactions (GL333234231)\Note.txt}} or {{Bills and Adjustments (INV0023572)\Orig_doc.jpeg}}.
*For a file attached to a record detail (a detail row or line of the entity or document), the resulting name consists of the form name, a record ID and record detail ID in parentheses, a backslash, and the name of the file. Example: {{Journal Transactions (GL333234231 3)\Note.txt}}.
*For a file attached to a wiki article, the resulting name consists of the wiki article name and the name of the file, separated by a backslash. Example: {{Role-Based Access\Users.gif}}.

==File Searches==
You can use the following forms to find the files imported to the system:
*[HelpRoot_Interface\SE_00_00_40|Search Form] ([~/?ScreenId=SE000040|SE000040]): On this form, you can search for a file by its name or part of the name, or by the comment specified during file upload. You can also search by the type of object it is attached to (article or system entity); you can also include in the search files not attached to any system entity.
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_20|Search in Files] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202520|SM202520]): By using this form, you can specify the following criteria in your search:
**What the file name (or part of it) is
**When the file was added
**Who added the file
**Who is editing the file (if the file is checked out for edit)
**What document type the file is attached to
*:When you first use the system, the tree in the left pane of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_20|Search in Files] form may contain only one root node, which is populated as users attach files to the records, record details, or wiki articles. A module appears on the site tree only after at least one file has been attached to a record (such as a batch, bill, or invoice) created on a form of the module.
*:((({S:Warn}The system doesn&rsquo;t check the access rights to file attachments for a user who searches the files by using this form.
)))

For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__How_Tracking_Files|To Manage Files].
==Version Maintenance==
You can import and maintain an unlimited number of versions for any file. For each new version of the file, provide a comment to inform users about modifications to it. This will help users find the file and file version they need. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__How_Tracking_Files|To Manage Files].
==File Storage Configuration==
By default, the system stores the files attached to documents in the Acumatica ERP SQL Server database. Alternatively, the system can store the files outside of the database—either in a local folder on the computer running the Acumatica ERP website, or in a public cloud using Azure Blob Storage or Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). ((({S:Warn}To use an external file storage, you must have an account with the provider and configure the file storage to be used by your Acumatica ERP instance. For more information, see [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/storage-introduction/#blob-storage|Blob Storage] on the Microsoft Azure portal and [http://aws.amazon.com/s3/|Amazon S3].
)))
You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_40|External File Storage] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202540|SM202540]) form to configure external file storage providers and specify where files should be stored. With regard to file storage functionality, ''provider'' denotes the storage provider, which can be a local folder, Azure Blob service, or Amazon S3 service.{br}

If you created multiple companies in your Acumatica ERP instance and want to store file attachments out of the database in any of these companies, you need to configure an external storage provider for each company individually. It can be the same provider for all companies or a separate provider for each company.{br}

See the following topics for the procedures of configuring external file storage in Acumatica ERP: [anchor|#ul_ghv_h1g_ms]
*[HelpRoot_Administration\DM__How_External_File_Storage|To Store Attached Files in a Local Folder]
*[HelpRoot_Administration\DM__how_FileStorage_Azure|To Store Attached Files by Using the Azure Blob Service]
*[HelpRoot_Administration\DM__how_FileStorage_AmazonS3|To Store Attached Files by Using the Amazon S3 Service]

==File Synchronization==
You can use automation schedules to perform periodic synchronization between a file on an Acumatica ERP site and a file (or folder) on a local computer or network. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_How_to_Set_Up_Automatic_Synchronization_of_Files|To Set Up Automatic File Synchronization ].[anchor|#_4bfc9acc-4ef8-41b2-a31f-12f5a8bb4fc0]((({S:Warn}If you synchronize files with an FTP server, you should use a login without the /, or \ characters in synchronization settings. Otherwise, Acumatica ERP will not be able to connect to the server.
)))
==Access Rights==
A single file attachment can be attached to multiple wiki articles, notification templates, and templates for email.{br}

By default, access rights are not set directly for file attachments. Access rights for the file attachment are inherited from their rights for the system entity it was first attached to. By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_10|File Maintenance] form, you can define the primary document or article from which roles inherit access rights to this file. Also, you can make the file available to all users. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__How_Tracking_Files|To Manage Files].
==File Deletions==
When you actively import files into the system, you can accumulate unnecessary files if either or both of the following is true:[anchor|#ul_dmw_hgc_tj]
*You don&rsquo;t delete the files that were attached to the ERP records, documents, notification templates, or wiki articles that were deleted from the system.
*You update the files with versioning turned on and leave the outdated versions of files.

It is a good practice to delete outdated and unnecessary files from the system to minimize the use of file storage. Try to delete these files (and versions of files, if applicable) regularly.{br}

For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__How_Tracking_Files|To Manage Files].

You import the 				files to the system and attach them to ERP records, record details, documents, 				notification templates, and wiki articles. You can easily manage and track the 				imported files. File Type and Size Preferences In  Acumatica ERP, you can allow or deny the importing of specific file types (by their extensions) 				and set a maximum size for imported files. Use the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202550|SM202550]) File Upload Preferences (SM202550) form to view and edit the file types and sizes that 				users may import to the site. File Attachments You use the  Files  dialog box to import the file and attach it 				to the ERP record, document, notification template, wiki article, or record detail.  Also, you can attach any other files that have been uploaded to the system. You click 					 Add Link  button in the  Files  				dialog box and the system navigates you to the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202520|SM202520]) Search in Files (SM202520) form where you can search for needed files and 				attached them to the entity. For more information on importing and attaching files, see the following topics: To Attach a File to a Record and 						 To Attach a File to a Record Detail in 					the  Acumatica ERP Interface Guide To Add a Graphic  and  To Attach Existing Files to a Record or a Record DetailAttachment of Scanned Files You can scan documents and attach these files to documents and document lines if the 					 DeviceHub  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form and at least one scanner 				has been configured in  Acumatica ERP through integration with the  DeviceHub application.  For more information on configuring scanners in  DeviceHub, see the topics of the  Configuring Hardware Devices in DeviceHub chapter. For more 				information on scanning and attaching files, see  To Scan a File and Attach It to a Record and  To Scan a File and Attach It to a Record Detail. File Name Changes When files are imported, the system modifies their names as follows:  For a file attached to a record (that is, an entity or a document created on a data entry 					form), the resulting name consists of the form name, a record ID in parentheses, 					a backslash, and the name of the file. Example:  Journal Transactions 						(GL333234231)\Note.txt  or  Bills and Adjustments 						(INV0023572)\Orig_doc.jpeg . For a file attached to a record detail (a detail row or line of the entity or document), the 					resulting name consists of the form name, a record ID and record detail ID in 					parentheses, a backslash, and the name of the file. Example:  Journal 						Transactions (GL333234231 3)\Note.txt . For a file attached to a wiki article, the resulting name consists of the wiki 					article name and the name of the file, separated by a backslash. Example: 						 Role-Based Access\Users.gif . File Searches You can use the following forms to find the files imported to the system:  ([~/?ScreenId=SE000040|SE000040]) Search Form (SE000040): On this form, you 					can search for a file by its name or part of the name, or by the comment 					specified during file upload. You can also search by the type of object it is 					attached to (article or system entity); you can also include in the search files 					not attached to any system entity.  ([~/?ScreenId=SM202520|SM202520]) Search in Files (SM202520): By using this form, 					you can specify the following criteria in your search: What the file name (or part of it) is When the file was added Who added the file Who is editing the file (if the file is checked out for edit) What document type the file is attached to When you first use the system, the tree in the left pane of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202520|SM202520]) Search in Files form may contain only one root 						node, which is populated as users attach files to the records, record 						details, or wiki articles. A module appears on the site tree only after at 						least one file has been attached to a record (such as a batch, bill, or 						invoice) created on a form of the module. The system doesn't check 						the access rights to file attachments for a user who searches the files by 						using this form. For more information, see  To Manage Files. Version Maintenance You can import and maintain an unlimited number of versions for any file. For each 				new version of the file, provide a comment to inform users about modifications to 				it. This will help users find the file and file version they need. For more 				information, see  To Manage Files. File Storage Configuration By default, the system stores the files attached to documents in the  Acumatica ERP SQL Server database. Alternatively, the system can store the files outside of the 				database—either in a local folder on the computer running the  Acumatica ERP website, or in a public cloud using Azure Blob Storage or Amazon Simple Storage 				Service (Amazon S3).  To use an external file storage, you must have an account with the provider and 				configure the file storage to be used by your  Acumatica ERP instance. For more information, see  Blob Storage Blob Storage on the Microsoft Azure portal 				and  Amazon 					S3 Amazon S3. You use the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202540|SM202540]) External File Storage (SM202540) form to 				configure external file storage providers and specify where files should be stored. 				With regard to file storage functionality,  provider  denotes the storage 				provider, which can be a local folder, Azure Blob service, or Amazon S3 service. If you created multiple companies in your  Acumatica ERP instance and want to store file attachments out of the database in any of these 				companies, you need to configure an external storage provider for each company 				individually. It can be the same provider for all companies or a separate provider 				for each company. See the following topics for the procedures of configuring external file storage in 					 Acumatica ERP:  To Store Attached Files in a Local FolderTo Store Attached Files by Using the Azure Blob ServiceTo Store Attached Files by Using the Amazon S3 ServiceFile Synchronization You can use automation schedules to perform periodic synchronization between a file 				on an  Acumatica ERP site and a file (or folder) on a local computer or network. For more information, 				see  To Set Up Automatic File Synchronization . If you synchronize files with an FTP server, you             should use a login without the /, or \ characters in synchronization settings.             Otherwise,  Acumatica ERP will not be able to connect to the server. Access Rights A single file attachment can be attached to multiple wiki articles, notification 				templates, and templates for email. By default, access rights are not set directly for file attachments. Access rights 				for the file attachment are inherited from their rights for the system entity it was 				first attached to. By using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202510|SM202510]) File Maintenance form, you can define the primary document or article from which 				roles inherit access rights to this file. Also, you can make the file available to 				all users. For more information, see  To Manage Files. File Deletions When you actively import files into the system, you can accumulate unnecessary files 				if either or both of the following is true: You don't delete the files that were attached to the ERP records, documents, 					notification templates, or wiki articles that were deleted from the system. You update the files with versioning turned on and leave the outdated versions 					of files. It is a good practice to delete outdated and unnecessary files from the system to 				minimize the use of file storage. Try to delete these files (and versions of files, 				if applicable) regularly. For more information, see  To Manage Files. ]]></column>

You can use automation schedules to perform periodic synchronization between a file on an Acumatica ERP site and a file on a local computer or network. {br}

You find the file whose synchronization you want to schedule by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_20|Search in Files] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202520|SM202520]) form, configure file synchronization by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_10|File Maintenance] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202510|SM202510]) form, and then schedule the synchronization on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_30|File Synchronization] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202530|SM202530]) form.
==Before You Proceed==
Before you start configuring synchronization between a file on your Acumatica ERP website and a file or folder on your local network, share the folder (which includes the file to be synchronized or which will itself be synchronized with the file on the Acumatica ERP website) through your operating system. Make sure the folder is shared with proper rights for writing. ((({S:Hint}Synchronization (of the ''export'' type) with a folder means that each time synchronization is performed, a new file with the appropriate date and time stamp is created in the specified folder. 
)))
==To Configure File Synchronization==
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_20|Search in Files] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202520|SM202520]) form.
#To find the file, on the form, do one of the following:
#*In the Selection area, specify criteria to help you find the file. This criteria can include the file name (or part of the file name), the time interval of the import, and the name of the user who imported the file or checked it out. The table in the right pane lists the files that match the criteria you specified.
#*In the left pane, navigate to and select the form to which the file is attached. The table in the right pane lists the files attached to the entities created by using the form you selected in the left pane.
#In the right pane, click the file to open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_10|File Maintenance] form for this file and view file properties.
#On the '''Synchronization''' tab, select the '''Synchronize''' check box.
#In the '''Synchronization Type''' box, select '''Shared Folder'''.
#In the '''Path''' box, enter the path to the shared folder on a local network computer.
#In the '''Login''' and '''Password''' boxes, type the login and password of an account with sufficient rights to allow system access to the shared folder.
#:((({S:Warn}If you synchronize files with an FTP server, you should use a login without the /, or \ characters in synchronization settings. Otherwise, Acumatica ERP will not be able to connect to the server.
)))
#To configure synchronization with the folder, do the following: 
##Select the '''Synchronize Folder Content''' check box.
##In the '''Import File Validation Mask''' box, enter a validation mask for the files in the folder that are involved in synchronization. 
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

==To Schedule File Synchronization==
After you have configured the file synchronization, you can perform synchronization manually by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_30|File Synchronization] form. Alternatively, you can assign it to a schedule to be performed automatically by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_20|Automation Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=SM205020|SM205020]) form. For more information about automation schedules, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Scheduled_Processing|Scheduled Processing].{br}

To schedule file synchronization, do the following:
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_30|File Synchronization] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202530|SM202530]) form.
#In the '''Operation''' box, select the synchronization operation to be performed, '''Import File''' or '''Export File'''. This displays (in the table in the lower part of the form) the pairs of files for which synchronization of the selected type has been configured.
#In the '''Selected''' column, select the check boxes for the files you want to have automatically updated. [anchor|#_c4e1c5d2-d7b2-4818-86d9-b28f9c411945]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Schedules''' > '''Add'''. This opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_20|Automation Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=SM205020|SM205020]) form as a pop-up.[anchor|#_cb414bd2-ccd3-4cd3-8465-61f0cf84aa69]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_20|Automation Schedules] form, in the '''Description''' box, enter a description of the new schedule.[anchor|#_5c57bf40-df94-4c7b-8650-f4fefe9e5b5d]
#On the '''Details''' tab, specify the additional settings of the schedule:
##Optional: In the '''Starts On''' box of the '''Details''' tab, select the start date. By default, the schedule execution starts on the current business date.
##Optional: If you need to specify an expiration date for the schedule, clear the '''No Expiration Date''' check box, and specify the expiration date in the '''Expires On''' box.
##Do one of the following:
##*If you want to limit the number of executions, in the '''Execution Limit''' box, specify the number of times the schedule should be executed.
##*If you do not need to limit the number of executions, select the '''No Execution Limit''' check box.
##Optional: In the '''Process with Branch''' box, select the branch under which the schedule should be processed. For example, if documents are created by this schedule, the system creates these documents and specifies the selected branch for each document. 
##Optional: Change the time zone in which the schedule will operate. By default, the time zone specified on the [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\SM_20_30_10|User Profile] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) form for the currently signed-in user is selected. [anchor|#_8757a2df-1030-4424-884d-3f39015fede7]
#On the '''Schedule''' tab, configure the execution dates and time as follows:

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[To Set Up Automatic File Synchronization  You can use automation schedules to perform periodic synchronization between a file 				on an  Acumatica ERP site and a file on a local computer or network.  You find the file whose synchronization you want to schedule by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202520|SM202520]) Search in Files (SM202520) form, configure file synchronization by 				using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202510|SM202510]) File Maintenance (SM202510) form, and then schedule the 				synchronization on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202530|SM202530]) File Synchronization (SM202530) form. Before You Proceed Before you start configuring synchronization between a file on your  Acumatica ERP website and a file or folder on your local network, share the folder (which 				includes the file to be synchronized or which will itself be synchronized with the 				file on the  Acumatica ERP website) through your operating system. Make sure the folder is shared with 				proper rights for writing.  Synchronization (of the  export  type) with a folder means that 				each time synchronization is performed, a new file with the appropriate date and 				time stamp is created in the specified folder.  To Configure File Synchronization Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202520|SM202520]) Search in Files (SM202520) form. To find the file, on the form, do one of the following: In the Selection area, specify criteria to help you find the file. This 							criteria can include the file name (or part of the file name), the time 							interval of the import, and the name of the user who imported the file 							or checked it out. The table in the right pane lists the files that 							match the criteria you specified. In the left pane, navigate to and select the form to which the file is 							attached. The table in the right pane lists the files attached to the 							entities created by using the form you selected in the left pane. In the right pane, click the file to open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202510|SM202510]) File Maintenance 					form for this file and view file properties. On the  Synchronization  tab, select the 						 Synchronize  check box. In the  Synchronization Type  box, select  Shared 						Folder . In the  Path  box, enter the path to the shared folder on a 					local network computer. In the  Login  and  Password  boxes, type the 					login and password of an account with sufficient rights to allow system access 					to the shared folder. If you synchronize files with an FTP server, you             should use a login without the /, or \ characters in synchronization settings.             Otherwise,  Acumatica ERP will not be able to connect to the server. To configure synchronization with the folder, do the following:  Select the  Synchronize Folder Content  check 							box. In the  Import File Validation Mask  box, enter a 							validation mask for the files in the folder that are involved in 							synchronization.   On the form toolbar, click  Save . To Schedule File Synchronization After you have configured the file synchronization, you can perform synchronization manually 				by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202530|SM202530]) File Synchronization form. Alternatively, you 				can assign it to a schedule to be performed automatically by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM205020|SM205020]) Automation Schedules (SM205020) form. For more information about 				automation schedules, see  Scheduled Processing. To schedule file synchronization, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202530|SM202530]) File Synchronization (SM202530) form. In the  Operation  box, select the synchronization operation to be 					performed,  Import File  or  Export 						File . This displays (in the table in the lower part of the form) 					the pairs of files for which synchronization of the selected type has been 					configured. In the  Selected  column, select the check boxes for the files you want 					to have automatically updated.  On the form toolbar, click  Schedules Add . This opens the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM205020|SM205020]) Automation Schedules (SM205020) form as a pop-up. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM205020|SM205020]) Automation Schedules             form, in the  Description  box, enter a description of the new             schedule. On the  Details  tab, specify             the additional settings of the schedule: Optional: In the  Starts On  box of the                          Details  tab, select the start date. By default, the                     schedule execution starts on the current business date. Optional: If you need to specify an expiration date for the schedule, clear the                          No Expiration Date  check box, and specify the                     expiration date in the  Expires On  box. Do one of the following: If you want to limit the number of executions, in the                                  Execution Limit  box, specify the number of                             times the schedule should be executed. If you do not need to limit the number of executions, select the                                  No Execution Limit  check box. Optional: In the  Process with Branch  box, select the                     branch under which the schedule should be processed. For example, if documents                     are created by this schedule, the system creates these documents and specifies                     the selected branch for each document.  Optional: Change the time zone in which the schedule will operate. By default,                     the time zone specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) User Profile                     (SM203010) form for the currently signed-in user is selected.  On the  Schedule  tab, configure             the execution dates and time as follows: Specify how often the schedule execution should be performed: To execute the schedule daily or every  x  days, do the following:                                  In the  Schedule Type  section, select                                          Daily .

Within Acumatica ERP, users can perform searches in help, wikis, and various ''entities'', such as vendors, customers, invoices, and contracts. To make the process quick and accurate, Acumatica ERP uses semantic search and search indexes.
==Semantic Search in Acumatica ERP==
 Acumatica ERP uses semantic search through SQL databases that allows the system to identify the key phrases in text or documents, discover similar or related documents, and provide information to explain how documents are similar or related.{br}

To employ semantic search in your Acumatica ERP instance, make sure that semantic search functionality is enabled in your SQL server. [anchor|#ul_qqk_15h_5r]
*In Microsoft SQL Server, the semantic search functionality is disabled by default. Enable the functionality, as described in [HelpRoot_Install\how__Semantic_Search|Enabling Semantic Search for Microsoft SQL Server] in Acumatica ERP Installation Guide.
*In MySQL Server, the semantic search functionality is enabled by default.

==Search Indexes==
The search indexes are used to accelerate searching in Acumatica ERP. When users perform the day-to-day operations, such as adding new documents or updating customer accounts, the new information is added to the appropriate search indexes automatically. You need to rebuild the search indexes in the following cases: [anchor|#_14537503-d814-46c2-aa6e-b00eeb7e4218]
*After you have upgraded your Acumatica ERP system from a version that did not include the search indexes
*After you have installed an Acumatica ERP tenant with demo data

For detailed procedure, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Search_indexes_update|To Build Search Indexes].{br}

The list of indexed entities, excluding the wikis, is available on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_95_00|Rebuild Full-Text Entity Index] ([~/?ScreenId=SM209500|SM209500]) form. {br}

The built-in help wikis are indexed automatically. The wikis created in your system are not indexes automatically; you must add search indexes for such wikis manually, as described [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__how_Wiki_Setting_Up_a_New_Wiki|To Add a Wiki]. Wiki search indexes are not displayed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_95_00|Rebuild Full-Text Entity Index] form.
==Known Limitations to Search Queries==
A semantic search does not find related entities if the search query includes word breakers, such as <tt>AND</tt> or <tt>FOR</tt>.{br}

 For example, suppose that you want to find related entities by using a description as a search query. The description includes at least one word breaker, so in this case, the search returns no results.

 Acumatica ERP and the Acumatica mobile app provides mechanisms to support two-factor authentication to prevent unauthorized system access. Security-conscious businesses require two-factor authentication to verify user identities before allowing them to access sensitive ERP data.((({S:Warn}This functionality is available only if the ''Two-Factor Authentication'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form.
)))
Access is granted only after the user successfully presents to the system additional evidence of authentication in addition to the user&rsquo;s credentials (that is, the username and password). At the system level, a system administrator can require two-factor authentication or turn off this authentication (the default setting). In addition, the administrator can specify different settings for individual users with regard to two-factor authentication; user settings take precedence over system-wide settings.{br}

If two-factor authentication is required, the user needs to authenticate the sign-in operation by using one of the methods displayed in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_c0b67561-4712-4c43-ae6b-30f6ef26b09e][image:UserGuide/Images/2019R1_RN_TwoFactor_2.png|popup|250px]{br}

By default, when two-factor authentication is enabled, the system uses the push notification method to authenticate the login operation.((({S:Warn}Push notifications are available only for instances with a valid license.
))){br}

The push notification method of authentication requires the Acumatica app to be set up on a mobile device.[anchor|#_386f2e44-3f7d-4d17-8308-64932c38f53f][image:UserGuide/Images/2019R1_RN_TwoFactor_1.png|popup|250px]{br}

You can specify whether the user confirms authentication in one of the following ways:[anchor|#_9658494d-2d2f-472c-ab92-fe59f1e01c69]
*By tapping '''Approve''' in Acumatica mobile app push notification.
*By email. This authentication method will be on the the login screen list if the administrator selects the ''Allow Email'' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_60|Security Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201060|SM201060]) form.
*Via SMS. This authentication method will be in on the the login screen list if the administrator selects the ''Allow SMS'' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_60|Security Preferences] form.
*By generating codes in Acumatica mobile app with the '''Generate Access Code''' command.
*By generating codes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) or User Profile (SM203010) form.
{br}

The '''Two-Factor Authentication Policy''' section on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_60|Security Preferences] form is used for setting up system-wide two-factor authentication preferences. The settings in this sentence affect all of the company's users that do not have their own settings specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] form. 
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] form, in the '''Two-Factor Authentication''' section, the administrator must select the '''Override Security Preferences''' check box in order to override the system default settings and specify the two-factor authentication mode for a specific selected user. (Otherwise, the settings specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_60|Security Preferences] form will be used.)
If two-factor authentication is required for a particular user, the first time that user signs in to the Acumatica mobile app, the system will request the security access code that will be sent to the user&rsquo;s email address when the user signs in to the web version of Acumatica ERP. The mobile app will also require PIN code or biometric verification when the user signs in. By invoking the '''Generate Access Code''' command in the account editing menu of the mobile app, the user can generate access codes for two-factor authentication.

When two-factor authentication has been enabled, you must register your mobile device or devices to receive confirmation requests as push notifications. That is, you must sign in to the Acumatica server in the mobile app by using an access code.((({S:Warn}Even if you have signed in to the server before, you must sign in again by using an access code. This must be done once for each mobile device.

#When you sign in to the mobile app, click the '''Send request to device''' button on the Sign-In page (as shown in the following screenshot). The system will send a push notification with a code to the registered device. If the message with the access code is not displayed on the Sign-In page, this means that the device was not registered properly, and you need to make sure that the instructions in the previous step have been completed correctly.[anchor|#image_n1v_w5p_4gb][image:UserGuide/Images/RN_2019R1_TwoFactor_Auth_2.png|popup|The Send request to device button|450px]
#Open the push notification and tap '''Approve''' (as shown in the following screenshot).

#:You will be signed in to the mobile app automatically.

If you cannot receive a push notification, you can use the ''Use Another Authentication Method'' link on the Sign-In page. You can do any of the following:[anchor|#_7bb8386b-7c21-4654-a3c2-4893b7b98231]
#Receive an access code by SMS. You can use this method if the sending of SMS messages has been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_60|Security Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201060|SM201060]) form and the correct mobile phone number has been specified on the [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\SM_20_30_10|User Profile] form. When you receive the access code in SMS, enter the code on the Sign-In page.
#Receive an access code by email. You can use this method if the sending of emails has been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_60|Security Preferences] form and the correct email address is specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] form. When you receive the access code in an email, enter the code on the Welcome screen.
#Use an existing access code or a code generated by the mobile app. You can use one of codes from the list generated on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] or [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\SM_20_30_10|User Profile] form. Alternatively, if you are signed in the mobile app, use the '''Generate Access Code''' action on the mobile device (see the following screenshot).[anchor|#image_ihj_cxp_4gb][image:UserGuide/Images/RN_2019R1_TwoFactor_Auth_4.png|popup|The Generate Access Code action in the mobile app|300px]

When you sign in to the system after registration, a push notification with a sign-in request will be sent automatically to the registered mobile devices. You need to approve the request, and sign-in will be performed automatically. The other authentication methods (which are described above) also can be used if push notifications are not available at the moment of sign-in.{br}

That is, you must                 sign in to the  Acumatica server in the mobile app by using an access code. Even if you have signed in to the server before, you must sign in                 again by using an access code. This must be done once for each mobile device. To Sign In with Two-Factor Authentication On your mobile device, enter your credentials on the Sign-In page. The system                     sends an access code for the mobile app to the user's email                         address. If the  Acumatica mobile app is not installed on the device, install the app, and create an                         account for the  Acumatica ERP server to which you want to connect. When you sign in to the mobile app, click the  Send request to                         device  button on the Sign-In page (as shown in the following                     screenshot). The system will send a push notification with a code to the                     registered device. If the message with the access code is not displayed on the                     Sign-In page, this means that the device was not registered properly, and you                     need to make sure that the instructions in the previous step have been completed                         correctly. The Send request to device button Open the push notification and tap  Approve  (as shown in                     the following screenshot). You need to confirm approval by using biometric                     authentication (if it is supported by the device) or by entering your PIN. A sample push notification with an access code You will be signed in to the mobile app automatically. If you cannot receive a push notification, you can use the  Use Another                     Authentication Method  link on the Sign-In page. You can do any of the                 following: Receive an access code by SMS. You can use this method if the sending of SMS                     messages has been enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201060|SM201060]) Security Preferences (SM201060) form                     and the correct mobile phone number has been specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) User                         Profile User Profile form. When you receive the access code in SMS, enter the code                     on the Sign-In page. Receive an access code by email. You can use this method if the sending of                     emails has been enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201060|SM201060]) Security Preferences form and the                     correct email address is specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) Users form.                     When you receive the access code in an email, enter the code on the Welcome                     screen. Use an existing access code or a code generated by the mobile app. You can use                     one of codes from the list generated on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) Users or                           ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) User                         Profile User Profile form. Alternatively, if you are signed in the mobile app, use                     the  Generate Access Code  action on the mobile device (see                     the following screenshot). The Generate Access Code action in the mobile app When you sign in to the system after registration, a push notification with a sign-in                 request will be sent automatically to the registered mobile devices. You need to                 approve the request, and sign-in will be performed automatically. The other                 authentication methods (which are described above) also can be used if push                 notifications are not available at the moment of sign-in. When you sign in to the mobile app by using an account with two-factor authentication                 enabled, the app will always request to confirm your identity by using biometric                 authentication (if it is supported by the device) or by entering your PIN. You can disable push notifications with sign-in requests for a particular device or                 particular devices by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) Users or   ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) User                     Profile User Profile form as follows: On the  Devices  tab, you                 clear the check box in the  Send Confirmation Push  column. ]]></column>

 Acumatica ERP provides functionality that you can use to localize the system in multiple languages. You can maintain the user interface and wikis in multiple languages if you have multiple locales. The default locale of Acumatica ERP is U.S. English. {br}

Localization includes the usage of locale-specific settings and the translation of the strings used on the application interface. Starting with Acumatica ERP 6, you can translate user input to multiple languages and store translations in the database.{br}

In this topic, you will read about how locales and languages are handled in the system.{br}{TOC}
==Understanding Locales and Languages==
 Acumatica ERP uses the list of locales provided by Microsoft.NET. In most cases, a locale identifier has two parts:[anchor|#ul_tcp_kyd_jw]
*The ISO code of the language: The system retrieves the language code from the locale identifier to create a new entity language and associates the language with the locale. Note that the system associates multiple locales with a language if the identifiers of these locales contain the same ISO code of a language. For example, the <tt>en-US</tt>, <tt>en-GB</tt>, and <tt>en-AU</tt> locales are all associated with English, the language whose ISO code is <tt>en</tt>. 
*:You can use these languages to localize user input. The translations can be further used for printing reports and documents. For details, see [[#section_lqy_4c2_jw|Enabling Multilingual User Input].
*The ISO code of the region (or country): The system uses the region code of the identifier to define which resource libraries of the Microsoft .NET Framework to use when it applies region-specific settings, which include the date and time format, the format of numbers (such as the decimal separator and digit grouping), and the writing direction. In the previous example, <tt>US</tt>, <tt>GB</tt>, and <tt>AU</tt> are all ISO codes of the country.

In Acumatica ERP, the translations of the user interface and wiki articles are associated with a locale, and the translations of user input are associated with a language.[anchor|#section_v2q_4c2_jw]
==Adding New Locales to the System==
When Acumatica ERP is installed, one locale (U.S. English) is present by default. You can add other locales on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_50|System Locales] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200550|SM200550]) form. For the detailed procedure, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Add_Locale|To Add a New Locale]. When you activate multiple locales, a user may select his or her preferred locale on the Sign-In page before signing in the system.{br}

A newly added locale is inactive by default, which means the system does not display it in the list of locales on the Sign-In page. For an inactive locale, you can override locale preferences (region-specific settings). Also, you can use the Acumatica ERP translation functionality to translate the interface elements for the locale. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Translation_Process|Translation Process].{br}

After you activate the locale, it becomes available for selection on the Sign-In page. Once a user selects the locale and signs in to Acumatica ERP, the system displays the localized interface and applies the specified locale preferences by using the resource libraries provided for the selected locale by the Microsoft .NET Framework. {br}

Also, you can print localized versions of reports if you have translated the reports&rsquo; strings for the locale you are currently signed in with. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__CON_Usage_of_UserInput_Translations|Use of User Input Translations].{br}

When a user with a right to edit wiki articles is signed in with a locale, he or she can create locale-specific versions of the wiki articles. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Translation_Process#section_nq3_n3l_hw|Translating Wiki Articles] in [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Translation_Process|Translation Process].[anchor|#section_lqy_4c2_jw]
==Enabling Multilingual User Input==
Starting with Acumatica ERP 6, you can translate user input to multiple languages and store translations in the database. For example, you can enter descriptions of General Ledger accounts in multiple languages and then print a localized version of the trial balance report with the descriptions of accounts in the language of the locale you are currently signed in with.{br}

To make this functionality available, you perform the following steps:[anchor|#ul_egb_22j_gw]
#If the needed locales are not defined in the system, you add and activate them on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_50|System Locales] form. For step-by-step instructions, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Add_Locale|To Add a New Locale]. The system retrieves the ISO codes of languages from the locales (active and inactive) and forms the initial list of languages that you will use to define a set of languages to translate user input to.
#:((({S:Warn}The system associates multiple locales with a language if the identifiers of these locales contain the same ISO code of a language. 
)))
# You click the '''Set Up Languages''' button on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_50|System Locales] form toolbar that invokes the '''Languages''' dialog box. In the dialog box, you specify the languages in which you are going to translate user input and define the default language. For details, see the [[#section_vkn_2lm_hw|Setting Up Languages] section in this topic.

Once you have finished making the functionality available, you can translate user input for the boxes that have multi-language support. A link (for example, [anchor|#image_q2f_yvy_jw][image:UserGuide/Images/Translations_box_link.png]) is displayed next to these text boxes in the system. Clicking this link invokes the '''Translations''' dialog box (described in the [HelpRoot_Interface\UIG__CON_TranslationBoxes|Translations Dialog Box] topic of the Interface Guide). You enter translations for each language, close the dialog box, and click '''Save''' on the form toolbar.{br}

You can also add translations for text in the rich text editor (for example, a description of a stock item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form). On the formatting toolbar, you select languages for which you would like to add a translation one after another, enter a translation, and click '''Save''' on the form toolbar.{br}

The translation tool that is described in this section can also be used for translating filter tabs (see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Translate_Filter_Tabs|To Translate Filter Tab Captions]) and generic inquiry elements, such as column captions in the results grid (see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Translate_GI_Column_Captions|To Translate Column Captions for a Generic Inquiry]) and parameter display names (see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Translate_GI_Parameter_Names|To Translate Parameter Display Names for a Generic Inquiry]).{br}

For the list of boxes with this support, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__CON_Boxes_MultiLanguage|Boxes that Have Multi-Language Support]. You can upload translations from a file for those entities (such as account classes, ledgers, and financial periods) that support integration with Excel. You can also import values to these text boxes and export values from them by using integration scenarios. For details, see [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__con_IS_Multi-Language_Fields|Multi-Language Fields in Import and Export Scenarios].[anchor|#section_vkn_2lm_hw]
==Setting Up Languages==
In Acumatica ERP, a language can be marked as the default, an alternative, or not used in the localization of user input. When you specify the default language, multi-language support is enabled for the supported text boxes in the system. The default language and alternative languages form the list of languages for which you can provide translations in the ''' Translations''' dialog box.{br}

To define the set of languages to translate user input to, do the following:[anchor|#ol_jpk_bhg_rw]
#Click the '''Set Up Languages''' button on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_50|System Locales] form toolbar to invoke the '''Languages''' dialog box. The dialog box contains the list of languages, represented by their ISO codes, that the system retrieved from the list of locales (active and inactive).
#In the '''Default Language''' box, select the ISO code of the language that you want to mark as the default. The default language must be associated with an active locale. 
#In the table below the box, select the unlabeled check box for the languages you want to mark as alternatives and clear this check box for those languages that you want to exclude from the localization of user input.
((({S:Warn}If a language is associated with an inactive locale, the system does not display it in the ''' Translations''' dialog box.
)))
Once you apply the settings, in the table on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_50|System Locales] form, you can view which locales are associated with languages that are the default, alternatives, or not used in localization by adding to the table the '''Alternative Language''' and '''Default Language''' columns, which are hidden by default.{br}

After you set up languages, you can proceed with translating user input for the text boxes that have multi-language support.
==Disabling Locales and Multilingual User Input==
If you do not need a particular locale anymore, you can clear the '''Active''' check box for this locale on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_50|System Locales] form. The system then excludes this locale from the list of available locales (the '''Locale''' box) on the following forms:[anchor|#ul_sh2_p2t_jw]
*The Sign-In page
*Report forms
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_03|Notification Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=SM204003|SM204003])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_10_00|Customer Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR201000|AR201000])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_10_00|Vendor Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AP201000|AP201000])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000])

The system stores the translations you have added for the deactivated locale, so you can activate it again and view the associated translations of the user interface and wiki pages.{br}

If you deactivate all the locales but one, the system will not display the '''Locale''' box on the forms listed above.{br}

If you do not need to translate user input in a particular language, you do one of the following by using the '''Set Up Languages''' dialog box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_50|System Locales] form:[anchor|#ul_uzd_5xy_jw]
*If the language was marked as an alternative, you clear the unlabeled check box for the language.
*If the language was marked as the default, you select another language in the '''Default Language''' box and clear the unlabeled check box in the table for those languages that you want to exclude from the localization of user input.

The system stores the translations you have added for the excluded language, so you can activate it again and view the associated translations of the user input.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Locales and Languages  Acumatica ERP provides functionality that you can use to localize the system in multiple languages. You         can maintain the user interface and wikis in multiple languages if you have multiple         locales. The default locale of  Acumatica ERP is U.S. English.  Localization includes the usage of locale-specific settings and the translation of the         strings used on the application interface. Starting with  Acumatica ERP 6, you can translate user input to multiple languages and store translations in the         database. In this topic, you will read about how locales and languages are handled in the system. Understanding Locales and Languages  Acumatica ERP uses the list of locales provided by Microsoft.NET. In most cases, a locale identifier         has two parts: The ISO code of the language: The system retrieves the language code from the locale           identifier to create a new entity language and associates the language with the locale.           Note that the system associates multiple locales with a language if the identifiers of           these locales contain the same ISO code of a language. For example, the              en-US ,  en-GB , and  en-AU  locales           are all associated with English, the language whose ISO code is  en .              You can use these languages to localize user input. The translations can be further             used for printing reports and documents. For details, see  Enabling Multilingual User Input Enabling Multilingual User Input. The ISO code of the region (or country): The system uses the region code of the           identifier to define which resource libraries of the Microsoft .NET Framework to use when           it applies region-specific settings, which include the date and time format, the format of           numbers (such as the decimal separator and digit grouping), and the writing direction. In           the previous example,  US ,  GB , and              AU  are all ISO codes of the country. In  Acumatica ERP, the translations of the user interface and wiki articles are associated with a locale,         and the translations of user input are associated with a language. Adding New Locales to the System When  Acumatica ERP is installed, one locale (U.S. English) is present by default. You can add other locales         on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200550|SM200550]) System Locales (SM200550) form. For the detailed procedure, see            To Add a New Locale. When you activate multiple locales, a user may         select his or her preferred locale on the Sign-In page before signing in the system. A newly added locale is inactive by default, which means the system does not display it in         the list of locales on the Sign-In page. For an inactive locale, you can override locale         preferences (region-specific settings). Also, you can use the  Acumatica ERP translation functionality to translate the interface elements for the locale. For         details, see  Translation Process. After you activate the locale, it becomes available for selection on the Sign-In page.         Once a user selects the locale and signs in to  Acumatica ERP, the system displays the localized interface and applies the specified locale preferences         by using the resource libraries provided for the selected locale by the Microsoft .NET         Framework.  Also, you can print localized versions of reports if you have translated the reports'         strings for the locale you are currently signed in with. For details, see  Use of User Input Translations. When a user with a right to edit wiki articles is signed in with a locale, he or she can         create locale-specific versions of the wiki articles. For details, see  Translating Wiki Articles in  Translation Process. Enabling Multilingual User Input Starting with  Acumatica ERP 6, you can translate user input to multiple languages and store translations in the         database. For example, you can enter descriptions of General Ledger accounts in multiple         languages and then print a localized version of the trial balance report with the         descriptions of accounts in the language of the locale you are currently signed in with. To make this functionality available, you perform the following steps: If the needed locales are not defined in the system, you add and activate them on the               ([~/?ScreenId=SM200550|SM200550]) System Locales form. For step-by-step instructions, see  To Add a New Locale. The system retrieves the ISO codes of languages from           the locales (active and inactive) and forms the initial list of languages that you will           use to define a set of languages to translate user input to. The system associates             multiple locales with a language if the identifiers of these locales contain the same             ISO code of a language.   You click the  Set Up Languages  button on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200550|SM200550]) System Locales form toolbar that invokes the  Languages            dialog box. In the dialog box, you specify the languages in which you are going to           translate user input and define the default language. For details, see the  Setting Up Languages Setting Up Languages section           in this topic. Once you have finished making the functionality available, you can translate user input for         the boxes that have multi-language support. A link (for example,  ) is displayed         next to these text boxes in the system. Clicking this link invokes the            Translations  dialog box (described in the  Translations Dialog Box topic of the Interface Guide).         You enter translations for each language, close the dialog box, and click  Save  on the         form toolbar. You can also add translations for text in the rich text editor (for example, a description         of a stock item on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form). On         the formatting toolbar, you select languages for which you would like to add a translation         one after another, enter a translation, and click  Save  on the form toolbar. The translation tool that is described in this section can also be used for translating         filter tabs (see  To Translate Filter Tab Captions) and generic inquiry         elements, such as column captions in the results grid (see  To Translate Column Captions for a Generic Inquiry) and parameter display names (see  To Translate Parameter Display Names for a Generic Inquiry). For the list of boxes with this support, see  Boxes that Have Multi-Language Support. You can upload translations from a file for those entities (such as account classes,         ledgers, and financial periods) that support integration with Excel. You can also import         values to these text boxes and export values from them by using integration scenarios. For         details, see  Multi-Language Fields in Import and Export Scenarios. Setting Up Languages In  Acumatica ERP, a language can be marked as the default, an alternative, or not used in the localization         of user input. When you specify the default language, multi-language support is enabled for         the supported text boxes in the system. The default language and alternative languages form         the list of languages for which you can provide translations in the             Translations  dialog box. To define the set of languages to translate user input to, do the following: Click the  Set Up Languages  button on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200550|SM200550]) System Locales form toolbar to invoke the  Languages            dialog box. The dialog box contains the list of languages, represented by their ISO codes,           that the system retrieved from the list of locales (active and inactive). In the  Default Language  box, select the ISO code of the language           that you want to mark as the default. The default language must be associated with an           active locale.  In the table below the box, select the unlabeled check box for the languages you want to           mark as alternatives and clear this check box for those languages that you want to exclude           from the localization of user input. If a language is associated with an inactive locale, the system does not display it in         the   Translations  dialog box. Once you apply the settings, in the table on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200550|SM200550]) System Locales form, you         can view which locales are associated with languages that are the default, alternatives, or         not used in localization by adding to the table the  Alternative           Language  and  Default Language  columns, which are hidden         by default. After you set up languages, you can proceed with translating user input for the text boxes         that have multi-language support. Disabling Locales and Multilingual User Input If you do not need a particular locale anymore, you can clear the            Active  check box for this locale on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200550|SM200550]) System Locales form. The system then excludes this locale from the list of         available locales (the  Locale  box) on the following forms: The Sign-In page Report forms  ([~/?ScreenId=SM204003|SM204003]) Notification Templates (SM204003)  ([~/?ScreenId=AR201000|AR201000]) Customer Classes (AR201000)  ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000)  ([~/?ScreenId=AP201000|AP201000]) Vendor Classes (AP201000)  ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors (AP303000) The system stores the translations you have added for the deactivated locale, so you can         activate it again and view the associated translations of the user interface and wiki         pages. If you deactivate all the locales but one, the system will not display the            Locale  box on the forms listed above. If you do not need to translate user input in a particular language, you do one of the         following by using the  Set Up Languages  dialog box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200550|SM200550]) System Locales form: If the language was marked as an alternative, you clear the unlabeled check box for the           language. If the language was marked as the default, you select another language in the              Default Language  box and clear the unlabeled check box in the           table for those languages that you want to exclude from the localization of user           input. The system stores the translations you have added for the excluded language, so you can         activate it again and view the associated translations of the user input. ]]></column>

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Boxes that Have Multi-Language Support Once you have enabled multilingual user input, the system displays a link with a language         ISO code next to the supported text boxes in the system. When you click the link, the            Translations  dialog box appears, where you can enter translations.         For a description of the dialog box, see  Translations Dialog Box. By default, the system supports multilingual user input for the boxes listed in this topic.         You can expand this list by means of customization. Also, if the            PXDBString  attribute for a box from the list was customized in the         earlier versions, after upgrade to  Acumatica ERP 6 the box will not have multi-language support.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
Starting with Acumatica ERP 6, you can translate user input for multiple text boxes in the system. That is, you can maintain your data in multiple languages. These data translations can later be used in printed reports and documents.{br}

In this topic, you will read about how to print reports and documents, how to send notifications in the language preferred by the customer or vendor, and how the system searches for translations.{br}{TOC}[anchor|#section_qbt_bkm_jw]
==Printing Localized Reports==
If you have enabled multilingual user input and provided translations for the fields that supply data to a report, you can prepare a fully localized report—that is, a report whose strings (headers and footers) and data are localized. By default, the system prepares a report in the language associated with the locale you used to sign in. You can override this locale by specifying another locale on a report form in the '''Locale''' box.{br}

Before you prepare a localized report, you should make sure that all of the following preliminary steps have been completed:[anchor|#ol_kqb_h1b_bx]
#All the needed locales are added and activated on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_50|System Locales] form. For step-by-step instructions, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Add_Locale|To Add a New Locale]. 
#Multilingual user input is set up, as described in [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__CON_Locales_and_Languages#section_lqy_4c2_jw|Enabling Multilingual User Input].
#The user interface is localized, including reports. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Translation_Process|Translation Process] in the System Administration Guide and [HelpRoot_ReportingTools\Translating_Reports|Translating Reports] in the Acumatica Report Designer Guide.
#There are translations for the fields that supply data to the report.

Once you have finished, you can prepare a fully localized report as follows:[anchor|#ol_i1q_crg_rw]
#You select the needed locale in the '''Locale''' box on the report form.
#You run the report. 
#:The system prints the localized version of the report, where the report&rsquo;s strings and report&rsquo;s data are translated to the language of the locale you have selected on the report form.

If you have not selected a locale on the report form, the system prepares the report in the language of the locale you are currently signed in with.((({S:Warn}A user may specify a locale while constructing a report by using the Report Designer. The locale setting from the Report Designer overrides the locale you used to sign in, but not the locale you specified in the '''Locale''' box on the report form.
)))
For example, suppose that your company utilizes two locales: <tt>en-US</tt> and <tt>fr-CA</tt>. English is set up as the default language, and French is the alternative language. Some of the company&rsquo;s personnel speak English and some speak French. Also, the company&rsquo;s data—such as descriptions of GL accounts and descriptions in inventory items—is maintained in two languages. {br}

Further suppose that a user who prefers working under the English locale needs to prepare a report in French for his or her French-speaking manager. The user opens the report form, selects the French locale in the '''Locale''' box, and runs the report. The system prepares the report in French, regardless of the locale the user is currently signed in with.
==Printing Localized Documents==
You can associate a locale with a customer or vendor. If you do, with the enabled multilingual user input, when you create a document for this customer or vendor and add a document line with an inventory item, the system does the following:[anchor|#ul_zqc_bb3_nw]
*Populates the column with descriptions of inventory items in the language specified for the customer or vendor
*Applies to the document the region-specific settings defined for the locale you are currently signed in with
*Populates the boxes for which translations are available with the values in the language of the locale you used to sign in

For example, suppose that you work under the <tt>en-US</tt> locale. You associate a customer with some French locale, such as <tt>fr-CA</tt>, and enter translations of inventory item descriptions in French. Then you create an invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form, select the customer, and add an inventory item. The system populates the descriptions of credit terms, GL accounts and subaccounts, taxes, and the payment method of the customer in English. But the system populates the '''Transaction Descr.''' column with the item description in French. When you release the invoice, this item description in French is posted to the ledger as the GL transaction description.((({S:Warn}The system supports the described behavior for documents that you create on the following forms: [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_40_00|Quick Checks] ([~/?ScreenId=AP304000|AP304000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_40_00|Cash Sales] ([~/?ScreenId=AR304000|AR304000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]), and [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]).
)))
You may frequently need to print reports that are versions of documents created in Acumatica ERP, as with the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\AR_64_10_00|Invoice/Memo] ([~/?ScreenId=AR641000|AR641000]) and [HelpRoot_ReportReference\SO_64_10_10|Sales Order] ([~/?ScreenId=SO641010|SO641010]) reports. {br}

You can initiate the printing of a document directly from its entry form. If you are signed in with the locale that is specified for the customer or vendor and you have translated the strings of the report for this locale, the system will print a fully localized document. Otherwise, the system will print the document with only the description of the inventory items in a customer&rsquo;s preferred language.{br}

For example, suppose that a customer wants to receive sales orders in French. You should perform the following steps:[anchor|#ol_mgt_2wg_rw]
#Make sure that the strings of the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\SO_64_10_10|Sales Order] ([~/?ScreenId=SO641010|SO641010]) report, which corresponds to sales orders created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, are translated in French.
#Make sure that descriptions of inventory items, taxes, and credit and shipping terms have French translations.
#Specify <tt>fr-CA</tt> as the customer&rsquo;s locale. 
#Sign in with the <tt>fr-CA</tt> locale, and create a sales order for the customer on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form.
# Initiate printing of the sales order by using '''Reports''' > '''Print Sales Order/Quote''', and the system opens the ready-to-print sales order in French.

Also, you can print a document by using the corresponding report form. On the report form, you select the reference number of the document, specify locale of the customer or vendor in the '''Locale''' box, and run the report. The system opens the ready-to-print document in the language of the locale you have specified. For details, see the previous section in this topic. 
==Sending Localized Notifications==
Multilingual user input can also be used in correspondence you send to your customers and vendors by means of Acumatica ERP mailings, which are described in detail in [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__MNG_Notifications|Managing Mailings]. Starting with Acumatica ERP 6, you can specify a locale for a notification template. The system uses the assigned locale to apply region-specific settings to the text, dates, and digits in the body of the notification template. The system also retrieves the translations of the values needed to replace the placeholders in the body according to the language of the locale. {br}

If you want to send mailings in the language preferred by a customer or a vendor, you need to set up the system as follows:[anchor|#ol_ihn_ffh_kw]
#You create a dedicated notification template on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_03|Notification Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=SM204003|SM204003]) and specify the locale of the needed language in the '''Locale''' box. You also compose the notification text in the language of the locale. For details on creating a notification template, see [HelpRoot_Administration\EM__con_Notification_Templates|Notification Templates].
#If you want to send a document as an attachment, you create a dedicated report for this document type—for example, a copy of the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\AR_64_10_00|Invoice/Memo] ([~/?ScreenId=AR641000|AR641000]) report—by using the Report Designer. You enter the strings of the report (headers and footers) in the same language that you used to compose the notification and, in the report settings, specify the same locale as you specified for the notification template. For details, see [HelpRoot_ReportingTools\Creating_and_Modifying_the_Reports|Creating and Modifying the Reports] in the Acumatica Report Designer Guide.[anchor|#li_qdx_gjh_kw]
#You group the customers or vendors who prefer the same language to one customer or vendor class. For this class, you specify a locale that is associated with the language in the '''Locale''' box of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_10_00|Customer Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR201000|AR201000]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_10_00|Vendor Classes] (AP2010100) form. 
#:((({S:Warn}The system will assign the locale to the new customer or vendor accounts automatically when you select the customer or vendor class for the account on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form. For existing vendors and customers, you need to manually select the preferred locale for each account.
)))
#You configure the mailing settings for the customer or vendor class on the '''Mailing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_10_00|Customer Classes] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_10_00|Vendor Classes] form. For a mailing, you specify the notification template and report you have created.
#:((({S:Warn}The customer or vendor class provides the default settings for the customer or vendor accounts of the class, but you can override these default settings to make the mailing configuration more specific. Mailings modified for specific accounts on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] form are marked by the system as overridden (that is, the '''Overridden''' check box is selected on the form). If you change the configuration of a mailing for a customer or vendor class, these changes affect the mailings of all customer or vendor accounts of this class, except those mailings that were modified specifically for a customer or vendor account (overridden).
)))

Once you have performed these configuration steps, when you initiate emailing by using a mass processing form or the corresponding action on an entry form, the system does the following:[anchor|#ul_df3_zmj_nw]
#Generates emails from the notification template you have created in the preferred language and specified for the customer or vendor on the '''Mailing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] form.
#Applies region-specific settings to each email body.
#Replaces any placeholders with the corresponding translations (if placeholders are used for the values for which translations are available).
#Attaches the report that you have created in the preferred language and specified for the customer or vendor on the '''Mailing Settings''' tab.

As a result, customers and vendors receive notifications in their preferred languages.[anchor|#_847db9a7-b760-4bef-a7b2-8ebeb3e05ff3]
==Troubleshooting User Input Translations==
Once you have entered translations for multiple boxes that have multi-language support and you start using these translations in documents or reports, you may realize that some translations are missing. In most cases, this means that you have not entered a translation, and the system is displaying the value entered for the default language or another alternative language. The system searches for a translation as follows:[anchor|#ol_cwc_q21_kw]
#If a locale is specified for the applicable customer, vendor, or report, the system searches for a translation available for the language of the locale. If this translation is available, the system ends the search and displays the translation.
#If a translation for the language of the locale assigned to the customer, vendor, or report is not available or a locale is not specified for these entities, the system searches for a translation specified for the language of the locale you used to sign in. If a translation for the locale language is available, the system ends the search and displays the translation.
#If a translation for the locale language is not available, the system searches for a translation specified for the language selected as the default on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_50|System Locales] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200550|SM200550]) form. If a translation for the default language is available, the system ends the search and displays the translation.
#If the translation for the default language is not available, the system searches for a translation specified for any language selected as an alternative on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_50|System Locales] form, in the sequence specified for alternative languages in the '''Sequence''' column on this form. If a translation for some alternative language is available, the system ends the search and displays the translation.
#If no translation is available, the system displays an empty value. 

When the system displays a translation of a value in a box with multi-language support, it always displays the ISO code of the corresponding language on the right side of the box.

Further suppose that a user who prefers working under the English locale needs to prepare a     report in French for his or her French-speaking manager. The user opens the report form, selects     the French locale in the  Locale  box, and runs the report. The system     prepares the report in French, regardless of the locale the user is currently signed in     with. Printing Localized Documents You can associate a locale with a customer or vendor. If you do, with the enabled multilingual     user input, when you create a document for this customer or vendor and add a document line with     an inventory item, the system does the following: Populates the column with descriptions of inventory items in the language specified for the      customer or vendor Applies to the document the region-specific settings defined for the locale you are      currently signed in with Populates the boxes for which translations are available with the values in the language of      the locale you used to sign in For example, suppose that you work under the  en-US  locale. You associate a customer     with some French locale, such as  fr-CA , and enter translations of inventory item     descriptions in French. Then you create an invoice on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos     (AR301000) form, select the customer, and add an inventory item. The system populates the     descriptions of credit terms, GL accounts and subaccounts, taxes, and the payment method of the     customer in English. But the system populates the  Transaction Descr.      column with the item description in French. When you release the invoice, this item description     in French is posted to the ledger as the GL transaction description. The system supports the described behavior for documents that you create on the following     forms:   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000),   ([~/?ScreenId=AP304000|AP304000]) Quick Checks     (AP304000),   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000),   ([~/?ScreenId=AR304000|AR304000]) Cash Sales     (AR304000),   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000), and   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000). You may frequently need to print reports that are versions of documents created in  Acumatica ERP,     as with the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR641000|AR641000]) Invoice/Memo (AR641000) and   ([~/?ScreenId=SO641010|SO641010]) Sales Order(SO641010) reports.  You can initiate the printing of a document directly from its entry form. If you are signed in     with the locale that is specified for the customer or vendor and you have translated the strings     of the report for this locale, the system will print a fully localized document. Otherwise, the     system will print the document with only the description of the inventory items in a customer's     preferred language. For example, suppose that a customer wants to receive sales orders in French. You should     perform the following steps: Make sure that the strings of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO641010|SO641010]) Sales Order (SO641010) report,      which corresponds to sales orders created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000)      form, are translated in French. Make sure that descriptions of inventory items, taxes, and credit and shipping terms have      French translations. Specify  fr-CA  as the customer's locale.  Sign in with the  fr-CA  locale, and create a sales order for the customer on the         ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders form.  Initiate printing of the sales order by using  Reports Print Sales Order/Quote , and the system opens the ready-to-print sales order in French. Also, you can print a document by using the corresponding report form. On the report form, you     select the reference number of the document, specify locale of the customer or vendor in the       Locale  box, and run the report. The system opens the ready-to-print     document in the language of the locale you have specified. For details, see the previous section     in this topic.  Sending Localized Notifications Multilingual user input can also be used in correspondence you send to your customers and     vendors by means of  Acumatica ERP     mailings, which are described in detail in  Managing Mailings. Starting     with  Acumatica ERP     6, you can specify a locale for a notification template. The system uses the assigned locale to     apply region-specific settings to the text, dates, and digits in the body of the notification     template. The system also retrieves the translations of the values needed to replace the     placeholders in the body according to the language of the locale.  If you want to send mailings in the language preferred by a customer or a vendor, you need to     set up the system as follows: You create a dedicated notification template on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM204003|SM204003]) Notification Templates      (SM204000) and specify the locale of the needed language in the        Locale  box. You also compose the notification text in the language of      the locale. For details on creating a notification template, see  Notification Templates. If you want to send a document as an attachment, you create a dedicated report for this      document type—for example, a copy of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR641000|AR641000]) Invoice/Memo (AR641000)      report—by using the Report Designer. You enter the strings of the report (headers and      footers) in the same language that you used to compose the notification and, in the report      settings, specify the same locale as you specified for the notification template. For details,      see  Creating and Modifying the Reports in the Acumatica      Report Designer Guide. You group the customers or vendors who prefer the same language to one      customer or vendor class. For this class, you specify a locale that is associated with the      language in the  Locale  box of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR201000|AR201000]) Customer Classes (AR201000) or   ([~/?ScreenId=AP201000|AP201000]) Vendor Classes (AP2010100) form.  The system will assign the       locale to the new customer or vendor accounts automatically when you select the customer or       vendor class for the account on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000)       or   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors (AP303000) form. For existing vendors and       customers, you need to manually select the preferred locale for each account. You configure the mailing settings for the customer or vendor class on the        Mailing Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR201000|AR201000]) Customer Classes or   ([~/?ScreenId=AP201000|AP201000]) Vendor Classes form. For a mailing, you specify the      notification template and report you have created. The customer or vendor class provides       the default settings for the customer or vendor accounts of the class, but you can override       these default settings to make the mailing configuration more specific. Mailings modified for       specific accounts on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers or   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors form are marked by the system as overridden (that is,       the  Overridden  check box is selected on the form). If you change the       configuration of a mailing for a customer or vendor class, these changes affect the mailings       of all customer or vendor accounts of this class, except those mailings that were modified       specifically for a customer or vendor account (overridden). Once you have performed these configuration steps, when you initiate emailing by using a mass     processing form or the corresponding action on an entry form, the system does the following: Generates emails from the notification template you have created in the preferred language      and specified for the customer or vendor on the  Mailing Settings  tab of      the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers or   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors form. Applies region-specific settings to each email body. Replaces any placeholders with the corresponding translations (if placeholders are used for      the values for which translations are available). Attaches the report that you have created in the preferred language and specified for the      customer or vendor on the  Mailing Settings  tab. As a result, customers and vendors receive notifications in their preferred languages. Troubleshooting User Input Translations Once you have entered translations for multiple boxes that have multi-language support and you     start using these translations in documents or reports, you may realize that some translations     are missing. In most cases, this means that you have not entered a translation, and the system     is displaying the value entered for the default language or another alternative language. The     system searches for a translation as follows: If a locale is specified for the applicable customer, vendor, or report, the system searches      for a translation available for the language of the locale. If this translation is available,      the system ends the search and displays the translation. If a translation for the language of the locale assigned to the customer, vendor, or report      is not available or a locale is not specified for these entities, the system searches for a      translation specified for the language of the locale you used to sign in. If a translation for      the locale language is available, the system ends the search and displays the translation. If a translation for the locale language is not available, the system searches for a      translation specified for the language selected as the default on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200550|SM200550]) System Locales (SM200550) form. If a translation for the default      language is available, the system ends the search and displays the translation. If the translation for the default language is not available, the system searches for a      translation specified for any language selected as an alternative on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200550|SM200550]) System Locales form, in the sequence specified for alternative      languages in the  Sequence  column on this form. If a translation for some      alternative language is available, the system ends the search and displays the      translation. If no translation is available, the system displays an empty value.  When the system displays a translation of a value in a box with multi-language support, it     always displays the ISO code of the corresponding language on the right side of the box. ]]></column>

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
 Acumatica ERP provides built-in localization functionality, so you can easily translate Acumatica ERP into any language without using third-party products. You can collect the strings used in the whole system or on a particular form, and translate them for any locale available in Acumatica ERP. {br}

This topic explains how to translate interface strings by using the built-in localization functionality of Acumatica ERP. {br}{TOC}
==Translating Application Strings==
In Acumatica ERP, various strings that are used on the application interface—such as element and column labels, error messages, and warnings—are stored within the code. Hence, the translation of the strings includes two steps: collecting strings and translating strings. {br}

During the string collection process, the system gathers the strings used in the system (including the strings in customized system elements, such as forms) and prepares a string collection for translation. You can collect all strings in the system or the strings bound to particular forms. Because the collection process is resource- and time-consuming, we recommend that you perform string collection on the whole system after you install the system and after updates to collect the new and updated strings. For details, see [[#section_rp3_5bc_gw|Collecting the Strings for Translation].{br}

Translation of the collected strings from U.S. English, which is used as the Acumatica ERP default language, to any other language can be performed directly in Acumatica ERP. Alternatively, the filtered list of strings may be exported to an Excel file, and imported back after being translated somewhere else. For more information, see [[#section_r5w_5bc_gw|Translating Strings].{br}

After you finish translating strings on the interface, when a user signs in to the system and selects a local language, the application will use strings translated to this language. For the strings that are not translated, the system will display the string value in the default language (U.S. English).[anchor|#section_rp3_5bc_gw]
==Collecting the Strings for Translation==
Source strings include element labels, toolbar and menu items, drop-down list options, error messages, dialog box captions, and form names. When you localize the system for the first time or after you update your instance, you should collect all the strings used in the system for translation as follows:[anchor|#ul_xw4_34m_vs]
*Click '''Collect Strings''' on the form toolbar on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) form.

If any system functionality is updated or customized in your system that was previously localized, you can collect the new strings used on a particular form (or multiple forms) for translation. To collect these strings, you should create a translation set that includes only the required forms, and then collect the strings used on these forms for translation on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_21_15_00|Translation Sets] ([~/?ScreenId=SM211500|SM211500]) form. For the detailed procedures, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Translation_Sets_Add|To Add a New Translation Set] and [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Translation_Sets_Collect|To Collect the Strings of a Translation Set]. {br}

You can also collect strings from multiple translation sets at once by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_51_15_00|Collect Translation Sets] ([~/?ScreenId=SM511500|SM511500]) form. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Translation_Sets_Collect_Multiple|To Collect Strings of Multiple Translation Sets].{br}

If you are collecting strings that were previously translated and if any of these strings has not been found during the new collection process, the system marks these strings as obsolete and displays them on the '''Obsolete''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] form. ((({S:Hint}String collection is a time-consuming operation that should be performed during off-peak hours and never attempted on a busy production system.
)))[anchor|#section_r5w_5bc_gw]
==Translating Strings==
Generally, translating strings is a straightforward process: In the '''Default Values''' table of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) form, type the translation for each string that must be translated in the ''&lt;Target Language&gt;'' column and select the '''Do Not Translate''' check box for each string that does not require translation. When you&rsquo;re finished, click '''Save'''. The fully translated (that is, translated into all languages defined in the system) strings and the strings that do not require translation are hidden from the '''Default Values''' table. {br}

Despite the simplicity, the translation process has its own particularities in how you filter strings to be translated and in what you translate or not. {br}

First of all, the strings you see on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] form are filtered in any case: You can see either ''bound'' or ''unbound'' strings. Bound strings are the strings associated with system resources bound to forms, such as table names. Unbound strings are the strings associated with resources that are not bound to forms, such as prompts. To translate all the strings on the interface, you should translate both the bound and unbound strings. The type of strings displayed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] depends on the '''Show Only Unbound''' check box in the Selection area of this form as follows:[anchor|#ul_x1p_gz3_5s]
*If the check box is cleared, the system displays only bound strings. For any bound string, you can get the context of the string: By using the '''Usage Details''' dialog box, you can view the list of forms on which you can find the string and quickly navigate to any form in the list.
*:((({S:Warn}In Acumatica ERP, the contents of a form may be content-related and may depend on system configuration and on selections on the form itself. If you don&rsquo;t see the string immediately, you can check the corresponding reference topic in help.
)))
*:Additionally, you can select a form in the '''Show Used in UI''' box in the Selection area of the form to view and translate only strings that are associated with the resources of the selected form.
*If the check box is selected, the system displays only unbound strings. Additionally, you can select which type (or types) of the unbound resources you want to view and translate.

To further narrow the displayed strings, you can use table filtering, described in detail in the [HelpRoot_Interface\IB_Filters|Filters] chapter of the Acumatica ERP Interface Guide.{br}

The next particularity of the translation process relates to the contents of the source values of strings. If you open the list of collected strings, you will see that strings include the text itself and may include special formatting. The examples of the special formatting include the following:[anchor|#ul_zwy_ltd_vs]
*The ''-&gt;'' character: For commands in lists, the ''-&gt;'' character separates the name of the list from the command (for example, ''State -&gt; Completed''; the ''State -&gt;'' part of the string is for informational purposes only). You should translate only the text after the ''-&gt;'' sign.
*HTML tags: Strings may include HTML tags that define the formatting of the string. For example, ''&lt;B&gt;'' and ''&lt;/B&gt;'' tags indicate that the enclosed text should be in bold type. You should keep these tags in the translated text in their respective places to keep the formatting.
*Placeholders that use the ''&rsquo;&#0123;&lt;number&gt;&#0125;&rsquo;'' format: These placeholders are replaced with text when a user who works with the document gets the message. You should copy the placeholders without changes in the respective places in the translation.
*The ''~'' (tilde) character: When a message that you want to translate contains multiline text, the end of each line is indicated by the ''~'' character. You should use the tilde in the translated multiline text to mark the ends of lines.
*:((({S:Warn}If you do not mark the ends of lines with tildes in the translated text, the message will be displayed as one line for messages translated directly in Acumatica ERP, or the translation of this text will not be imported for messages translated in an external file (for example, in a Microsoft Excel workbook).
)))
*The special wrapper {{[a type=ACTION][/a]}}: This wrapper is used along with messages that the system displays in tables when the table is empty. It converts the text into a hyperlink. When a user clicks this link, the system performs the action specified in the wrapper (such as {{clear}}). You should keep this wrapper in the translated text in its initial place to keep the formatting and the action.

One additional particularity is related to handling strings that should not be translated. In terms of the effect on the UI, there is no difference between a string with the '''Do Not Translate''' check box selected, and a string left untranslated and with the '''Do Not Translate''' check box cleared: Either way, the user will see the value of the string in the default language. However, based on whether you select this check box, these strings are processed differently:[anchor|#_b1b40b1b-7b8d-4ddb-9881-7b6ff0f2faca]
*A string with the '''Do Not Translate''' check box selected is hidden from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] form until you select the '''Show Excluded''' check box. Additionally, such strings are considered valid when you try to validate translation of strings on forms.
*A string that is not translated and for which with the '''Do Not Translate''' check box is cleared appears on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] form when you select a language for translation. Also, such strings are considered invalid and warnings about these strings appear on the form when you try to validate string translation on forms. 
*:((({S:Warn}For more information on validation of translation of strings, see the '''Reviewing the Translations on Forms''' section in this topic.
)))

For the detailed procedures, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Translate_Bound_Strings|To Translate Bound Strings], [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Translate_Unbound_Strings|To Translate Unbound Strings], and [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Translate_Exclude|To Exclude Strings from Translation].{br}

After you add translations for a string in all the languages defined in the system or mark a string as not requiring translation and save the result, the string is removed from the work area. You can see the fully translated strings and the excluded strings by selecting the '''Show Localized''' and '''Show Excluded''' check boxes, respectively, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] form. 
==Handling Multiple Occurrences of the Same String==
A string—such as an element label or a drop-down list option that is available on multiple forms—may be used in the interface multiple times. Depending on the context, the same string may require different translation. To address this situation, Acumatica ERP shows the resource or resources the string is associated with for each string listed in the '''Default Values''' table of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) form. These resources, which are displayed in the '''Key-Specific Values''' table, indicate the entities in which specific string is used. You can provide correct translations for each occurrence of the string depending on its context. ((({S:Warn}If you want to provide specific translations for different occurrences of a string, you must provide a generic translation in the '''Default Values''' table.
)))
The translation you specify in the '''Default Values''' table is generally applied to all occurrences of the string automatically. But if you specify specific translations for certain occurrences in the '''Key-Specific Values''' table, the system will use the specific translations. 
==Reviewing the Translations on Forms==
To check if all the strings on a form are translated into a language defined in the system, you can turn on validation of translations on forms for the language on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_50|System Locales] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200550|SM200550]) form. For the detailed procedure, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Activate_Validation|To Turn On Validation of Translations].{br}

With the validation active, when you sign in with the language and open a form that has untranslated strings, you see a warning with the quantity of the untranslated strings appear at the top of the form. ((({S:Warn}The warnings appear for all users of the system who sign in with the language.
)))
You can click the warning to expand the list. Each warning includes the type and the details of the resource with which the untranslated string is associated, and a link to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) form. You can click the link to quickly open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] form with the locale of the untranslated string selected, and then find and translate the string. ((({S:Warn}The strings with the '''Do Not Translate''' check box selected on the '''Collected''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] form are considered valid and are not listed in the warning.
)))
After you translate all strings into a language and validate the translations, you can turn off the validation of translations, as described in [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Deactivate_Validation|To Turn Off Validation of Translations].
==Exporting and Importing Strings==
You can export strings, translate them by using third-party applications, and import back into Acumatica ERP. Translated strings are loaded into the system as a locale dictionary and are immediately applied to the user interface once a user signs into the system using a specific locale. {br}

You can also import the file with the translations into a new instance to speed up the translation process. The new instance should have the locales translations that you want to import. ((({S:Warn}If the imported file includes strings that were not collected in the instance, these strings will be imported as unbound strings. This happens because the system is not able to reinstate the bounds between the forms and the system resources associated with the imported strings. Such strings are displayed on the interface similarly to the way other unbound strings are displayed, and you won&rsquo;t be able to use the '''Usage Details''' dialog box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) to quickly view the forms the strings are used on.
)))
To export and import strings, use the corresponding buttons on the table toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] form. ((({S:Warn}The exported file includes only the strings displayed in the table, based on the filtering applied on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] form.
)))
==Correcting Translations==
At any time during the translation process you may need to change the translation of a string—for example, to correct a typo. You can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) form to correct the translation. The steps to correct the translation depend on the string whose translation you want to correct:[anchor|#ul_vhj_rkj_5s]
*If the string has not been fully translated, use the filtering options to find it and correct the translation.
*If the string has been fully translated and is hidden on the form, select the '''Show Localized''' check box to make the fully translated strings appear on the '''Collected''' tab, and then find the string and correct the translation.
*If the string has been wrongly marked as not requiring translation, select the '''Show Excluded''' check box to make the strings that do not require translation appear on the '''Collected''' tab, and then find the string and clear the '''Show Excluded''' check box.

If you know when the translation has been added or modified, you can use filtering to view only strings with translations added and modified after the date by specifying the dates in the '''Created Since''' and '''Modified After''' boxes, respectively.
==Updating Translations==
Sometimes the values of particular strings change. For example, this may happen if the functionality of a form is changed during an update of your Acumatica ERP instance or if a customization has been applied to a form by the customizers in-house. When you collect strings, if any of the previously translated strings have not been found during the new collection process, these strings are considered obsolete and displayed on the '''Obsolete''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) form. Strings with new values appear on the '''Collected''' tab as untranslated strings.((({S:Warn}We recommend that you collect all strings in the system by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] form after every update of your Acumatica ERP instance.
)))
If any functionality is updated or customized in the system regularly, you may need to regularly collect the strings from the appropriate forms for translation. To do that, you should create a translation set in which you include a required form or forms by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_21_15_00|Translation Sets] ([~/?ScreenId=SM211500|SM211500]) form, and then add these sets to a schedule for automatic collection. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Scheduled_Processing|Scheduled Processing].[anchor|#section_nq3_n3l_hw]
==Translating Wiki Articles==
The Help wiki is created in the base language of Acumatica ERP, U.S. English. For a newly added locale, all articles will be displayed in this base language until you create locale-specific versions of the articles. For the detailed procedure, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Translate_Wiki_Article|To Create a Localized Version of an Article].{br}

After you translate an article, only the versions of the article created in the selected locale will be listed on the '''History''' tab when you open the article in [HelpRoot_FormReference\DM__con_Wiki_Wiki_Editor_Form_for_Articles|Wiki Editor Form for Articles]. {br}

For more information about wikis in Acumatica ERP, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__mng_Wikis|Managing Wikis].

You can collect the strings 				used in the whole system or on a particular form, and translate them for any locale 				available in  Acumatica ERP.  This topic explains how to translate interface strings by using the built-in 				localization functionality of  Acumatica ERP.  Translating Application Strings In  Acumatica ERP, various strings that are used on the application interface—such as element and 				column labels, error messages, and warnings—are stored within the code. Hence, the 				translation of the strings includes two steps: collecting strings and translating 				strings.  During the string collection process, the system gathers the strings used in the 				system (including the strings in customized system elements, such as forms) and 				prepares a string collection for translation. You can collect all strings in the 				system or the strings bound to particular forms. Because the collection process is 				resource- and time-consuming, we recommend that you perform string collection on the 				whole system after you install the system and after updates to collect the new and 				updated strings. For details, see  Collecting the Strings for Translation Collecting the Strings for Translation. Translation of the collected strings from U.S. English, which is used as the  Acumatica ERP default language, to any other language can be performed directly in  Acumatica ERP. Alternatively, the filtered list of strings may be exported to an Excel file, 				and imported back after being translated somewhere else. For more information, see 					 Translating Strings Translating Strings. After you finish translating strings on the interface, when a user signs in to the 				system and selects a local language, the application will use strings translated to 				this language. For the strings that are not translated, the system will display the 				string value in the default language (U.S. English). Collecting the Strings for Translation Source strings include element labels, toolbar and menu items, drop-down list 				options, error messages, dialog box captions, and form names. When you localize the 				system for the first time or after you update your instance, you should collect all 				the strings used in the system for translation as follows: Click  Collect Strings  on the form toolbar on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries (SM200540) form. If any system functionality is updated or customized in your system that was previously 				localized, you can collect the new strings used on a particular form (or multiple 				forms) for translation. To collect these strings, you should create a translation 				set that includes only the required forms, and then collect the strings used on 				these forms for translation on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM211500|SM211500]) Translation Sets (SM211500) 				form. For the detailed procedures, see  To Add a New Translation Set and  To Collect the Strings of a Translation Set.  You can also collect strings from multiple translation sets at once by using the 					  ([~/?ScreenId=SM511500|SM511500]) Collect Translation Sets (SM511500) form. For details, see  To Collect Strings of Multiple Translation Sets. If you are collecting strings that were previously translated and if any of these 				strings has not been found during the new collection process, the system marks these 				strings as obsolete and displays them on the  Obsolete  tab of 				the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries form.  String collection is a time-consuming operation that should be 				performed during off-peak hours and never attempted on a busy production 				system. Translating Strings Generally, translating strings is a straightforward process: In the  Default 					Values  table of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries 				(SM200540) form, type the translation for each string that must be translated in 				the  <Target Language>  column and select the  Do Not 					Translate  check box for each string that does not require 				translation. When you're finished, click  Save . The fully 				translated (that is, translated into all languages defined in the system) strings 				and the strings that do not require translation are hidden from the 					 Default Values  table.  Despite the simplicity, the translation process has its own particularities in how 				you filter strings to be translated and in what you translate or not.  First of all, the strings you see on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries form are 				filtered in any case: You can see either  bound  or  unbound  strings. 				Bound strings are the strings associated with system resources bound to forms, such 				as table names. Unbound strings are the strings associated with resources that are 				not bound to forms, such as prompts. To translate all the strings on the interface, 				you should translate both the bound and unbound strings. The type of strings 				displayed on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries depends on the  Show Only 					Unbound  check box in the Selection area of this form as follows: If the check box is cleared, the system displays only bound strings. For any 					bound string, you can get the context of the string: By using the 						 Usage Details  dialog box, you can view the list of 					forms on which you can find the string and quickly navigate to any form in the 						list. In  Acumatica ERP, the contents of a form may be content-related and may depend on system 						configuration and on selections on the form itself. If you don't see the 						string immediately, you can check the corresponding reference topic in 						help. Additionally, you can select a form in the  Show 							Used in UI  box in the Selection area of the form to view and 						translate only strings that are associated with the resources of the 						selected form. If the check box is selected, the system displays only unbound strings. 					Additionally, you can select which type (or types) of the unbound resources you 					want to view and translate. To further narrow the displayed strings, you can use table filtering, described in detail in 				the  Filters chapter of the  Acumatica ERP Interface Guide. The next particularity of the translation process relates to the contents of the 				source values of strings. If you open the list of collected strings, you will see 				that strings include the text itself and may include special formatting. The 				examples of the special formatting include the following: The  ->  character: For commands in lists, the  ->  character 					separates the name of the list from the command (for example,  State -> 						Completed ; the  State ->  part of the string is for 					informational purposes only). You should translate only the text after the 						 ->  sign. HTML tags: Strings may include HTML tags that define the formatting of the 					string. For example,  <B>  and  </B>  tags indicate that the 					enclosed text should be in bold type. You should keep these tags in the 					translated text in their respective places to keep the formatting. Placeholders that use the  '{<number>}'  format: These placeholders are 					replaced with text when a user who works with the document gets the message. You 					should copy the placeholders without changes in the respective places in the 					translation. The  ~  (tilde) character: When a message that you want to translate 					contains multiline text, the end of each line is indicated by the  ~  					character. You should use the tilde in the translated multiline text to mark the 					ends of lines. If you do not mark the ends of lines with tildes in the 						translated text, the message will be displayed as one line for messages 						translated directly in  Acumatica ERP, or the translation of this text will not be imported for messages 						translated in an external file (for example, in a Microsoft Excel 						workbook). The special wrapper  [a type=ACTION][/a] : This wrapper is used 					along with messages that the system displays in tables when the table is empty. 					It converts the text into a hyperlink. When a user clicks this link, the system 					performs the action specified in the wrapper (such as  clear ). 					You should keep this wrapper in the translated text in its initial place to keep 					the formatting and the action. One additional particularity is related to handling strings that should not be translated. In 				terms of the effect on the UI, there is no difference between a string with the 					 Do Not Translate  check box selected, and a string left 				untranslated and with the  Do Not Translate  check box cleared: 				Either way, the user will see the value of the string in the default language. 				However, based on whether you select this check box, these strings are processed 				differently: A string with the  Do Not Translate  check box selected is 					hidden from the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries form until you select the 						 Show Excluded  check box. Additionally, such strings 					are considered valid when you try to validate translation of strings on 					forms. A string that is not translated and for which with the  Do Not 						Translate  check box is cleared appears on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries form when you select a language for translation. 					Also, such strings are considered invalid and warnings about these strings 					appear on the form when you try to validate string translation on forms. 						 For more information on validation of translation of strings, see the 							 Reviewing the Translations on Forms  section in 						this topic. For the detailed procedures, see  To Translate Bound Strings, 					 To Translate Unbound Strings, and  To Exclude Strings from Translation. After you add translations for a string in all the languages defined in the system or 				mark a string as not requiring translation and save the result, the string is 				removed from the work area. You can see the fully translated strings and the 				excluded strings by selecting the  Show Localized  and  Show 					Excluded  check boxes, respectively, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries form.  Handling Multiple Occurrences of the Same String A string—such as an element label or a drop-down list option that is available on 				multiple forms—may be used in the interface multiple times. Depending on the 				context, the same string may require different translation. To address this 				situation,  Acumatica ERP shows the resource or resources the string is associated with for each string 				listed in the  Default Values  table of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries (SM200540) form. These resources, 				which are displayed in the  Key-Specific Values  table, 				indicate the entities in which specific string is used. You can provide correct 				translations for each occurrence of the string depending on its context.  If you want to provide specific translations for different occurrences of a 				string, you must provide a generic translation in the  Default 					Values  table. The translation you specify in the  Default Values  table is generally 				applied to all occurrences of the string automatically. But if you specify specific 				translations for certain occurrences in the  Key-Specific 					Values  table, the system will use the specific translations.  Reviewing the Translations on Forms To check if all the strings on a form are translated into a language defined in the 				system, you can turn on validation of translations on forms for the language on the 					  ([~/?ScreenId=SM200550|SM200550]) System Locales (SM200550) form. For the detailed procedure, 				see  To Turn On Validation of Translations. With the validation active, when you sign in with the language and open a form that 				has untranslated strings, you see a warning with the quantity of the untranslated 				strings appear at the top of the form.  The warnings appear for all users of the system who sign in with the 				language. You can click the warning to expand the list. Each warning includes the type and the details 				of the resource with which the untranslated string is associated, and a link to the 					  ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries (SM200540) form. You can click the link to 				quickly open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries form with the locale of the 				untranslated string selected, and then find and translate the string.  The strings with the  Do Not Translate  check box selected on 				the  Collected  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries form 				are considered valid and are not listed in the warning. After you translate all strings into a language and validate the translations, you 				can turn off the validation of translations, as described in  To Turn Off Validation of Translations. Exporting and Importing Strings You can export strings, translate them by using third-party applications, and import 				back into  Acumatica ERP. Translated strings are loaded into the system as a locale dictionary and are 				immediately applied to the user interface once a user signs into the system using a 				specific locale.  You can also import the file with the translations into a new instance to speed up 				the translation process. The new instance should have the locales translations that 				you want to import.  If the imported file includes strings that were not collected in the instance, these 				strings will be imported as unbound strings. This happens because the system is not 				able to reinstate the bounds between the forms and the system resources associated 				with the imported strings. Such strings are displayed on the interface similarly to 				the way other unbound strings are displayed, and you won't be able to use the 					 Usage Details  dialog box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries (SM200540) to quickly view the forms the strings 				are used on. To export and import strings, use the corresponding buttons on the table toolbar of 				the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries form.  The exported file includes only the strings displayed in the table, based on the 				filtering applied on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries form. Correcting Translations At any time during the translation process you may need to change the translation of a 				string—for example, to correct a typo. You can use the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries (SM200540) form to correct the translation. The steps to correct the 				translation depend on the string whose translation you want to correct: If the string has not been fully translated, use the filtering options to find it and 					correct the translation. If the string has been fully translated and is hidden on the form, select the 						 Show Localized  check box to make the fully translated 					strings appear on the  Collected  tab, and then find the 					string and correct the translation. If the string has been wrongly marked as not requiring translation, select the 						 Show Excluded  check box to make the strings that do 					not require translation appear on the  Collected  tab, and 					then find the string and clear the  Show Excluded  check 					box. If you know when the translation has been added or modified, you can use filtering to view 				only strings with translations added and modified after the date by specifying the 				dates in the  Created Since  and  Modified 					After  boxes, respectively. Updating Translations Sometimes the values of particular strings change. For example, this may happen if the 				functionality of a form is changed during an update of your  Acumatica ERP instance or if a customization has been applied to a form by the customizers 				in-house. When you collect strings, if any of the previously translated strings have 				not been found during the new collection process, these strings are considered 				obsolete and displayed on the  Obsolete  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries (SM200540) form. Strings with new values appear on 				the  Collected  tab as untranslated strings. We recommend that you collect all strings in the system by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries form after every update of your  Acumatica ERP instance. If any functionality is updated or customized in the system regularly, you may need to 				regularly collect the strings from the appropriate forms for translation. To do 				that, you should create a translation set in which you include a required form or 				forms by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM211500|SM211500]) Translation Sets (SM211500) form, and then add 				these sets to a schedule for automatic collection. For more information, see  Scheduled Processing. Translating Wiki Articles The Help wiki is created in the base language of  Acumatica ERP, U.S. English. For a newly added locale, all articles will be displayed in this 				base language until you create locale-specific versions of the articles. For the 				detailed procedure, see  To Create a Localized Version of an Article. After you translate an article, only the versions of the article created in the 				selected locale will be listed on the  History  tab when you open the article 				in  Wiki Editor Form for Articles.  For more information about wikis in  Acumatica ERP, see  Managing Wikis. ]]></column>

In any ERP system, such tasks as the processing of documents or the validation of accounts require significant time and system resources. As such, they should be processed at times when there are no employees at work, such as weekends or nights. Other processing, such as releasing or posting documents, takes less time but also should be performed regularly, with a frequency determined by your business needs. {br}

In Acumatica ERP, if the ''Scheduled Processing'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can set up automated processing for most processing forms instead of initiating the processing manually. You can handle the scheduling in one of the following ways:
*From the target processing form: Here you configure the appropriate processing. You then invoke the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_20|Automation Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=SM205020|SM205020]) form as a pop-up to create a new schedule for this processing.
*By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_30|Automation Schedule Statuses] form: On this form, you can set up both operations by using different tabs.

Generally, both ways deliver the same result, although the first way is a bit easier if you use predefined filters to display appropriate documents (or other entities) on the processing form. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Scheduling_the_Desired_Processing|To Schedule Processing].((({S:Warn}The system uses the ''admin'' user account to run scheduled processes. This account uses the first available system locale, which is specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_50|System Locales] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200550|SM200550]) form for the company with the schedule.
)))
The sections below describe the two ways you can configure automatic processing. When you set up an automatic processing, you&rsquo;ll have to create separate schedules for each set of documents you generally process (or for the most time-consuming ones) and manually process the rest of the documents. {br}{TOC}
==Configuring Processing Through a Specific Processing Form==
Generally, the scheduling of processing includes two operations: 
#The configuration of processing: Selecting documents by their date, total amount, customer or vendor, currency, or any other relevant property
#The scheduling itself: Specifying how often processing should be performed, at what time, and with or without a limit on the number of executions

On many of the processing forms, you can sort documents by specific criteria, such as posting period, document type, or processing type. When you perform the processing manually, you open the appropriate form and use the elements in the Selection area to select the documents or other objects for processing. You can create a filter or use an existing filter for the form to select documents by their properties, such as amounts in a specific range. {br}

To select the appropriate documents for automatic processing by using the processing form, you do the following: 
*Use the Selection area of the processing form to specify criteria.
*Optionally, apply a filter to select documents or objects by their properties.
*On the '''Schedule''' menu of the form toolbar, select ''Add''. This brings up the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_20|Automation Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=SM205020|SM205020]) form as a pop-up window; the values specified in the Selection area and the settings of the applied filter appear on the '''Conditions''' and '''Filter Values''' tabs of the form.
*Specify a name for the schedule, as well as its description, frequency, expiration information, and time of the day. Save the schedule.

==Configuring Processing Using the Automation Schedules Form==
By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_20|Automation Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=SM205020|SM205020]) form, you can configure scheduled processing for any processing form. To select documents for automatic processing by using this form, you do the following: 
#Select the processing form by its screen ID.
#Specify a name for the schedule, as well as its description, frequency, expiration information, and time of the day. 
#Specify the dates and the particular time to start processing. 
#:((({S:Hint}You can specify a start and end time for a processing session if you want the processing to be performed in sessions. Then the system, after stopping the processing at the end time, suspends it during the specified interval and resumes processing when a new session starts.
)))
#On the '''Conditions''' tab, specify the values that you would otherwise specify in the Selection area of the processing form.
#On the '''Filter Values''' tab, specify the filtering conditions based on the document or object properties.
#:((({S:Warn}If a field on the processing form is automatically filled in with a default value—for example, the '''Allocation Date''' field on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_50_45_00|Run Allocations] ([~/?ScreenId=GL504500|GL504500]) form, which by default has the current business date value—the system filters the entities that should be processed by this value. To reset the filter that uses the field's default value, on the '''Filter Values''' tab, you need to add a new filter for this field and leave the value empty.
)))
#Save the schedule.

==Viewing the History of Schedules==
Once you have assigned the processing to the schedule, processing of the form will be performed automatically, in accordance with the assigned schedule. To view when and how it was performed, on the original processing form, use the '''Schedule''' menu (on the form toolbar): Select the '''History''' option, which allows you to view the history of schedule execution in a specified date range. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Scheduling_the_Desired_Processing|To Schedule Processing].

If a field on the processing form is automatically 						filled in with a default value—for example, the  Allocation 							Date  field on the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL504500|GL504500]) Run Allocations 						(GL504500) form, which by default has the current business date 						value—the system filters the entities that should be processed by this 						value. To reset the filter that uses the field's default value, on the 							 Filter Values  tab, you need to add a new filter 						for this field and leave the value empty. Save the schedule. Viewing the History of Schedules Once you have assigned the processing to the schedule, processing of the form will be 				performed automatically, in accordance with the assigned schedule. To view when and 				how it was performed, on the original processing form, use the  Schedule  menu 				(on the form toolbar): Select the  History  option, which 				allows you to view the history of schedule execution in a specified date range. For 				details, see  To Schedule Processing.   ([~/?ScreenId=SM205020|SM205020]) ]]></column>

Some Acumatica ERP functionality is implemented through ''automation steps'', which are steps to be executed on an Acumatica ERP form for specific records or objects generated in the system, depending on the properties of the record or object. For a data entry Acumatica ERP form, you can create any number of automation steps that redefine the functionality of toolbar actions, add values to combo box lists, or provide default values for the form elements, based on the properties of the records under processing. For more details on automation capabilities, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Workflow_Customization|Workflow Customization by Means of Automation Steps].

A complete set of automation steps is considered an ''automation definition'' and can be saved under a user-defined name. Acumatica ERP is delivered with a number of standard automation definitions, depending on the package you buy.

==Saving the Current State of Automation==
You may need to create an automation definition to save the current state of automation in your system. ((({S:Hint}
Always create a definition of the current automation state before you perform an upgrade or begin major changes to automation. 
)))
To create a definition for the current state of your system, do the following on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_10|Automation Definitions] form: 
#Click '''Insert''' to clear the elements on the form.
#Specify an ID and a description for a new definition.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Populate Definition''' to load the details of existing automation steps.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save''' to save the definition.

==Restoring a State of Automation from a Definition==
You can revert the system to one of Acumatica ERP default automation definitions by taking the following actions on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_10|Automation Definitions] form: 
# In the '''Definition''' box, select the definition by its ID.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Activate Definition'''. This action removes the automation steps associated with the screens and assigns the steps from the selected definition. For screens not listed in the definition, all automation steps will be removed during activation.

==Creating a New Definition Based on an Existing One==
To create a definition based on an existing one, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_10|Automation Definitions] form, do the following: 
#Click '''Insert''' to clear the elements on the form.
#Specify an ID and a description for the new definition.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Copy Details''', which opens the '''Specify Source Definition''' dialog box.
#In the '''Source Definition''' box, select a definition by its ID.
#Click '''OK''' to close the dialog box and load the details of the selected definition.
#Remove from the definition each screen for which you do not want to maintain automation by selecting the row and clicking '''Delete''' on the table toolbar.
#Save the definition by clicking '''Save''' on the form toolbar.

After that, you can make necessary changes in the new definition and be sure that you have a backup to restore the system in case your changes didn&rsquo;t result in the expected automation state.

Along with visual customization tools that can be used to customize forms, Acumatica ERP provides the automation functionality, which you can use to change the functionality of forms. {br}

With functional customization, you can change the existing business logic associated with particular screens to fit your business processes and requirements. Using screen automation functionality, you can add document statuses, provide different default values for specific elements, or make some of the elements unavailable, depending on document statuses. For example, you can configure the system so that bills with small amounts will be automatically approved and paid on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form, while bills with large amounts will require approval that can be performed only by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_50_20_00|Approve Bills for Payment] ([~/?ScreenId=AP502000|AP502000]) form. ((({S:Warn}The functionality is available if the ''Workflow Automation'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
)))
Also, you can create automation schedules and set up document processing to be performed automatically according to schedules with only the documents matching specific conditions being processed. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Scheduled_Processing|Scheduled Processing]. {br}{TOC}
==Understanding Automation Steps==
As a rule, you can create documents or objects of different types with the help of data entry forms (screens). For example, by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form, you can create bills, credit adjustments, debit adjustments, and prepayments. Documents of different types are processed differently in the system, and most of the functionality is built in. For some of the data entry forms, specific business logic for documents of different types is implemented through the sets of automation steps created for these forms and can be further modified with the help of automation steps. {br}

An automation step is a set of conditions for a document that, when reached, causes particular actions defined for the step to be performed, or restrictions on the values to be applied. {br}

Only data entry forms can be customized with the help of automation steps. For example, for the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] form, six automation steps define which of the actions on the form toolbar are available and which of the elements are unavailable for documents of each type with different statuses. {br}

You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_00|Automation Steps] ([~/?ScreenId=SM205000|SM205000]) form to create functional automation for the appropriate data entry form. {br}

Once you selected the data entry form for automation, before you start to configure automation steps, think through all types of documents that can be created on the form and how different their workflows should be. Specify the conditions on which the particular actions should be performed, and set up the default values for the elements or the restrictions for the values of the elements (input mask or minimum and maximum values). 
==Defining Conditions for the Automation Step==
Automation steps are executed conditionally. On the '''Conditions''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_00|Automation Steps] form, specify the conditions for applying the automation step. You can specify one condition or multiple conditions joined by logical operators (''OR'' or ''AND''). If a form can be used to create documents of multiple types, conditions can be used to select documents of a particular type and with a particular status. {br}

If you select a lookup element for a condition, you can select any value from the list to be used in the condition. For example, if you set up a condition for the documents with the ''Balanced'' status, select ''Status'' as the '''Field Name''', ''Equal'' as the '''Condition''', and ''Balanced'' as the '''Value'''. {br}

If you select an input element in a condition, manually enter the value. 
==Redefining Actions for the Step==
Once conditions are specified, on the '''Actions''' tab, select the actions to be performed for the documents matching the specified conditions. You can reload all the actions available for the form and redefine some of them for the step. {br}

For each action available on the target form, you can select one of the following options: 
*Disable it on the form once conditions are met
*Run it automatically
*Hide the action from the toolbar
*Use the action in its default meaning
*Convert it to a menu with menu options (reports or inquiries) added by using the '''Fill with Values''' dialog box
*Run the action in batch mode for all matching documents

To convert an action on the toolbar to a menu, you need to add options to this menu by using the '''Fill With Values''' dialog box. You can add, for example, a report to the '''Reports''' menu or an inquiry to the '''Inquiries''' menu. To add a report, an inquiry, or another action, perform the following actions: [anchor|#ol_fwc_ldn_mq]
#In the '''Field Name''' box, type {{@reportID}}, or {{@inquiryID}}, or {{@ActionName}}.
#In the '''Value''' box, type the ID of the report (for example, {{SO641010}}), inquiry (for example, {{ViewActivities}}), or action (for example, {{AddTask}}).
#To save the changes and close the dialog box, click '''Close'''. 

You can also update the ''Notification'' action to attach multiple reports to one mailing. The attached reports may have different formats (for example, you can attach a PDF and an HTML report to the same email). To attach multiple reports to one mailing, do the following:[anchor|#ol_h1c_qzm_mq]
#On the '''Actions''' tab, open the '''Fill with Values''' dialog box for the ''Notification'' action.
#In the ''@notification'' line, in the '''Value''' column, specify the mailing IDs, separated by commas.

The mailing will be sent according to the recipients of the first mailing in the line. The recipients of the other mailings will be discarded.{br}

Also, for the automation step, you can specify what should happen on failure of the redefined action or on its success. To do this, click '''Flow''' on the Details toolbar and specify what actions from this automation step or other automation steps should be performed on failure or success of the step. 
==Redefining Fields for the Step==
On the '''Fields''' tab, you can specify how some of the fields should be redefined when the conditions are met. You can select a field and do one of the following: 
*Set a minimum value, a maximum value, or both
*Redefine a field as a combo box
*Assign a default value
*Set up an input mask to ensure that the correct data will be entered or the correct format will be used
*Disable the field
*Hide the field

By using the '''Combo Box Values''' action, which opens the dialog box of the same name, you can add new values to the existing list of combo box values or create a new list for an input field redefined as a combo box. Only user-defined values can be removed from a the combo box list.

In Acumatica ERP, you can use classes for flexible grouping of entities, such as leads, opportunities, customers, and inventory items. Initially, Acumatica ERP contains a number of preconfigured classes, which you can tailor as needed, and you can create additional classes to meet your needs to group entities meaningfully. {br}

You specify all applicable settings for classes, and you can define ''attributes'': properties (such as company size, manufacturer, or industry) of entities belonging to the class that are important to your company but not tracked on the data entry form where the entity is created. Each attribute you specify for a particular class appears on the data entry form for an entity of the class. Depending on how you have defined the attribute for the class, the attribute can be required or optional for an entity of the class, and you can define a default setting for any attribute. {br}

When a user creates an entity that must have an entity class selected, the user first selects the class. If any attributes are defined for the particular class, the system lists these attributes on the '''Attributes''' tab of the data entity form. On that tab, the user specifies the appropriate settings of the attributes of the class (such as the manufacturer of a particular item of the item class, or the industry of a particular customer of the customer class).{br}

Not all system entities have entity classes, so you cannot add attributes via classes and the '''Attributes''' tab for all entities. To provide this information-tracking capability, if you have the ''Customizer'' role, you can add ''user-defined fields'' directly to the Acumatica ERP data entry forms where these entities are created. You add these user-defined fields, which are based on predefined and site-specific attributes defined in the system, to an additional tab (the '''User-Defined Fields''' tab) of a particular data entry form. (This tab appears on the data entry form only if user-defined fields have been defined for the form.).{br}{TOC}

In Acumatica ERP, you can define attributes for flexible, meaningful classification of leads, opportunities, customers, and inventory items in your company. An attribute is a property (such as age or industry) that enables you to specify additional information for objects in the system. For some entities, attributes are defined in the context of a class, which is a grouping of the business accounts (including leads, opportunities, customers, and cases), projects, and stock and non-stock items by one or more of their properties. For other entities, attributes can be added directly to a corresponding data entry form.{br}

For each class, you can define a list of attributes to gather class-specific information about members of the class; for example, attributes may carry the information about product brand, manufacturer, lead age, gender, or industry. You can use attributes for entities related to the following functionality:[anchor|#_6d3e1e28-4f7c-4d94-9e3a-afdd7d7ec5e3]

Attributes assigned to an entity are displayed on the '''Attributes''' tab of a corresponding data entry form. Also, attributes can be added as boxes to an additional tab (the '''User-Defined Fields''' tab) of a data entry form. {br}{TOC}
==Attributes in Classes==
A class contains a set of attributes that must be available in any instance of the class. For example, any lead of a given class must contain all the attributes defined for the lead class.{br}

The sets of attributes for specific classes is defined on the following forms: [anchor|#_76cbb740-364b-42a5-ac9a-009071b3d5d0]
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_70_00|Lead Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR207000|CR207000])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_50_00|Contact Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR205000|CR205000])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_90_00|Opportunity Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR209000|CR209000])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_60_00|Case Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR206000|CR206000])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_80_00|Business Account Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR208000|CR208000])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_25_00|Campaign Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR202500|CR202500])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_20_00|Attributes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM202000|PM202000])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_20_00|Employee Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=EP202000|EP202000])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_10_00|Vendor Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AP201000|AP201000])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_10_00|Customer Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR201000|AR201000])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CT_20_20_00|Contract Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=CT202000|CT202000])

For each attribute in a given class, you can specify whether the attribute is required. When creating an instance of the class, you must define the values for all the required attributes.{br}

You specify the attributes for a class by selecting the attributes from the attributes available in the system. If you need an attribute that is not available in the system, you can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_50_00|Attributes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) form to create the attribute, as well as any other attributes you may need. Then you will be able to select the new attribute in any class.{br}

You can deactivate an obsolete attribute for a particular entity class by clearing the '''Active''' check box for this attribute on the entity class form. In this case, the deactivated attribute will no longer be displayed for records of the class, but all attribute values that have already been specified for existing records still will be stored in the database. If you re-activates the attribute, its values will become visible in the system again. However, if it is not necessary to preserve the data related to an obsolete attribute, you can deactivate the attribute and then delete it by using the Delete Row button on the table toolbar. In this case, the attribute will be permanently deleted from the class and all attribute values will be cleared for the records of the class.
==Import of Records with Attributes==
When a record with attributes is being imported to the system through an import scenario, an error may occur if the target class of the record does not include any of the attributes specified for the record. If this is the case, you may need to verify whether the attribute is correctly specified in the source record or consider adding the attribute to the target class.
==Attribute Types==
For each attribute created by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_50_00|Attributes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) form, you need to specify its type, which can be one of the following: [anchor|#_0cabb526-3ef6-4316-83de-61466eeb3dc1]
*''Text'': A text box into which the user can type text
*''Combo'': A list box users can use to type or select options
*''Multi Select Combo'': A list box where users can select multiple options
*''Checkbox'': A check box users can select or clear
*''Datetime'': An element for selecting date and time

For a ''Text'' attribute, you can specify an input validation rule based on an input mask or a regular expression. Input validation ensures that the entered data is valid and usable. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Examples_Mask_and_RegExp_Usage|Examples of Masks and Regular Expressions Usage ].{br}

For a ''Combo'' and ''Multi Select Combo'' attribute, you can create a list of possible values, so that the user can select (respectively) one value or multiple values from the drop-down list. You can also specify the order of the values listed.

The functionality of attributes is not available for all entities. For some of these entities, your organization may want to add user-defined fields directly to their corresponding data entry forms. Also, attributes can be added as boxes to an additional tab (the '''User-Defined Fields''' tab) of a data entry form. {br}

 If you add user-defined fields, the original information of a record is displayed on the '''Document''' tab of the applicable form, and the added user-defined fields are displayed on the '''User-Defined Fields''' tab. {br}{TOC}
==User-Defined Fields==
You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_50_00|Attributes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) form to create new attributes that will serve as the user-defined fields, or you can use attributes already defined in the system. To add an attribute as a user-defined field to a data entry form, you need access to the '''Customization''' menu on the form toolbar; this access is provided by the ''Customizer'' user role. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\Admin_HOW_AddUserField|To Add User-Defined Fields to a Form].
==Forms That Support User-Defined Fields==

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[User-Defined Fields The functionality of attributes is not available for all entities. For some of these 				entities, your organization may want to add user-defined fields directly to their 				corresponding data entry forms. Also, attributes can be added as boxes to an 				additional tab (the  User-Defined Fields  tab) of a data entry 				form.   If you add user-defined fields, the original information of a record is displayed on 				the  Document  tab of the applicable form, and the added 				user-defined fields are displayed on the  User-Defined Fields  				tab.  User-Defined Fields You use the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) Attributes (CS205000) form to create 				new attributes that will serve as the user-defined fields, or you can use attributes 				already defined in the system. To add an attribute as a user-defined field to a data 				entry form, you need access to the  Customization  menu on the 				form toolbar; this access is provided by the  Customizer  user role. For 				details, see  To Add User-Defined Fields to a Form. Forms That Support User-Defined Fields A user may add user-defined fields to any of the following data entry forms: Time and Expenses  ([~/?ScreenId=EP301020|EP301020]) Expense Receipt (EP301020)

 Acumatica ERP provides the functionality to monitor and manage three types of events:[anchor|#_af37e558-887c-423b-a81f-5dc22dcb0f58]
*Events that are planned by people
*Changes to system data 
*Schedule-based checking of conditions in the system

 Acumatica ERP provides the ''event'' functionality and the ''business event'' functionality for the management and monitoring of events. 
==Event Functionality==
The event functionality is suitable for monitoring and managing events to be held by your company employees, customers, or vendors. Users can create these events—which can include meetings, seminars, trade shows, and conference calls—in the system. Acumatica ERP gives users the ability to send personalized emails to all participants based on notification templates that can be defined for inviting potential attendees to an event, rescheduling an event, and canceling an event. ((({S:Warn}Although it would be possible to monitor system data changes by using the event functionality, we do not recommend this. You instead use the business event functionality, which was developed specifically for this purpose.
)))
==Business Event Functionality==
You use the business event functionality for monitoring business events that occur in the system as users perform business processes. Business events are particular actions, data changes, or conditions that require user attention in your company. By setting up business event monitoring, you ensure that these business events will not be missed without individual users needing to spend their time performing manual monitoring.{br}

You can configure Acumatica ERP not only to monitor for particular business events but also to perform any number of actions (such as sending an email notification or performing the instructions defined by an import scenario) in the system. The system performs these actions based on either of the following occurrences:[anchor|#_77bf784f-419b-495b-a74b-0628c9079fe0]
*Specific data being changed in the system.
*:For example, in contract management, you can configure the system to send an email notification to the customer when the customer&rsquo;s contract is activated.
*The meeting of particular conditions, which the system checks for at the schedule you specify.
*:For example, in the management of opportunities, you can configure the system to send an email to the owner of an opportunity when it is one month from its estimated close date and the opportunity hasn&rsquo;t been updated for more than seven days. The system performs this monitoring once a day.
[anchor|#_e9e6364c-586a-4e74-88a5-a8cbf5d21dd0]
To configure the system to monitor a business process, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_50|Business Events] ([~/?ScreenId=SM302050|SM302050]) form, you define a ''business event'' that relates to this business process and that causes the system to perform an action or multiple actions in the system. The business event is a data change or a set of conditions checked for on a schedule. For details on the business events, see [HelpRoot_Administration\AI__con_Business_Event_By_Data_Change|Business Events Related to Data Changes] and [HelpRoot_Administration\AI__con_Business_Event_By_Schedule|Business Events Monitored on a Schedule].
To define the actions that the system should perform in the system once the business event has occurred, you specify the ''subscribers'' of this business event. A subscriber of a business event is an entity in the system (an email, a push notification to a mobile device, or a script based on an import scenario) that the system processes when the business event occurs. If the subscriber is an email or a push notification, the system sends the needed emails or push notifications based on the settings of the notification template that you have specified for the business event. If the subscriber is an import scenario, the system executes the sequence of instructions defined by the import scenario that you have specified for the business event. For more information about subscribers, see [HelpRoot_Administration\AI__con_Business_Event_Subscribers|Subscribers of Business Events].

By using Acumatica ERP, you can configure automatic notifications about various events in the organization, such as training sessions, work meetings, conference calls, and trade shows. Users create events and invite leads, contacts, and customers to attend them, and the system sends invitations to the potential attendees specified for the event. Also, the system reminds users about the event and notifies attendees if you make any changes to the event or cancel it.{br}{TOC}
==Event-Related Settings==
By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_40_70|Event Setup] ([~/?ScreenId=EP204070|EP204070]) form, you can configure automatic notifications about events to be held by your company employees. You can configure either simple (built-in) notifications or template-based notifications that allow users to send personalized emails. A template can include placeholders that are replaced by each addressee's personal data, such as the first and last names and position, when the system generates event notification emails.{br}

You can create the following templates: [anchor|#ul_u3r_jwy_w3]
*''Invitation template'': This template can be used to send personalized email invitations to the persons listed on the '''Attendees''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_30|Event] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306030|CR306030]) form. If the user adds new potential attendees to the list after sending initial invitations and saves the event, the system will prompt the user to send invitations to the added potential attendees.
*''Rescheduling template'': This template can be used if the event date or time has been changed. Emails based on the template are sent to all invited persons automatically once the event is shifted to a new start time.
*''Cancellation template'': This template is used if the invitation to the event is canceled for a particular potential attendee (for instance, if the event planner sent the invitation to this person in error) or for all potential attendees.

==Creation of New Events==
Users can view existing events by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_40_41_00|Events] ([~/?ScreenId=EP404100|EP404100]) form. Clicking the '''Add Event''' button on the table toolbar invokes the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_30|Event] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306030|CR306030]) form (as a pop-up window), which lets you create a new event. {br}

When creating an event, the user may configure a ''reminder'' for it, specifying the day and time when all invited attendees will be reminded about the event (by the '''Automatic Reminder''' dialog box popping up). 
==Event-Related Notification Emails==
If a user creating an event specifies potential attendees, notification emails will be sent at the following times to the specified parties: [anchor|#ul_rz2_zht_w3]
*When the event is being saved for the first time: To all potential attendees
*When new attendees are added: To only newly added attendees
*When the event is rescheduled: To all potential attendees
*When the event is canceled: To all potential attendees
*When the invitation is canceled: To the selected potential attendees

 In Acumatica ERP, you can configure record change notifications if the ''Change Notifications'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. Record change notifications are emails the system generates and sends when specific changes are made to particular documents.{br}{TOC}
==Uses of Record Change Notifications ==
Notifications can help your employees and selected external contacts track key developments that occur within the organization. Some examples include the following: 
*A sales manager may want the system to notify a customer contact when a sales order has been shipped to the customer.
*Your company might want to tell customers about changes in their blanket purchase orders.
*A manager may want to know when a specific purchase order has received all the required approvals.
*A credit manager may want to know when a sales order is created for a particular customer that is approaching its credit limit.
*A customer service manager may want to be informed when a new employee is assigned a case of a specific type, to give the employee assistance with this type of case.

==Public and Private Notifications==
You can configure private notifications to be received by only particular recipients and public notifications for which users can sign up. {br}

For private notifications, you can specify very precise conditions for sending the notification email, and choose only appropriate individuals to receive it. {br}

You can configure public notifications about typical changes in documents of a specific type that employees and external contacts may want to know about. These public notifications are visible to all users who have access to the respective data entry forms. When a user is viewing a document of the specific type on the form, the user can sign up for the notification to receive emails about changes made to the particular document.
==Access to Notification Configuration==
To create a new notification, a user should have access to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_40|Automation Notifications] ([~/?ScreenId=SM205040|SM205040]) form at the ''Insert'' level of access or higher. {br}

If you want multiple users to be able to create new notifications, configure a ''Notification Administrator'' role with an ''Insert'' or ''Delete'' level of access to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_40|Automation Notifications] form. Users with this role can then create private and public notifications for other users of the organization. {br}

A user doesn&rsquo;t need access to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_40|Automation Notifications] form, however, to sign up for an existing public notification. If a user has access to a data entry form for which public notifications have been configured, the user can sign up for notifications associated with the form, to monitor changes in specific records or documents. 
==Creation of a New Public Notification==
To begin creating a new public notification about changes in documents of a specific type or certain records, do one of the following: 
*Open the form where specific documents are created, click '''Notifications''' (upper right of the form), and then click '''Create New'''. This opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_40|Automation Notifications] form as a pop-up window so that you can create a new notification.
*Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_40|Automation Notifications] form directly, and select the data entry form of interest in the '''Screen ID''' box.

Now that you are on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_40|Automation Notifications] form with the appropriate screen selected, perform the following steps: 
#Provide a description for the notification. After you save the notification, the description will serve as the notification ID.
#Make sure the '''Active''' check box is selected.
#Provide a subject for emails to be sent for this notification.
#Optional: In the '''Data Source''' box, select one of the following options:
#*''Report'': To send an electronic version of the document with the notification email, either as an attachment or as the email body. If you select this option, specify the '''Report ID''', the '''Report Format''', and, optionally, report parameters on the '''Parameters''' tab (which appears after you have selected a report ID). To send the document in the email body, select the '''Embedded''' check box; in this case, you cannot specify other text for the email message.
#*''Action'': To execute a specific action once a notification email is generated. For example, if you configure notification emails as emails based on an email template, by using this option, you can specify whether to print the document, release it, or void it.
#*''None'': To not perform any additional actions.
#Select the''' Public''' check box.
#Click the '''Message''' tab. If you have selected the '''Embedded''' check box, the document generated based on the specified report will be used as email body; otherwise, type the text of the notification email, or paste the notification template that you previously created in the Notifications wiki. To make emails personalized, use placeholders in double parentheses, such as ''((EmployeeFirstName))''.
#Do the following to specify the conditions that the system will check when the document is saved and send notification emails if the conditions are met:
#*On the '''Conditions''' tab, specify the conditions for the document field values.
#*On the '''Fields''' tab, select the fields whose changes should be monitored.
#On the '''Addresses''' tab, specify the list of recipients. For each recipient, specify the following information:
#*In the '''Source''' box, select one of the following options as the source of the recipient&rsquo;s address: ''Document'' (to select recipients among the contacts associated with the document, such as customer or vendor contacts) or ''User'' (to select recipients among all users defined in the system).
#*In the '''Email''' box, select the email address of the recipient.
#*Make sure the '''Active''' check box is selected.
#*In the '''Type''' box, select the type of this recipient: ''To'', ''CC'', or ''BCC''.
#Click '''Save'''.

==Signing Up for a Public Notification==
Public notifications created for a particular data entry form are visible to all users who have access to the form. {br}

To sign up for a public notification, a user should do the following: 
#Open the data entry form, and select the appropriate document.
#Click '''Notifications''' (upper right of the title bar). From the drop-down list of options, click the particular notification, which opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_40|Automation Notifications] form (a version of the form intended only for signing up) as a pop-up window.
#On the '''Addresses''' tab, add the user&rsquo;s own email address to the list of recipients. 
#:((({S:Warn}On the '''Conditions''' tab of the pop-up window, a new line with the document reference number will be added automatically.
)))
#Click '''Save'''.

After the user has completed these steps, if the values in the monitored elements are changed, the user will receive a notification email.

You can configure the system to perform actions when a change of the data related to a business process has occurred. In this topic, you can find information about the configuration and processing of the business events related to data changes.{br}{TOC}
==Business Event Configuration==
To configure the system to perform actions related to data changes, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_50|Business Events] ([~/?ScreenId=SM302050|SM302050]) form, you create a business event of the ''Trigger by Record Change'' type and specify the following: [anchor|#_e4e402cd-e4bd-433d-a0a8-b16b7c643f47][anchor|#_78b12dad-74e8-4d65-8dca-63e5ee31d752]
*The data for monitoring.
*:In the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_50|Business Events] form, you can select an existing generic inquiry form or the generic inquiry form, which you have created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_80_00|Generic Inquiry] ([~/?ScreenId=SM208000|SM208000]) form, that defines the data for the system to monitor. You can also select a shared filter (if one has been defined for the form).((({S:Warn}Business events do not support generic inquiries that have grouping specified on the '''Grouping''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_80_00|Generic Inquiry] form. The generic inquiry that you use should be as simple as possible. Thus, we recommend that you avoid unnecessary multiple joins and joins to the same tables. In most cases, you can exclude from the generic inquiry all the tables that are not used on the '''Results Grid''' tab of the corresponding generic inquiry form.
)))
*The conditions that must be met for the system to perform actions.
*:On the '''Trigger Conditions''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_50|Business Events] form, you configure the conditions when the system should perform actions related to the business process. You can configure the conditions that are applied to any of the following:[anchor|#_b28880ac-077b-495e-8dfc-563493797c77]
**The results of the generic inquiry before the data change (the old field values).
**The results of the generic inquiry after the data has been changed (the new field values).
**The comparison of these results. That is, the condition can check whether a field value has been changed, or a record has been added, removed, or updated.The action is performed if the inquiry results have been changed according to the specified conditions.[anchor|#_39e22f27-4d9c-4295-b999-2eb77f343edd]
*The action or actions that the system should perform if the specified conditions have been met.
*:On the '''Subscribers''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_50|Business Events] form, you select a subscriber that has been configured; if needed, you can select multiple subscribers (one in each row). To create a new subscriber, you click '''Create Subscriber''' and click the menu command corresponding to the type of the subscriber, which causes the system to open the Acumatica ERP form (for an email or a push notification to a mobile device) or the dialog box and form (for an import scenario script) to create the subscriber. For details about subscribers of both types, see [HelpRoot_Administration\AI__con_Business_Event_Subscribers|Subscribers of Business Events].
*:((({S:Warn}If you plan to send push notifications to users of the Acumatica mobile app on mobile devices, make sure that the generic inquiry you have selected (in the '''Screen Name''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_50|Business Events] ([~/?ScreenId=SM302050|SM302050]) form) includes the <tt>NoteID</tt> data field for the entity that you plan to display when a user taps a notification on the mobile device. For example, suppose that you want to notify employees about new opportunities assigned to them, and when an employee taps this notification, the app should display the new opportunity. In this case, you should add the <tt>NoteID</tt> data field for the object <tt>CROpportunity</tt> on the '''Results Grid''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_80_00|Generic Inquiry] ([~/?ScreenId=SM208000|SM208000]) form. 
)))
*:If you have specified multiple subscribers on the '''Subscribers''' tab for the business event, you can select the '''Stop on Error''' check box in the row of a subscriber to direct the system to process subsequent subscribers in the list only if no error has occurred while the system was processing the current subscriber. 
{br}

In the '''Raise Event''' box of the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_50|Business Events] form, you can also select how the system should generate the business event: for each record that satisfies the trigger conditions or for the whole set of records that satisfy the trigger conditions.{br}

For details on how to configure the system to monitor business events related to record changes, see [HelpRoot_Administration\AI__how_Business_Event_by_Record_Change|To Monitor Changes of the Business Process Data].
==An Example of the Business Event Configuration==
For example, suppose that you want to configure the system to send a notification to the customer when this customer&rsquo;s contract has been activated. You would do the following: [anchor|#_87be13bd-6790-4c4e-b6cb-eec7c285b496]
#Optional: Create a generic inquiry (based on the <tt>PX.Objects.CT.Contract</tt> and <tt>PX.Objects.AR.ARContact</tt> tables) that retrieves from the system all contracts along with the applicable customer contact details. 
#:((({S:Warn}You could instead use an existing generic inquiry when you define the business event, if one exists that retrieves the needed data. We recommend that you check whether only the needed fields and tables are used in the generic inquiry you have decided to use. If the already-existing inquiry uses any fields and tables that are unnecessary for your specific business event, you should instead create a new inquiry and use it.
)))
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_50|Business Events] ([~/?ScreenId=SM302050|SM302050]) form, create a business event with the following settings:
#*'''Type''': ''Trigger by Record Change''
#* '''Raise Event''': ''For Each Record'' (to make the system generate a business event for each activated contract)
#*'''Screen Name''': The generic inquiry you have created
#On the '''Trigger Conditions''' tab, add two rows with the following values:
#*Row 1:
#**'''Operation''': ''Field Changed''
#** '''Table Name''': ''Contract'' (<tt>PX.Objects.CT.Contract</tt> table)
#**'''Field Name''': ''Status''
#** '''Operator''': And
#*Row 2:
#**'''Operation''': ''New Field Value''
#** '''Table Name''': ''Contract'' (<tt>PX.Objects.CT.Contract</tt> table)
#**'''Field Name''': ''Status''
#** '''Condition''': ''Equals''
#** '''Value 1''': ''Active''
#On the '''Subscribers''' tab, select a notification template. For this example, you would create a notification template that specifies as the recipient of the email a placeholder that has the system extract the default email address of the customer contact specified in the activated contract. 

==Business Event Processing==
When a business event is configured and is active—that is, the '''Active''' check box is selected for it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_50|Business Events] ([~/?ScreenId=SM302050|SM302050]) form—the system starts monitoring data changes made to the data included in the generic inquiry form. If a record has been changed, the system checks whether the record satisfies the conditions specified on the '''Trigger Conditions''' tab. If the record satisfies the conditions (which means that the business event has occurred), the system processes the subscribers of the event that are specified on the '''Subscribers''' tab. {br}

After all subscribers of the business event have been processed, the system saves information about the processing of the business event, which you can view on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_50_20_30|Business Event History] ([~/?ScreenId=SM502030|SM502030]) form.{br}

The following diagram illustrates the configuration and processing of business events related to record changes.[anchor|#_cf3804c6-77f3-477d-97f5-c637b7b428b6][anchor|#_201de822-5ef5-4b49-8512-02a4675a1b05][image:UserGuide/Images/BusinessEventByRecordChange.png|popup|The processing of a business event related to record changes|450px]

In this case, you                 should add the  NoteID  data field for the object  CROpportunity  on                 the  Results Grid  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM208000|SM208000]) Generic Inquiry (SM208000) form.  If you have                 specified multiple subscribers on the  Subscribers  tab for the                 business event, you can select the  Stop on Error  check box in                 the row of a subscriber to direct the system to process subsequent subscribers in                 the list only if no error has occurred while the system was processing the current                 subscriber.  In the  Raise Event  box of the Summary area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM302050|SM302050]) Business Events form, you can also select how the system should         generate the business event: for each record that satisfies the trigger conditions or for         the whole set of records that satisfy the trigger conditions. For details on how to configure the system to monitor business events related to record     changes, see  To Monitor Changes of the Business Process Data. An Example of the Business Event Configuration For example, suppose that you want to configure the system to send a notification to the         customer when this customer's contract has been activated. You would do the following:  Optional: Create a generic inquiry (based on the                PX.Objects.CT.Contract  and                PX.Objects.AR.ARContact  tables) that retrieves from the system all             contracts along with the applicable customer contact details.  You could instead               use an existing generic inquiry when you define the business event, if one exists that               retrieves the needed data. We recommend that you check whether only the needed fields               and tables are used in the generic inquiry you have decided to use. If the               already-existing inquiry uses any fields and tables that are unnecessary for your               specific business event, you should instead create a new inquiry and use             it. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM302050|SM302050]) Business Events (SM302050) form, create a business event             with the following settings: Type :  Trigger by Record Change Raise Event :  For Each Record  (to make the system                 generate a business event for each activated contract) Screen Name : The generic inquiry you have created On the  Trigger Conditions  tab, add two rows with the following               values: Row 1: Operation :  Field Changed Table Name :  Contract                        ( PX.Objects.CT.Contract  table) Field Name :  Status Operator : And Row 2: Operation :  New Field Value Table Name :  Contract                        ( PX.Objects.CT.Contract  table) Field Name :  Status Condition :  Equals Value 1 :  Active On the  Subscribers  tab, select a notification template. For             this example, you would create a notification template that specifies as the recipient             of the email a placeholder that has the system extract the default email address of the             customer contact specified in the activated contract.  Business Event Processing When a business event is configured and is active—that is, the  Active          check box is selected for it on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM302050|SM302050]) Business Events (SM302050) form—the         system starts monitoring data changes made to the data included in the generic inquiry form.         If a record has been changed, the system checks whether the record satisfies the conditions         specified on the  Trigger Conditions  tab. If the record satisfies the         conditions (which means that the business event has occurred), the system processes the         subscribers of the event that are specified on the  Subscribers  tab.  After all subscribers of the business event have been processed, the system saves information     about the processing of the business event, which you can view on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM502030|SM502030]) Business Event History (SM502030) form. The following diagram illustrates the configuration and processing of business events related         to record changes.

==Business Event Configuration==
To configure the system to perform actions based on the occurrence of particular events, which the system checks for at the schedule you specify, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_50|Business Events] ([~/?ScreenId=SM302050|SM302050]) form, you create a business event of the ''Trigger by Schedule'' type and specify the following: [anchor|#_861d8622-f713-4f2a-875b-8e8ea6143e1b][anchor|#_78b12dad-74e8-4d65-8dca-63e5ee31d752]
*The data for monitoring.
*:In the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_50|Business Events] form, you can select an existing generic inquiry form or the generic inquiry form, which you have created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_80_00|Generic Inquiry] ([~/?ScreenId=SM208000|SM208000]) form, that defines the data for the system to monitor.
*The conditions that must be met for the system to perform actions.
*:On the '''Trigger Conditions''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_50|Business Events] form, you configure the conditions when the system should perform actions related to the business process. These conditions are based on the fields of the records of the generic inquiry. The actions are performed if the inquiry results satisfy the specified conditions.[anchor|#_75fa3de7-8493-4bab-a115-8900cecf69b7]
*The action or actions that the system should perform if the specified conditions have been met.
*:On the '''Subscribers''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_50|Business Events] form, you select a subscriber that has been configured; if needed, you can select multiple subscribers (one in each row). To create a new subscriber, you click '''Create Subscriber''' and click the menu command corresponding to the type of the subscriber, which causes the system to open the Acumatica ERP form (for an email or a push notification to a mobile device) or the dialog box and form (for an import scenario script) to create the subscriber. For details about subscribers of both types, see [HelpRoot_Administration\AI__con_Business_Event_Subscribers|Subscribers of Business Events].
*:((({S:Warn}If you plan to send push notifications to users of the Acumatica mobile app on mobile devices, make sure that the generic inquiry you have selected (in the '''Screen Name''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_50|Business Events] ([~/?ScreenId=SM302050|SM302050]) form) includes the <tt>NoteID</tt> data field for the entity that you plan to display when a user taps a notification on the mobile device. For example, suppose that you want to notify employees about new opportunities assigned to them, and when an employee taps this notification, the app should display the new opportunity. In this case, you should add the <tt>NoteID</tt> data field for the object <tt>CROpportunity</tt> on the '''Results Grid''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_80_00|Generic Inquiry] ([~/?ScreenId=SM208000|SM208000]) form. 
)))
*:If you have specified multiple subscribers on the '''Subscribers''' tab for the business event, you can select the '''Stop on Error''' check box in the row of a subscriber to direct the system to process subsequent subscribers in the list only if no error has occurred while the system was processing the current subscriber. 
*The schedule or schedules that dictate when the system should check whether the data meets the specified conditions.
*:On the '''Schedules''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_50|Business Events] form, you select a schedule that has been configured; if needed, you can select multiple schedules (one in each row). If the needed schedule has not been configured, you click '''Create Schedule''', which causes the system to open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_20|Automation Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=SM205020|SM205020]) form. On this form, you configure the schedule by which the system should check the conditions on the data for monitoring. Also, in the '''Screen ID''' box, you must specify the generic inquiry that defines the data for monitoring. 

In the '''Raise Event''' box of the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_50|Business Events] form, you can also select how the system should generate the business event: for each record that satisfies the trigger conditions or for the whole set of records that satisfy the trigger conditions.{br}

For details on how to configure the system to monitor business events by a schedule, see [HelpRoot_Administration\AI__how_Business_Event_by_Schedule|To Monitor the Business Process Data by a Schedule].
==An Example of the Business Event Configuration==
For example, suppose that you need to configure the system to send a email to the owner of an opportunity when the opportunity is one month from its estimated close date and the opportunity hasn&rsquo;t been updated for more than seven days. You would do the following:[anchor|#_c4d03d62-ce34-4be5-b2b5-138c84734c7c]
#Optional: Create a generic inquiry (based on the <tt>PX.Objects.CR.CROpportunity</tt> and <tt>PX.Objects.CR.Contact</tt> tables) that retrieves from the system all opportunities that have the ''Open'' status and an estimated close date that is one month from today&rsquo;s date; the generic inquiry should also retrieve the contact email address of the owner of the respective opportunity.
#:((({S:Warn}You could instead use an existing generic inquiry when you define the business event, if one exists that retrieves the needed data.
)))
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_50|Business Events] ([~/?ScreenId=SM302050|SM302050]) form, create a business event with the following settings:
#*'''Type''': ''Trigger by Schedule''
#* '''Raise Event''': ''For Each Record'' (to make the system generate a business event for each opportunity that satisfies the conditions)
#*'''Screen Name''': The generic inquiry you have createdof the ''Trigger by Schedule'' type, and select the generic inquiry you have created in the '''Screen Name''' box. 
#On the '''Trigger Conditions''' tab, select the following values:
#*'''Table Name''': ''Opportunity'' (<tt>PX.Objects.CR.CROpportunity</tt> table)
#*'''Field Name''': ''Last Modified Date''
#* '''Condition''': ''Is Less Than''
#* '''Value 1''': ''@Today-7''
#On the '''Subscribers''' tab, select a notification template. You can create a notification template that specifies as the recipient a placeholder for the email address of the owner of the opportunity to be closed. 
#On the '''Schedules''' tab, create a schedule that is executed every day.

==Business Event Processing==
When a business event is configured and is active—that is, the '''Active''' check box is selected for it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_50|Business Events] ([~/?ScreenId=SM302050|SM302050]) form—and the next schedule execution date comes, the system executes the generic inquiry. If the generic inquiry returns any data, the system checks whether the returned records satisfy the conditions specified on the '''Trigger Conditions''' tab. If there are records that satisfy the conditions (which means that the business event has occurred), the system processes the subscribers of the event that are specified on the '''Subscribers''' tab. {br}

After all subscribers of the business event have been processed, the system saves information about the processing of the business event, which you can view on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_50_20_30|Business Event History] ([~/?ScreenId=SM502030|SM502030]) form.{br}

The following diagram shows how business events checked for on a schedule are configured and processed.[anchor|#_2732e838-e4cc-4ff9-8765-0c9da2ece6d8][anchor|#_08d1453e-875f-4a0d-8542-dbb7e171fd24][image:UserGuide/Images/BusinessEventBySchedule.png|popup|The processing of a business event monitored on a schedule|450px]

A subscriber of a business event is an entity in the system (such as an email notification or a script based on an import scenario) that the system processes in a particular way when the business event occurs. In this topic, you can find information about the available types of subscribers.
==Email Notifications==
If a subscriber to a business event is an email notification, when the business event occurs, the system sends an email (or multiple emails) to particular recipients, based on the settings of the notification template that you have specified for the business event.{br}

You configure a subscriber of the ''Email Notification'' type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_03|Notification Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=SM204003|SM204003]) form. On this form, you must specify the sender, the recipients of the notification emails, and the template for the email message. Also, in the '''Screen''' box, you specify the generic inquiry of the business event. ((({S:Warn}The easiest way to create an email notification for a business event is to do so while you are creating the event on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_50|Business Events] ([~/?ScreenId=SM302050|SM302050]) form: On the table toolbar of the '''Subscribers''' tab, you click '''Create Subscriber''' > '''Email Notification'''. This causes the system to open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_03|Notification Templates] form with the correct value selected in the '''Screen''' box.
)))
In the notification template you define on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_03|Notification Templates] form, you can use placeholders for the values of the form elements. As the placeholders, you can use the data fields available in the results of the generic inquiry of the business event as follows:[anchor|#_c0b0f216-5565-4664-97ef-5327c2504df3]
*To specify the recipients of the emails (in the '''To''', '''CC''', and '''BCC''' boxes), you can use the data fields (as the placeholders, separated with semicolons) that hold email addresses and whose values are retrieved when the business event occurs. For example, if you need to monitor cases and send notifications to assignees, you can use a placeholder for the email address of the assignee, such as {{((Contact_eMail))}}. 
*To specify the subject ('''Subject''') of the notification template, you can use any data fields whose values are retrieved when the business event occurs.
*In the body of the notification template (on the '''Message''' tab), you can click '''Insert Data Field''' on the formatting toolbar to insert as a placeholder any data field whose value is retrieved when the business event occurs. Also, you can click '''Insert Previous Data Field''' to insert as a placeholder any data field whose value was retrieved before the business event occurred. You can use this ability to demonstrate how the value of the data field has changed, for example, a case status has changed from ''New'' to ''Open''.
*In the '''Link to Account''', '''Link to Contact''', and '''Link to Entity''' boxes, you can use the data fields that contain a business account ID, contact ID, or note ID, respectively, and whose values are retrieved when the business event occurs. The system creates an activity of the ''Email'' type and links this activity (if any of the values of the specified fields are not empty in the results of the generic inquiry) to the specified business account, contact, or entity. You can then view the activity on the '''Activities''' tab of the corresponding form or in the '''Tasks & Activities''' dialog box, which opens if you click '''Activities''' on the form title bar. For details about activities, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CR__con_Managing_Your_Tasks__Events__and_Activities|Managing Tasks, Events, and Activities].

When the business event occurs and the system processes the subscriber of the ''Email Notification'' type, the system extracts the values of the fields specified for placeholders of the template (from the results of the generic inquiry that satisfy the conditions) and inserts these values into the email. The system then sends the email or emails to the recipients.{br}

If the notification has been sent successfully, the system considers the subscriber to be successfully processed and adds a record on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_50_20_30|Business Event History] ([~/?ScreenId=SM502030|SM502030]) form. If any error has occurred during the processing of the notification template, the system displays the error on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_50_20_30|Business Event History] form for the business event.
==Push Notifications==
If a subscriber to a business event is a push notification, when the business event occurs, the system sends a push notification or multiple push notifications to the mobile devices of particular recipients, based on the settings of the notification template that you have specified for the business event.{br}

You configure a subscriber of the ''Mobile Push Notification'' type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_04|Mobile Notifications] ([~/?ScreenId=SM204004|SM204004]) form. On this form, you must specify the push delivery method, the description, the recipients of the notifications, and the template for the message. Also, in the '''Screen''' box, you specify the generic inquiry of the business event. ((({S:Warn}The easiest way to create a push notification for a business event is to do so while you are creating the event on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_50|Business Events] ([~/?ScreenId=SM302050|SM302050]) form: On the table toolbar of the '''Subscribers''' tab, you click '''Create Subscriber''' > '''Mobile Push Notification'''. This causes the system to open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_04|Mobile Notifications] form with the ''Push'' option selected in the '''Delivery Method''' box and the correct value selected in the '''Screen''' box.
)))
In the notification template you define on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_04|Mobile Notifications] form, you can use placeholders for the values of the form elements. As the placeholders, you can use the data fields available in the results of the generic inquiry of the business event as follows:[anchor|#_9bff3da5-d8a6-4ff2-b526-bc8da8a248c7]
*To specify the recipients of the notification (in the '''To''' box), you can use the data fields (as the placeholders, separated with semicolons) that hold user identifiers and whose values are retrieved when the business event occurs. For example, if you need to monitor cases and send notifications to assignees, you can use a placeholder for the identifier of the assignee, such as {{((CRCase_ownerID!PKID))}}. 
*You use the needed fields to specify which entity should be opened by the mobile app after a user taps the notification (in the '''Destination Entity ID''' box). Make sure that the {{NoteID}} data field is present in the results of the generic inquiry for the entity. For example, suppose that you selected ''Sales Orders'' in '''Destination Screen ID''' and want to open a particular order for the user; then you need to select the {{NoteID}} data field for the {{SOOrder}} object in '''Destination Entity ID'''.
*To specify the subject ('''Title''') of the notification template, you can use any data fields whose values are retrieved when the business event occurs. For example, the subject could be {{Opportunity ((CROpportunity_opportunityID)) has been assigned to you}}. 
*In the body of the notification template (on the '''Message''' tab), you can click '''Insert Data Field''' on the formatting toolbar to insert as a placeholder any data field whose value is retrieved when the business event occurs. Also, you can click '''Insert Previous Data Field''' to insert as a placeholder any data field whose value was retrieved before the business event occurred. You can use this ability to demonstrate how the value of the data field has changed, for example, a case status has changed from ''New'' to ''Open''.

When the business event occurs and the system processes the subscriber of the ''Mobile Push Notification'' type, the system extracts the values of the fields specified for placeholders of the template (from the results of the generic inquiry that satisfy the conditions) and inserts these values into the notification. The system then sends the push notification or notifications to appropriate mobile devices of the recipients.{br}

If the notification has been sent successfully, the system considers the subscriber to be successfully processed and adds a record on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_50_20_30|Business Event History] ([~/?ScreenId=SM502030|SM502030]) form. If any error has occurred during the processing of the notification template, the system displays the error on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_50_20_30|Business Event History] form for the business event.
==SMS Notifications==
If a subscriber to a business event is a mobile text notification, when the business event occurs, the system sends a mobile text notification (or multiple text notifications) to the mobile devices of particular recipients, based on the settings of the notification template that you have specified for the business event.{br}

The system uses an SMS service account configured on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_35|SMS Providers] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203535|SM203535]) form to send mobile text notifications. You can configure an account with the Amazon or Twilio service provider.{br}

You configure a subscriber of the ''Mobile SMS Notification'' type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_04|Mobile Notifications] ([~/?ScreenId=SM204004|SM204004]) form. On this form, you must specify the SMS delivery method, the service provider, the description, the recipients of the notifications, and the template for the message. Also, in the '''Screen''' box, you specify the generic inquiry of the business event. ((({S:Warn}The easiest way to create a text notification for a business event is to do so while you are creating the event on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_50|Business Events] ([~/?ScreenId=SM302050|SM302050]) form: On the table toolbar of the '''Subscribers''' tab, you click '''Create Subscriber''' > '''Mobile SMS Notification'''. This causes the system to open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_04|Mobile Notifications] form with the ''SMS'' option selected in the '''Delivery Method''' box and the correct value selected in the '''Screen''' box.
)))
In the notification template you define on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_04|Mobile Notifications] form, you can use placeholders for the values of the form elements. As the placeholders, you can use the data fields available in the results of the generic inquiry of the business event as follows:[anchor|#_40b737ba-3e86-4836-ae58-8a13fd766d1f]
*To specify the recipients of the notification (in the '''To''' box), you use the data fields (as the placeholders, separated with semicolons) that hold user phone numbers and whose values are retrieved when the business event occurs. Also, you can specify phone numbers explicitly, separated with semicolons. 
*:For example, if you want to send a text about a shipment confirmation to a customer, you can use a placeholder for the identifier of the customer&rsquo;s phone number, such as {{((SOShipment_customerID!DefContactID!Phone1))}}.
*In the body of the notification template (on the '''Message''' tab), you can click '''Insert Data Field''' on the formatting toolbar to insert as a placeholder any data field whose value is retrieved when the business event occurs. Also, you can click '''Insert Previous Data Field''' to insert as a placeholder any data field whose value was retrieved before the business event occurred. 
*:For example, suppose that you would like to notify a customer that the status of the case has changed to another one. You insert the {{((CRCase_status))}} data field, which represents the placeholder of the case status and whose value will be retrieved when the business event occurs. To show the previous status of the case, you click '''Insert Previous Data Field''' and select the same data field; the system will insert the placeholder with the {{PREV}} function, which in our example is {{PREV((CRCase_status))}}. When the event occurs, the system retrieves the value that the field had before the event has occurred. 

When the business event occurs and the system processes the subscriber of the ''Mobile SMS Notification'' type, the system extracts the values of the fields specified for placeholders of the template (from the results of the generic inquiry that satisfy the conditions) and inserts these values into the notification. The system then sends the text notification or notifications to the mobile devices of the recipients.{br}

If the notification has been sent successfully, the system considers the subscriber to be successfully processed and adds a record on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_50_20_30|Business Event History] ([~/?ScreenId=SM502030|SM502030]) form. If any error has occurred during the processing of the notification template, the system displays the error on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_50_20_30|Business Event History] form for the business event.
==Import Scenarios==
If a subscriber is an import scenario, when the business event occurs, the system executes on the target Acumatica ERP form the sequence of instructions defined by the import scenario that you have specified for the event. With the import scenario, you can perform any action defined on the target Acumatica ERP form, such as release of a document.{br}

You configure a subscriber of the ''Import Scenario'' type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) form. We recommend that you open this form to create the subscriber from the '''Subscribers''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_50|Business Events] ([~/?ScreenId=SM302050|SM302050]) form: You click '''Create Subscriber''' > '''Import Scenario''' on the table toolbar and specify the name of the scenario in the '''Create Import Scenario Subscriber''' dialog box, which opens. {br}

When you enter the name and click '''OK''' to close the dialog box, the system automatically creates on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_15|Data Providers] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206015|SM206015]) form a data provider of the ''Business Process Provider'' type for the import scenario (if the provider has not been created earlier for the generic inquiry of the business event). For this provider, the ''ScreenID'' parameter on the '''Parameters''' tab is set to the generic inquiry of the business event. The provider has two schema objects on the '''Schema''' tab: ''Results'' and ''PreviousResults''. Each object includes all fields of the results of the generic inquiry. The ''Results'' object returns the values of these fields when the business event occurs. The ''PreviousResults'' object returns the values of these fields before the business event has occurred. {br}

When the data provider has been created, the system opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) form with the import scenario name and the data provider specified. On the form, you complete creation of the import scenario by specifying the following:[anchor|#_817444ab-02a3-42b6-b456-a5fcd1dcaf9c]
*In the '''Screen Name''' box, the target Acumatica ERP form (which can be any Acumatica ERP form) on which the system should execute the sequence of instructions when the business event occurs.
*In the '''Provider Object''' box, the ''Results'' provider object or the ''PreviousResults'' provider object, depending on whether you want the system to extract the values before the business event has occurred or the values when the business event has occurred. The system uses the specified results of the generic inquiry to perform the sequence of instructions on the target form. 
*On the '''Mapping''' tab, the mapping of the import scenario—that is, the sequence of instructions that the system should perform on the target form when the business event occurs. When you are mapping fields, you should first map the key fields: the fields that the system uses to distinguish records that belong to different documents. After you have mapped the key fields, you should map other fields in the order in which you would fill them in on the form. At the end of the mapping of the scenario that creates or updates data in the system, to save the record to the database, you have to insert a row with the ''&lt;Action: Save&gt;'' action. For details about import scenario mapping, see [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__mng_Scenario_Mapping|Configuring Scenario Mapping].

You can also specify other parameters of the import scenario and source and target restrictions. For more information about import scenario configuration, see [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__mng_Configuring_Import_Scenarios|Configuring Import Scenarios].{br}

When the business event occurs and the system processes the ''Import Scenario'' subscriber, the system extracts the values (either the values before the business event has occurred or the values when the business event has occurred, depending on the provider object you specified for the import scenario) of the fields of the generic inquiry results and uses them as the source fields of the import scenario. The system executes on the target Acumatica ERP form the sequence of instructions defined by the import scenario. {br}

If the scenario has been executed successfully, the system considers the subscriber to be successfully processed and adds a record on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_50_20_30|Business Event History] ([~/?ScreenId=SM502030|SM502030]) form. If any error has occurred during the processing of the import scenario, the system displays the error on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_50_20_30|Business Event History] form for the business event.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Subscribers of Business Events A subscriber of a business event is an entity in the system (such as         an email notification or a script based on an import scenario) that the system processes in         a particular way when the business event occurs. In this topic, you can find information         about the available types of subscribers. Email Notifications If a subscriber to a business event is an email notification, when the business event         occurs, the system sends an email (or multiple emails) to particular recipients, based on         the settings of the notification template that you have specified for the business         event. You configure a subscriber of the  Email Notification  type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM204003|SM204003]) Notification Templates (SM204003) form. On this form, you must specify the         sender, the recipients of the notification emails, and the template for the email message.         Also, in the  Screen  box, you specify the generic inquiry of the         business event.  The easiest way to create an email notification for a business event is to do so while         you are creating the event on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM302050|SM302050]) Business Events (SM302050) form: On the         table toolbar of the  Subscribers  tab, you click  Create Subscriber Email Notification . This causes the system to open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM204003|SM204003]) Notification Templates form with the correct value selected in the            Screen  box. In the notification template you define on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM204003|SM204003]) Notification Templates         form, you can use placeholders for the values of the form elements. As the placeholders, you         can use the data fields available in the results of the generic inquiry of the business         event as follows: To specify the recipients of the emails (in the  To ,              CC , and  BCC  boxes), you can use the data           fields (as the placeholders, separated with semicolons) that hold email addresses and           whose values are retrieved when the business event occurs. For example, if you need to           monitor cases and send notifications to assignees, you can use a placeholder for the email           address of the assignee, such as  ((Contact_eMail)) .  To specify the subject ( Subject ) of the notification template,           you can use any data fields whose values are retrieved when the business event           occurs. In the body of the notification template (on the  Message  tab),           you can click  Insert Data Field  on the formatting toolbar to insert           as a placeholder any data field whose value is retrieved when the business event occurs.           Also, you can click  Insert Previous Data Field  to insert as a           placeholder any data field whose value was retrieved before the business event occurred.           You can use this ability to demonstrate how the value of the data field has changed, for           example, a case status has changed from  New  to  Open . In the  Link to Account ,  Link to Contact ,           and  Link to Entity  boxes, you can use the data fields that contain           a business account ID, contact ID, or note ID, respectively, and whose values are           retrieved when the business event occurs. The system creates an activity of the              Email  type and links this activity (if any of the values of the specified fields           are not empty in the results of the generic inquiry) to the specified business account,           contact, or entity. You can then view the activity on the              Activities  tab of the corresponding form or in the              Tasks & Activities  dialog box, which opens if you click              Activities  on the form title bar. For details about activities,           see  Managing Tasks, Events, and Activities. When the business event occurs and the system processes the subscriber of the  Email           Notification  type, the system extracts the values of the fields specified for         placeholders of the template (from the results of the generic inquiry that satisfy the         conditions) and inserts these values into the email. The system then sends the email or         emails to the recipients. If the notification has been sent successfully, the system considers the subscriber to be         successfully processed and adds a record on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM502030|SM502030]) Business Event History (SM502030)         form. If any error has occurred during the processing of the notification template, the         system displays the error on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM502030|SM502030]) Business Event History form for the business         event. Push Notifications If a subscriber to a business event is a push notification, when the business event occurs,         the system sends a push notification or multiple push notifications to the mobile devices of         particular recipients, based on the settings of the notification template that you have         specified for the business event. You configure a subscriber of the  Mobile Push Notification  type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM204004|SM204004]) Mobile Notifications (SM204004) form. On this form, you must specify the push         delivery method, the description, the recipients of the notifications, and the template for         the message. Also, in the  Screen  box, you specify the generic inquiry         of the business event.  The easiest way to create a push notification for a business event is to do so while you         are creating the event on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM302050|SM302050]) Business Events (SM302050) form: On the table         toolbar of the  Subscribers  tab, you click  Create Subscriber Mobile Push Notification . This causes the system to open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM204004|SM204004]) Mobile Notifications form with         the  Push  option selected in the  Delivery Method  box and the         correct value selected in the  Screen  box. In the notification template you define on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM204004|SM204004]) Mobile Notifications form, you         can use placeholders for the values of the form elements. As the placeholders, you can use         the data fields available in the results of the generic inquiry of the business event as         follows: To specify the recipients of the notification (in the  To  box),           you can use the data fields (as the placeholders, separated with semicolons) that hold           user identifiers and whose values are retrieved when the business event occurs. For           example, if you need to monitor cases and send notifications to assignees, you can use a           placeholder for the identifier of the assignee, such as              ((CRCase_ownerID!PKID)) .  You use the needed fields to specify which entity should be opened by the mobile app           after a user taps the notification (in the  Destination Entity ID            box). Make sure that the  NoteID  data field is present in the results of           the generic inquiry for the entity. For example, suppose that you selected  Sales             Orders  in  Destination Screen ID  and want to open a particular           order for the user; then you need to select the  NoteID  data field for the              SOOrder  object in  Destination Entity ID . To specify  the subject ( Title ) of the notification template, you           can use any data fields whose values are retrieved when the business event occurs. For           example, the subject could be  Opportunity ((CROpportunity_opportunityID)) has been             assigned to you .  In the body of the notification template (on the  Message  tab),           you can click  Insert Data Field  on the formatting toolbar to insert           as a placeholder any data field whose value is retrieved when the business event occurs.           Also, you can click  Insert Previous Data Field  to insert as a           placeholder any data field whose value was retrieved before the business event occurred.           You can use this ability to demonstrate how the value of the data field has changed, for           example, a case status has changed from  New  to  Open . When the business event occurs and the system processes the subscriber of the  Mobile           Push Notification  type, the system extracts the values of the fields specified for         placeholders of the template (from the results of the generic inquiry that satisfy the         conditions) and inserts these values into the notification. The system then sends the push         notification or notifications to appropriate mobile devices of the recipients. If the notification has been sent successfully, the system considers the subscriber to be         successfully processed and adds a record on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM502030|SM502030]) Business Event History (SM502030)         form. If any error has occurred during the processing of the notification template, the         system displays the error on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM502030|SM502030]) Business Event History form for the business         event. SMS Notifications If a subscriber to a business event is a mobile text notification, when the business event         occurs, the system sends a mobile text notification (or multiple text notifications) to the         mobile devices of particular recipients, based on the settings of the notification template         that you have specified for the business event. The system uses an SMS service account configured on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM203535|SM203535]) SMS Providers         (SM203535) form to send mobile text notifications. You can configure an account with the         Amazon or Twilio service provider. You configure a subscriber of the  Mobile SMS Notification  type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM204004|SM204004]) Mobile Notifications (SM204004) form. On this form, you must specify the SMS delivery         method, the service provider, the description, the recipients of the notifications, and the         template for the message. Also, in the  Screen  box, you specify the         generic inquiry of the business event.  The easiest way to create a text notification for a business event is to do so while you         are creating the event on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM302050|SM302050]) Business Events (SM302050) form: On the table         toolbar of the  Subscribers  tab, you click  Create Subscriber Mobile SMS Notification . This causes the system to open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM204004|SM204004]) Mobile Notifications form with         the  SMS  option selected in the  Delivery Method  box and the         correct value selected in the  Screen  box. In the notification template you define on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM204004|SM204004]) Mobile Notifications form, you         can use placeholders for the values of the form elements. As the placeholders, you can use         the data fields available in the results of the generic inquiry of the business event as         follows: To specify the recipients of the notification (in the  To  box),             you use the data fields (as the placeholders, separated with semicolons) that hold user             phone numbers and whose values are retrieved when the business event occurs. Also, you             can specify phone numbers explicitly, separated with semicolons.  For example, if you want to send a text about a shipment confirmation to a customer,             you can use a placeholder for the identifier of the customer's phone number, such as                ((SOShipment_customerID!DefContactID!Phone1)) . In the body of the notification template (on the  Message  tab),             you can click  Insert Data Field  on the formatting toolbar to             insert as a placeholder any data field whose value is retrieved when the business event             occurs. Also, you can click  Insert Previous Data Field  to insert             as a placeholder any data field whose value was retrieved before the business event             occurred.  For example, suppose that you would like to notify a customer that the status of the             case has changed to another one. You insert the  ((CRCase_status))  data             field, which represents the placeholder of the case status and whose value will be             retrieved when the business event occurs. To show the previous status of the case, you             click  Insert Previous Data Field  and select the same data field;             the system will insert the placeholder with the  PREV  function, which in             our example is  PREV((CRCase_status)) . When the event occurs, the system             retrieves the value that the field had before the event has occurred.  When the business event occurs and the system processes the subscriber of the  Mobile SMS           Notification  type, the system extracts the values of the fields specified for         placeholders of the template (from the results of the generic inquiry that satisfy the         conditions) and inserts these values into the notification. The system then sends the text         notification or notifications to the mobile devices of the recipients. If the notification has been sent successfully, the system considers the subscriber to be         successfully processed and adds a record on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM502030|SM502030]) Business Event History (SM502030)         form. If any error has occurred during the processing of the notification template, the         system displays the error on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM502030|SM502030]) Business Event History form for the business         event. Import Scenarios If a subscriber is an import scenario, when the business event occurs, the system executes         on the target  Acumatica ERP form the sequence of instructions defined by the import scenario that you have specified         for the event. With the import scenario, you can perform any action defined on the target            Acumatica ERP form, such as release of a document. You configure a subscriber of the  Import Scenario  type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) Import Scenarios (SM206025) form. We recommend that you open this form to create         the subscriber from the  Subscribers  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM302050|SM302050]) Business Events (SM302050) form: You click  Create Subscriber Import Scenario  on the table toolbar and specify the name of the scenario in the            Create Import Scenario Subscriber  dialog box, which opens.  When you enter the name and click  OK  to close the dialog box, the         system automatically creates on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM206015|SM206015]) Data Providers (SM206015) form a data         provider of the  Business Process Provider  type for the import scenario (if the         provider has not been created earlier for the generic inquiry of the business event). For         this provider, the  ScreenID  parameter on the  Parameters  tab is         set to the generic inquiry of the business event. The provider has two schema objects on the            Schema  tab:  Results  and  PreviousResults . Each object         includes all fields of the results of the generic inquiry. The  Results  object returns         the values of these fields when the business event occurs. The  PreviousResults  object         returns the values of these fields before the business event has occurred.  When the data provider has been created, the system opens the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) Import Scenarios (SM206025) form with the import scenario name and the data provider specified. On the         form, you complete creation of the import scenario by specifying the following: In the  Screen Name  box, the target  Acumatica ERP form (which can be any  Acumatica ERP form) on which the system should execute the sequence of instructions when the business           event occurs. In the  Provider Object  box, the  Results  provider object or           the  PreviousResults  provider object, depending on whether you want the system to           extract the values before the business event has occurred or the values when the business           event has occurred. The system uses the specified results of the generic inquiry to           perform the sequence of instructions on the target form.  On the  Mapping  tab, the mapping of the import scenario—that           is, the sequence of instructions that the system should perform on the target form when           the business event occurs. When you are mapping fields, you should first map the key           fields: the fields that the system uses to distinguish records that belong to different           documents. After you have mapped the key fields, you should map other fields in the order           in which you would fill them in on the form. At the end of the mapping of the scenario           that creates or updates data in the system, to save the record to the database, you have           to insert a row with the  <Action: Save>  action. For details about import           scenario mapping, see  Configuring Scenario Mapping. You can also specify other parameters of the import scenario and source and target         restrictions. For more information about import scenario configuration, see  Configuring Import Scenarios. When the business event occurs and the system processes the  Import Scenario          subscriber, the system extracts the values (either the values before the business event has         occurred or the values when the business event has occurred, depending on the provider         object you specified for the import scenario) of the fields of the generic inquiry results         and uses them as the source fields of the import scenario. The system executes on the target            Acumatica ERP form the sequence of instructions defined by the import scenario.  If the scenario has been executed successfully, the system considers the subscriber to be         successfully processed and adds a record on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM502030|SM502030]) Business Event History (SM502030)         form. If any error has occurred during the processing of the import scenario, the system         displays the error on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM502030|SM502030]) Business Event History form for the business event. ]]></column>

==Before You Proceed==
You need to determine which data related to the business process Acumatica ERP should monitor. You can use an existing generic inquiry created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_80_00|Generic Inquiry] ([~/?ScreenId=SM208000|SM208000]) form or create a generic inquiry that defines the data for the system to monitor. For details on creating generic inquiries, see [HelpRoot_ReportingTools\SM__MNG_Managing_Generic_Inquiry|Managing Generic Inquiries] in the Reporting Tools guide and the [https://openuni.acumatica.com/courses/reporting/s130-inquiries-reports-and-dashboards/|S130 Reporting: Data Retrieval and Analysis] training course.

==Before You Proceed==
You need to determine which data related to the business process Acumatica ERP should monitor. You can use an existing generic inquiry created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_80_00|Generic Inquiry] ([~/?ScreenId=SM208000|SM208000]) form or create a generic inquiry that defines the data for the system to monitor. For details on creating generic inquiries, see [HelpRoot_ReportingTools\SM__MNG_Managing_Generic_Inquiry|Managing Generic Inquiries] in the Reporting Tools guide and the [https://openuni.acumatica.com/courses/reporting/s130-inquiries-reports-and-dashboards/|S130 Reporting: Data Retrieval and Analysis] training course.

On the  Schedules  tab, add a schedule or multiple                     schedules for the business event by doing one of the following for each                         schedule: If a schedule related to the generic inquiry form of the business event                             has already been configured in the system, add a new row to the table as                                 follows: Make sure the  Active  check box is                                     selected. In the  Schedule ID  column, select the                                     previously configured schedule. Make sure the correct time zone and the date when the schedule                                     will be executed next are specified as the  Time                                         Zone  and  Next Execution                                         Date , respectively. If you want to create a schedule for the business event, do the                                 following: On the table toolbar, click  Create                                         Schedule .

Optional: In the  Process with Branch  box, select the                     branch under which the schedule should be processed. For example, if documents                     are created by this schedule, the system creates these documents and specifies                     the selected branch for each document.  Optional: Change the time zone in which the schedule will operate. By default,                     the time zone specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) User Profile                     (SM203010) form for the currently signed-in user is selected.  On the  Schedule  tab, configure             the execution dates and time as follows: Specify how often the schedule execution should be performed: To execute the schedule daily or every  x  days, do the following:                                  In the  Schedule Type  section, select                                          Daily .

In the  Every x Week(s)  box, type the                                     number of weeks between successive executions of the                                     schedule. Select the appropriate check boxes for the day or days of the                                     week on which the schedule should be executed. To execute the schedule monthly or every  x  months, do the                             following:  In the  Schedule Type  section, select                                          Monthly . Optional: In the  Schedule Details                                      section, in the  Next Execution Date  box,                                     select the date when the schedule should be executed next. In the  Every x Month(s)  box, type the                                     number of months between successive executions of the                                     schedule. Select when the schedule should be executed: the day of the                                     month, or the week in the month and the day of the week (such as                                     the third Friday of the month). To execute the schedule once per financial period or every  x                              financial periods, perform the following steps:  In the  Schedule Type  section, select                                          By Financial Period . Optional: In the  Schedule Details                                      section, in the  Next Execution Date  box,                                     select the date when the schedule should be executed next. In the  Every x Period(s)  box, type the                                     number of financial periods between successive executions of the                                     schedule. Select the appropriate option button to indicate when the                                     schedules should be executed: at the end of the period, at the                                     start of the period, or on a fixed day of the period (which you                                     should specify if you select this option button). In the  Execution Time  section, specify the particular                     time of the day to start and stop the processing as follows: In the  Starts On  box, select the hour and minute                             when the first execution of the schedule should start. If you want the processing to be stopped at specific time or you want                             the processing to be repeated multiple times a day, in the                                  Stops On  box, select the hour and minute when                             the first execution of the schedule should stop.  If execution of the schedule should be repeated multiple times a day, in                             the  Every  box, select the interval between                             successive executions of the schedule. In the  Next Execution Time  box, make sure the                             next execution time is correct. If you want the system to execute the schedule at exactly the time                             specified in the  Next Execution Time  box, select                             the  Exact Time  check box. If the check box is                             cleared, the system may shift the next execution time of the schedule by                             multiple minutes. Optional: If you want to specify filtering conditions to be                                     applied to the records retrieved by the generic inquiry of the                                     business event, on the  Conditions  tab,                                     for each condition, do the following: Make sure the  Active  check box is                                             selected.

The user interface of Acumatica ERP provides predefined user interface elements, such as workspaces and workspace tiles and links, which you can configure to adjust the user interface to the business processes of your organization. Because the employees of your organization can locate the forms they use most right away, they can perform their working tasks related to Acumatica ERP more easily. {br}

For the description of the user interface elements, see [HelpRoot_Interface\UIG__con_New_UI| Acumatica ERP User Interface].{br}

In this topic, you will read about the capabilities in the system for customizing the user interface.{br}{TOC}
==User Role for the Customizing the User Interface==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_60|Security Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201060|SM201060]) form in the '''Menu Editor Role''' box you can specify any available user role. A user with this role will be able to customize the user interface (in particular, main menu and workspace links) in the special Menu Editing mode. The changes made in this mode are applied to all users of Acumatica ERP. ((({S:Warn}We recommend creating a dedicated role and assign it to those users who should have access to the user interface modification.
)))
==Customization of the User Interface==
You can customize the user interface as follows:[anchor|#_60b6fc42-9307-4431-a8e8-bb30a142e528]
*Adjust the list of workspaces that are items on the main menu: You can keep in the user interface only the workspaces that correspond to the business processes of your organization. To perform this task, you can add new workspaces and populate them with items (tiles and links that provide access to forms and reports), delete existing menu items for workspaces that do not comply with your business processes, and rename existing workspaces. For details, see [[#_67fc05a9-d987-4260-93c5-fb47ecc8ea40|Management of the Workspaces Listed on the Main Menu].
*Change the items of a workspace: You can customize a workspace so that only the items that your employees use in their work are displayed there. You can change the list of forms, reports, and dashboards in a workspace, regroup the links to forms and reports in a workspace, reorder the links to forms and reports in a category, remove unnecessary tiles and links to forms, reports, and dashboards from a workspace, and reorder tiles in a workspace. For more information, see [[#_334a2f9f-1e24-42b1-a323-1dff1dd42040|Management of Workspace Tiles and Links].

By using Menu Editing mode, you can customize the user interface in a variety of ways. To switch to this mode, on the main menu, you click the configuration menu button ([anchor|#_55f9375f-7fbb-4a10-a2f2-cdbb78a3972d][image:UserGuide/Images/Main_Menu_Dots.png|25px]) and then click '''Edit Menu'''.{br}

If you customize the user interface in this mode and then decide to return the initial state of the main menu and all workspaces, you can reset the menu settings to default. Changes in the following menu elements will be reset: [anchor|#_2857f336-086f-46e8-934e-9315ddc8785c]
*The list of workspaces that are items on the main menu and the '''More Items''' menu
*Items in each workspace, including categories, tiles, and links to forms, reports, and dashboards
*Items in quick menu of each workspace for all users of the system
*Workspaces pinned to the main menu and unpinned from the main menu for all users of the system
((({S:Hint}If your changes are not applied immediately after refreshing the page, we recommend clearing browser cache and loading the page again.

==Management of the Workspaces Listed on the Main Menu==
The main menu is the primary navigation tool that you and the employees of your organization use when you start working in Acumatica ERP. The system provides you with predefined workspaces list that is displayed in the main menu. The list of workspaces that a user sees by default is determined by the features enabled based on your Acumatica ERP license and the access rights of the user roles assigned to the particular user account.((({S:Warn}You must configure access rights for users to each form and report that belongs to a workspace. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\US__con_Access_Rights|User Access Rights].
)))
If the default list of workspaces (that is, the items on the main menu) does not correspond to the business processes of your organization, you can configure the list as follows:[anchor|#_8aa21377-c78c-41aa-b793-7188779a49df]
*Rename existing workspaces: If a title of any existing workspace is not optimal for your company&rsquo;s users, you can change the title to help users easily find the forms and reports they need. For the steps you need to perform to rename a workspace, see [HelpRoot_Administration\AS__how_Rename_Workspace|To Rename a Workspace].
*Delete existing workspaces: If a predefined workspace does not fit the business processes of your organization and will not be needed by system users, you can completely delete it from the system. When you delete a workspace, the system completely deletes tiles that belonged to the workspace, but forms, reports, and dashboards that belonged to the workspace remain in the system; you can add to other workspaces links to these forms, reports, and dashboards. For the procedure that describes how to delete a workspace, see [HelpRoot_Administration\AS__how_Delete_Workspace|To Delete a Workspace].
*Add new workspaces: If your organization has a specific business process that requires forms, reports, and dashboards from different functional areas to be gathered on one menu for employees&rsquo; convenience, you can create a custom workspace and pin it to the main menu panel. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\AS__how_Add_Configure_Workspace|To Add and Configure a Workspace].

==Management of Workspace Tiles and Links==
Workspaces are used in the system to organize links to forms, reports, and dashboards in a way that is convenient to users. By default, each workspace contains tiles (buttons that provide users with quick access to frequently used forms) and links to forms, reports, and dashboards grouped by categories (such as '''Profiles''', '''Reports''', and '''Preferences'''). Each organization has its own business processes and uses sets of Acumatica ERP forms, reports, and dashboards based on these processes.{br}

To make a workspace convenient for the employees of your organization, you can do the following:[anchor|#_ca8ce07c-2db6-4669-bf80-122b539f3ed4]
*Change the default list of links to forms, reports, and dashboards displayed in a workspace: If you need different forms, reports, and dashboards to be displayed in a workspace, you can change the default list by showing the items that are hidden by default and hiding the items that are displayed by default. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\AS__how_Display_Hide_Forms_in_Workspace_Menu|To Display and Hide Forms in a Workspace].
*Add new links to forms, reports, and dashboards to a workspace: If a link to a form, report, and dashboard is not on a workspace by default but the employees of your organization want to have it in this workspace, you can add the required link to any Acumatica ERP form, report, or dashboard to the workspace. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\AS__how_Add_Form_to_Workspace_Menu|To Add a Link to a Workspace].
*:((({S:Warn}If a link to a form or report has not been added to any of workspaces, you cannot find this form or report by using the '''Search''' box on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen.
)))
*Regroup links to forms, reports, and dashboards in a workspace: If the default grouping of links to forms, reports, and dashboards in a workspace is inconvenient for the employees of your organization, you can move these links to other existing categories, or create a category that fits the terminology used by your employees. Changes to grouping settings affect only the workspace in which they are changed. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\AS__how_Regroup_Items_In_Workspace_Menu|To Regroup Forms and Reports in a Workspace ].
*:((({S:Warn}If you need to move a link to an existing category, which is displayed in a workspace, in the Menu Editing mode, you can simply drag the link to the category.
)))
*Reorder links to forms, reports, and dashboards in a category: In the Menu Editing mode, you can reorder links to forms, reports, and dashboards in a category by dragging each link to a necessary position.
*Remove links to forms, reports, and dashboards from a workspace: If you are sure that users will not need a particular link to a form, report, or dashboard in a workspace, you can remove this link from the workspace. (The form, report, or dashboard will remain in the system.) For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\AS__how_Remove_Form_From_Workspace_Menu|To Remove a Form or Report from a Workspace ].
*Delete preconfigured tiles: If the employees of your organization do not use functions preconfigured in tiles, you can delete the tiles from a workspace to have more space in the workspace. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\AS__how_Delete_Tile_from_Workspace_Menu|To Delete a Tile from a Workspace ].
*:((({S:Hint}After you delete a tile, you will be able to restore it only when restoring menu settings to default.
)))
*Reorder tiles in a workspace: In the Menu Editing mode, you can reorder tiles in a workspace by dragging each tile to a necessary position.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Customization of the UI The user interface of  Acumatica ERP     provides predefined user interface elements, such as workspaces and workspace tiles and links,     which you can configure to adjust the user interface to the business processes of your     organization. Because the employees of your organization can locate the forms they use most     right away, they can perform their working tasks related to  Acumatica ERP     more easily.  For the description of the user interface elements, see   Acumatica ERP User Interface. In this topic, you will read about the capabilities in the system for customizing the user     interface. User Role for the Customizing the User Interface On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201060|SM201060]) Security Preferences (SM201060) form in the  Menu Editor      Role  box you can specify any available user role. A user with this role will be     able to customize the user interface (in particular, main menu and workspace links) in the     special Menu Editing mode. The changes made in this mode are applied to all users of  Acumatica ERP.  We recommend creating a dedicated role and assign it to those users who should have access     to the user interface modification. Customization of the User Interface You can customize the user interface as follows: Adjust the list of workspaces that are items on the main menu: You can keep in the user      interface only the workspaces that correspond to the business processes of your organization.      To perform this task, you can add new workspaces and populate them with items (tiles and links      that provide access to forms and reports), delete existing menu items for workspaces that do      not comply with your business processes, and rename existing workspaces. For details, see  Management of the Workspaces Listed on the Main Menu Management of the Workspaces Listed on the Main Menu. Change the items of a workspace: You can customize a workspace so that only the items that      your employees use in their work are displayed there. You can change the list of forms,      reports, and dashboards in a workspace, regroup the links to forms and reports in a workspace,      reorder the links to forms and reports in a category, remove unnecessary tiles and links to      forms, reports, and dashboards from a workspace, and reorder tiles in a workspace. For more      information, see  Management of Workspace Tiles and Links Management of Workspace Tiles and Links. By using Menu Editing mode, you can customize the user interface in a variety of ways. To     switch to this mode, on the main menu, you click the configuration menu button ( ) and     then click  Edit Menu . If you customize the user interface in this mode and then decide to return the initial state     of the main menu and all workspaces, you can reset the menu settings to default. Changes in the     following menu elements will be reset:  The list of workspaces that are items on the main menu and the  More       Items  menu Items in each workspace, including categories, tiles, and links to forms, reports, and      dashboards Items in quick menu of each workspace for all users of the system Workspaces pinned to the main menu and unpinned from the main menu for all users of the      system If your changes are not applied immediately after refreshing the page, we     recommend clearing browser cache and loading the page again.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
Some companies may want to customize the Acumatica ERP interface style—that is, the look and feel of the user interface—to make it better fit their professional image. One facet of the interface style is the theme of the user interface: the color selections of different parts of the screen. An administrative user can select one of the predefined themes or a custom theme created for the company. The theme represents the package of the files that work together to determine the appearance of the system. {br}

In addition to changing the theme of the user interface, an administrative user can change the logo of each specific branch and the images displayed on the Sign-In page.{br}{TOC}
==Changing the Theme Used in the System==
In Acumatica ERP, an administrative users that has access to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_05|Site Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200505|SM200505]) form can change the theme of the interface the company uses. The theme is selected in the '''Interface Theme''' box of the '''General Defaults''' section. There are two predefined themes available in the system:[anchor|#_231a32ef-ed05-434f-9bbe-29d8e888ae79]
*''Default'': This theme, which is applied by default, consists primarily of warmer blue, light gray, and white colors. 
*''Indigo'': This theme consists primarily of cooler blue, cold gray, and white colors. 

You can select the name of a custom theme in this box, if one has been created. (The next section describes the creation process.){br}

When you select the ''Default'' theme on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_05|Site Preferences] form, the '''Primary Color''' box appears under the '''Interface Theme''' box. You can leave the default color defined in the theme or select a different primary color to be used for the user interface. For multibranch companies, a different color can be specified for each branch to make it easier for employees to distinguish between these branches.((({S:Warn}You can reset the changed primary color to the default color by clicking the '''Reset to Default Colors''' button next to the '''Interface Theme''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_05|Site Preferences] form. The system will reset the primary color for all companies and branches.
)))
You change the color palette of the user interface by using the '''Primary Color''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_05|Site Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200505|SM200505]) form. The selected color palette is applied to all companies and branches, unless in the settings of a specific company or branch, the ability to override the site color is enabled and another color is selected. To change the color for a specific company or a branch, you do the following:[anchor|#_f105bc57-c4f2-4382-9fb0-9cf896a65cc7]
*For a company: On the '''Theme''' section of the '''Visual Appearance''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) form, you first select the '''Override Colors for the Selected Company''' check box, and then select the needed color in the '''Primary Color''' box or specify the hexadecimal number of the color in the box next to the '''Primary Color''' box.
*For a branch: On the '''Theme''' section of the '''Visual Appearance''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_20_00|Branches] ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) form, you first select the '''Override Colors for the Selected Branch''' check box, and then select the needed color in the '''Primary Color''' box or specify the hexadecimal number of the color in the box next to the '''Primary Color''' box.

If a company has multiple branches, you can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] or the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_20_00|Branches] ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) form to select the needed color. The color palette selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] form for the company with multiple branches is applied to all branches of a company unless in the settings of a specific branch, an override of the site color is enabled and another color is selected. 
==Creating a Custom Theme==
Users that have administrative access to the site database that is located on the server can edit the existing themes or create their own to apply them in the system. All themes are saved in the <tt>App&#95;Themes</tt> folder on the path that was specified for the site while the product was installed. When you insert a new folder into the <tt>App&#95;Themes</tt> folder, Acumatica ERP detects this folder and displays its name (which is also the name of the theme) in the list of the themes in the '''Interface Theme''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_05|Site Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200505|SM200505]) form. We highly recommend that you create new themes rather than edit the existing ones to avoid issues with the look and feel of the site. {br}

The following two files define the look and feel of the Acumatica ERP site:[anchor|#_50311acb-19a2-4564-9ee3-9e71cb913f35]
*<tt>00&#95;Controls.css</tt>: Defines the formatting of the forms that appear on the UI. This file can be found through the following path: <tt>C:\Program Files\Acumatica ERP\MySite\App&#95;Themes\ThemeName</tt>.
*<tt>Site.css</tt>: Defines the formatting of the navigation panels, tooltips, headers, and footers of the UI. This file can be found through the following path: <tt>C:\Program Files\Acumatica ERP\MySite\Content</tt>.

To create a custom theme, you copy the folder with the existing theme, insert it into the <tt>App&#95;Themes</tt> folder, and rename the copied folder to <tt>MyTheme</tt>, where ''MyTheme'' is the name you want to use for the theme being created. Then you copy the <tt>Site.css</tt> file and rename it to <tt>SiteMyTheme.css</tt>, where ''MyTheme'' is replaced by the name you want to use for the theme you are creating. To modify the look and feel of the forms, change the color scheme in the <tt>00&#95;Controls.css</tt> file of the folder that has the name of your theme, and save the changes. To modify the look and feel of the other elements of the UI, change the color scheme in the <tt>SiteMyTheme.css</tt> file (where ''MyTheme'' is the name you want to use for the theme being created) and save the changes. {br}

For instance, if you want to name your new theme ''Green'', you copy the <tt>Default</tt> theme folder and rename it to <tt>Green</tt>. Then you copy the <tt>Site.css</tt> file and you rename it to <tt>SiteGreen.css</tt> so that the system can detect that they are interconnected. {br}

When all files have been configured, you can select the created theme in the '''Interface Theme''' box of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_05|Site Preferences] form to apply the changes. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__how_To_Change_Default_Theme|To Change the Default Theme of Acumatica ERP].
==Changing the Company Logo==
A company logo is a unique graphical symbol of the company that makes this company recognizable among others. Administrative users can change the site logo by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) form (for companies of the ''Without Branches'' type) and the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_20_00|Branches] ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) form (for companies of the ''With Branches Not Requiring Balancing'' and ''With Branches Requiring Balancing'' type), on the '''Logo''' tab of both forms. The recommended size of the uploaded image is 210 by 50 pixels. 
==Changing the Images on the Sign-In Page==
Users that have administrative access to the site database that is located on the server can also customize the images displayed on the left side of the Sign-In page. The system displays a custom image from a set of images stored in the <tt>Icons</tt> folder (from <tt>login&#95;bg1.jpg</tt> to <tt>login&#95;bg9.jpg</tt>) on the path that was specified for the site while the product was installed. We recommend that you save the images that you will use for the Sign-In page with the same names as the original images have and that you reserve the original images for future use by changing the extension of these files from <tt>.jpg</tt> to <tt>.bak</tt>. The recommended size of each image is 1500 by 1000 pixels.[anchor|#_c372ac2e-893a-4fda-b037-be51ed038b7c]
==Inspecting Elements of the Webpage==
While creating a custom theme, a user may wonder how to find the selector that is responsible for the formatting of a specific user interface element. Each browser has a set of web development and debugging tools called Developer Tools. These Developer Tools display the document object model (DOM) of the webpage or the DOM of a separate element on that page. On the '''Elements''' tab of the Developer Tools, the user can find the name of the source file where the code of the element is specified and the line of this code.{br}

 On the needed page, a user can press F12 to open the '''Developer Tools''' window. To view the node for a specific element, the user can click the '''Select Element''' tool button (''Microsoft Internet Explorer'') on the '''Command Menu''' bar of the '''Developer Tools''' window and select that specific element on the webpage. The HTML node of the selected element appears on the '''Elements''' tab of the '''Developer Tools''' window. The CSS code of the selected element is displayed on the '''Styles''' tab on the right side of the same window. The following screenshot shows how the system displays the HTML and CSS code of the selected element.[anchor|#_8b01e94c-593a-4c36-a19e-092ee69252c1][image:UserGuide/Images/SourceCode.jpg|popup|600px]
The following table displays the list of browsers and the name of the tool for each particular browser.[anchor|#_afc19e8c-272b-487c-9ef3-af3d4414ff04]

To change the color for a specific company or a branch, you do         the following: For a company: On the  Theme  section of the  Visual             Appearance  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) Companies           (CS101500) form, you first select the  Override Colors for the Selected             Company  check box, and then select the needed color in the              Primary Color  box or specify the hexadecimal number of the color           in the box next to the  Primary Color  box. For a branch: On the  Theme  section of the  Visual             Appearance  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) Branches           (CS102000) form, you first select the  Override Colors for the Selected             Branch  check box, and then select the needed color in the  Primary             Color  box or specify the hexadecimal number of the color in the box next to           the  Primary Color  box. If a company has multiple branches, you can use the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) Companies or the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) Branches         (CS102000) form to select the needed color. The color palette selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) Companies form for the company with multiple branches is         applied to all branches of a company unless in the settings of a specific branch, an         override of the site color is enabled and another color is selected.  Creating a Custom Theme Users that have administrative access to the site database that is located on the server         can edit the existing themes or create their own to apply them in the system. All themes are         saved in the  App_Themes  folder on the path that was specified for the         site while the product was installed. When you insert a new folder into the            App_Themes  folder,  Acumatica ERP detects this folder and displays its name (which is also the name of the theme) in the         list of the themes in the  Interface Theme  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200505|SM200505]) Site Preferences (SM200505) form. We highly recommend that you create new themes         rather than edit the existing ones to avoid issues with the look and feel of the site.  The following two files define the look and feel of the  Acumatica ERP site: 00_Controls.css : Defines the formatting of the forms that appear on           the UI. This file can be found through the following path:  C:\Program             Files\Acumatica ERP\MySite\App_Themes\ThemeName . Site.css : Defines the formatting of the navigation panels,           tooltips, headers, and footers of the UI. This file can be found through the following           path:  C:\Program Files\Acumatica ERP\MySite\Content . To create a custom theme, you copy the folder with the existing theme, insert it into the            App_Themes  folder, and rename the copied folder to            MyTheme , where  MyTheme  is the name you want to use for the         theme being created. Then you copy the  Site.css  file and rename it to            SiteMyTheme.css , where  MyTheme  is replaced by the name you         want to use for the theme you are creating. To modify the look and feel of the forms, change         the color scheme in the  00_Controls.css  file of the folder that has the         name of your theme, and save the changes. To modify the look and feel of the other elements         of the UI, change the color scheme in the  SiteMyTheme.css  file (where            MyTheme  is the name you want to use for the theme being created) and save the         changes.  For instance, if you want to name your new theme  Green , you copy the            Default  theme folder and rename it to  Green .         Then you copy the  Site.css  file and you rename it to            SiteGreen.css  so that the system can detect that they are         interconnected.  When all files have been configured, you can select the created theme in the            Interface Theme  box of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200505|SM200505]) Site Preferences form to         apply the changes. For more information, see  To Change the Default Theme of Acumatica ERP. Changing the Company Logo A company logo is a unique graphical symbol of the company that makes this company         recognizable among others. Administrative users can change the site logo by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) Companies (CS101500) form (for companies of the  Without Branches          type) and the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) Branches (CS102000) form (for companies of the  With           Branches Not Requiring Balancing  and  With Branches Requiring Balancing  type),         on the  Logo  tab of both forms. The recommended size of the uploaded         image is 210 by 50 pixels.  Changing the Images on the Sign-In Page Users that have administrative access to the site database that is located on the server         can also customize the images displayed on the left side of the Sign-In page. The system         displays a custom image from a set of images stored in the  Icons  folder         (from  login_bg1.jpg  to  login_bg9.jpg ) on the path         that was specified for the site while the product was installed. We recommend that you save         the images that you will use for the Sign-In page with the same names as the original images         have and that you reserve the original images for future use by changing the extension of         these files from  .jpg  to  .bak . The recommended         size of each image is 1500 by 1000 pixels. Inspecting Elements of the Webpage While creating a custom theme, a user may wonder how to find the selector that is         responsible for the formatting of a specific user interface element. Each browser has a set         of web development and debugging tools called Developer Tools. These Developer Tools display         the document object model (DOM) of the webpage or the DOM of a separate element on that         page. On the  Elements  tab of the Developer Tools, the user can find         the name of the source file where the code of the element is specified and the line of this         code.  On the needed page, a user can press F12 to open the  Developer           Tools  window. To view the node for a specific element, the user can click the            Select Element  tool button ( Microsoft Internet Explorer ) on         the  Command Menu  bar of the  Developer Tools          window and select that specific element on the webpage. The HTML node of the selected         element appears on the  Elements  tab of the  Developer           Tools  window. The CSS code of the selected element is displayed on the            Styles  tab on the right side of the same window. The following         screenshot shows how the system displays the HTML and CSS code of the selected element. The following table displays the list of browsers and the name of the tool for each         particular browser. Browser Tool Name Microsoft Internet Explorer Select Element Microsoft Edge Select Element Mozilla Firefox Select Element by Click Apple Safari Start Element Selection Google Chrome Select an element in the page to inspect it Each  .CSS  file has commented lines that indicate the name of the class         defined below these lines. You can use these lines to easily find the needed node through         the document.  ]]></column>

By using Acumatica ERP wikis, users can create, edit, and share information. Organizations can easily create specialized wikis for sharing information within project teams, within and across departments, or with external users. Wiki users can share policy and procedure manuals, employee manuals, business plans, individual plans, task lists, and other frequently updated documents. These users benefit from wiki version tracking and security. Also, users can attach files in any format to wiki articles. {br}

 Acumatica ERP wikis facilitate efficient content management practices. With Acumatica ERP wikis, digital content consists of articles organized logically within folders. Employees can easily:[anchor|#ul_v4c_ks3_jj]
*Set up wikis.
*Structure articles and folders within wikis to best fit users&rsquo; needs.
*Write and edit articles with ease and flexibility.
*Track changes.
*Implement preferred review procedures and standards before each article is published.

The Document Management module provides advanced functionality for wiki management.{br}{TOC}
==Help Wiki==
 Acumatica ERP provides a predefined wiki, Help, that includes the complete set of online documentation. As with any other wiki, the Help wiki can be modified, if needed. However, we strongly recommend that you restrict the ability to modify this wiki.
==User-Defined Wikis==
 Acumatica ERP supports user-created wikis. You can create a new wiki by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_20_05|Wiki] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202005|SM202005]) form. The functionality of the wiki is defined by the article type you select for the wiki (the ''Article'' type or ''KB Article'' type). You can also specify the access rights the roles have to the entire wiki. For more information about the process of adding a wiki, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__how_Wiki_Setting_Up_a_New_Wiki|To Add a Wiki]
==Display of a Wiki in Acumatica ERP==
In the user interface of Acumatica ERP, users with the appropriate level of access rights can add a wiki card to a Help dashboard. This capability makes information from the wiki available for other users, depending on the access rights defined for them on the '''Access Rights''' tab of the selected wiki. Alternatively, you can hide a wiki displayed on the Help dashboard if users no longer use it. For more information on how to add a wiki card to the Help dashboard or hide it on this dashboard, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__how_Wiki_Dispaying_in_the_Modern_UI|To Display and Hide a Wiki in the UI].
==User-Defined Wiki Templates==
In Acumatica ERP, users that have the ''Insert'', ''Publish'', and ''Delete'' levels of access rights can create templates for wiki articles to make it easier for users to quickly create articles with the needed formatting. Wiki templates are used to define the default style and components of the article, its printed version, its header, and its footer within the selected wiki. You create and save these templates in the wiki you want to apply them to. {br}

Templates are defined in the system as articles, and the system recognizes templates among other articles by the specific ID defined for them. To create the template for the article and the printing template, you type <tt>ContainerTemplate:</tt> before the template ID. To create the templates for headers and footers, you type <tt>GenTemplate:</tt> before the template ID. Do not use spaces in these IDs. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__how_Wiki_Creating_Template|To Create a Wiki Template].{br}

You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_20_05|Wiki] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202005|SM202005]) form to apply a template to the wiki. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__how_Wiki_Adding_Template|To Apply Templates to a Wiki]
==Presentation of Wiki Articles==
You can use Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to specify how the articles in the wiki will be displayed and printed. For style examples, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Style_Examples|Wiki Style Examples].
==Access to Wikis==
In Acumatica ERP, you configure access to all system entities, including wikis, by using roles. To allow users to view published articles or modify wikis, among other tasks, you have to create appropriate roles and configure each role to have the needed access rights for wikis. For more information on setting up the access that roles have to wikis, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Wiki_Access_Setup|Wiki Access Management].
==Wiki Content Management==
The management of wiki content may consist of multiple phases: creating new articles, editing the article text, publishing the articles so other users can read them, and removing outdated materials. Acumatica Wiki supports all the phases that apply in your organization.{br}

You can edit the article as a whole, including its properties, or make content edits to a particular section of the article.{br}

For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__mng_Wiki_How_To|Wiki Content Procedures].
==Wiki Markup==
In Acumatica ERP, to format the text of the articles, you use wiki markup, a straightforward syntax that uses special markup elements. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__con_Wiki_Using_Wiki_Markup|Wiki Markup Reference].
==Wiki Article Approval==
In most organizations, certain phases of content management involve the collaboration of multiple workgroups. For example, consider an article created by one author and edited by other users of the same group. Before the article can be published, your organization may require approval by one workgroup or multiple workgroups. In Acumatica ERP, you can configure approval procedures to ensure that articles are approved by authorized employees before they are published. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__con_Wiki_Configuring_Approval_Procedures|Wiki Approval Procedures].
==Categories for Wiki Articles==
You can use categories to mark the type of content that wiki articles contain. Categories, along with other features, help readers find necessary information when they perform searches. You can add and delete categories and select articles included in a category. For more information on managing categories, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__how_Wiki_Using_Categories|To Use Categories in Wikis].
==Products for Wiki Articles==
You can mark the articles that apply to different products or product versions. Products, along with other features, help readers find necessary information when they perform searches. You can add and delete products and select the articles that apply to the product. For more information on managing categories and products, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__how_Wiki_Using_Products|To Use Products in Wikis].
==Wiki Article Versions==
With article versioning turned on, each time you save an edited article, a new version of the article is created. You can view the history of revisions and switch to any version of the article. Also, you can compare article versions and review the statistics related to the comparison. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__how_Wiki_Tracking_Changes|To Track Changes in Wiki Articles] and [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__how_Wiki_Comparing_Article_Versions|To Compare Wiki Article Versions].
==Visibility in Acumatica ERP of a Wiki Article Created on the Self-Service Portal==
You can create a wiki article on Self-Service Portal and display it in Acumatica ERP. For example, suppose that you have added a FAQ article on Self-Service Portal and would like to make it visible to the support engineers of your organization who use Acumatica ERP. {br}

To make a wiki article created on Self-Service Portal visible in Acumatica ERP, you do the following:[anchor|#_2da12317-1682-4ca2-82a5-f15a4e0ecf04]
#Select the wiki that contains the article you want to display in Acumatica ERP.
#Add the wiki to the Acumatica ERP site map.
#Set up access rights to the wiki and the article for users who may need to view them during their work.

For the detailed procedure, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__how_Display_Wiki_Article_Created_on_Portal|To Make a Wiki Article Visible in Acumatica ERP].

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
In Acumatica ERP, you configure all access, including access to the wiki, by using roles. Each role is collection of functions a user with the role may access. Acumatica ERP provides several built-in roles and a number of predefined roles with names and abilities that vary by reseller. Your company may need to redefine roles or create new roles to effectively separate employee duties in accordance with established internal policies. {br}

Wiki access management involves configuring new roles, modifying existing roles, and assigning roles to users to allow them to perform the required tasks in the wikis. {br}{TOC}
==Role Setup==
Generally, for roles whose users work with wikis, access should be configured to the following: 
*Particular wikis for which the roles will edit, publish, or create new articles (which might include templates or announcements).
*Forms that users with the role will use to rename and move articles in the wiki site map, view and compare article versions, and publish articles.
*Forms to create new roles or modify existing ones for wiki users and to configure approval procedures.

For example, a small or mid-sized company might have the following wiki-related roles, which differ by the level of access to wikis and by the tasks users with the role may perform:[anchor|#ul_asp_wkg_x3]
*'''Internal User''': Users with this role can view system wikis (that is, wikis delivered with the system) and access their personal user settings. Such a role would be assigned to each internal user (one who is employed by your company) in the system. The rights of the role may be extended to provide access to other wikis that include public materials.
*'''Wiki Author''': These users can view and edit published and unpublished wiki articles, create new articles and folders, move articles between folders, and publish articles. The role may have access to system wikis (if the company policy allows modification of these wikis), to another wikis that contains the company internal instructions and manuals, or to other work documents.
*:((({S:Warn}We recommend setting the ''View Only'' access to wikis delivered with the system. Modification of system wiki articles will prevent their update during upgrades. The system will update only articles that have not been modified.
)))
*'''Wiki Administrator''': Users with this role manage the access rights other roles have to wikis, folders, and files. Users with the role may create new wikis and wiki styles and set up approval procedures for the publishing of articles. The role should have full access to all wikis.

Your company may create additional wikis for corporate use. When you create new wikis, wiki folders, and articles, the existing roles will not have access to them. You will need to establish proper access rights to those items by modifying existing roles or creating new ones.
==Access for Wiki Articles==
You set the access each role has to the wikis available in your company by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_20_15|Wiki Access by Role] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202015|SM202015]) form. If the company has multiple wikis, you set access for each of the wikis separately. You can set access rights to a particular article or folder by using the '''Access Rights''' tab when you open the article in the Wiki Editor form. {br}

The following levels of access rights are available for all items (wikis, folders, or articles) in all wikis. If a particular level of access rights is set for a wiki, by default, that level is inherited by all articles and folders in the wiki. You can, however, set different levels of access rights for articles and folders within the wiki.[anchor|#_gkk_jvd_rg]

For users whose roles allow them to edit articles (with ''Edit'' or higher access rights), you may want to grant access to the following forms, so that these users can insert and update graphics within articles:[anchor|#ul_fxy_5t1_lj]
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_20|Search in Files] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202520|SM202520]) 
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_10|File Maintenance] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202510|SM202510]) 
((({S:Warn}You can set the access rights of the role by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_25|Access Rights by Role] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201025|SM201025]) form. 
)))
==Role Configuration for Wikis==
When you configure a role for the users who will be working with wikis, you give access to:[anchor|#ul_f5h_5cb_xl]
*The wiki management forms by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_25|Access Rights by Role] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201025|SM201025]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_20|Access Rights by Screen] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201020|SM201020]), or [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_20_05|Wiki] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202005|SM202005]) form.
*The wiki articles by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_20_15|Wiki Access by Role] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202015|SM202015]) form. By using this form, a user will be able to configure access only to wikis this user has access to.

==Access to Help Topics==
Although most wikis are created to be modified by multiple users, Acumatica ERP Help (system wikis) should be protected from unnecessary modifications. We recommend setting the ''View Only'' access to wikis delivered with the system. Modification of system wiki articles will prevent their update during upgrades. The system will update only articles that have not been modified.
==Access to Wiki Management Forms==
Typically, content management may include the following tasks: creating articles or folders, editing the text, publishing the articles for other users to read, removing outdated materials, moving articles and folders, setting up a new wiki, and defining the styles. The users with any roles that performs such duties will require ''Edit'' (or higher) access rights to the following forms:
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_20_10|Wiki Site Map] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202010|SM202010]): Allows users with the role to move folders and articles between folders. 
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_20_05|Wiki] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202005|SM202005]): Allows users with the role to create new wikis and specify access rights for existing wikis. 
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_20_30|Wiki Style Sheets] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202030|SM202030]): Allows users with the role to define new styles and modify existing ones.

You might want to give users with a particular role the ability to perform wiki administration, which involves the following tasks: 
*Configuring the access rights other users have to wikis, specific wiki folders, and articles
*Performing inquiries in the wikis
*Setting up approval routes and configuring approval procedures
*Creating new roles and configuring their access rights to forms in the Document Management module

The role should include access rights to the following forms:

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Wiki Access Management In  Acumatica ERP, you configure all access, including access to the wiki, by using roles. Each                 role is collection of functions a user with the role may access.  Acumatica ERP provides several built-in roles and a number of predefined roles with names and                 abilities that vary by reseller. Your company may need to redefine roles or create                 new roles to effectively separate employee duties in accordance with established                 internal policies.  Wiki access management involves configuring new roles, modifying existing roles, and                 assigning roles to users to allow them to perform the required tasks in the wikis.              Role Setup Generally, for roles whose users work with wikis, access should be configured to the                 following:  Particular wikis for which the roles will edit, publish, or create new articles                     (which might include templates or announcements). Forms that users with the role will use to rename and move articles in the wiki                     site map, view and compare article versions, and publish articles. Forms to create new roles or modify existing ones for wiki users and to                     configure approval procedures. For example, a small or mid-sized company might have the following wiki-related                 roles, which differ by the level of access to wikis and by the tasks users with the                 role may perform: Internal User : Users with this role can view system wikis (that is, wikis                     delivered with the system) and access their personal user settings. Such a role                     would be assigned to each internal user (one who is employed by your company) in                     the system. The rights of the role may be extended to provide access to other                     wikis that include public materials. Wiki Author : These users can view and edit published and unpublished wiki                     articles, create new articles and folders, move articles between folders, and                     publish articles. The role may have access to system wikis (if the company                     policy allows modification of these wikis), to another wikis that contains the                     company internal instructions and manuals, or to other work documents. We                         recommend setting the  View Only  access to wikis delivered with the                         system. Modification of system wiki articles will prevent their update                         during upgrades. The system will update only articles that have not been                         modified. Wiki Administrator : Users with this role manage the access rights other                     roles have to wikis, folders, and files. Users with the role may create new                     wikis and wiki styles and set up approval procedures for the publishing of                     articles. The role should have full access to all wikis. Your company may create additional wikis for corporate use. When you create new                 wikis, wiki folders, and articles, the existing roles will not have access to them.                 You will need to establish proper access rights to those items by modifying existing                 roles or creating new ones. Access for Wiki Articles You set the access each role has to the wikis available in your company by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202015|SM202015]) Wiki Access by Role (SM202015) form. If the                 company has multiple wikis, you set access for each of the wikis separately. You can                 set access rights to a particular article or folder by using the  Access                     Rights  tab when you open the article in the Wiki Editor form.  The following levels of access rights are available for all items (wikis, folders, or articles)                 in all wikis. If a particular level of access rights is set for a wiki, by default,                 that level is inherited by all articles and folders in the wiki. You can, however,                 set different levels of access rights for articles and folders within the wiki. Option Description Not Set If all roles has this level of access rights to a wiki, users                                 with all roles have access to the new wiki. When another option is                                 selected for at least one of the roles, this option denies access                                 for roles that have not been explicitly set. Revoked If a role has this level of access rights to a wiki, users with the role are denied access                                 to the entire wiki and its items; for such users, the wiki is not                                 displayed in the navigation pane. Other (more permissive) levels of                                 access set for articles within the wiki won't allow users with the                                 role to view those items in the navigation pane; these users can                                 access the items only by using direct links to the items. View Only If a role has this level of access rights to a wiki, a user with the role may view the                                 published article, published articles within the folder, or                                 published articles in the wiki, depending on the item to which the                                 level is assigned. Access to the item is inherited by all articles                                 within the item; if the item is an unpublished folder, a user with                                 the role cannot see the published articles within it even if the                                 role has permissive rights for these articles. If the role has the                                      View Only  level of access rights, the  Edit                                     Current Article ,  Add New                                     Article , and  Delete Article                                  buttons are unavailable on the wiki toolbar for the user.  Edit If a role has this level of access rights to a wiki, a user with the role may view and edit                                 published and unpublished articles in the wiki. If a role has this                                 level of access rights to an article in the wiki, users with the                                 role may set higher and lower levels of access to the item. For                                 folders and articles to which the user has this level of access, the                                      Add New Article  and  Delete                                     Article  buttons are unavailable on the wiki toolbar                                 for the user.

If a role has                                 this level of access rights to an item within the wiki, users with                                 the role may set higher and lower levels of access for the item.

Publish If a role has this level of access rights to a wiki, a user with the role may edit, create,                                 and publish articles. If a role has this level of access rights to                                 an item within a wiki, users with the role may set higher and lower                                 levels of access to the item.

Articles in a wiki must be published to be seen by all users. An organization may require articles to be approved by authorized employees before they may be published. In Acumatica ERP, you can configure approval procedures by using roles and wiki functionality, as described below. {br}{TOC}
==Approval by Using Roles==
In Acumatica ERP, access to any wiki is determined by the roles assigned to users. You can use roles to facilitate the approval of wiki articles by performing the following steps: 
*Configure a role for wiki authors that has access to the required wiki folders (or the entire wiki) at the ''Insert'' level. Users who have this role assigned will be able to create new articles and edit existing ones, but will not be able to publish articles.
*Configure a role for wiki publishers, and give the role access to the required wiki folders (or the entire wiki) at the ''Publish'' level. Users assigned to this role will be able to publish the articles after they approve of article content. Assign this role to users qualified to approve and publish articles. 
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_20_05|Wiki] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202005|SM202005]) form, make sure that the '''Require Approval''' check box is cleared for the wiki for which approval will be performed through roles.

A user with the wiki publisher role can publish an article by opening the Wiki Editor form for the article, clearing the '''Hold''' check box, and saving the article.
==Approval by Using Wiki Functionality==
You can also use built-in wiki functionality to enable wiki article approval. To make approval required for a specific wiki, do the following:[anchor|#ol_fvy_h53_mj]
#On the '''Configuration''' tab, click '''Document Management'''. In the left pane, click '''Manage''' > '''Wiki''' to open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_20_05|Wiki] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202005|SM202005]) form.
#In the Summary area, in the '''ID''' box, select the wiki.
#Select the '''Hold on Entry''' check box to assign ''Hold'' status to any article after it has been edited. If the article has versions, a new version with the ''Hold'' status is created and the last published version is still available to users with ''View Only'' access. If the article is not versioned, a new version with the ''Hold'' status overwrites the published article; this new version is not available to users with ''View Only'' access rights.
#Select the '''Require Approval''' check box.
#In the '''Approval Group''' box, select the workgroup to perform approvals for articles in the wiki. The default user of the group is initially specified as the approver, but you can select another member of the group in the '''Approver ID''' box.
#:((({S:Warn}You can configure the wiki approval groups by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_40_61|Company Tree] ([~/?ScreenId=EP204061|EP204061]) form.
)))
#In the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

To begin the process of publishing an article, the user who created or edited the article clears the '''Hold''' check box in the Summary area of the '''Contents''' tab of the Wiki Editor form. This changes the article status to ''Pending''. The approver periodically finds articles with the ''Pending'' status for viewing and editing by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_20_25|Wikis] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202025|SM202025]) form. The approver can view and edit any listed articles.{br}

This form also lets the approver process one or more articles. The approver can add keywords, change the parent folder, assign a category, and approve or reject the article. When the article is processed, its status changes as follows:[anchor|#ul_yvy_h53_mj]
*If approved, the article has the ''Published'' status, and the '''Approved''' check box (visible on the '''Content''' tab when the article is open in the Wiki Editor form) is selected for it.
*If rejected, the article has the ''On Hold'' status, and the '''Rejected''' check box (also on the '''Content''' tab) is selected for it.

==Escalation==
An article becomes escalated if its approval was requested but the article was not approved within the wait time specified for the workgroup assigned to approve articles in the wiki. Escalated articles become visible to users of the workgroup that is positioned at one level higher on the company tree. Escalated articles can be approved by the user they were initially assigned to or by a user from the group to which the approval was escalated.

==Paragraph Styles==
You can use spacing and headings to separate and organize paragraphs. Spacing between paragraphs make the text more readable, while headings provide visual cues that help users understand the structure of the article. Other styles, such as boxes and lists, make information easier to understand and remember.{br}

To increase spacing between paragraphs when you&rsquo;re editing, insert two line breaks in the wiki text. Single line breaks are ignored. {br}

The table below includes the paragraph styles you can use in wiki articles. ((({S:Hint}All the paragraph styles listed below should be used at the beginning of the line.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
You can create new wikis to meet the evolving needs of your organization. You can use a wiki to easily share often-used content, such as an employee manual or internal processing instructions, that you need to change with minimal lag time. By using a wiki, you can also organize collaboration on a multi-participant project, such as a business plan or budget, that needs to be managed across distance and time. {br}

Whatever the purpose of your wiki, you can set it up easily by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_20_05|Wiki] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202005|SM202005]) form, as described below.[anchor|#_8dfaea9f-ab18-4839-8721-5d48aeeb0d53]
==Before You Proceed==
Before you create a new wiki, you need to plan its use, usually in cooperation with other affected parties. You probably have already considered the most basic questions:[anchor|#_066d58fd-32e6-430a-95bd-ecf017099a8d]
*Who will use the wiki?
*How will these employees use it?
*What kind of information will it contain?
*Who will perform the writing, reviewing, and administering?

Before you begin setting up the wiki, you need to consider other questions as well, including the following: [anchor|#_ed1c6f17-d587-476d-8b71-41faa24d956f]
*What type of articles will the wiki consist of? In Acumatica Wiki, a wiki can consist of basic wiki articles or web pages.
*What categories will the wiki articles be placed into? Categories designate the type of content.
*What products will the wiki articles be applied to?
*What roles will have access rights for approving and publishing the wiki?
*What roles will have access rights for the wiki? What access rights should they have?
*Do you want the system to save versions of articles, either globally or for only particular articles?

Also, you will need to define the style (that is, the look and formatting) that will be used for all articles in the wiki. The style is defined by a file with the <tt>.css</tt> extension. For examples of styles, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Style_Examples|Wiki Style Examples].[anchor|#_07d91709-5e85-4408-be24-86cf6fd848da]
==To Add a Wiki==
To create a wiki, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_20_05|Wiki] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202005|SM202005]) form. You can complete the setup of a wiki all at once or in stages, skipping the optional steps. To add a wiki and specify the required settings for it, do the following:[anchor|#_33c28574-d2a3-4eac-9260-a780be1bcdc6]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_20_05|Wiki] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202005|SM202005]) form.
#In the '''ID''' box of the '''General''' section, enter the unique identifier of the wiki, and in the '''Name''' box, enter a name for the wiki.
#In the '''Approval''' section, do the following:
##Use the '''Hold on Edit''' check box to specify whether created articles should have the ''Hold'' status by default: 
##*Clear the check box (the default setting) to have the ''Published'' status assigned to new articles and to published articles each time they are edited, whether or not an article is versioned. 
##*Select the check box to have the ''Hold'' status assigned to new articles as well as to published articles each time they are edited. If the article is versioned, once it is saved with the '''Hold''' check box selected, a new version with the ''Hold'' status is created and the published version is still available to users with ''View Only'' access rights. If the article is not versioned, the published article is overwritten by a new version with the ''Hold'' status and is not available to users with ''View Only'' access rights.
##Use the '''Require Approval''' check box to specify the necessity of the approval of the selected wiki by the approval group:
##*Clear the '''Require Approval''' check box, which is selected by default, if the selected wiki is not subject to approval. 
##*Select the '''Require Approval''' check box if the selected wiki is subject to approval. In the '''Approval Group''' box, select the wiki approval group, and in the '''Approver ID''' box, select the user in this group who is responsible for approving the articles. 
##*:For more information about wiki approvals, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__con_Wiki_Configuring_Approval_Procedures|Wiki Approval Procedures].
#In the '''Modern UI''' section, do the following:
##Select the '''Show on Help Dashboard''' check box to display a card for the selected wiki on the Help dashboard.
##In the '''Sequence''' box, specify the whole or decimal number that defines the sequential position of the wiki on the Help dashboard.
##:((({S:Warn}Acumatica ERP doesn&rsquo;t verify the sequence number that you specify for each wiki. We recommend that you use different sequence numbers for different wikis to avoid unexpected results.
)))
##Optional: In the '''Default Article''' box, select the article to be displayed by default when a user clicks '''Explore''' on the wiki card on the Help dashboard. If no article is selected here, the first article of the selected wiki is displayed by default.
## On the '''Wiki Settings''' tab, in the '''Dashboard Description''' box, type an explanation of the content of the wiki, which will be used on the wiki card on the Help dashboard. In the description box, you can enter 255 characters, but we recommend that you enter no more than 160 characters so that your description fits the wiki card displayed on the Help dashboard.
#In the '''Classic UI''' section, do the following:
##In the '''Site Map Location''' box, select the node of the site map in which the wiki will be located.
##In the '''Site Map Title''' box, type the title of wiki on the site map.
#On the '''Wiki Settings''' tab, apply the appropriate style options for the wiki by doing the following:
##In the '''Style''' box of the '''Look and Feel''' section, select the prepared file with the CSS styles intended for displaying the articles of the wiki in a browser. If you specify no file, the browser-specific default styles will be used.
##In the '''Print Style''' box, select the prepared file with the CSS styles that define how a printed article of the wiki should look. If no file is specified, the browser-specific default styles will be used.
##In the '''Article Type''' box, select the type of articles that will make up the content of the wiki. The following options are available: 
##*''Article'': The basic type of articles. This type of articles may contain various content (text, tables, graphics, and links). Usually this type is used for Help articles.
##*''KB Article'': The type of article especially designed for Knowledge Base articles. This type of articles may contain the same content as basic articles. Additionally, users can rate the articles and leave their feedback for a particular article, which gives you the ability to collect statistics and information on how helpful the articles are.
# Skip the '''Template''', '''Print Template''', '''Header''', and '''Footer''' boxes until you create wiki templates.
#:((({S:Warn} You can apply templates to the wiki only after you create them for the selected wiki. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__how_Wiki_Creating_Template|To Create a Wiki Template] and [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__how_Wiki_Adding_Template|To Apply Templates to a Wiki].
)))
#Optional: In the '''Miscellaneous''' section of the '''Wiki Settings''' tab, do the following:
##In the '''Default Site Map Tag''' box, select the tag to be used by default for new articles. (This step can be performed later, when at least one tag has been created.)
## In the '''Public Virtual Path''' box, specify the web address of the wiki on a local website to be used for access outside of your local network.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save''' to save the settings you&rsquo;ve specified for the wiki so far.
#Only if you have selected the node of the site map in which the wiki will be located in the '''Site Map Location''' box (which causes the system to generate user roles and access rights for the selected wiki), on the '''Access Rights''' tab, configure the access rights for the wiki by doing the following in the table:
##In the '''Access Rights''' column of the first row, select the proper option for the selected role. The following options, listed from the most restrictive access rights to the broadest ones, are available: 
##:((({S:Warn}These access rights apply to all items (folders and articles) within the wiki unless you set different access rights for particular items within it; for more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Wiki_Access_Setup|Wiki Access Management]. 
)))
##*''Revoked'': For users with the role, doesn&rsquo;t allow any access to the wiki and the articles and folders within it, including viewing these items.
##*''View Only'': Allows users with the role to view all published articles and folders within the wiki.
##*''Edit'': Allows users with the role to edit the articles and folders in the wiki.
##*''Insert'': Allows users with the role to edit and create new articles and folders in the wiki.
##*''Publish'': Allows users with the role to edit, create, and directly publish articles and folders (or initiate the approval process for publishing, if this approval is required for the wiki) in the wiki.
##*''Delete'': Allows users with the role to delete articles and folders within the wiki, in addition to the rights at lower levels of access.
##Repeat the previous substep for each additional row with a role listed.
##On the form toolbar, click '''Save''' to change the access rights for the roles.
#Optional: On the '''Tags''' tab, create the list of tags to be used to mark the versions of articles in the wiki. To create the tags, do the following:
#:((({S:Warn}Tags can be created at any time and are not required for initial wiki setup.
)))
##In the table toolbar, click '''Add Row''' to add a new blank row to the table.
##In the '''Description''' box, type a descriptive name for the tag.
##Repeat the two previous substeps for each tag you want to add.
##On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

To add a wiki and specify the                 required settings for it, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202005|SM202005]) Wiki (SM202005) form. In the  ID  box of the  General                      section, enter the unique identifier of the wiki, and in the                          Name  box, enter a name for the wiki. In the  Approval  section, do the following: Use the  Hold on Edit  check box to specify whether                             created articles should have the  Hold  status by default:  Clear the check box (the default setting) to have the                                          Published  status assigned to new articles and to                                     published articles each time they are edited, whether or not an                                     article is versioned.  Select the check box to have the  Hold  status assigned to                                     new articles as well as to published articles each time they are                                     edited. If the article is versioned, once it is saved with the                                          Hold  check box selected, a new                                     version with the  Hold  status is created and the published                                     version is still available to users with  View Only  access                                     rights. If the article is not versioned, the published article                                     is overwritten by a new version with the  Hold  status and                                     is not available to users with  View Only  access                                     rights. Use the  Require Approval  check box to specify the                             necessity of the approval of the selected wiki by the approval group: Clear the  Require Approval  check box,                                     which is selected by default, if the selected wiki is not                                     subject to approval.  Select the  Require Approval  check box if                                     the selected wiki is subject to approval. In the                                          Approval Group  box, select the wiki                                     approval group, and in the  Approver ID                                      box, select the user in this group who is responsible for                                     approving the articles.  For more information about wiki                                         approvals, see  Wiki Approval Procedures. In the  Modern UI  section, do the following: Select the  Show on Help Dashboard  check box to                             display a card for the selected wiki on the Help dashboard. In the  Sequence  box, specify the whole or decimal                             number that defines the sequential position of the wiki on the Help                                     dashboard. Acumatica ERP doesn't verify the sequence number that you specify for each                                 wiki. We recommend that you use different sequence numbers for                                 different wikis to avoid unexpected results. Optional: In the  Default Article  box, select the                             article to be displayed by default when a user clicks                                  Explore  on the wiki card on the Help                             dashboard. If no article is selected here, the first article of the                             selected wiki is displayed by default.  On the  Wiki Settings  tab, in the                                  Dashboard Description  box, type an                             explanation of the content of the wiki, which will be used on the wiki                             card on the Help dashboard. In the description box, you can enter 255                             characters, but we recommend that you enter no more than 160 characters                             so that your description fits the wiki card displayed on the Help                             dashboard. In the  Classic UI  section, do the following: In the  Site Map Location  box, select the node of                             the site map in which the wiki will be located. In the  Site Map Title  box, type the title of wiki                             on the site map. On the  Wiki Settings  tab, apply the appropriate style                     options for the wiki by doing the following: In the  Style  box of the  Look and                                 Feel  section, select the prepared file with the CSS                             styles intended for displaying the articles of the wiki in a browser. If                             you specify no file, the browser-specific default styles will be                             used. In the  Print Style  box, select the prepared file                             with the CSS styles that define how a printed article of the wiki should                             look. If no file is specified, the browser-specific default styles will                             be used. In the  Article Type  box, select the type of                             articles that will make up the content of the wiki. The following                             options are available:  Article : The basic type of articles. This type of articles may contain various content                 (text, tables, graphics, and links). Usually this type is used for Help                 articles. KB Article : The type of article especially designed for Knowledge Base articles. This type of articles may contain the same content as basic articles. Additionally, users can rate the articles and leave their feedback for a particular article, which gives you the ability to collect statistics and information on how helpful the articles are.  Skip the  Template ,  Print                     Template ,  Header , and                          Footer  boxes until you create wiki templates.                          You can apply templates to the wiki only after you create them for the                         selected wiki. For more information, see  To Create a Wiki Template and  To Apply Templates to a Wiki. Optional: In the  Miscellaneous  section of the                          Wiki Settings  tab, do the following: In the  Default Site Map Tag  box, select the tag                             to be used by default for new articles. (This step can be performed                             later, when at least one tag has been created.)  In the  Public Virtual Path  box, specify the web                             address of the wiki on a local website to be used for access outside of                             your local network. On the form toolbar, click  Save  to save the settings                     you've specified for the wiki so far. Only if you have selected the node of the site map in which the wiki will be                     located in the  Site Map Location  box (which causes the                     system to generate user roles and access rights for the selected wiki), on the                          Access Rights  tab, configure the access rights for                     the wiki by doing the following in the table: In the  Access Rights  column of the first row,                             select the proper option for the selected role. The following options,                             listed from the most restrictive access rights to the broadest ones, are                             available:  These access rights apply to all items (folders and                                 articles) within the wiki unless you set different access rights for                                 particular items within it; for more information, see  Wiki Access Management.  Revoked : For users with the role, doesn't allow any                                     access to the wiki and the articles and folders within it,                                     including viewing these items. View Only : Allows users with the role to view all                                     published articles and folders within the wiki. Edit : Allows users with the role to edit the articles and                                     folders in the wiki. Insert : Allows users with the role to edit and create new                                     articles and folders in the wiki. Publish : Allows users with the role to edit, create, and                                     directly publish articles and folders (or initiate the approval                                     process for publishing, if this approval is required for the                                     wiki) in the wiki. Delete : Allows users with the role to delete articles and                                     folders within the wiki, in addition to the rights at lower                                     levels of access. Repeat the previous substep for each additional row with a role                             listed. On the form toolbar, click  Save  to change the                             access rights for the roles. Optional: On the  Tags  tab, create the list of tags to be                     used to mark the versions of articles in the wiki. To create the tags, do the                         following: Tags can be created at any time and are not required for                         initial wiki setup. In the table toolbar, click  Add Row  to add a new                             blank row to the table. In the  Description  box, type a descriptive name                             for the tag. Repeat the two previous substeps for each tag you want to add. On the form toolbar, click  Save .  ([~/?ScreenId=SM202005|SM202005]) ]]></column>

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[To Display and Hide a Wiki in the UI If you want to make a wiki available for other users, you can add a card for it to                 the Help dashboard; you can also hide a card for a wiki from the Help dashboard if                 it is already displayed there. You might want to display a wiki card on the Help                 dashboard if any users in your system may use the  Acumatica ERP UI.  To display or hide a wiki, you use the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202005|SM202005]) Wiki (SM202005)                 form.  To Display a Wiki in the UI Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202005|SM202005]) Wiki (SM202005) form. In the Summary area of the form, in the  ID  box of the  General  section, select the identifier of the wiki that you want to make visible on the Help dashboard. In the  Modern UI  section, select the  Show on Help Dashboard  check box to display a card for the selected wiki on the Help dashboard. In the  Sequence  box, specify the whole or decimal number that defines the sequential position of the wiki on the Help dashboard. Acumatica ERP doesn't verify the sequence number that you specify for each wiki. We recommend that you use different sequence numbers for different wikis to avoid unexpected results. Optional: In the  Default Article  box, select the article to be displayed by default when a user clicks  Explore  on the wiki card on the Help dashboard. If no article is selected here, the first article of the selected wiki is displayed by default.  On the  Wiki Settings  tab, in the  Dashboard Description  box, type an explanation of the content of the wiki, which will be used on the wiki card on the Help dashboard. In the description box, you can enter 255 characters, but we recommend that you enter no more than 160 characters so that your description fits the wiki card displayed on the Help dashboard. In the  Classic UI  section, do the following: In the  Site Map Location  box, select the node of the site map in which                         the wiki will be located.  You specify the site map location of the                             selected wiki to make it available for use in the system. This step is                             necessary. In the  Site Map Title  box, type the title of wiki on the site map. On the form toolbar, click  Save . To Hide a Wiki in the UI Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202005|SM202005]) Wiki (SM202005) form. In the Summary area of the form, in the  ID  box of the  General  section, select the identifier of the wiki that you want to hide from the Help dashboard. In the  Modern UI  section, clear the  Show on Help Dashboard  check box to hide the card for the selected wiki on the Help dashboard. In the  Classic UI  section, clear the  Site Map                     Location  box to delete the selected wiki from the node of the site                 map.

This article describes what searches are available in Acumatica Wiki and how to perform the searches. When you search wikis, you can do a quick search or a full-text search. To perform a search, you can use the '''Search''' box (in the navigation pane) and the Search form. {br}

For more information on searching in Acumatica ERP, see [HelpRoot_Interface\Search_Options_and_the_Search_Form|Search].
==To Perform a Quick Search==
When you perform a quick search, the system searches article properties, such as article IDs, categories, names, summaries, and keywords. It does not search the text of articles. ((({S:Hint}For each article, a wiki author can specify a concise summary, an appropriate category (such as ''reference, overview,'' or ''procedure''), and a list of keywords, so that wiki users can quickly find the information they need, even if they do a quick search.
)))
To perform a quick search, do the following: 
#In the navigation pane, in the '''Search''' box, type a word, a part of a word, or a phrase you&rsquo;re searching for.
#Click '''Search'''.
#On the Search form, click '''All Wikis''' to open the [HelpRoot_Interface\SE_00_00_40|Search Form] ([~/?ScreenId=SE000040|SE000040]). On the form, you will see a list of articles in all wikis whose properties contain the search word or phrase you entered in Step 1.
#Optional: Click the '''All Wikis''' arrow and select a wiki to see a list of articles in the selected wiki whose properties contain the search word or phrase you entered in Step 1.
#Optional: If you selected a particular wiki, click '''Advanced''' and then select check boxes for the wiki-specific categories you want the system to search. (This option is unavailable for the '''All Wikis''' scope.)

==To Perform a Full-Text Search==
For a full-text search, the system searches article properties as well as the full text of articles. The full-text search takes longer and may return articles that do not contain the information you hope to find. To ease the process of finding the required information, start by searching for a more specific word or phrase and then search for broader words or phrases if needed. {br}

To perform a full-text search, do the following: 
#In the navigation pane, in the '''Search''' box, type the word, part of a word, or phrase you&rsquo;re searching for.
#Click '''Search'''.
#On the Search form, click '''All Wikis''' to open the [HelpRoot_Interface\SE_00_00_40|Search Form] with the list of articles in all wikis whose properties contain the search word you entered.
#Optional: On the Search form, click the '''All Wikis''' arrow and then select a particular wiki to search within it, or select '''All Wikis''' to again search in all wikis. This step defines the scope of the search.
#Select the '''Full-text search''' check box.
#Optional: If you selected a particular wiki, click '''Advanced''' and then select check boxes for the wiki-specific categories you want the system to search. (This option is unavailable for the '''All Wikis''' scope.)
#Click '''Go''' to start the search.

You can create links to places in the current article, to other articles in the same wiki, and to external websites. These links help users quickly access additional information they might need. 
==To Navigate Within an Article==
With a lengthy article, you might want to give users the ability to quickly navigate within the article. To do this, you first insert anchors to mark the beginnings of sections and other positions in the article to which you want to redirect users. You then insert anchor links, which users can click to easily navigate to the defined anchors. {br}

To define an anchor, do the following:[anchor|#ol_qw1_5d2_lj]
#Open the article.
#On the wiki toolbar, click '''Edit Current Article''' to open the article in the Wiki Editor form.
#Click the place within the article where you want to create the anchor.
#Add the anchor by using the following general syntax:{{{{[Anchor|#<i>AnchorID<i>]
}}}}
#:where ''AnchorID'' is the unique identifier you define for the anchor within the article. It can include any combination of numbers and uppercase and lowercase letters. For example, you can use sequential numbers or abbreviated versions of section names as IDs.

You can create as many anchors as you like in the article, but each ''Anchor ID'' must be unique.{br}

After you have added the anchor, you can insert as many links to the anchor as you need. To insert an anchor link, do the following:[anchor|#ol_xdb_tg2_lj]
#With the article still open in the Wiki Editor form, click the place within the article where you want to add the anchor link.
#Add the anchor link by using the following syntax:{{{{[#<i>AnchorID<i>|<i>LinkText<i>]
}}}}
#:where ''AnchorID'' is the identifier that you defined for the anchor, and ''LinkText'' is the text to be displayed as the link. The user clicks this link to navigate to the anchor.

For example, to enable users to return to the top of the article from a place within the article, create an anchor at the top of an article by adding the following syntax at the beginning of the article: {{{{[Anchor|#Top]
}}}}
Then add the following syntax to the article in the place where you want to create the link to the top of the article: {{{{[#Top|Return to the top]
}}}}
Now, each time users click the {{Return to the top}} link, they navigate to the top of the article.
==To Add Links to Articles and Websites==
You use wiki links to give users the ability to quickly access other articles within the Acumatica ERP instance.{br}

To add a link to another article, do the following: [anchor|#ol_t5w_qgg_lj]
#Open the article to which you want to add the link.
#Open the article for editing. Do one of the following:
#*On the wiki toolbar, click '''Edit Current Article''' to open the entire article in the Wiki Editor form.
#*Click '''Edit''' to the right of the section to which you want to add the link.
#On the formatting toolbar, click '''Link'''. This opens the '''Wiki Link Editor''' dialog box.
#In the '''Wiki Link Editor''' dialog box, specify the link parameters:
#*To configure a link to another article, do the following:
#*#In the Link Type box under the '''Wiki text''' box, select '''Article'''.
#*#In the box to the right of the Link Type box, select the article you want to add a link to.
#*#Optional: In the '''Caption''' box, type the text of the link, which the user will click to navigate to the article.
#*To configure a link to an external web site, do the following:
#*#In the Link Type box under the '''Wiki text''' box, select '''URL'''.
#*#In the box to the right of the Link Type box, type or paste the URL of the external website.
#*#In the '''Caption''' box, type the text of the link.
#Click anywhere in the '''Wiki text''' box to update the link, and then copy the link.
#Click '''OK''' to close the dialog box.
#Click the position in the text where you want the link to be, and then paste the link.
#In the formatting toolbar, click '''Save'''.
#:((({S:Warn}If you opened the article in the Wiki Editor form, alternatively, you can click '''Save''' in the Wiki Editor form toolbar to save your changes and exit the editing mode.
)))
#Check the link displayed in the article by clicking the link text.

In Acumatica Wiki, you use the following basic format for a link:{{{{[ArticleID|LinkText]
}}}}
where ''ArticleID'' is the identifier of the article, and ''LinkText'' is the text of the link. The user clicks on this word or phrase to navigate to the article for which you specify the identifier.{br}

Here are some examples of wiki links: 
*{{[Glossary]}}: This text is displayed as a link.
*{{[Glossary|This is a link to the Glossary]}}: This link is displayed with a custom link text ([HelpRoot_Interface\Glossary|This is a link to the Glossary]); clicking the link opens the Glossary article.
*{{[~/Pages/GL/GL202500.aspx|Chart of Accounts]}}: This link redirects the user to a form in the General Ledger module of Acumatica ERP. 

By using external links, you can redirect users to external websites and mail-to links. Here are some examples of external links:[anchor|#ul_qcl_2ng_lj]
*{{[http://google.com]}}: The system displays this link as a string with the external link icon: [http://google.com/].
*{{[mail@server.com]}}: The system displays this text as a mail-to link: [mail@server.com].
*{{[mail@server.com|Contact us]}}: The system displays this string as a mail-to link with a custom link text: [../UserGuide/mail@server.com|Contact us].

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[To Add a Link You can create links to places in the current article, to other articles in the same                 wiki, and to external websites. These links help users quickly access additional                 information they might need.  To Navigate Within an Article With a lengthy article, you might want to give users the ability to quickly navigate                 within the article. To do this, you first insert anchors to mark the beginnings of                 sections and other positions in the article to which you want to redirect users. You                 then insert anchor links, which users can click to easily navigate to the defined                 anchors.  To define an anchor, do the following: Open the article. On the wiki toolbar, click  Edit Current Article  to open                     the article in the Wiki Editor form. Click the place within the article where you want to create the anchor. Add the anchor by using the following general                         syntax: [Anchor|# AnchorID ] where                              AnchorID  is the unique identifier you define for the anchor                         within the article. It can include any combination of numbers and uppercase                         and lowercase letters. For example, you can use sequential numbers or                         abbreviated versions of section names as IDs. You can create as many anchors as you like in the article, but each  Anchor ID                  must be unique. After you have added the anchor, you can insert as many links to the anchor as you                 need. To insert an anchor link, do the following: With the article still open in the Wiki Editor form, click the place within the                     article where you want to add the anchor link. Add the anchor link by using the following                         syntax: [# AnchorID | LinkText ] where                              AnchorID  is the identifier that you defined for the anchor, and                              LinkText  is the text to be displayed as the link. The user clicks                         this link to navigate to the anchor. For example, to enable users to return to the top of the article from a place within                 the article, create an anchor at the top of an article by adding the following                 syntax at the beginning of the article:  [Anchor|#Top] Then add the following syntax to the article in the place where you want to create                 the link to the top of the article:  [#Top|Return to the top] Now, each time users click the  Return to the top  link, they navigate                 to the top of the article. To Add Links to Articles and Websites You use wiki links to give users the ability to quickly access other articles within                 the  Acumatica ERP instance. To add a link to another article, do the following:  Open the article to which you want to add the link. Open the article for editing. Do one of the following: On the wiki toolbar, click  Edit Current Article                              to open the entire article in the Wiki Editor form. Click  Edit  to the right of the section to which                             you want to add the link. On the formatting toolbar, click  Link . This opens the                          Wiki Link Editor  dialog box. In the  Wiki Link Editor  dialog box, specify the link                         parameters: To configure a link to another article, do the following: In the Link Type box under the  Wiki text                                      box, select  Article . In the box to the right of the Link Type box, select the article                                     you want to add a link to. Optional: In the  Caption  box, type the                                     text of the link, which the user will click to navigate to the                                     article. To configure a link to an external web site, do the following: In the Link Type box under the  Wiki text                                      box, select  URL . In the box to the right of the Link Type box, type or paste the                                     URL of the external website. In the  Caption  box, type the text of the                                     link. Click anywhere in the  Wiki text  box to update the link,                     and then copy the link. Click  OK  to close the dialog box. Click the position in the text where you want the link to be, and then paste the                     link. In the formatting toolbar, click  Save . If you opened                         the article in the Wiki Editor form, alternatively, you can click                              Save  in the Wiki Editor form toolbar to save your                         changes and exit the editing mode. Check the link displayed in the article by clicking the link text. In  Acumatica Wiki, you use the following basic format for a link: [ArticleID|LinkText] where  ArticleID  is the identifier of the article, and  LinkText  is the                 text of the link. The user clicks on this word or phrase to navigate to the article                 for which you specify the identifier. Here are some examples of wiki links:  [Glossary] : This text is displayed as a link. [Glossary|This is a link to the Glossary] : This link is                     displayed with a custom link text ( This is a link to the Glossary This is a link to the Glossary); clicking the link                     opens the Glossary article. [~/Pages/GL/GL202500.aspx|Chart of Accounts] : This link                     redirects the user to a form in the General Ledger module of  Acumatica ERP.  By using external links, you can redirect users to external websites and mail-to                 links. Here are some examples of external links: [http://google.com] : The system displays this link as a string                     with the external link icon:  . [mail@server.com] : The system displays this text as a mail-to                     link:  . [mail@server.com|Contact us] : The system displays this string                     as a mail-to link with a custom link text:  Contact                         us Contact us. ]]></column>

At times, you might want to illustrate the concepts or ideas in an article. To do this, you can import graphics to add them to articles. In the process, you can specify a variety of display options. [anchor|#section_jr1_qbc_tj]
==To Import a Graphic File==
Before you import your file, make sure that the size of your file does not exceed the maximum file size allowed and that the type of file is allowed. You can check the maximum allowable file size and the valid file extensions on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_50|File Upload Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202550|SM202550]) form.{br}

To import a graphic file for an article, do the following: [anchor|#ol_xr1_qbc_tj]
#Open the article to which you want to add the graphic.
#Open the article for editing. Do one of the following:
#*Click '''Edit''' to the right of the section to which you want to add the graphic.
#*On the wiki toolbar, click '''Edit Current Article''' to open the entire article in the Wiki Editor form.
#On the formatting toolbar, click '''Attach File'''.
#:((({S:Warn}Alternatively, if you opened the Wiki Editor form, you can click '''Attach''' on the Wiki Editor form toolbar. This opens the '''File Upload''' dialog box.
)))
#In the '''File Upload''' dialog box, click '''Browse''' to find the file, select the file, and then click '''Upload'''. This opens the '''File Link Editor''' dialog box.
# In the '''File Link Editor''' dialog box, specify the following options:[anchor|#image_bhc_z53_5g][image:UserGuide/Images/Adding_Pictures_Adding_PicturesFile_Link_Editor.gif|popup|File Link Editor Dialog Box|350px]
#*In the '''Type''' box, select one of the following display options: ''Not Set'', ''Thumb'', ''Frame'', or ''Border''.
#*In the '''Alignment''' box, select one of the following alignment options: ''Not Set'', ''Right'', ''Left'', or ''Center''.
#*In the '''Caption''' box, enter the caption for the graphic.
#*In the '''Size''' box, enter the display size (in pixels) of the graphic to be displayed.
#:For more information, see the [[#section_mcz_rys_kj|Customize a Graphic] section of this article.
#Click anywhere in the '''Wiki text''' box to update the link, and then copy the link.
#Click '''OK''' to close the dialog box.
#Click on the position in the text where you want to insert the graphic, and paste the link.
#Click '''Save'''.
#Check the graphic displayed in the article, and correct the options if needed. 

==To Update a Graphic File==
When you need to replace a graphic, do the following: [anchor|#_g3l_2td_rg]
#Open the wiki article with the graphic you want to update.
#Click the '''Edit''' link next to the graphic you want to replace. The system redirects you to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_10|File Maintenance] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202510|SM202510]) form with the file name of the graphic specified in the '''File''' box. The form displays the list of versions of the file. 
#Make sure the file name of the graphic begins with the correct article ID, separated from the graphic file name by a backslash (\). 
#:((({S:Hint}If the article ID has changed, delete the old link and create a new one.
)))
#On the form toolbar, click '''Check Out'''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Upload New Version'''.
#In the '''File Upload''' dialog box, click '''Browse''' and select the graphic you want to upload.
#Make sure the '''Check In''' check box is selected to check in the updated version of the file.
#Click '''Upload'''.

The system uploads the file and adds it to the list of file versions under the original file name (regardless of the name of the uploaded file). By default, the new version of the file will be displayed in the article. [anchor|#section_mcz_rys_kj]
==To Customize a Graphic==
You may need to change how a graphic is justified in the text, scale it, or alter other display options. This section describes the wiki markup syntax you use to customize an graphic.{br}

See below for the most basic syntax for adding a graphic to a wiki article: {{{{[image:<i>File name<i>]
}}}}
where ''File name'' has the following format: {{{{[<i>Article ID<i>\<i>Image file name<i>]
}}}}
For example, the following syntax displays the graphic without borders and a caption: {{{{[image:Graphic\Links.png]
}}}}
 The following graphic corresponds to the markup above: [anchor|#image_rtw_qb3_x3][image:UserGuide/Images/Graphic_without_border_caption.png|popup|File Link Editor Dialog Box|175px]
You use the following complete syntax to add a graphic to a wiki article:{{{{[Image:File name|Type|Location|Caption|Size|Noclick|]
}}}}
Follow these tips when you use these options, which the remainder of this article describes in detail: [anchor|#ul_ymk_3j2_vg]
*List the options in any order.
*Use no additional spaces before, between, or after any pipe sign (|) because spaces can cause errors when the system parses the link.
*Note that if the text between two pipe signs is not a valid option, the system interprets it as a caption.

|- 
| Location
| Defines the horizontal placement of the graphic on the page. Use one of the following values: ''right'', ''left'', or ''center''. By default, the system displays graphics left-aligned. 
This is an example of the syntax for a centered graphic: {{{{[image:Graphic\Links.png|Links|center]
}}}}[anchor|#image_gj3_vpq_y3][image:UserGuide/Images/Graphic_centered.png|popup|Centered Graphic|350px]
|- 
| Caption
| Specifies the tooltip shown when a user points to the graphic. This is an example of the syntax for a graphic with the ''caption'' option: {{{{[image:Graphic\Links.png|Links]
}}}}
The corresponding image is shown in the screenshot below. The ''Links'' text, interpreted as a caption, is shown when you point to the image.[anchor|#image_s3q_jd3_x3][image:UserGuide/Images/Graphic_with_caption.png|popup|Graphic with Caption|350px]
|- 
| Size
| 
Gives you the ability to scale the graphic in either of the following ways: [anchor|#ul_d5y_z5h_x3]
*To the specified width, with the aspect ratio as in the original graphic: The syntax is ''N''px, where ''N'' is a number of pixels.
*To both the specified width and height: The syntax is ''N''x''M''px, where ''N'' specifies the number of pixels for the width and ''M'' specifies the number of pixels for the height.

This is an example of the syntax for a graphic with the specified height and width: {{{{[image:Graphic\Links.png|100x50px|Links]
}}}}
The graphic is scaled down to 100 pixels in width and 50 pixels in height, as shown in the screenshot below.[anchor|#image_dbb_md3_x3][image:UserGuide/Images/Graphic_100x50.png|popup|Scaled Graphic|350px]
If you click the scaled graphic, the system opens the graphic in its actual size on a blank page. To return to the article, click the '''Back''' button of the browser.[anchor|#image_iyj_sqq_y3][image:UserGuide/Images/Graphic_without_border_caption.png|popup|Graphic at Actual Size|350px]
|- 
| NoClick
| 
Prohibits the user from displaying the graphic in its actual size. See the following example of the syntax for a graphic with the ''noclick'' option: {{{{[image:Graphic\Links.png|100px|Links|noclick]
}}}}
The syntax above results in the graphic being scaled down proportionally to 100 pixels in width. When you click this graphic, the system does not open the graphic in its actual size.[anchor|#image_g23_drq_y3][image:UserGuide/Images/Graphic_noclick.png|popup|Graphic with Noclick Option|350px]
|}
==To Attach Already Imported Files==
You can easily attach one file to different articles.{br}

To attach a file that is already imported into the system, do the following:[anchor|#ol_tvs_b1c_tj]
#Open the wiki article with the graphic you want to use.
#Open the article for editing. Do one of the following:
#*Click '''Edit''' to the right of the section to where the graphic is located.

This is an example of the syntax for a graphic with the specified height and width:  [image:Graphic\Links.png|100x50px|Links] The graphic is scaled down to 100 pixels in width and 50 pixels 									in height, as shown in the screenshot below. Scaled Graphic If you click the scaled graphic, the system opens the graphic in its actual size on a 									blank page. To return to the article, click the  Back  									button of the browser. Graphic at Actual Size NoClick Prohibits the user from displaying the graphic in its actual size. See the following 									example of the syntax for a graphic with the  noclick  									option:  [image:Graphic\Links.png|100px|Links|noclick] The syntax above results in the graphic being scaled down proportionally to 100 pixels in 									width. When you click this graphic, the system does not open the 									graphic in its actual size. Graphic with Noclick Option To Attach Already Imported Files You can easily attach one file to different articles. To attach a file that is already imported into the system, do the following: Open the wiki article with the graphic you want to use. Open the article for editing. Do one of the following: Click  Edit  to the right of the section to where 							the graphic is located. On the wiki toolbar, click  Edit Current Article  							to open the entire article in the Wiki Editor form. Select and copy the image link. Click  Cancel . Open the wiki article where you want to insert the graphic. Open the article for editing. Do one of the following: Click  Edit  to the right of the section to which 							you want to add the graphic. On the wiki toolbar, click  Edit Current Article  							to open the entire article in the Wiki Editor form. On the formatting toolbar, click  Attach 						File . Alternatively, if you opened the Wiki Editor form, 						you can click  Attach File  on the Wiki Editor form 						toolbar. This opens the  File Upload  dialog 						box. In the  File Upload  dialog box, select  Link to 						existing file  option, paste the link into the 						 Existing File  dialog box, and then click 						 Upload . This opens the  File Link 						Editor  dialog box. Follow Steps 5 through 10 of the  Importing Graphic Files Importing Graphic Files procedure.

You can easily build a table by using wiki markup.
==To Understand Table Markup==
See below for descriptions of the basic wiki markup for tables, which you should use at the beginning of a line. [anchor|#table_cp1_5tk_mj]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="21%" ! Markup Element
!width="78%" ! Description
|- 
|  &#0123;|
| The beginning of the table. Table parameters may be defined on the first line.
|- 
|  |+
| The table title (caption) line.
|- 
|  |&#0125;
| The end of the table.
|- 
|  !
| A column heading.
|- 
|  !!
| A column heading separator if headings are all specified on one line.
|- 
|  |
| The beginning of a table cell.
|- 
|  ||
| A cell separator if all cells are specified on one line.
|- 
|  |-
| A table row separator.
|- 
|  width=&ldquo;x%&ldquo;
| Column width, where ''x'' is the predefined width in %. 
Insert the attribute before the column name, with column heading separators on both sides.
|}
==To Define a Simple Table==
 See below for an example of the wiki markup to define a simple table. This example shows all the column headings in one line, separated by {{!!}}, with the row headings ({{1.x}} and {{2.x}}) on separate lines. All cells for each row are listed in one line. {{{{{| 
! X !! x.1 !! x.2
|-
! 1.x
| Cell 1.1 || Cell 1.2
|-
! 2.x
| Cell 2.1 || Cell 2.2
|}
}}}}
If you have long phrases in the cells or in the headings, you can define each cell in a separate line, as shown below. {{{{{|
! X 
! x.1 
! x.2
|-
! 1.x
| Cell 1.1 
| Cell 1.2
|-
! 2.x
| Cell 2.1 
| Cell 2.2
|}
}}}}
 Both of the syntax examples above generate the same table, as shown below.[anchor|#_c4j_zsz_wg][image:UserGuide/Images/Adding_Tables_sample1.png|popup|150px]
 You can use parameters, described in the following sections, to affect how the table looks. 
==To Define Table Borders==
You specify the parameters of the table borders, among other parameters, after the &#0123;| characters that designate the start of the table. See the following examples of the syntax to define table borders: 
*{{border="1"}}: Adds an overall border around the table and borders between the cells.
*{{border="1" style="border: solid 5px #000000;"}}: Adds borders as the previous example does, but makes the outer border black and 5 pixels thick.

Use the syntax below to generate a table with a border around the outside and between cells.{{{{{| border="1" 
! X !! x.1 !! x.2
|-
! 1.x
| Cell 1.1 || Cell 1.2
|-
! 2.x
| Cell 2.1 || Cell 2.2
|}
}}}}[anchor|#_shm_qsz_wg][image:UserGuide/Images/Adding_Tables_sample2.png|popup|150px]
Use the syntax below to generate the table with a thick red border.{{{{{| border="1" style="border: solid 5px Red;"
! X !! x.1 !! x.2
|-
! 1.x
| Cell 1.1 || Cell 1.2
|-
! 2.x
| Cell 2.1 || Cell 2.2
|}
}}}}[anchor|#image_dmn_ck3_x3][image:UserGuide/Images/Adding_Tables_sample3.png|popup|150px]
==To Add Cell Spacing and Padding==
To add space to the cells and between cells, use the ''cellspacing'' and ''cellpadding'' parameters, as shown in the following examples: 
*{{cellspacing="10"}}: The ''cellspacing'' parameter defines space between cells. (The default value is 1 pixel.) When ''cellspacing'' is set to &ldquo;0&ldquo;, as in this example, the borders of the neighboring cells merge into one line.
*{{cellpadding="4"}}: The ''cellpadding'' parameter adds space to the cells, padding them in all directions. This example adds 4 pixels to cell space in each of 4 directions: above, below, right, and left.

Use the following syntax to generate the table (shown below the syntax) with enlarged spacing in the cells and between the cells.{{{{{| cellspacing="10" cellpadding="4" border="1" style="border: solid 1px #000000;"
! X !! x.1 !! x.2
|-
! 1.x
| Cell 1.1 || Cell 1.2
|-
! 2.x
| Cell 2.1 || Cell 2.2
|}
}}}}[anchor|#_dft_msz_wg][image:UserGuide/Images/Adding_Tables_sample4.png|popup|150px]
==To Use Color==
Use the syntax below to generate a table (shown below the syntax) with text color set to brown, background color set to yellow, and enlarged spacing in the cells.{{{{{| cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1" style="color:brown;background-color:yellow;" 
! X !! x.1 !! x.2
|-
! 1.x
| Cell 1.1 || Cell 1.2
|-
! 2.x
| Cell 2.1 || Cell 2.2
|}
}}}}[anchor|#_o3g_1sz_wg][image:UserGuide/Images/Adding_Tables_sample5.png|popup|150px]
Use the syntax below to generate a table with a gray background color for the table heading (shown below the syntax).{{{{{| cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1"
|- style="background-color: #D0D0D0;"
! X !! x.1 !! x.2
|-
! 1.x
| Cell 1.1 || Cell 1.2
|-
! 2.x
| Cell 2.1 || Cell 2.2
|}
}}}}[anchor|#_fxx_prz_wg][image:UserGuide/Images/Adding_Tables_sample6.png|popup|150px]
 You can also add color to the row headings. The following syntax sets the background color of the table heading to black, the text color of the table heading to gray, and the background color of the row headings to a different shade of gray.{{{{{| cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1" style="border: solid 6px Blue;"
|- style="background-color: #000000; color: #CCCCCC;" 
! X !! x.1 !! x.2
|-
| style="background-color: #D0D0D0;" | 1.x
| Cell 1.1 || Cell 1.2
|-
| style="background-color: #D0D0D0;"  | 2.x
| Cell 2.1 || Cell 2.2
|}
}}}}
 The syntax above generates the table below. [anchor|#_o3s_vsz_wg][image:UserGuide/Images/Adding_Tables_sample7.png|popup|150px]]]></column>

When an article is also a folder, the article appears as a node in the wiki tree and may contain articles.
==To Define an Article as a Folder==
You can define a new or existing article as a folder. For more information about creating a new folder—that is, creating an article and defining it as a folder—see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__how_Wiki_Creating_a_New_Article|To Add an Article]. To define an existing article as a folder, do the following: [anchor|#ol_s51_f2z_mj]
#Open the article.
#On the wiki toolbar, click '''Edit''' to open the Wiki Editor form.
#On the '''Content''' tab, select the '''Folder''' check box.
#On the Wiki Editor form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

After you have defined an article as a folder, if you open the article in the Wiki Editor form, you can see the '''Subarticles''' tab. 
==To Add Articles to a Folder==
You can populate a folder with articles by moving existing articles into the folder or by creating new articles in the folder. To move existing articles to the folder, use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_20_10|Wiki Site Map] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202010|SM202010]) form. If you're creating a new article, open the article in the Wiki Editor form, and on the '''Contents''' tab, specify the folder in the '''Parent Folder''' box.
==To Convert a Folder into an Article==
A folder can be converted to an article only if the folder doesn&rsquo;t contain any articles. For more information about moving the articles to another folder, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__how_Wiki_Moving_an_Article_to_Another_Folder|To Move an Article].{br}

To convert a folder into an article, do the following: 
#Open the folder you want to convert.
#On the wiki toolbar, click '''Edit Current Article''' to open the Wiki Editor form.
#On the '''Content''' tab, clear the '''Folder''' check box. 
#On the Wiki Editor form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

Some processes in Acumatica ERP require multiple tasks to be executed to complete the whole process.

The business process scenarios tool gives you the ability to simplify the execution of such complex processes. By using this tool, you can create a scenario that contains the list of tasks required for completing some process.

Each scenario has a hierarchical structure. You can create the tasks and subtasks, and set the order of their execution (if needed), which depends on the system configuration, your enabled features, or your business needs.{br}

While configuring a scenario, you can apply the role-based approach by specifying an access role for each scenario. By using this approach, you can manage an access to every scenario, so that only the users that are granted by this role can access it.{br}

Configuration of a scenario includes the following steps, each of which is described in greater detail below:[anchor|#ol_yzb_2bk_cp]
#Reviewing enabled features
#Creating a scenario
#Adding the tasks to the scenario
{br}{TOC}
==Reviewing Enabled Features==
Before you start adding a scenario, make sure that the features on which the scenario will be based are enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. For more information on Acumatica ERP features, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Features_Overview|Overview of the Acumatica ERP Features ].
==Creating a Scenario==
The first step of configuring a scenario is specifying its general settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\WZ_20_10_00|Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=WZ201000|WZ201000]) form:[anchor|#ul_cdd_123_jp]
*'''Scenario Name''': You should enter any appropriate name, which will be displayed on the Acumatica ERP interface, on the main menu or in the navigation pane (depending on the location, which you define next).
*'''Site Map Location''': You should define the location of the scenario on the site map, where it will be available to users for execution. You can specify any appropriate location, depending on the type of the process to be executed.
*'''Role Name''' (optional): You can limit user access to the scenario by specifying an access role. Only users granted by this role will have access to this scenario. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Role-Based_Access|Role-Based Access]. If you do not specify an access role, the scenario will be available to all users under the defined site map location.
((({S:Warn}The execution date and execution period will be entered automatically by the system after the first scenario execution.
)))
Then you should save the scenario by clicking '''Save''' on the form toolbar.{br}

After that, you need to add the tasks to the scenario.
==Adding the Tasks to the Scenario==
The second step of configuring a scenario is adding the tasks to the scenario on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\WZ_20_20_00|Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=WZ202000|WZ202000]) form. You can open this form by clicking the scenario name on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\WZ_20_10_00|Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=WZ201000|WZ201000]) form or by navigating to the Tasks (EP404000) form, and then selecting the required scenario in the '''Scenario Name''' box.{br}

To add each task, you need to click '''Add Task''' on the tree pane toolbar, and in the '''Task Summary''' area, specify the task-related settings, which are described in detail below:[anchor|#ul_x5n_shk_cp]
*'''Name''' box: You should enter the task name.
*'''Status''' box: You should leave the default task status. The status of the task will be updated automatically, depending on the actions you perform during task execution or the features enabled in your system. For a detailed description of task statuses, see [HelpRoot_FormReference\WZ_20_20_00|Tasks].
*'''Optional''' check box: You should select this check box if the task you are creating is optional and its completion is not required to complete the whole process. Whether execution of the task is optional depends on the settings made in your system and your business needs. If you select this check box, during scenario execution, the user will be able to skip this task (by clicking '''Skip''' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\WZ_20_15_10|&lt;Scenario Name&gt; - &lt;Task Name&gt;] ([~/?ScreenId=WZ201510|WZ201510]) form). 
*'''Assigned To''' box: You can assign the task to any user for execution, or reassign the task, if needed. 
*:((({S:Warn}You can perform this action after the scenario is already configured and activated in the system (that is, in the beginning of its execution or at any appropriate moment during the process).
)))
*'''Details''' tab: You can add any information that can be useful for task execution, such as instructions or links to help topics.
*'''Screen Details''' tab: You can specify the ID of the form where the task should be executed. In the '''Screen ID''' box, specify the ID of the form that will be opened when a user clicks the '''Go to Screen''' button on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\WZ_20_15_10|&lt;Scenario Name&gt; - &lt;Task Name&gt;] ([~/?ScreenId=WZ201510|WZ201510]) form. You can also specify the import scenario, if the task requires you to automatically upload data (for example, to upload the list of customers). For that, you need to specify the appropriate form ID in the '''Screen ID''' box, and then select the scenario in the '''Import Scenario''' box. In that case, when a user clicks the '''Go to Screen''' button on the task execution form, the system will navigate to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_36|Import by Scenario] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206036|SM206036]) form. For details, see the [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__mng_Configuring_Import_Scenarios|Configuring Import Scenarios].
*:((({S:Warn}You can leave these boxes blank if the task does not involve any form or report for its execution. In that case, the '''Go to Screen''' button will be absent on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\WZ_20_15_10|&lt;Scenario Name&gt; - &lt;Task Name&gt;] ([~/?ScreenId=WZ201510|WZ201510]) form.
)))
*'''Predecessors''' tab: You need to specify the tasks that have to be completed before the execution of the task you are configuring (if any). Specifiyng tasks on this tab is required when the tasks in the scenario have to be performed in a strict order. The task will be available for execution (its status will change to ''Open'') only when the predecessor tasks are completed.
*'''Successors''' tab: Do nothing; the list of tasks (if any) is filled in automatically. These are the tasks that can be performed only after the execution of the task you are currently configuring.
*'''Subtasks''' tab: Do nothing; the list of subtasks (if the task has subtasks) is filled in automatically. If any subtask has the ''Pending'', ''Open'', or ''In Progress'' status, the parent task cannot be completed.
*'''Features''' tab: You need to select the features that have to be enabled in the system for task execution. If the required features are not activated, the task will be marked as ''Disabled'' during activation of the scenario.

After you have added all required tasks, save the scenario by clicking '''Save''' on the form toolbar.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\WZ_20_20_00|Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=WZ202000|WZ202000]) form, you can add, delete, and edit the tasks associated with the scenario.
==Activating a Scenario==
To make a scenario available to users on the defined site map location, you should activate it by clicking the '''Activate Scenario''' button. This button is available on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\WZ_20_10_00|Scenarios] form, the [HelpRoot_FormReference\WZ_20_20_00|Tasks] form, or the screen at the defined site map location.{br}

After activation, all the tasks that do not have predecessors and can be executed right away are marked as ''Open''. The tasks that depend on features that haven&rsquo;t been activated are marked as ''Disabled''. The tasks for which required features are activated but that have uncompleted predecessor tasks are marked as ''Pending''. {br}

You can start scenario execution with any of the ''Open'' tasks. {br}

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Scenario Configuration Configuration of a scenario includes the following steps, each of which is described in         greater detail below: Reviewing enabled features Creating a scenario Adding the tasks to the scenario Reviewing Enabled Features Before you start adding a scenario, make sure that the features on which the scenario will         be based are enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. For more         information on  Acumatica ERP features, see  Overview of the Acumatica ERP Features . Creating a Scenario The first step of configuring a scenario is specifying its general settings on the   ([~/?ScreenId=WZ201000|WZ201000]) Scenarios (WZ201000) form: Scenario Name : You should enter any appropriate name, which will           be displayed on the  Acumatica ERP interface, on the main menu or in the navigation pane (depending on the location, which           you define next). Site Map Location : You should define the location of the scenario           on the site map, where it will be available to users for execution. You can specify any           appropriate location, depending on the type of the process to be executed. Role Name  (optional): You can limit user access to the scenario           by specifying an access role. Only users granted by this role will have access to this           scenario. For details, see  Role-Based Access. If you do not           specify an access role, the scenario will be available to all users under the defined site           map location. The execution date and execution period will be entered automatically by the system         after the first scenario execution. Then you should save the scenario by clicking  Save  on the form         toolbar. After that, you need to add the tasks to the scenario. Adding the Tasks to the Scenario The second step of configuring a scenario is adding the tasks to the scenario on the   ([~/?ScreenId=WZ202000|WZ202000]) Tasks (WZ202000) form. You can open this form by clicking the scenario         name on the   ([~/?ScreenId=WZ201000|WZ201000]) Scenarios (WZ201000) form or by navigating to the Tasks         (EP404000) form, and then selecting the required scenario in the  Scenario           Name  box. To add each task, you need to click  Add Task  on the tree pane toolbar,         and in the  Task Summary  area, specify the task-related settings,         which are described in detail below: Name  box: You should enter the task name. Status  box: You should leave the default task status. The status           of the task will be updated automatically, depending on the actions you perform during           task execution or the features enabled in your system. For a detailed description of task           statuses, see   ([~/?ScreenId=WZ202000|WZ202000]) Tasks. Optional  check box: You should select this check box if the task           you are creating is optional and its completion is not required to complete the whole           process. Whether execution of the task is optional depends on the settings made in your           system and your business needs. If you select this check box, during scenario execution,           the user will be able to skip this task (by clicking  Skip  on the               ([~/?ScreenId=WZ201510|WZ201510]) &lt;Scenario Name&gt; - &lt;Task Name&gt; (WZ201510) form).  Assigned To  box: You can assign the task to any user for           execution, or reassign the task, if needed.  You can perform this action after the             scenario is already configured and activated in the system (that is, in the beginning of             its execution or at any appropriate moment during the process). Details  tab: You can add any information that can be useful for           task execution, such as instructions or links to help topics. Screen Details  tab: You can specify the ID of the form where the           task should be executed. In the  Screen ID  box, specify the ID of           the form that will be opened when a user clicks the  Go to Screen            button on the   ([~/?ScreenId=WZ201510|WZ201510]) &lt;Scenario Name&gt; - &lt;Task Name&gt; (WZ201510) form. You can also specify the           import scenario, if the task requires you to automatically upload data (for example, to           upload the list of customers). For that, you need to specify the appropriate form ID in           the  Screen ID  box, and then select the scenario in the              Import Scenario  box. In that case, when a user clicks the              Go to Screen  button on the task execution form, the system will           navigate to the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM206036|SM206036]) Import by Scenario (SM206036) form. For details, see the              Configuring Import Scenarios. You can leave these boxes blank if the task does not involve any form or report             for its execution. In that case, the  Go to Screen  button will be             absent on the   ([~/?ScreenId=WZ201510|WZ201510]) &lt;Scenario Name&gt; - &lt;Task Name&gt; (WZ201510) form. Predecessors  tab: You need to specify the tasks that have to be           completed before the execution of the task you are configuring (if any). Specifiyng tasks           on this tab is required when the tasks in the scenario have to be performed in a strict           order. The task will be available for execution (its status will change to  Open )           only when the predecessor tasks are completed. Successors  tab: Do nothing; the list of tasks (if any) is filled           in automatically. These are the tasks that can be performed only after the execution of           the task you are currently configuring. Subtasks  tab: Do nothing; the list of subtasks (if the task has           subtasks) is filled in automatically. If any subtask has the  Pending ,  Open ,           or  In Progress  status, the parent task cannot be completed. Features  tab: You need to select the features that have to be           enabled in the system for task execution. If the required features are not activated, the           task will be marked as  Disabled  during activation of the scenario. After you have added all required tasks, save the scenario by clicking            Save  on the form toolbar. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=WZ202000|WZ202000]) Tasks (WZ202000) form, you can add, delete, and edit the         tasks associated with the scenario. Activating a Scenario To make a scenario available to users on the defined site map location, you should activate         it by clicking the  Activate Scenario  button. This button is available         on the   ([~/?ScreenId=WZ201000|WZ201000]) Scenarios form, the   ([~/?ScreenId=WZ202000|WZ202000]) Tasks form, or         the screen at the defined site map location. After activation, all the tasks that do not have predecessors and can be executed right         away are marked as  Open . The tasks that depend on features that haven't been         activated are marked as  Disabled . The tasks for which required features are activated         but that have uncompleted predecessor tasks are marked as  Pending .  You can start scenario execution with any of the  Open  tasks.  When the scenario is activated, you cannot add new tasks to it, modify the order of           tasks, change the list of required features, and edit the list of predecessor           tasks. ]]></column>

Scenario execution is managed under the site map location specified during scenario configuration. To execute a scenario, you need to complete the tasks on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\WZ_20_15_00|&lt;Scenario Name&gt;] ([~/?ScreenId=WZ201500|WZ201500]) form. On this form, you can view the list of tasks with their current statuses. The statuses are assigned to the tasks during scenario activation and indicate whether the task is available for execution. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Scenario_Configuration|Scenario Configuration]. {br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\WZ_20_15_00|&lt;Scenario Name&gt;] form, you can view the following lists of tasks by clicking the appropriate tab:[anchor|#ul_vmb_bxj_jp]
*'''All Records''': The list of all tasks included in the scenario
*'''My Tasks''': The list of tasks assigned to you (the currently signed-in user)
*'''Not Completed Tasks''': The list of tasks that are not executed yet

You can start the scenario execution with any of the ''Open'' tasks. When you click the task name, the [HelpRoot_FormReference\WZ_20_15_10|&lt;Scenario Name&gt; - &lt;Task Name&gt;] ([~/?ScreenId=WZ201510|WZ201510]) form opens. This form may contain the following tabs, which are described in more detail below:[anchor|#ul_uj1_whj_jp]
*'''Summary''' tab: Contains the description of the task or the instructions for execution of the task (if it was specified during scenario configuration).
*'''Optional Subtasks''': Contains the list of optional subtasks. This tab is absent if there are no optional subtasks for the selected task. If an optional subtask exists, you can skip it by clicking the '''Skip''' button.
*'''Predecessors''' tab: Contains the list of tasks that have to be completed to make the selected task be available for execution (its status will change to ''Open'')—that is, the tasks on which the selected task depends on. This tab is absent if there are no predecessor tasks for the selected task.
*'''Successors''' tab: Contains the list of tasks that are not available for execution until the current task is completed—that is, the tasks that are blocked by the selected task. This tab is absent if there are no successor tasks for the selected task.
*'''Details''' tab: Contains the task details, such as the task status, the employee ID to whom the task is assigned (if any), the ID of the employee who completed the task, and the start and end dates of task execution.

You should execute the task by using the instructions located on the '''Summary''' tab or by opening the appropriate form specified for task execution. To do this, you should click the '''Go to Screen''' button (if it is available). ((({S:Warn}If the task has subtasks, you should execute the subtasks first, starting with those that have the ''Open'' status. After all subtasks have been completed, you can complete the parent task.

To indicate that the task is in progress, you can click the '''Start Task''' button on the form toolbar. With this, the task status will change from ''Open'' to ''In Progress''.((({S:Warn}This step is not required, but can be convenient if multiple users execute the scenario. It allows the users to find out whether a task is in progress. In other cases, you can complete any ''Open'' task without using the '''Start Task''' button.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
With Acumatica ERP, you can schedule the activation of the scenarios that have to be performed on a periodic basis. You can create a schedule for a scenario or multiple scenarios that meets your business needs. A schedule defines how many times and how often specific scenarios should be activated in the system. You can assign multiple scenarios to one schedule, or you can create a separate schedule for each scenario.{br}

The schedules can be run manually or automatically. These approaches are described in greater detail in the following sections of this topic.{br}{TOC}
==Creating a Schedule==
To schedule the activation of the recurring scenarios, you need to create a schedule and specify schedule parameters for the particular scenario or scenarios. The parameters define the periods when the scenarios assigned to the schedule should be activated. {br}

To create a schedule, you should use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\WZ_30_10_00|Recurring Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=WZ301000|WZ301000]) form. On that form, you define the start date and expiration date of using the schedule, or define that it should never expire by selecting the '''Never Expires''' check box. You can also limit the number of schedule execution sessions and set up the frequency of running the schedule. To set up this frequency, you need to select one of the following options:[anchor|#ul_obs_yqc_cp]
*'''Daily''': A scenario should be activated every day or every ''x'' days.
*'''Weekly''': A scenario should be activated every week or every ''x'' weeks, on the selected day or days of the week.
*'''Monthly''': A scenario should be activated once per month or every ''x'' months, on the specified day of the month.
*'''By Financial Period''': A scenario should be activated once per financial period or every ''x'' periods, on the specified day of the period.

After you have defined all the required parameters, you can assign the appropriate scenarios to that schedule. To do that, you need to click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar and add scenarios to the schedule. You then save the schedule.{br}

As a result of this operation, you have created a schedule for the scenario or scenarios activation. To run the schedule, you need to click the '''Run Now''' button. When you run the schedule, the system determines whether it should activate the scenario depending on the business date and the next execution date specified in the schedule. The scenario will not be activated if the next execution date has not occurred yet. Otherwise, the scenario will be activated and the system will update the '''Last Executed''' date in the schedule.{br}

For example, suppose that you schedule the scenario to be activated monthly on the first Tuesday of each month. If you run the schedule the first Tuesday of every month, the scenario will be activated each time. If you run this schedule every day, the scenario will be activated only on the first Tuesday of the month.
==Activating Recurring Scenarios==
If you have multiple scenarios that should be activated according to different schedules, it would be quite difficult to remember to run all these schedules on time. In that case, you can automate the process of running the scenario schedules by creating the automation schedule. According to this schedule, the system will run the scenario schedules automatically.{br}

To create an automation schedule, you should click the '''Schedules''' button on the toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\WZ_50_10_00|Activate Recurring Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=WZ501000|WZ501000]) form, and then click the '''Add''' item in the menu. After that, the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_20|Automation Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=SM205020|SM205020]) form opens. On this form, you should specify the schedule parameters and save the schedule. For details, see the [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Scheduled_Processing|Scheduled Processing] and [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Scheduling_the_Desired_Processing|To Schedule Processing] topics.{br}

For example, suppose that there are two recurring scenarios configured in your system. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\WZ_30_10_00|Recurring Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=WZ301000|WZ301000]) form, you have created the schedules for activation these scenarios. The first scenario has to be activated on the first Monday of every month, and the second one has to be activated on the last Friday of each month. To automate the process of running these schedules, you create an automation schedule by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\WZ_50_10_00|Activate Recurring Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=WZ501000|WZ501000]) form. According to this automation schedule, each scenario schedule will be run automatically, so that the scenarios will also be activated automatically. In our example, the first scenario will be activated every month on the first Monday, and the second scenario will be activated every month on the last Friday.((({S:Warn}Only scenarios with the ''Pending'' or ''Completed'' status can be activated by running the schedule.

In this topic and the steps within it, you can find a detailed description of the steps you need to perform to resolve performance issues on the client side and, if necessary, to gather information to provide it to the Acumatica support team. {br}

Performance issues fall into two broad categories:[anchor|#_8ed1d57a-489d-4768-a749-1630d005340f]
*'''Overall performance is slow'''
*:The whole site is slow, and you cannot identify a particular process for which the slowdown occurs.
*'''Some process works slowly'''
*:The site works slowly when a user is working with particular forms or executing specific actions.
{br}

The category your client’s performance issues fall into dictates the steps and substeps you should perform to find the reasons for the performance slowdown and resolve the issue. For each category, the following table shows these steps and substeps; the + symbol indicates that you should perform the step or substep.

To exclude the reasons that lead to performance slowdown most frequently, you should perform the substeps described in the sections that follow.[anchor|#_36238980-f793-4d0d-8b88-4cbcb9b6077b]
==1. Check Whether the Site Is Licensed==
The slowdown may be caused by the site not being licensed. Sites in trial mode allow only two concurrent users and limit the usage of hardware resources. {br}

If you have already registered the site, it could become unlicensed for the following reasons:[anchor|#_30b48afd-9009-4880-a0ed-9970400458eb]
*A user may be using a URL of an unregistered site—for example, if the user is accessing the site through a bookmark with that URL.
*Some hardware changes have been made to the application server—for example, more CPUs have been added, or the application pools have been changed.
{br}

Perform the following task to check whether the site is licensed.'''To check whether the site is licensed:'''[anchor|#_f9e44184-76ae-47a3-9a7b-6c58183c3edc]
#Check if the site is licensed in one of the following ways:
#*Make sure there is no message in the bottom of the browser window that says ''Your product is in the trial mode. Only two concurrent users are allowed. Activate''. See the message in the following screenshot.
#*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_15_10|Activate License] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201510|SM201510]) form, check the value of the '''Status''' element. An unregistered site has the ''Invalid'' status, as shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_47b6c4ba-82d7-4d0c-9e9f-aabcab40ac9e][image:UserGuide/Images/ActivateLicenseInvalid.png|popup|Invalid license|450px]
#Depending on the results of the previous instruction, do one of the following:
#*If the site is not licensed, activate the license by following the instructions in [HelpRoot_Install\Licensing_Acumatica|Licensing and Activating Acumatica ERP]. 
#*If the site is licensed, continue with the next substep.
[anchor|#_cacf2a39-2ffa-4729-af83-da68d6845964]
==2. Check the Speed from Other Browsers==
Another possible reason for the slowdown is that some properties of the browser may be preventing the site from running faster.{br}

Perform the following task to see whether this is the reason for the slowdown.{br}

'''To check the speed from other browsers:'''[anchor|#_32bf72be-e3af-4daf-879f-994f4c70655d]
#Try to access the site from another browser. 
#Depending on the results of the previous instruction, do one of the following:
#*If the issue is reproduced in only one browser, check the version of the browser, and try to reproduce the issue in the latest version of the browser. You can also try to turn off plug-ins in the browser. Collect more information on the slowdown, and send it to the Acumatica support team, as described in [HelpRoot_Administration\how_Troubleshoot_Performance_Step5|Step 5: Collect More Information] and [HelpRoot_Administration\how_Troubleshoot_Performance_Step6|Step 6: Submit a Case to Acumatica Support].
#*If the issue is reproduced in all browsers, continue with the next substep.
[anchor|#_e8fa44f8-311c-4d2a-a2e2-aabed4a155d5]
==3. Check the Speed from Other Locations==
Some network or internet service provider issues at the user’s end may be causing a performance slowdown.{br}

Perform the following task to see whether this is the reason for the slowdown.{br}

'''To check the speed from other locations:'''[anchor|#_84cfb397-a672-47ea-8e32-a085e8696330]
#Try to reproduce the slowdown issue on some computers at a different location.
#Depending on the results of the previous instruction, do one of the following:
#*If the issue is not reproduced on other computers, the problem is probably in the client’s network. Ask the client to check the network settings.
#*If the issue is reproduced on multiple computers, continue with the next substep.
[anchor|#_3f2ef842-3b6a-4c79-9be7-99cbb953f227]
==4. Check Automation Schedules==
Slowdowns may be caused by errors on active schedules, unprocessed emails, or insufficient time for a scheduled processes to complete before others begin. {br}

Perform the following tasks to check the automation schedules.{br}

'''To look for errors on the active schedules:'''[anchor|#_010e32e3-7a79-434d-9913-a51afa78ca99]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_30|Automation Schedule Statuses] ([~/?ScreenId=SM205030|SM205030]) form, look for errors on the active schedules. (For each schedule, see the '''Status''' and the '''Last Execution Result''' columns.)
#Depending on the results of the previous instruction, do one of the following:
#*If you found an error, either correct the error in the scheduled process or deactivate the schedule.
#*If there are no errors in automation schedules, continue with the next task.
{br}

'''To check the frequency of schedules:'''[anchor|#_c5924f68-8ce4-4494-9ee8-f6cff3492da4]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_30|Automation Schedule Statuses] form, make sure there are no schedules starting at the same time or within short intervals.
#Depending on the results of the previous instruction, do one of the following:
#*If you have found some overlap in the schedules, correct the execution times of any needed schedules. For example, we recommend that you leave at least 5 minutes between executions of the ''Send and Receive Email ''schedule, as shown in the following screenshot. [anchor|#_589132a7-43e1-4e9e-95ee-70c1db0590d1][image:UserGuide/Images/SendAndReceiveEmailSchedule.png|popup|Send and Receive Email schedule|450px]
#*If there is enough time for each process to finish before the start of the next scheduled process, continue with the next task.
{br}

'''To look for failed and old unprocessed emails:'''[anchor|#_485c91e5-155a-45b0-8fb1-fd15f9aabfb9]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CO_40_90_70|All Emails] ([~/?ScreenId=CO409070|CO409070]) form, look for failed and old unprocessed emails.
#Depending on the results of the previous instruction, do one of the following:
#*If you have found failed or old unprocessed emails, delete them.
#*If there are no failed or unprocessed emails, continue with the next substep.
[anchor|#_ba43ed97-9782-4aea-9b48-820b14cfb5fe]
=='''5. Explore the Running Processes'''==
The slowdown could be caused by some process that is hung and is running in an endless loop.{br}

Perform the following tasks to check the running processes.{br}

'''To Check the Running Processes in Acumatica ERP'''{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_15_30|System Monitor] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201530|SM201530]) form, check the list of all ongoing processes for all users as follows:[anchor|#_fa80ebe7-1d2a-4e88-acba-f90143c2a5b5]
#Look for processes that have been going on for a long time (typically you should look for processes running longer than 30 minutes) to see if the process is hung and running in an endless loop.
#Depending on the results of the previous instruction, do the following:
#*If some process is hung, select the process and click '''Abort''' on the form toolbar to end the process, as shown in the following screenshot. If the situation repeats, collect more information on the slowdown and send it to the Acumatica support team, as described in [HelpRoot_Administration\how_Troubleshoot_Performance_Step5|Step 5: Collect More Information] and [HelpRoot_Administration\how_Troubleshoot_Performance_Step6|Step 6: Submit a Case to Acumatica Support].[anchor|#_8a499591-eec1-44fa-b59d-2d8f99899ffa][image:UserGuide/Images/RunningProcessesAbort.png|popup|Abort button|450px]
#*If no process is hung, continue with the next task.
{br}

'''To check the running processes in the operating system:'''[anchor|#_bbb9c501-9f9b-4159-b806-5a57e233be78]
#In Task Manager, review the running processes as follows:
#* Check the memory consumption of the ''w3wp.exe'' process.
#*:((({S:Warn}Acumatica ERP runs under the ''w3wp.exe'' process, with the username that is the name of the application pool. 
)))
#*Check whether other processes are executed at the same time and review their memory consumption.
#Depending on the results of the previous, do one of the following:
#*If ''w3wp.exe'' is using almost all memory, create a process dump, as described in [HelpRoot_Administration\how_Troubleshoot_Performance_Step5|If your site is completely non-responsive or extremely slow] in Step 5. Try to restart the process.
#*If another process takes too much time, either investigate the reasons or end the process. 
#*If memory consumption of the ''w3wp.exe'' is normal and no other processes are taking too much time or using too much server memory, continue with the next substep.
[anchor|#_8d5338a1-c780-4797-8728-a786fbf92abb]
=='''6. Check Whether Antivirus Software Is Blocking Some Functionality of the Site'''==
Some settings of antivirus software could be preventing the site from working normally.{br}

Perform the following task to see whether antivirus software is the reason for the slowdown.'''To check whether the antivirus software is blocking the site:'''[anchor|#_6402b2cc-2dde-4e0f-96f0-1fa73c7e6d81]
#Check the antivirus logs, and try to turn off the antivirus software, if any.

To look for errors on the active schedules: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM205030|SM205030]) Automation Schedule Statuses (SM205030) form, look                         for errors on the active schedules. (For each schedule, see the                              Status  and the  Last Execution                             Result  columns.) Depending on the results of the previous instruction, do one of the                             following: If you found an error, either correct the error in the scheduled                                 process or deactivate the schedule. If there are no errors in automation schedules, continue with the                                 next task. To check the frequency of schedules: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM205030|SM205030]) Automation Schedule Statuses form, make sure there                         are no schedules starting at the same time or within short intervals. Depending on the results of the previous instruction, do one of the                             following: If you have found some overlap in the schedules, correct the                                 execution times of any needed schedules. For example, we recommend                                 that you leave at least 5 minutes between executions of the  Send                                     and Receive Email  schedule, as shown in the following                                 screenshot.  Send and Receive Email schedule If there is enough time for each process to finish before the start                                 of the next scheduled process, continue with the next task. To look for failed and old unprocessed emails: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CO409070|CO409070]) All Emails (CO409070) form, look                         for failed and old unprocessed emails. Depending on the results of the previous instruction, do one of the                             following: If you have found failed or old unprocessed emails, delete                                 them. If there are no failed or unprocessed emails, continue with the next                                 substep. 5. Explore the Running Processes The slowdown could be caused by some process that is hung and is running in an                 endless loop. Perform the following tasks to check the running processes. To Check the Running Processes in  Acumatica ERPOn the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201530|SM201530]) System Monitor (SM201530) form, check the list                 of all ongoing processes for all users as follows: Look for processes that have been going on for a long time (typically you                         should look for processes running longer than 30 minutes) to see if the                         process is hung and running in an endless loop. Depending on the results of the previous instruction, do the following: If some process is hung, select the process and click                                      Abort  on the form toolbar to end the                                 process, as shown in the following screenshot. If the situation                                 repeats, collect more information on the slowdown and send it to the                                      Acumatica support team, as described in  Step 5: Collect More Information and  Step 6: Submit a Case to Acumatica Support. Abort button If no process is hung, continue with the next task. To check the running processes in the operating system: In Task Manager, review the running processes as follows:  Check the memory consumption of the  w3wp.exe                                          process. Acumatica ERP runs under the  w3wp.exe  process, with the username                                     that is the name of the application pool.  Check whether other processes are executed at the same time and                                 review their memory consumption. Depending on the results of the previous, do one of the following: If  w3wp.exe  is using almost all memory, create a process                                 dump, as described in  If your site is completely non-responsive or extremely                                     slow If your site is completely non-responsive or extremely slow in Step 5. Try to restart the process. If another process takes too much time, either investigate the                                 reasons or end the process.  If memory consumption of the  w3wp.exe  is normal and no other                                 processes are taking too much time or using too much server memory,                                 continue with the next substep. 6. Check Whether Antivirus                     Software Is Blocking Some Functionality of the Site Some settings                 of antivirus software could be preventing the site from working                 normally. Perform the following task to see whether antivirus software is the                 reason for the slowdown. To check whether the antivirus software is blocking                 the site: Check the antivirus logs, and try to turn off the antivirus software, if                     any. Depending on the results of the previous instruction, do one of the                         following: If the antivirus software is blocking the site, change the antivirus                             settings. If the antivirus software is not blocking the site, continue with  Step 2: Investigate Application Server Time and Database Server Time in the Request Profiler . ]]></column>

To make sure that Microsoft SQL Server works correctly, you should perform the substeps described below.[anchor|#_0a4969cd-273f-48b6-8db0-a806663603b3]
==1. Check the Configuration of the Database Server==
Settings of Microsoft SQL Server may not be configured properly, leading to the performance slowdown.{br}

If correction of Microsoft SQL Server settings does not improve the performance of the site, continue with [[#_370d83b1-6a5c-415a-b461-20adae300041|2. Run Performance Reports].{br}

Perform the following tasks to check Microsoft SQL Server configuration. {br}

'''To ensure that Microsoft SQL Server is not restricted on memory usage:'''{br}

In Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, right-click the database server instance and select '''Properties'''. In the '''Server Properties''' dialog box, click '''Memory'''. Set the value in the '''Maximum server memory (in MB)''' box to 75 to 80 percent of the total physical memory of the server, but leave at least 4 GB available for the operating system. For example, if your server has a total memory of 16 GB, you can set the maximum server memory to 12 GB (which is 75 percent but leaves 4 GB for the operating system).{br}

'''To schedule the weekly maintenance plan:'''{br}

By using the '''Maintenance Wizard''' in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, schedule the following tasks:[anchor|#_04d31a82-1dec-4938-8cd6-d49071029d0c]
*'''Database Integrity Check''': Checks the logical and physical integrity of the database
*'''Rebuild Index''': Helps remove gaps in data pages and eases the data retrieval process 
*'''Shrink Database''': Removes space by moving pages from the end of the file to the front, and then deallocates the excess space back to the file system
*'''Update Statistics''': Internally updates statistical information about tables and indexes used by SQL Query Optimizer during data retrieval requests

You can find more information on creating maintenance plans in [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms189953|https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms189953.aspx]. See an example of the schedule of the recommended maintenance plans in the following screenshot.

==2. Run Performance Reports==
Some SQL queries consume too many resources.{br}

To find out the top resource-consuming SQL queries, you should perform either or both of the following tasks. You should collect data on the resource-consuming SQL queries as quickly as possible after a performance slowdown occurs, because information in such reports is updated frequently during the process of server work.{br}

'''To find out the top resource-consuming SQL queries by using a standard report:'''[anchor|#_c4927b68-e955-4a9f-9235-26c7a2ac3283]
#In the '''Object Explorer''' of Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, right-click the server instance, and select '''Reports''' > '''Standard Reports''' > '''Performance - Top Queries by Average CPU Time'''. Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio opens the report.
#Right-click the report, select '''Export''', and select the format of the exported report.
#Send this report, along with other information on the slowdown, to the Acumatica support team. (See the list of information that you should provide to support in [HelpRoot_Administration\how_Troubleshoot_Performance_Step6|Step 6: Submit a Case to Acumatica Support].)

For                 example, if your server has a total memory of 16 GB, you can set the maximum server                 memory to 12 GB (which is 75 percent but leaves 4 GB for the operating                     system). To schedule the weekly maintenance plan: By using                 the  Maintenance Wizard  in Microsoft SQL Server Management                 Studio, schedule the following tasks: Database Integrity Check : Checks the logical and physical                     integrity of the database Rebuild Index : Helps remove gaps in data pages and eases                     the data retrieval process  Shrink Database : Removes space by moving pages from the                     end of the file to the front, and then deallocates the excess space back to the                     file system Update Statistics : Internally updates statistical                     information about tables and indexes used by SQL Query Optimizer during data                     retrieval requests You can find more information on creating maintenance plans in  https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms189953.aspx https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms189953.aspx.              See an example of the schedule of the recommended maintenance plans in the following             screenshot.  Weekly maintenance plan 2. Run Performance Reports Some SQL queries consume too many resources. To find out the top resource-consuming SQL queries, you should perform either or both                 of the following tasks. You should collect data on the resource-consuming SQL                 queries as quickly as possible after a performance slowdown occurs, because                 information in such reports is updated frequently during the process of server                 work. To find out the top resource-consuming SQL queries by using a standard                 report: In the  Object Explorer  of Microsoft SQL Server                     Management Studio, right-click the server instance, and select  Reports Standard Reports Performance - Top Queries by Average CPU Time . Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio opens the report. Right-click the report, select  Export , and select the                         format of the exported report. Send this report, along with other information on the slowdown, to the  Acumatica support team. (See the list of information that you should provide to                         support in  Step 6: Submit a Case to Acumatica Support.) To find out the top resource-consuming SQL queries manually: Perform the following SQL query to get the performance report. By using this                         report, you get the same information that is provided in the standard report                         but in a table format, which can be more convenient. Moreover, as a result                         of this request, you get not only average CPU time ( AvgCPU )                         but also the number of times the process was executed                             ( execution_count ). Therefore, you can find out not only                         which process is taking the longest but also which process is being executed                         the most.                          SELECT  top 100

                     ELSE qs.statement_end_offset
                     END - qs.statement_start_offset)/2)+ 1
        )AS txt  
, convert(nvarchar(max),query_plan)
, CONVERT(int, depa.value)

cross apply [master].[sys].[dm_exec_plan_attributes](qs.plan_handle) depa  
WHERE (depa.attribute = 'dbid')
ORDER BY 1 DESC; Send the results of the query, along with other information on the slowdown,                         to the  Acumatica support team. (For the list of information that you should provide to                         support, see  Step 6: Submit a Case to Acumatica Support.) 3. Check the SQL Activity Monitor for Locks In the Object Explorer of Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, right-click                     the instance name, and then select  Activity Monitor . Review the  Recent Expensive Queries  section. Send the data from the SQL Activity Monitor, along with other information on the                     slowdown, to the  Acumatica support team. (For the list of information that you should provide to                     support, see  Step 6: Submit a Case to Acumatica Support.) ]]></column>

In this topic, you can find general recommendations for optimal performance of a MySQL database and a list of common problems and solutions.{br}

For more detailed information on MySQL settings, see the [https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/|MySQL Reference Manual].{br}{TOC}[anchor|#_9a11de24-75a0-45c2-95a2-5910127a571d]
==General Recommendations==
To optimize the performance of a MySQL database, do the following:[anchor|#_33204a39-4116-4abf-8b7f-0e222dc45a3f]
#Back up the database regularly.
#Change the default values of the parameters in the <tt>my.cnf</tt> file as follows (for numerical parameters, the minimum recommended values are specified, and you should specify values appropriate to your processing load):
##{{max_allowed_packet=10M}}
##:For this parameter, you specify the maximum size of a file that can be stored in the database. It is important that you limit the file size to prevent the database from becoming overfilled with large files.
##{{innodb_buffer_pool_size=256M}}
##:For this parameter, you specify the size of the buffer pool, which should be 70 to 80 percent of the available RAM.
##{{innodb_log_file_size=64M}}
##:For this parameter, you specify the size of the transaction log file for <tt>InnoDB</tt>. Large <tt>InnoDB</tt> transaction logs are crucial for good and stable writing performance, but larger log files mean that the recovery process will be slower if a crash occurs. You should find a balance between a reasonable recovery time and high performance in your system.
##{{innodb_log_buffer_size=16M}}
##:For this parameter, you specify the size of the buffer for the transaction log. <tt>InnoDB</tt> writes the changed data records into its log buffer, which is kept in memory. This buffer saves disk input and output operations for large transactions because it is not necessary for <tt>InnoDB</tt> to write the log of changes to disk before it commits a transaction.
##{{innodb_flush_method=O_DIRECT}}
##:For this parameter, you specify the method MySQL uses to flush files from RAM to a hard drive. When you use the {{O_DIRECT}} flush method, you avoid double buffering and reduce swap pressure, which improves performance.
##{{key_buffer_size=64M}}
##:For this parameter, you specify the amount of RAM you reserve for the database key buffer. This parameter is very important if you use MyISAM tables. You should specify the value of this parameter as 30 to 40 percent of available RAM if you use MyISAM tables exclusively.
##{{read_rnd_buffer_size=1M}}
##:For this parameter, you specify the size of the buffer that the database uses after a sort, when it is reading rows in sorted order. When the database is reading rows from a {{MyISAM}} table in sorted order following a key-sorting operation, the rows are read through this buffer to avoid disk seeks. If you use many queries with {{ORDER BY}}, you can increase this parameter value to improve performance.
##{{query_cache_size=0}}
##:For this parameter, you specify the RAM amount allocated for the query cache. The caching mechanism works ineffectively; therefore, we recommend that the query cache be switched off.
##{{innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=2}}
##:For this parameter, you specify how often the log buffer is flushed on disk. The default value of this parameter is ''1'', which means that each {{UPDATE}} transaction will be flushed to a hard drive and therefore this mode is resource-demanding. When you set this parameter to ''2'', the log buffer is flushed to the OS file cache on every transaction commit, which significantly increases the speed of writing to the database. The drawback of this mode is that the database can lose transactions for the last second or two if OS crashes.

==1. Investigate Requests in the Request Profiler==
Do the following to isolate queries leading to errors and performance lags:[anchor|#_248b6f95-a98d-4cfd-ac54-21c163a36d53]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_70|Request Profiler] ([~/?ScreenId=SM205070|SM205070]) form, specify the following settings, which are shown in the screenshot below: 
#*'''Log SQL Requests''': Selected
#*'''SQL Time Threshold''': 2000
#*'''SQL Count Threshold''': 1000
#:((({S:Warn}You have specified two thresholds for the requests. Therefore, the profiler will record the URL requests that meet either of these conditions (the logical OR is applied).

==3. Use External Tools==
You can use different external tools to get more information about the reasons for the performance slowdown.{br}

For example, you can use the [https://www.jetbrains.com/profiler/download/|dotTrace] performance profiler to create a process snapshot.  If you use external tools to investigate performance issues, include the information obtained from these tools when you contact the Acumatica support team. (For the list of information that you should provide to support, see [HelpRoot_Administration\how_Troubleshoot_Performance_Step6|Step 6: Submit a Case to Acumatica Support].)]]></column>
			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Step 5: Collect More Information If you have not found the reason for the performance slowdown while performing the                 previous steps or you need to collect more details about it, perform the following                 substeps. 1. Investigate Requests in the Request Profiler Do the following to isolate queries leading to errors and performance lags: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM205070|SM205070]) Request Profiler (SM205070) form,                         specify the following settings, which are shown in the screenshot below:  Log SQL Requests : Selected SQL Time Threshold : 2000 SQL Count Threshold : 1000 You have specified two thresholds for the requests. Therefore,                             the profiler will record the URL requests that meet either of these                             conditions (the logical OR is applied). Request Profiler settings If the Request Profiler has not been started yet, click                              Start  on the form toolbar. Reproduce the slowdown in the system. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM205070|SM205070]) Request Profiler  form, click                              Refresh Results  on the form toolbar to upload to                         the form all the new activities since the last refresh. Review the list of requests as follows: Find requests that have a value other than  LongRun  in the                                      Command Target  column with a server time                                 greater than 2000 milliseconds. Find requests that have more than 1000 milliseconds in the                                      SQL Count  column. For each request that meets either or both of the criteria above, select the                         corresponding row in the table, and click  SQL  on the                         table toolbar to see the queries being executed, as shown in the following                             screenshot. SQL button In the  SQL Profiler  dialog box, which opens, review                         the  TimeMs  column, which shows the time taken by each                         step, and find the row with the biggest value in this column, as shown in                         the following screenshot. SQL Profiler dialog box Double-click on this row to see the actual SQL statement, an example of                         which is shown in the following screenshot. SQL statement Copy and paste the statement into SQL Server Management Studio, run the                         query with the Execution Plan enabled, and see whether any suggestions are                         provided by the SQL Server. The following screenshot demonstrates SQL                             Server suggesting that the problem is a missing index. SQL Server suggestion Report the issue to the  Acumatica support team, as described in  Step 6: Submit a Case to Acumatica Support. You can save the Request Profiler log to an Excel file by clicking                              Export to Excel  on the table toolbar on the                         Request Profiler form. You can perform the solution suggested by SQL                             Server as an interim fix after consultation with the  Acumatica support team. However, we recommend that such issues are always                             reported via a support case for a permanent solution. 2. Collect Additional Information from the Logs You should collect the information from the needed log files depending on the                 situation, which can be one of the following: The performance slowdown appeared after an                         update The performance slowdown appeared after an updateYour site is completely non-responsive or extremely                             slow Your site is completely non-responsive or extremely slowYou need to track a randomly reproducible                         error You need to track a randomly reproducible errorIf the performance slowdown appeared                     after an update Get information on the update that was performed and the errors that                         occurred during update by using the following resources: Update history and errors On the  Update History  tab                                     of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM203510|SM203510]) Apply Updates                                     (SM203510) form, get the information on the history of                                     updates and the errors that occurred during update. You can get                                     the same information from the  UpHistory  and                                          UpErrors  database tables of the site database, which                                     you can view in the SQL Server Management Studio. Maintlog.txt This log file contains the update history for                                     the instance and all the errors that were logged during the                                     update. The log file can be used to review the cause when you                                     are unable to log in due to a failed update through the  Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard. You can find the file in the folder                                          <Acumatica ERP Installation Folder>\<Site                                         Folder>\App_Data.  By default, the folder is                                          C:\Program Files (x86)\Acumatica ERP\<Site                                         Folder>\App_Data . Provide this information to the  Acumatica support team, along with other information on the performance slowdown                         issue. (For the list of information that you should provide to support, see                              Step 6: Submit a Case to Acumatica Support.) If your site is completely                     non-responsive or extremely slow: Create a dump file as follows: In Task Manager on the application server, find the                                      w3wp.exe  process that is run under the                                 username that is the name of the application pool. Right-click on the process, and select  Create Dump                                     File , as shown in the following screenshot.  Creation of a dump file A process dump is a snapshot of an application showing what                             processes were executing and which modules were loaded at the time it                             was taken. The dump must be created only when the site is completely                             non-responsive or extremely slow. While you are creating a dump file,                             the process goes into a suspended mode, which will disconnect users from                             the site and lose any unsaved work. Provide the dump file to the  Acumatica support team, along with other materials related to the performance                         slowdown issue. (For the list of information that you should provide to                         support, see  Step 6: Submit a Case to Acumatica Support.) If you need to track a randomly                     reproducible error Enable the first-chance exception log as follows: Ensure that there is enough hard drive space on the  Acumatica ERP installation drive (which by default is drive  C) . The                                     first-chance exception log grows quite quickly in size and                                     should be enabled for only short periods of time. In the  web.config  file in the  Acumatica ERP site folder, find the  EnableFirstChanceExceptionsLogging                                  key, and change its value to  true , as shown in the following                                 screenshot.  Fragment of web.config Reproduce the problem. Find the first-chance exception log file in the site folder. By                                 default, it is  C:\Program Files (x86)\Acumatica                                     ERP\<Site Folder>\firstchanceexceptions.log . The first-chance exception log is a powerful mechanism to track                             all exceptions in the system, but especially randomly reproducible                             errors. The difference between the first-chance exception log and the                             exception log that you can obtain by using the Request Profiler in  Acumatica ERP (if you select  Log Trace Messages ,                                  Log Exceptions , or both on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM205070|SM205070]) Request Profiler (SM205070) form) is that                             the first-chance exception log tracks not only committed transactions                             but also transactions that resulted in errors. Provide the first-chance exception log file to the  Acumatica support team, along with other materials related to the performance                         slowdown issue. (For the list of information that you should provide to                         support, see  Step 6: Submit a Case to Acumatica Support.) 3. Use External                 Tools You can use different external tools to get more information about                 the reasons for the performance slowdown. For example, you can use the  dotTrace dotTrace performance profiler to create a process                 snapshot.   If you use external tools to investigate performance issues, include             the information obtained from these tools when you contact the  Acumatica support team.

==Trace==
The Acumatica ERP trace log is the first place you should look when you face an issue in the application. You can view the trace log by clicking '''Tools''' > '''Trace''' on the form title bar.{br}

When you are working with reports or generic inquiries, the trace log contains relevant SQL statements that you can use for SQL debugging purposes.{br}

By default, the trace log is stored only in the current user session. However, you can also store the trace log in the file system. This possibility is useful when you are dealing with errors that cause Internet Information Services (IIS) to become unresponsive and result in a web server restart.{br}

To make the trace log stored in a file as well as in the current user session, edit the <tt>pxtrace</tt> section of the <tt>web.config</tt> file (which is located in the folder that contains the application instance website) similarly to the code block shown below.{{{{&lt;pxtrace defaultProvider="PXSessionTraceProvider"&gt;
    &lt;providers&gt;
        &lt;remove name="PXSessionTraceProvider" /&gt;
        &lt;add name="PXSessionTraceProvider" type="PX.Data.PXSessionTraceProvider, PX.Data" 
             url="../Frames/Trace.aspx" /&gt;
        &lt;remove name="PXFileTraceProvider" /&gt;
        &lt;add name="PXFileTraceProvider" type="PX.Data.PXFileTraceProvider, PX.Data" 
             file = "C:\Out\AcumaticaTraceInfo.txt" /&gt;
    &lt;/providers&gt;
&lt;/pxtrace&gt;
}}}}

==First-Chance Exception Log==
 Acumatica ERP has a mechanism for catching and logging all exceptions in the system. You can activate it by editing the appropriate line in the <tt>appSettings</tt> section of the <tt>web.config</tt> file (which is located in the folder that contains the application instance website) to read as follows.{{{{&lt;add key="EnableFirstChanceExceptionsLogging" value="true" /&gt;
}}}}
You can edit the file name for the log in the following line of the same section. (By default, the log will be stored in <tt>&lt;Site&#95;Folder&gt;\App&#95;Data\firstchanceexceptions.log</tt>, where ''&lt;Site&#95;Folder&gt;'' is the path to the folder that contains the application instance website.){{{{&lt;add key="FirstChanceExceptionsLogFileName" value="firstchanceexceptions.log" /&gt;
}}}}((({S:Warn}The first-chance exception log contains records of all exceptions, including those that the system has already caught and handled without issues, so the log file will grow rapidly and may reach an unmanageable size in minutes. Because of this, we recommend that you activate this logging mechanism for only short periods of time. In addition, you may want to erase the contents of the file once the error has been replicated and you have determined the required call stack.
)))
When you are facing a problem of an unknown origin, we recommend that you use this logging mechanism before trying other solutions—that is, you enable the mechanism, replicate the error, disable the mechanism to stop the log file from growing too much, and view the resulting log.[anchor|#_8e4da825-a68e-454f-bccd-7bc584e54a8a]

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Using Logs  Acumatica ERP stores logs in a number of files and database tables. This topic contains information         about the following logs: Trace Trace: You can use this standard  Acumatica ERP log for browsing issues that occur in the application. First-chance exception log First-chance exception log: This mechanism for catching and logging           exceptions can be very helpful when you are facing a problem of an unknown origin. Configuration Wizard logs Configuration Wizard logs: These logs provide information related           to issues occurring in the  Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard or  Acumatica Framework                             Configuration Wizard. Maintenance logs Maintenance logs: In these logs, you can find details about issues           that occur when you perform an upgrade in the  Acumatica ERP application.  Acumatica ERP logs  Acumatica ERP logs: These logs, which are stored in database tables, provide historical data           for various operations. Windows logs Windows logs: These logs provide details for issues related to           ASP.NET (for example, frequent application restarts or unhandled exceptions). IIS logs IIS logs: In these logs, IIS keeps records of all requests. SQL Server logs SQL Server logs: These logs, kept by SQL Server, contain details           for issues related to database accessibility and server maintenance operations. Trace The  Acumatica ERP trace log is the first place you should look when you face an issue in the application.         You can view the trace log by clicking  Tools Trace  on the form title bar. When you are working with reports or generic inquiries, the trace log contains relevant SQL         statements that you can use for SQL debugging purposes. By default, the trace log is stored only in the current user session. However, you can also         store the trace log in the file system. This possibility is useful when you are dealing with         errors that cause Internet Information Services (IIS) to become unresponsive and result in a         web server restart. To make the trace log stored in a file as well as in the current user session, edit the            pxtrace  section of the  web.config  file (which is         located in the folder that contains the application instance website) similarly to the code         block shown below. <pxtrace defaultProvider="PXSessionTraceProvider">

             file = "C:\Out\AcumaticaTraceInfo.txt" />
    </providers>
</pxtrace> In this case, the log file will be stored in            C:\Out\AcumaticaTraceInfo.txt . You should create the folder for the         log file manually. You will have to monitor the size of the log file manually and delete its contents from         time to time to avoid excessive growth of the file. If you prefer to store the trace log only in a file and not in the current user session,         edit the  pxtrace  section of the  web.config  file         similarly to the code block shown below. <pxtrace defaultProvider="PXFileTraceProvider">

[anchor|#_ba6d6714-71cb-49c1-8a8f-a061ca5cd48b]
==Automation Debugging==
If you encounter a problem with automation steps or definitions that you have configured in Acumatica ERP, you can use automation debugging. You can activate it by adding the following line in the <tt>appSettings</tt> section of the <tt>web.config</tt> file (which is located in the folder that contains the application instance website).{{{{&lt;add key="AutomationDebug" value="true" /&gt;
}}}}
After you have activated automation debugging, you can view the information about the current automation step in the form title bar on any form in Acumatica ERP.[anchor|#_dbe22d77-96db-4dd5-940f-65ce52b5f21a]
==ShowError URL Parameter==
If Acumatica ERP displays a generic error message (for example, ''We&rsquo;re sorry! An error has occurred while processing your request. A report has been generated for our technical staff to investigate the problem. Please try to repeat your request later. Thank you for understanding.'') and you do not have direct access to the file system of the Acumatica ERP server (as in the case of public hosting), you can use the special URL parameter <tt>ShowError=true</tt>. As a result, the system will display the specific message for the error that has occurred instead of the generic message.{br}

The full URL with the parameter looks as follows: <tt>http://&lt;website&#95;address&gt;/main.aspx?showerror=true</tt>, where {{<website_address>}} is replaced with the address of your site.]]></column>

{br}{TOC}[anchor|#_48f477e3-8643-4fe2-9360-e7898b091afd]
==JetBrains dotTrace==
JetBrains dotTrace is a tool for analyzing the performance of your application. In particular, by using this tool, you can view the average running time for the methods in your application.[anchor|#_df009414-950b-45fb-b639-14807e10cb38]
==.NET Memory Profiler==
.NET Memory Profiler is another tool for monitoring and analyzing issues on your server. By using this tool, you can take snapshots of the Acumatica ERP memory and isolate memory leaks.[anchor|#_095a927e-d9fe-4e3b-99a0-38013003f013]
==WinDbg==
WinDbg is a powerful tool that can open and analyze process dump files.{br}

To use WinDbg, you first need to obtain two .dll files from the .NET Framework version installed on the machine where the dump file was created. You then load these files into WinDbg by using the {{.load}} command, and use the {{.symfix}} system command to set the symbol storing path, as shown below.{{{{.load c:\sos\sos.dll
.load c:\sos\mscordacwks.dll
.symfix
}}}}
You can then analyze all objects in the memory by using the following commands:[anchor|#_e9205ac3-87cd-4db2-9020-e680acd5e6a5]
*{{!dumpheap -stat}} (summary for objects of all types)
*{{!dumpheap -type System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection}} (objects of a specific type)
*{{!do 000007feeeca24a0}} (object at a specific address)

By exploring the memory this way, you can obtain the value of each object instance in the current process, which may help you find the reason why the application is not working correctly.]]></column>

On initialization of the domain, the system compiles every page from the site map and stores the pages in the web server cache. This gives users the ability to quickly open any page without having to wait for it to compile when the page is opened for the first time. The downside of compiling every page during startup is the significant increase in memory consumption for a short period after the initialization.{br}

To avoid this increase in memory consumption, you can disable the compilation of all pages during startup.
