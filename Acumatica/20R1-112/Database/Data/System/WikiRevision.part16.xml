The License Tiers are grouped in the following series: S Series: Includes S1, S2, and S3 Tiers M Series: Includes M1, M2, and M3 Tiers L Series: Includes L1, L2, L3, and L4 Tiers X Series: Includes X1, X2, X3, and X4 Tiers E Series: Includes E1, E2, E3, E4, and E5 Tiers This topic contains typical server configurations for PCS and PCP     licenses that depend on the series of your License Tier, the software requirements for the     server part of the system, and the system requirements for workstations. Server Configurations This section describes typical hardware specifications for servers used to host  Acumatica ERP     (which includes the application server and the database) and typical configurations of Amazon     Web Services and Microsoft Azure instances for each series of License Tiers. You should install the application server and the database on separate virtual machines or     physical servers.

You deploy an Acumatica ERP instance by using the Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard.
==To Deploy a New Acumatica ERP Application Instance==[anchor|#ol_hz4_hhg_sl]
#Run the Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard. For example, select '''Start &gt; Acumatica &gt; Acumatica ERP                         Configuration'''.
#On the Welcome page, click '''Deploy New Application Instance'''.
#:Alternatively, on the Welcome page of the Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard, click '''Perform Application Maintenance''', and then click '''New''' on the Application Maintenance page.
#On the Database Server Connection page, specify the database server that will be used by the Acumatica ERP instance: 
##In the '''Server Type''' box, choose the server type. The following options are available: ''Microsoft SQL Server'' or ''MySQL Server''.
##Select a server to connect to. Do one of the following:
##*In the '''Server Name''' box, type the name or the address of the server machine.
##*:((({S:Warn}For a MySQL server, the port number defaults to 3306. You can specify the custom port number after a comma.
)))
##*If you are using a Microsoft SQL server, select the server in the '''Available Servers''' list. 
##*:If the server list does not include the server you are looking for, you should click '''Update the List''' to rescan your network. The list of database servers may not have a particular server even after your network is rescanned (if, for instance, the server blocks broadcasts). If the problem persists, contact your network administrator for assistance.
##*:((({S:Warn}If you use Microsoft SQL Server Express, the ''(local)'' option will not work even if the database server is running on the same machine. To use the server, start the SQL Browser service first, and then update the list of servers and select your server. Note that Microsoft SQL Server Express should not be used in a production environment due to its limitations.
)))
##Select the authentication method to be used to connect to the database server. If you select the '''SQL Server Authentication''' option, specify an account with sufficient rights for creating the databases or making changes to them. Keep the following points in mind as you select an authentication method:
##*The selected authentication method must be supported by the database server. By default, Microsoft SQL Server 2005 is installed with Windows authentication disabled.
##*Windows authentication works only for a local Microsoft SQL Server or when both application and database servers are members of the same Windows domain.
##*Windows authentication doesn&rsquo;t work for a MySQL Server.
#Click '''Next'''.
#On the Database Configuration page, select the appropriate option as follows: 
#*To create a new database, click '''Create a new database''' and then type the name in the '''New database&rsquo;s name''' box.
#*To connect to an existing database, do the following:
#*#Click '''Connect to an existing database'''.
#*#In the '''Available databases on server''' list, select a database name.
#*#Depending on the schema of the database you have selected, select the relevant check box to update, repair, or set up the database, if required. 
#*#If you want to shrink data after the database maintenance, select the '''Shrink data''' check box.
#Click '''Next'''.
#On the Tenant Setup page, do the following:
##Configure the new tenant (named ''Tenant'') that the Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard created by default:
##*To rename the tenant, double-click the tenant name in the '''Login Tenant Name''' column, type a new tenant name, and press Enter.
##*If you want to fill the database with demo data, select ''SalesDemo'' in the '''Insert Data''' column.
##Optional: Add more tenants if you want to create a multitenant Acumatica ERP instance. For more information about tenant setup, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__mng_MultiCompany|Managing Tenants].
##Optional: For a multitenant Acumatica ERP instance, if you want to restrict the list of tenants a user can see only to the tenants the user has access to, select the '''Secure Tenant on Login Form''' check box. In this case, the Tenant box does not appear on the Sign-In page by default and all users first authenticate themselves by entering their login and password.
##Optional: For a multitenant Acumatica ERP instance, if you want to configure data sharing between tenants, select the '''Advanced Settings''' check box. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Support_of_Multiple_Companies|Support of Multiple Tenants].
#Click '''Next'''.
#On the Database Connection page, specify the authentication method that this instance of Acumatica ERP will use to connect to the database, which is one of the following options:
#*'''Windows Authentication''': The Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard will use the default anonymous user account used by Internet Information Services (IIS).
#*:((({S:Warn}Windows authentication doesn&rsquo;t work for a MySQL Server.
)))
#*'''SQL Server Authentication''': Select '''Create new login''' to create a new SQL login, or select '''Use existing login''' and specify an existing login. The login must have at least the following rights:
#**For a Microsoft SQL server, ''read, write, execute,'' and ''ddl&#95;admin''
#**For a MySQL server, ''create'', ''alter'', ''drop'', ''select'', ''delete'', ''insert'', ''update'', ''create temporary tables'', and ''execute''
#Click '''Next'''.
#On the Instance Configuration page, specify the following options:
##'''Instance Name''': Type a name for this Acumatica ERP instance.
##'''Create Acumatica ERP Site''': Select this option button.
##'''Local Path to the Instance''': Enter the path on the local computer to this application instance.
#Click '''Next'''.
#On the Web Site Configuration page, do the following:
##In the '''Web Site Settings''' section, configure the list of websites and create a virtual directory. To use the URL of the IIS default site (that is, http://www.domain.com), clear the '''Create Virtual Directory''' check box.
##In the '''Application Pool Settings''' section, specify the application pool. You may want to use a dedicated application pool to better isolate instances and fine-tune resources that are allocated for the instance by IIS. To specify the dedicated application pool, select one of the following options:
##*To create a new application pool, click '''Create New Application Pool''' and type the name in the '''Application Pool Name''' box.
##*To use an existing application pool, click '''Use Existing Application Pool''' and select the name of the application pool in the list of available application pools.
##*:The list of application pools includes all the application pools you can use to install Acumatica ERP from the list of pools configured in Web Server (IIS), either classic or integrated.
##*:((({S:Warn}Acumatica ERP employs the application pools that use one of the supported .NET Framework versions. For the list of supported .NET Framework versions, see [HelpRoot_Install\System_Requirements|System Requirements for Acumatica ERP 2020 R1].
)))
#Click '''Next'''.
#On the Confirm Configuration page, do the following:

Also, you can access the storage services that are provided through the Windows Azure Management Portal. To use them, you must have a storage account. 
==System Requirements==
Deploying Acumatica ERP on Microsoft Azure imposes additional limitations to Acumatica ERP system requirement, described in [HelpRoot_Install\System_Requirements|System Requirements for Acumatica ERP 2020 R1].
The performance of Microsoft Azure SQL databases may not satisfy the requirements of midsize or large organizations. If daily volumes of your company exceed a thousand transactions, we recommend that you use Microsoft Azure&rsquo;s virtual machine with the CPU frequency equals 3 GHz or higher and your own dedicated SQL server.
==Before You Begin==
To deploying Acumatica ERP instance on Windows Azure, you will need the following:[anchor|#_dbd53754-e645-4d00-868d-57008b6172c6]
*An Azure account. For more information, see [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/|Microsoft Azure].
*An SSL service certificate that has been signed by a Certificate Authority, a trusted third-party who issues certificates. 
*: If you do not already have one, you will need to obtain one from a company that sells SSL certificates. If you have the certificate imported in the system, you can export the certificate into a PFX file by using the Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager or OpenSSL command-line tools.

==Deployment==
To deploy the Acumatica ERP Service on the Windows Azure platform, you perform the following steps:[anchor|#ol_swf_1qj_r3]
#Download the service package file [HelpRoot_Install\Deploying_on_Azure__Config_Package|To Download the Configuration Package]

During this step, you deploy an instance by using the Acumatica Framework                             Configuration Wizard. {br}

To deploy a new Acumatica Framework instance, do the following: [anchor|#ol_c4d_1c2_p3]
#Run the Acumatica Framework                             Configuration Wizard. For example, select '''Start &gt; Acumatica &gt; Acumatica Framework                             Configuration'''.
#On the Welcome page of the wizard, do one of the following:
#*Click '''Deploy New Instance of Acumatica Application Template''' to deploy a new application instance or an application instance with training templates.
#*Click '''Deploy New Instance of Acumatica Training Application''' to deploy a training application instance of Acumatica Framework with all demo data.
#On the Database Server Connection page, specify the database server that will be used by the Acumatica Framework instance: 
##In the '''Server Type''' box, choose the server type. The following options are available: ''Microsoft SQL Server'' or ''MySQL Server''.
##Select a server to connect to. Do one of the following:
##*In the '''Server Name''' box, type the name or the address of the server machine. Also, you can specify the custom port number after a comma.
##*:((({S:Warn}For a MySQL server, the port number defaults to 3306.
)))
##*If you are using a Microsoft SQL server, select the server in the '''Available Servers''' list. 
##*:If the server list does not include the server you are looking for, you should click '''Update the List''' to rescan your network. The list of database servers may not have a particular server even after your network is rescanned (if, for instance, the server blocks broadcasts). If the problem persists, contact your network administrator for assistance.
##*:((({S:Warn}If you use Microsoft SQL Server Express, the ''(local)'' option will not work even if the database server is running on the same machine. To use the server, start the SQL Browser service first, and then update the list of servers and select your server. Note that Microsoft SQL Server Express should not be used in a production environment due to its limitations.
)))
##Select the authentication method to be used to connect to the database server. If you select the '''SQL Server Authentication''' option, specify an account with sufficient rights for creating the databases or making changes to them. Keep the following points in mind as you select an authentication method:
##*The selected authentication method must be supported by the database server. By default, Microsoft SQL Server 2005 is installed with Windows authentication disabled.
##*Windows authentication works only for a local Microsoft SQL Server or when both application and database servers are members of the same Windows domain.
##*Windows authentication doesn&rsquo;t work for a MySQL Server.
#Click '''Next'''.
#On the Database Configuration page, select the appropriate option as follows: 
#*To create a new database, click '''Create a new database''', and then type the name in the '''New database&rsquo;s name''' box.
#*To connect to an existing database, do the following:
#*#Click '''Connect to an existing database'''.
#*#In the '''Available databases on server''' list, click a database name.
#*#Depending on the schema of the database you have selected, select the relevant check box to update, repair, or set up the database. To shrink data after the database maintenance, select the '''Shrink data''' check box.
#Click '''Next'''.
#On the Database Connection page, specify the authentication method that this application instance of Acumatica Framework will use to connect to the database, which is one of the following options:
#*'''Windows Authentication''': The Acumatica Framework                             Configuration Wizard will use the default anonymous user account used by Internet Information Services (IIS).
#*:((({S:Warn}Windows authentication doesn&rsquo;t work for a MySQL Server.
)))
#*'''SQL Server Authentication''': Select '''Create new login''' to create a new SQL login, or select '''Use existing login''' and specify an existing login. The login must have at least the following rights:
#**For a Microsoft SQL server, ''read, write, execute,'' and ''ddl&#95;admin''
#**For a MySQL server, ''create'', ''alter'', ''drop'', ''select'', ''delete'', ''insert'', ''update'', ''create temporary tables'', and ''execute''
#Click '''Next'''.
#On the Instance Configuration page, specify the following options:
#*'''Instance Name''': Type a name for this Acumatica Framework instance.
#*'''Local Path to the Instance''': Enter the path on the local computer to this application instance.
#Click '''Next'''.
#On the Web Site Configuration page, do the following:
#*Configure the list of websites and create a virtual directory. To use the URL of the IIS default site (that is, http://www.domain.com), clear the '''Create Virtual Directory''' check box.
#*Specify the application pool. You may want to use a dedicated application pool to better isolate instances and fine-tune resources that are allocated for the instance by IIS. To specify the dedicated application pool, select one of the following options:
#**To create a new application pool, click '''Create New Application Pool''' and type the application pool name.
#**To use the existing application pool, click '''Use Existing Application Pool''' and select the name of the application pool.
#**:The list of application pools includes all the application pools you can use to install Acumatica Framework from the list of pools configured in Web Server (IIS), either classic or integrated.
#**:((({S:Warn}Acumatica Framework employs the application pools that use one of the supported .NET Framework versions. For the list of supported .NET Framework versions, see [HelpRoot_Install\System_Requirements|System Requirements for Acumatica ERP 2020 R1].

#Click '''Next'''.
#On the Confirm Configuration page, do the following:
##Check the configuration settings you have specified. 
##Optional. To make any changes, click '''Back''' to return to the required wizard page, and then make necessary changes.
##To save the configuration settings in an XML file on your computer, click '''Save Configuration'''.

Navigate to  http://localhost/Instance_Name/  in the web                             browser, where  Instance_Name  is the name that you specified in                             the  Virtual Directory Name  box on the Web Site Configuration page                             during configuration. (If you used the default name for the virtual                             directory during the deployment of the instance, you would use the                             following URL:                                  http://localhost/AcumaticaFramework/ .) The                                      http://localhost/Instance_Name/  URL works only                                 on the local computer where you have installed  Acumatica Framework Tools. To access the  Acumatica Framework instance remotely, use the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of                                 the server instead of  localhost  in the URL. On the Sign-In page, enter the following default credentials: My User Name :  admin My Password :  setup Click  Sign In . Type the new password in the  New Password  and                          Confirm Password  boxes. If your  Acumatica Framework instance is configured so that you need to agree to the terms of the  Acumatica User Agreement, do the following: Click the  Acumatica User Agreement  link, and read the user agreement.  Select  Check here to indicate that you have read and agree to the                                 terms of the  Acumatica User Agreement , if you agree to these terms. If you don't                             agree to the terms of the user agreement, you cannot start using the                             software. Click  Sign In . ]]></column>

In Acumatica ERP, system administrators can check the limits for system resources specified in their license by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_60_40_00|License Monitoring Console] ([~/?ScreenId=SM604000|SM604000]) form.{br}

One limit shown on this form is the maximum numbers of users allowed to use the system concurrently according to the currently applied license. This topic describes this limit and the way it works in Acumatica ERP.{br}{TOC}
==User Types==
Two types of users can sign in to Acumatica ERP instances:[anchor|#_7a2aadc7-7c8e-44c3-a894-4bb1c4b32a18]
*Conventional users: These users sign in by using their user names and passwords either on the Acumatica ERP Sign-In page, or through the mobile application, or through single sign-on page provided that SSO with Google or Microsoft Account has been set up.
*API users: These users are client applications that sign in by using the method for singing in of the contract-based SOAP API, contract-based REST API, or screen-based SOAP API, or by using OAuth 2.0 mechanism of authorization for applications.

==License Restrictions==
Trial mode allows only two conventional users and two API user to concurrently use the system. Once a license has been applied to your Acumatica ERP instance, the particular license defines how many user sessions can be active in the instance. {br}

The license restriction for conventional users is shown in the '''Concurrent Users''' box on the '''License''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_60_40_00|License Monitoring Console] ([~/?ScreenId=SM604000|SM604000]) form. When an extra conventional user signs in to the system and the number of user sessions exceeds this license restriction, the user with the earliest sign-in time is forcibly signed out.{br}

On the '''License''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_60_40_00|License Monitoring Console] form, the '''Maximum Number of Web Services API Users''' box displays the license restriction for API users. When an extra API user tries to sign in to the system and the number of API user sessions exceeds your license restriction, an error message is returned and the sign-in process is interrupted. For details about the license limitations for the API users, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_License_Restrictions_API_Users|License Restrictions for API Users].
==Multiple User Sessions for the Same User==
You can define how the Acumatica ERP instance handles conventional users (but not API users) who try to sign in using the same user name—for example, from different browsers. In the site <tt>web.config</tt> settings, you can use the <tt>&lt;concurrentUserMode&gt;</tt> parameter to specify whether the system allows users to sign in multiple times under the same user name. {br}

If the <tt>&lt;concurrentUserMode&gt;</tt> parameter is set to ''false'' (the default setting), the system allows multiple user sessions under the same user name or names. For example, 10 users can sign in as ''admin'', 10 user sessions are created, and all of them are counted to comply with the concurrent user limit.{br}

If the <tt>&lt;concurrentUserMode&gt;</tt> is ''true'', the system allows only one user session under each user name. If anyone tries to sign in the system with a user name that is already signed in, the system will forcibly sign out the first user that is signed in with this user name.{br}

For details on changing the default system behavior to disallow multiple user sessions for the same user, see [HelpRoot_Install\how__Enable_Concurrent_User_Mode|To Limit Users to One Session ].

By default, this option is turned off, and system                 users can create user sessions (under the same user name and with different user                 names) until the concurrent user limit is reached.

Updates for Acumatica ERP provide functional enhancements and new functionality. You need to use an installation package to update your Acumatica ERP instances.{br}

In this topic, you will read about the ways to update Acumatica ERP and the schedule for locking out the system during the time of update.
==Updating Acumatica ERP==
You can update your instance of Acumatica ERP to a new product version or build in one of the following ways:[anchor|#_03d8ddd2-a6b2-4af5-a4f1-57eb23b4a343]
*By using the Acumatica ERP web interface
*By using the Acumatica ERP Configuration Wizard

The easiest way of updating Acumatica ERP is by using the web interface.[anchor|#_e75e7df9-1ae4-4d0b-8a9e-20af14958c81]((({S:Warn}If you have deployed your instance on Windows Azure, you won&rsquo;t be able to update this instance though the web interface. You must instead use the procedures described in [HelpRoot_Install\Upgrading_on_Azure|Updating Your Acumatica ERP Service on Windows Azure].
))){br}

If a server with Acumatica ERP is connected to the Internet, the system can download installation packages directly from the Acumatica ERP update server during installation. If the server is not connected to the Internet, you can download the update package from another computer, upload the package to Acumatica ERP, and install it by using the web interface. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Install\Updates__con_Web_Interface|Updating Acumatica ERP by Using the Web Interface].{br}

Alternatively, you can update Acumatica ERP by using the Configuration Wizard if you cannot update it by using the web interface (for example, for security reasons). For details, see [HelpRoot_Install\Upgrading_Locally|Updating Acumatica ERP by Using the Configuration Wizard].{br}

You can forbid the users of your Acumatica ERP instance to update the system by using the web interface. This might be useful, for example, when you want to avoid an unwanted update of a large database on Amazon Web Services. To prevent users from updating the system through the web interface, you set the {{RestrictUpdates}} parameter value to ''True'' in the {{appSettings}} section of the <tt>web.config</tt> file. With this setting, a message conveying this restriction appears on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_10|Apply Updates] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203510|SM203510]) form, all update actions on this form are blocked, and you can update Acumatica ERP by using the Configuration Wizard only.((({S:Warn}The system deletes all custom files from the Acumatica ERP site folders during an update. You can keep custom files in the <tt>Bin</tt> folder by doing one of the following:[anchor|#_d42840a5-e9ee-4494-8add-9b01ca7926de]
*Including all custom files in a customization package and publishing this customization package on the site
*Adding the file names to the file with the <tt>.preserve</tt> extension in the same folder
)))
==Scheduling the Lockout of the System==
We recommend that you switch on maintenance mode when you are updating the system. In this mode, users cannot access the system and process documents; therefore, it is safe to apply updates. To switch on maintenance mode, you schedule the system lockout by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_10|Apply Updates] form, specifying when the system will be unavailable. When the lockout is in effect, non-administrative users will see a message on the Sign-In page indicating that the site is under maintenance. After finishing the update, you must manually switch off maintenance mode (that is, unlock the system) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_10|Apply Updates] form.[anchor|#_ce6784b0-0b9e-4436-a91a-0040120189b9]((({S:Hint}When the lockout is in effect the following happens in the system:[anchor|#_1dbf9723-6023-4020-bbda-584d5c627b61]
*Only users that have the ''Administrator'' role can sign in to the system
*The system stops all processes that were run by schedule

))){br}

In this topic, you will find an upgrade policy, a description of the update process when you use the web interface and recommended update preferences.
==Upgrade Policy==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_10|Apply Updates] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203510|SM203510]) form, only minor updates for your current version of Acumatica ERP are available. You should upgrade your Acumatica ERP from previous versions of the system to Version 2020 R1 manually on the server (upgrade by using the web interface is not supported due to significant changes in customizations). For details, see [HelpRoot_Install\Upgrading_Locally|Updating Acumatica ERP by Using the Configuration Wizard].[anchor|#_421af2c8-18ad-435a-9624-e52a010a297f]
==Before You Proceed==
We strongly recommend that before you update Acumatica ERP to a newer product version, you do the following:[anchor|#_0e190ad6-3984-41e6-afce-ecaa5fa70e76]
*Back up all configuration files and databases used by the application instances.
*If you have created any custom views with the {{SCHEMABINDING}} clause in the Acumatica ERP database, remove them. (You can create these views anew after update.)
*If you have been replicating the Acumatica ERP database, turn off the replication. (Otherwise, the system cannot be updated.)
*If you developed a client application by using the screen-based SOAP API, follow the procedure described in [HelpRoot_Install\Updating__how_Update_API_Using_Wrapper|To Update a Client Application that Uses Screen-Based Web Services] to prevent a failure of your application that can happen because of the UI changes in the system.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_30|Automation Schedule Statuses] ([~/?ScreenId=SM205030|SM205030]) form, make sure that no processes are scheduled for the update time. If you find any scheduled processes reschedule them so that they start after the update.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_20|Tenants] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203520|SM203520]) form, click '''Optimize Database''' to check your Acumatica ERP database for orphaned snapshots and delete them if the system finds any orphaned snapshots.

==Overview of the Update Process==
When you update Acumatica ERP by using the web interface, both the site and the database of the application are updated at the same time. To update Acumatica ERP by using the web interface, you will perform the following steps:[anchor|#_61e8a749-cd59-4206-8fe1-1503196541ea]
#If necessary, notify users about the upcoming update and automatically lock out the system at the time of update, as described in [HelpRoot_Install\Updating__how_Enable_Lockout|To Schedule the System Lockout].

)))
In this topic, you can find a brief description of the update process on a local server and on Microsoft Azure.[anchor|#_5ccd8eef-2a95-4a85-a94c-2bfc28633462]
==Before You Proceed==
We strongly recommend that before you update Acumatica ERP to a newer product version, you do the following:[anchor|#_3604ca70-96d7-455a-90ce-462f1d90914e]
*Back up all configuration files and databases used by the application instances.
*If you have created any custom views with the {{SCHEMABINDING}} clause in the Acumatica ERP database, remove them. (You can create these views anew after update.)
*If you have been replicating the Acumatica ERP database, turn off the replication. (Otherwise, the system cannot be updated.)
*If you developed a client application by using the screen-based SOAP API, follow the procedure described in [HelpRoot_Install\Updating__how_Update_API_Using_Wrapper|To Update a Client Application that Uses Screen-Based Web Services] to prevent a failure of your application that can happen because of the UI changes in the system.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_30|Automation Schedule Statuses] ([~/?ScreenId=SM205030|SM205030]) form, make sure that no processes are scheduled for the update time. If you find any scheduled processes reschedule them so that they start after the update.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_20|Tenants] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203520|SM203520]) form, click '''Optimize Database''' to check your Acumatica ERP database for orphaned snapshots and delete them if the system finds any orphaned snapshots.

==Overview of the Update Process on a Local Server==
To update Acumatica ERP locally, perform the following steps:[anchor|#ol_rwb_fps_tl]
#If necessary, notify users about the upcoming update, and automatically lock out the system for the time of update, as described in [HelpRoot_Install\Updating__how_Enable_Lockout|To Schedule the System Lockout].
#Use the installation package file available on your computer to update the Acumatica ERP Tools. For details, see [HelpRoot_Install\Upgrading_Configuration_Wizard|To Update the Acumatica ERP Tools].
#Start updating the database and the site of your application instance. The system will automatically perform the following actions:
##For instances that contain published customization projects, validate the compatibility of the currently published customization code with the code of the new product version.
##Update the database of the instance.
##Update the site of the instance.
#:For details, see [HelpRoot_Install\Upgrading_Both_Database_and_Site|To Update the Database and Site of an Acumatica ERP Instance].
#:If you need to update the database without updating the site or to update the site without updating the database, see [[#_7f50d93f-2196-4526-8742-e5a2a57aada5|Divided Update of the Database and the Site].
#:((({S:Warn}We strongly recommend that you use the common procedure described in this step for a usual update of your Acumatica ERP instance.
)))
#If you are upgrading your system from a version that did not include the search indexes, build the search indexes. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Search_indexes_update|To Build Search Indexes] in the Acumatica ERP System Administration Guide.
#If you locked out the system, unlock the system, as described in [HelpRoot_Install\Updating__how_Disable_Lockout|To Unlock an Acumatica ERP Instance].
[anchor|#_7f50d93f-2196-4526-8742-e5a2a57aada5]
==Divided Update of the Database and the Site==
If (for strong reasons) you need to update the Acumatica ERP database without updating the site, to update the site without updating the database, or to consequently update the database and the site, you can use the '''Update only Website''' and '''Update only Database''' commands, which you can find in the drop-down list to the right of the '''Upgrade''' button in the Application Maintenance page of the Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard. For details, see [HelpRoot_Install\Upgrading_Database|To Update the Database of an Acumatica ERP Instance] and [HelpRoot_Install\Upgrading_Instance|To Update the Site of an Acumatica ERP Instance].((({S:Hint}When you update your Acumatica ERP instance by using the '''Update only Website''' or '''Update only Database''' commands, the system does not validate the customization compatibility. If you have published customization in your Acumatica ERP instance, the instance may stop working after update due to incompatible customization code.
