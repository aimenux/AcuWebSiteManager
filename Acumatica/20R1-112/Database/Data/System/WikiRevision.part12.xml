 Acumatica ERP provides multiple mechanisms of maintaining sales prices. You can define a base price list, price lists applicable to a specific customer or a group of customers, lists of promotional prices or prices that depend on the quantity of the product being sold. You can also define a default price for each individual item to fall back on if no other price is defined for it in the system.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
You will learn how sales prices of various types are defined in the system.
==Applicable Scenarios==
In Acumatica ERP, you can maintain sales prices for both non-stock items and stock items. Configuring sales prices for stock items is possible if the ''Inventory'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
==Sales Price Types==
You define sales prices by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form or the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_10|Sales Price Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202010|AR202010]) form. When you create a sales price record for an item, you specify the item, the date when the price becomes effective, and assign the price a specific sales price type and code, which help you define what the price is applicable to. You select one of the following price types:[anchor|#_84f3b670-2eb8-4838-a9e1-58a7cf02fdf8]
*''Base'': You use this price type for prices that you want to include in a base price list. Base prices are used if there are no more specific prices defined (for example, promotional or specific to individual customers). This price type does not have any price codes.
*''Customer Price Class'': You use this price type for prices aimed at customers of a particular customer price class. This price type also requires a price code to be specified. The price codes are identifiers of customer price classes defined in the system.
*:((({S:Warn}You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_80_00|Customer Price Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR208000|AR208000]) form to define a customer price class—a group of customers that may be offered special prices because of their buying habits. For instance, you could define as a class those customers that buy the largest quantities and are offered the most competitive prices. By default, all customers of the same customer price class are charged the same price for the same item.
)))
*''Customer'': You use this price type for prices aimed at a particular customer. This price type also requires a price code to be specified. The price codes are identifiers of customer accounts defined in the system. This price type might be needed if you have customers that have unique buying habits even among customers of the same price class, or customers who buy especially large volumes of products.

Optionally, prices of the listed types can also be configured as promotional, applicable to sales from specific warehouses, to items sold in specific units of measure, or to products sold in specific quantities.[anchor|#_38d49cef-8605-4008-80ea-3b1a4584ad62]
*Promotional: Prices aimed to draw customers&rsquo; attention. Promotional prices are effective for a specific period of time.
*Volume-dependent: Prices that depend on the volume of products being sold. You can define these prices if the ''Volume Pricing'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
*Specific to a warehouse: Prices aimed to a particular warehouse. You can define these prices if the ''Multiple Warehouses'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form.
*Specific to a unit of measure in which an item is sold.
((({S:Warn}A price can be of multiple types simultaneously—for example, a customer-specific price can be set as promotional and be volume-dependent at the same time.
)))
==Default Prices==
''Default prices'' are the sales prices of stock and non-stock items that can be maintained optionally—for instance, for the items whose prices do not vary depending on the quantity purchased, the season, special promotional periods, and other factors. {br}

You maintain the default price of a particular non-stock item in the '''Default Price''' box on the '''Price/Cost Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. If the ''Inventory'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, which means that stock items-related functionality is available in the system, you can enter default prices for stock items as well. To enter the default price for a stock item, you use the '''Default Price''' box on the '''Price/Cost Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. The default prices for stock items and non-stock items are specified in the base currency and for the base units.
You can update the default prices for stock and non-stock items as often as you need to. When updating price lists by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_10|Sales Price Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202010|AR202010]) form, you can specify the method of calculating the updated prices (based on such factors as the item markup percent or the percent of increase), and the new prices will be calculated automatically. However, when you update the default prices, you cannot directly specify how to calculate the new values—you can calculate these prices externally by using any method you consider appropriate; then you enter the resulting prices manually on a per-item basis or import all of them from a file by using an import scenario.
Default prices have the following limitations:[anchor|#ul_wlq_1ms_1q]
*The system does not keep the history of default prices. A default price has no start date and no expiration date; once specified, the default price is used for the item until a new default price is entered.
*You cannot define default prices as promotional prices that are in effect for a particular date range or as tiered prices.

In this activity, you will learn how to view sales prices configured in the system.
==Story==
Suppose that the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company has sales prices that were last updated in 2019. You want to review what prices exist in the system for the ''ONLCOURSE'' online training course for a particular customer, for a customer price class, and as the base price of this item.{br}

Also, you are interested in whether any promotional prices exist in the system for another training course, ''OFLCOURSE''.
Because SweetLife is going to start installing juicers for customers in  2020, you want to make sure that the default price of the installation service, ''INSTALL'', has been specified in the system.
==Process Overview==
For a particular item, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form, you can view the prices specified for a customer and for a customer price class; you can also view base prices and promotional prices for the item. You view the default price of a particular non-stock item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form.{br}

You do not need to save and release the invoices you create in this lesson; they are for training purposes only.
==System Preparation==
To prepare the system, do the following:[anchor|#_b6c443f8-e3c2-4cc7-b1eb-018ba52efb18]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as an accountant by using the ''johnson'' login and the ''123'' password.
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to '' 1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button and select '' 1/30/2020''. For simplicity, in this lesson, you will create and process all documents in the system on this business date.
#On the Company and Branch Selection menu, also on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center'' branch is selected. If it is not selected, click the selection menu to view the list of branches that you have access to, and then click ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center''.

==Step 1: View Sales Prices for a Particular Customer==
To view sales prices defined for a particular customer, ''COFFEESHOP'', do the following:[anchor|#_316fc480-85a2-42b6-b0de-c47820bebe11]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form.
#In the '''Price Type''' box of the Selection area, select ''Customer''.
#In the form table, review the price of your company&rsquo;s online training course (''ONLCOURSE'') for the ''COFFEESHOP'' customer ($13).

==Step 2: View Sales Prices for a Customer Price Class==
To view sales prices defined for local customers, do the following:[anchor|#_c735bb84-af53-45fb-a281-6bbd2b1dd9e8]
#While you are still on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form, in the '''Price Type''' box of the Selection area, select ''Customer Price Class''.
#In the '''Price Code''' box, select ''LOCAL''.
#In the table, review the price of your company&rsquo;s online course (''ONLCOURSE'') for local customers ($14.5).

==Step 3: View an Item&rsquo;s Base Price==
To view the base price of a particular item, ''ONLCOURSE'', do the following:[anchor|#_e2917ed0-2020-4a3d-8cb5-37867164b121]
#While you are still on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form, in the '''Price Type''' box of the Selection area, select ''Base''.
#In the '''Inventory ID''' box, select ''ONLCOURSE''.
#In the table, review the base price of the ''ONLCOURSE'' non-stock item in the system ($15).

==Step 4: View Promotional Prices==

Story Suppose that the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company has sales prices that were last updated     in     20 19 .     You want to review what prices exist in the system for the  ONLCOURSE  online training     course for a particular customer, for a customer price class, and as the base price of this     item. Also, you are interested in whether any promotional prices exist in the system for another     training course,  OFLCOURSE . Because SweetLife is going to start installing juicers for customers in        2020, you want to make sure that the default price of the installation service,       INSTALL , has been specified in the system. Process Overview For a particular item, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) Sales Prices (AR202000) form,     you can view the prices specified for a customer and for a customer price class; you can also     view base prices and promotional prices for the item. You view the default price of a particular     non-stock item on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form. You do not need to save and release the invoices you create in this lesson; they are for     training purposes only. System Preparation To prepare the system, do the following: Launch the  Acumatica ERP      website, and sign in as an accountant by using the  johnson  login and the  123       password. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP      screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to          1/30/2020. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu      button and select          1/30/2020. For simplicity, in this lesson, you will create and process all      documents in the system on this business date. On the       C ompany      and       B ranch       S election      menu, also on the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP      screen, make sure that the  SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center  branch is      selected. If it is not selected, click the selection menu to view the list of branches that you      have access to, and then click  SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center . Step 1: View Sales Prices for a Particular Customer To view sales prices defined for a particular customer,  COFFEESHOP , do the     following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) Sales Prices (AR202000) form. In the  Price Type  box of the Selection area, select       Customer . In the form table, review the price of your company's online training course       ( ONLCOURSE ) for the  COFFEESHOP       customer       ($13) . Step 2: View Sales Prices for a Customer Price Class To view sales prices defined for local customers, do the following: While you are still on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) Sales Prices (AR202000) form, in      the  Price Type  box of the Selection area, select  Customer Price       Class . In the  Price Code  box, select  LOCAL . In the table, review the      price  of      your company's online course ( ONLCOURSE ) for local      customers       ($14.5) . Step 3: View an Item's Base Price To view the base price of a particular item,  ONLCOURSE , do the following: While you are still on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) Sales Prices (AR202000) form, in      the  Price Type  box of the Selection area, select  Base . In the  Inventory ID  box, select  ONLCOURSE . In the table, review the base price of the  ONLCOURSE  non-stock item in the      system       ($15) . Step 4: View Promotional Prices To view the promotional prices existing in the system as of      1/1/  2020, do the following: While you are still on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) Sales Prices (AR202000) form,      clear the  Inventory ID  box of the Selection area. In the  Price Type  box of the Selection area, select  All      Prices . In the  Effective As Of  box, select         1/1/  2020. In the table, click the  Promotion  column and, in the dialog box that      opens, select       True       and click  OK . In the table, review the promotional price for the  OFLCOURSE  item       ($40)       and notice its effective      dates  (12/17/2019      - 1/17/ 2020) . Step 5: View the Default Price for a Particular Non-Stock Item To view the price set up as the default price of a non-stock item, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form. In the  Inventory ID  box, select  INSTALL . On the  Price/Cost Information  tab, in the  Default       Price  box, review the default price of the installation      services       ($100) . ]]></column>

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[[anchor|#Price_Record_Validity]
A price is effective during some period of time. In each price record, you define this period with the effective date and the expiration date; both dates are included in the effective period. The period can be open (no effective date or expiration date is specified) or closed (both dates are specified).{br}

In this topic, you will read about how the system validates a price record (regular and promotional)—both when you add it manually and when you add it by using the worksheet functionality.{br}{TOC}
==Price Record Validation When You Add the Record Manually==
When you add a new price record for an inventory item by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form, the system checks whether the record overlaps in time with existing records that have the same price type, code (if applicable), and currency. If the new record duplicates an existing one, the system flags the record with an error when you attempt to save your changes, until you adjust the date range either of the new record or of an existing one. {br}

Consider the following example: In one record, you define a base price in dollars for an inventory item that is effective on 8/4/2014, with no expiration date specified (see the green-framed record in the following screenshot). Suppose that you add for the same inventory item a record with a new base price in dollars that will be effective on 8/6/2014 (see the red-framed record in the following screenshot). The system warns you (see the X in the red circle) that the new record duplicates the existing one and cannot be saved.{br}

[anchor|#image_v1l_3kw_z4][image:UserGuide/Images/AR_CON_SalesPrices_Example2.png|popup|Duplicate price record|450px]{br}

The effective periods of both prices from the example are presented on the following diagram.[anchor|#image_pwv_xvc_1p][image:UserGuide/Images/Price_Record_Validity_Duplicate.png|popup|Overlap in effective periods|450px]{br}

 To successfully save your changes, you need to close the open period of the existing price record—that is, specify an expiration date that is before the effective period of the new record. In this example, an expiration date of 8/5/2014 is used to fix the overlap (see the green-framed record in the following screenshot). Then you can save the new record (see the red-framed record in the following screenshot).{br}

[anchor|#image_dw4_zxc_1p][image:UserGuide/Images/AR_CON_SalesPrices_Example2_2.png|popup|Correction of the overlap of periods|450px]{br}

The effective periods of both prices from the example are presented on the following diagram.[anchor|#image_ccw_gyc_1p][image:UserGuide/Images/Price_Record_Validity_Fixed.png|popup|Appropriate effective periods|450px]
==Price Record Validation When You Add the Record by Worksheet==
By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_10|Sales Price Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202010|AR202010]) form, you can add records in bulk or mass-update records by recalculating prices. When you release a worksheet for which you have added new records or updated existing ones, the system checks whether each record overlaps in time with existing records that have the same price type, code (if applicable), and currency, but the check is done within the records of the selected worksheet. The system does not warn you that price records in the worksheet overlap in time with the sales price records; it solves any overlapping automatically.{br}

The way the system automatically fixes overlap depends on whether the '''Overwrite Overlapping Prices''' check box is selected:[anchor|#ul_a42_2nq_cp]
*If it is cleared, the system automatically closes the open period of the price record with which a new record overlaps. (That is the same operation that you have to perform manually when you add the price record by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] form.)
*If it is selected, the system removes the price records with which a new record overlaps completely and adjusts the periods of the records with which a new record overlaps partially. For details, see the example that follows.

Consider the following example: Two customer-specific prices are defined for an inventory item. The first ($20000) price is effective from 8/17/2014 through 8/25/2014 (see the green-framed record in the following screenshot). The second ($22000) price is effective starting on 8/26/2014 (see the blue-framed record in the following screenshot). [anchor|#image_vs3_hqq_cp][image:UserGuide/Images/Price_Validation_EX2.png|popup|Viewing the initial sales price records|450px]{br}

Suppose that you want to update prices for this inventory item by adding a new price, $23000, which is effective starting on 8/20/2014. The new price record overlaps partially (from 8/20/2014 through 8/25/2014) with the first one shown above and completely (from 8/26/2014 indefinitely into the future) with the second one.{br}

Suppose that you create a worksheet with the new price record and select the '''Overwrite Overlapping Prices''' check box. When you release the worksheet, the system adjusts the effective period of the first record (see the green-framed record on the following screenshot) and overwrites the second one with the new record (see the yellow-framed record on the following screenshot).{br}

[anchor|#image_u4k_zsq_cp][image:UserGuide/Images/Price_Validation_Ex1.png|popup|Updating the sales price records|450px]
==Validation of Promotional Price Records==
Promotional price records may overlap in time with non-promotional price records. When you add records manually by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] form, the system validates promotional price records in the same way as it validates regular prices.{br}

When you update promotional prices by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_10|Sales Price Worksheets] form, the '''Overwrite Overlapping Prices''' check box is selected by default and cannot be cleared. That is, the system always removes price records with which a new record overlaps completely and adjusts the periods of the records with which a new record overlaps partially. ]]></column>

Your company may need to maintain prices that include a tax. Such prices are typical in countries where value-added taxes are enforced. Among your company&rsquo;s customers may be end customers that must pay a VAT and retail customers that are exempt from paying the VAT. {br}

To maintain price lists with taxes included and to prevent charging VAT-exempt customers, take the following steps: [anchor|#ul_cff_x5p_cp]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form, create a price list with the VAT amount added to prices.
*Specify the tax included in the prices in the '''Tax''' column of the same form.
*Assign customers exempt from the tax to a tax zone that doesn&rsquo;t include this tax, and customers that pay this tax to a zone that includes it.

When you save a sales order created for a customer, the system creates the list of applicable taxes by using the tax category of each item and the tax zone of the customer. For each item on the order, the system performs checks and handles prices accordingly: [anchor|#ul_dff_x5p_cp]
*If the tax included in the price applies to the line item, the price is used as-is and the tax is processed as inclusive.
*If the tax included in the price does not apply to the line item, the tax amount is excluded from the price.

By using the described price types and codes, you can create different price lists on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form or the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_10|Sales Price Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202010|AR202010]) form. You can sort price records by their type and code, and the resulting selection is a price list that applicable to a group of customers or to a particular customer.

If your company has many items in a price list and each item can be sold in different units of measure, you may want to keep and update sales prices for only one unit of measure, and configure the system to update the prices for other units of measure automatically based on this price.{br}

For example, suppose that you sell some stock item for which the ''EA'' base unit and the ''BOX'' non-base unit are configured so that 1 ''BOX'' = 10 ''EA'' (here, ''10'' is the conversion factor). After you specify the base price of $5 per the ''EA'' unit, the system will automatically calculate and suggest the $50 price for each ''BOX'' if you select the ''BOX'' unit of measure in the document line. {br}

Now suppose that you want to sell 1 ''BOX'' for $45 instead of $50. You cannot adjust the conversion factor, because it affects the quantity of items to be sold. You could create a separate price record that would define the sales price for the ''BOX'', but if you did so, you would later need to update two prices instead of one when there was a price change. Instead of creating these separate UOM-specific price records, you can specify the adjustment multiplier, which will define the ratio between the price for the base unit of measure and the price for the non-base unit of measure for the particular stock or non-stock item.{br}

To make it possible to adjust the calculation of sales prices, you need to select the '''Use a Price Adjustment Multiplier''' check box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form. After you do this, you can specify the adjustment multiplier in the '''Price Adjustment Multiplier''' column on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form for a stock item or the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form for a non-stock item. {br}

If this functionality has been turned on, the system will calculate the sales prices as follows.{br}

{{{{Base UOM Price = Sales UOM Price / (or *) Conversion Factor / Price Adjustment Multiplier
}}}}{br}

{{{{Non-Base UOM Price = Base UOM Price * (or /) Conversion Factor * Price Adjustment Multiplier
}}}}{br}

In these calculations, the operator of the first action in both expressions is defined by the '''Multiply/Divide''' column on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form or the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form.{br}

Thus, in the example presented earlier in this section, you need to specify an adjustment multiplier of 0.9, so that the price for 1 ''BOX'' will be calculated as $5 (the base price for each ''EA'') &#42; 10 (the conversion factor) &#42; 0.9 (the adjustment multiplier) = $45 for each ''BOX''. If you later set a new sales price for ''EA'', such as $6, the price for the ''BOX'' will be calculated as $6 &#42; 10 &#42; 0.9 = $54.{br}

For example, suppose that you sell some stock item for which the  EA  base unit and         the  BOX  non-base unit are configured so that 1  BOX  = 10  EA  (here,            10  is the conversion factor). After you specify the base price of $5 per the            EA  unit, the system will automatically calculate and suggest the $50 price for each            BOX  if you select the  BOX  unit of measure in the document line.  Now suppose that you want to sell 1  BOX  for $45 instead of $50. You cannot adjust         the conversion factor, because it affects the quantity of items to be sold. You could create         a separate price record that would define the sales price for the  BOX , but if you did         so, you would later need to update two prices instead of one when there was a price change.         Instead of creating these separate UOM-specific price records, you can specify the         adjustment multiplier, which will define the ratio between the price for the base unit of         measure and the price for the non-base unit of measure for the particular stock or non-stock         item. To make it possible to adjust the calculation of sales prices, you need to select the            Use a Price Adjustment Multiplier  check box on the            General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences         (SO101000) form. After you do this, you can specify the adjustment multiplier in the            Price Adjustment Multiplier  column on the  General           Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form for a         stock item or the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form for a non-stock item.  If this functionality has been turned on, the system will calculate the sales prices as         follows. Base UOM Price = Sales UOM Price / (or *) Conversion Factor / Price Adjustment Multiplier Non-Base UOM Price = Base UOM Price * (or /) Conversion Factor * Price Adjustment Multiplier In these calculations, the operator of the first action in both expressions is defined by         the  Multiply/Divide  column on the  General           Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form or the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items form. Thus, in the example presented earlier in this section, you need to specify an adjustment         multiplier of 0.9, so that the price for 1  BOX  will be calculated as $5 (the base         price for each  EA ) * 10 (the conversion factor) * 0.9 (the adjustment multiplier) =         $45 for each  BOX . If you later set a new sales price for  EA , such as $6, the         price for the  BOX  will be calculated as $6 * 10 * 0.9 = $54. If you clear the  Use a Price Adjustment Multiplier  check box on the             ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences form, the system will ignore any specified price         adjustment multipliers when calculating sales prices. ]]></column>

In Acumatica ERP, the system automatically suggests a price in a sales order or an AR invoice from the sales prices existing in the system.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
You will learn how the system selects a price to suggest in a sales order or AR invoice based on the price priority.
==Applicable Scenarios==
In Acumatica ERP, you can maintain sales prices for both non-stock items and stock items. Configuring sales prices for stock items is possible if the ''Inventory'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
==Price Selection Rules==
You can define multiple prices, each with a different goal, for an item. When a user selects an item in a document line (or modifies the item&rsquo;s quantity), the system searches for an applicable price that is effective on the date of the document. The system bases this search on the price search priority (highest to lowest) and stops when it finds an applicable price for the item. The search proceeds as follows:[anchor|#_0c7aeef2-2868-4204-8cab-78c6e2567eea]
#The system searches for a customer price for the item by using the following rules:
##A promotional price for the item has a higher priority than a regular price of the same type for the item.
##A price specified for the item with the unit of measure selected in the document line has a higher priority than a price specified for the item with the base unit of measure.
##If multiple warehouses are defined in the system, an item price specific to the warehouse selected in the document has a higher priority than a price of the same type that is not specific to a warehouse.
##:((({S:Warn}The system does not use any of the warehouse-specific prices in accounts receivable documents, because these documents do not have information about warehouses.
)))
#The system searches for an item price defined for the customer price class by using the following rules:
##A promotional price for the item has a higher priority than a regular price of the same type for the item.
##A price specified for the item with the unit of measure selected in the document line has a higher priority than a price specified for the item with the base unit of measure.
##If multiple warehouses are defined in the system, an item price specific to the warehouse selected in the document has a higher priority than a price of the same type that is not specific to a warehouse.
#The system searches for the base price of the item by using the following rules:
##A promotional price for the item has a higher priority than a regular price of the same type for the item.
##A price specified for the item with the unit of measure selected in the document line has a higher priority than a price specified for the item with the base unit of measure.
##If multiple warehouses are defined in the system, an item price specific to the warehouse selected in the document has a higher priority than a price of the same type that is not specific to a warehouse.
#The system searches for the default price specified for the item.
#The system searches for a price calculated for the item with the sales unit of measure in the following order:
##Customer price class: A promotional price has a higher priority than a regular price of the same type.
##Customer price: A promotional price has a higher priority than a regular price of the same type.
##Base price: A promotional price has a higher priority than a regular price of the same type.
((({S:Warn}If price tiers are defined in the applicable price list, the system applies the price from the tier that applies to the item quantity.
)))
Once the system finds an applicable price, it stops the search and inserts this price into the document, but you can override this price. The price search priority is illustrated in the diagram below.[anchor|#_84eecede-8a71-447d-abb9-e82ce35558bc][anchor|#_85e3a00a-3a20-4140-96bc-795744ab197b][image:UserGuide/Images/PricesAndDiscounts_PricePriorities_General.png|popup|Search priority for sales prices|450px]]]></column>

In this activity, you will create several invoices to see how the system suggests a price in each particular case depending on which prices exist in the system and which of them has the highest priority.
==Story==
In January 2020, three customers purchased online courses from SweetLife. Acting as SweetLife&rsquo;s accountant, you need to process an invoice for each of these customers for these purchases.
==Process Overview==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form, you start the creation of AR invoices for each of the customers that purchased the online course and review the price that the system suggests in each invoice. You do not have to complete the processing of the invoices.
==System Preparation==
To prepare the system, do the following:[anchor|#_b6c443f8-e3c2-4cc7-b1eb-018ba52efb18]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as an accountant by using the ''johnson'' login and the ''123'' password.
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to '' 1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button and select '' 1/30/2020''. For simplicity, in this lesson, you will create and process all documents in the system on this business date.
#On the Company and Branch Selection menu, also on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center'' branch is selected. If it is not selected, click the selection menu to view the list of branches that you have access to, and then click ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center''.

==Step 1: Create an AR Invoice for the COFFEESHOP customer==
To create an AR invoice for the ''COFFEESHOP'' customer and analyze which sales price the system inserts in it, do the following:[anchor|#_7fcf7589-e6e2-4109-b71a-1707c0f6b5d3]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record''', and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Type''': ''Invoice''
#* '''Customer''': ''COFFEESHOP''
#* '''Date''': '' 1/30/2020''
#* '''Post Period''': ''01- 2020''
#* '''Description''': <tt>One-day online course</tt>
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the added row:
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''ONLCOURSE''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>1</tt>
#*'''UOM''': ''DAY''
#Notice that in the '''Unit Price''' column, the system has inserted the sales price configured for this customer ($13).

==Step 2: Create an AR Invoice for the GOODFOOD customer==
To create an AR invoice for the ''GOODFOOD'' customer and analyze which sales price the system inserts in it, do the following:[anchor|#_217d299a-5f6b-43e8-99ed-7b26f825b4f3]
#While you are still on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form, click '''Add New Record''' on the form toolbar and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Type''': ''Invoice''
#* '''Customer''': ''GOODFOOD''
#* '''Date''': '' 1/30/2020''
#* '''Post Period''': ''01- 2020''
#* '''Description''': <tt>One-day online course</tt>
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, click '''Add Row''', and specify the following settings in the added row:
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''ONLCOURSE''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>1</tt>
#*'''UOM''': ''DAY''
#Notice that in the '''Unit Price''' column, the system has inserted the sales price configured for the ''LOCAL'' customer price class ($14.50), because the ''GOODFOOD'' customer belongs to this price class and no customer-specific price has been specified for the ''ONLCOURSE'' item for this customer.

==Step 3: Create an AR Invoice for the LAKECAFE Customer==
To create an AR invoice for the ''LAKECAFE'' customer and analyze which sales price the system inserts, do the following:[anchor|#_b80aa7b6-efed-4e68-a7b8-f4e8100cddbf]
#While you are still on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form, click '''Add New Record''' on the form toolbar and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Customer''': ''LAKECAFE''
#* '''Date''': '' 1/30/2020''
#* '''Post Period''': ''01- 2020''
#* '''Description''': <tt>One-day online course</tt>
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the added row:
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''ONLCOURSE''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>1</tt>
#*'''UOM''': ''DAY''
#Notice that in the '''Unit Price''' column, the system has inserted the base sales price defined in the system for this non-stock item ($15), because the ''LAKECAFE'' customer belongs to the ''INTERN''customer price class, and no price for this item is configured for this customer or for this price class.

==Step 4: Create an AR Invoice with a Promotional Price==
To create an AR invoice with the ''OFLCOURSE'' non-stock item, do the following:[anchor|#_9b0b7f5e-ff11-4908-a492-212ed7e2d53b]
#While you are still on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form, click '''Add New Record''' on the form toolbar, and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Customer''': ''GOODFOOD''
#* '''Date''': ''1/13/ 2020''
#* '''Post Period''': ''01- 2020''
#* '''Description''': <tt>One-day offline course</tt>
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the added row:
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''OFLCOURSE''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>1</tt>
#*'''UOM''': ''DAY''
#Notice that in the '''Unit Price''' column, the system has inserted the promotional price for this non-stock item ($40), because the invoice date (''1/13/ 2020'') is within the range of the effective dates specified for this promotional price.
#In the '''Date''' box of the Summary area, change the date to '' 1/30/2020'' (the current business date).
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Recalculate Prices''' and, in the '''Recalculate Prices''' dialog box, which opens, leave the default values, and click '''OK'''.
#:The system has updated the price in the '''Unit Price''' column, because now the invoice date (''1/30/2020'') is outside of the range of the effective dates specified for the promotional price, and the system has copied the default price of the item, because there are no other prices effective on this date and applicable to the ''GOODFOOD'' customer.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
In this activity, you will learn how to configure sales prices for different units of measure (UOMs) for a particular item and how to update prices in an existing sales order. You will also review how the system suggests a price when prices in multiple UOMs exist in the system.
==Story==
Suppose that, as the accountant of the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company, you have to record the sale of two boxes of 32-ounce jars of apple jam.{br}

The system contains the sales price of 1 jar of apple jam ($16.60), and one box of has been configured to be equal to six 32-ounce jars. After you have created the sales order, you will configure a sales price of one box of apple jam ($96) and update the price in this sales order.
==Process Overview==
To configure a sales price for a unit of measure that is not defined for a particular stock item, in order to include the item with the new UOM in a sales order, you will review the existing sales price for the stock item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form.{br}

You will then create a sales order for the sale of a particular stock item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. After that, you will configure a sales price for a particular UOM of a stock item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] form. {br}

Finally, you will update the price in the sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form.
==System Preparation==
To prepare the system, do the following:[anchor|#_9518e56e-9894-425b-87ca-0971f8e35a4c]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as an accountant by using the ''johnson'' login and the ''123'' password.
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to '' 1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button and select '' 1/30/2020''. For simplicity, in this lesson, you will create and process all documents in the system on this business date.
#On the company and branch selection menu, also on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center'' branch is selected. If it is not selected, click the selection menu to view the list of branches that you have access to, and then click ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center''.

==Step 1: View Existing Prices for a Particular Item==
To view the existing sales price for the ''APJAM32'' stock item, do the following:[anchor|#_a4594ebf-f5d2-4b6c-9528-054b310f6b21]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form.
#In the '''Inventory ID''' box of the Summary area, select ''APJAM32''.
#In the table, review the price of this stock item valid on the current business date ($16.60) and the UOM (''PIECE'', which is a jar in this case).

==Step 2: Create a Sales Order==
To create a sales order for apple jam, do the following:[anchor|#_c61a58b8-70f5-46ba-a271-4c3b7667ae0a]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form.
#In the '''Inventory ID''' box, select ''APJAM32''.
#On the '''General Settings''' tab, in the '''Unit of Measure''' section, notice that the sales unit for this item is ''BOX''. In the conversion table, review how this unit of measure is converted for this item (according to the settings, one box contains 6 pieces).
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record''', and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Order Type''': ''SO''
#* '''Customer''': ''COFFEESHOP''
#* '''Date''': '' 1/30/2020''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Apple jam 2 boxes</tt>
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the added row:
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''APJAM32''
#* '''Warehouse''': ''WHOLESALE''
#* '''UOM''': ''BOX''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>2</tt>
#Notice the value in the '''Unit Price''' column ($99.60). Because the system contains the price of 1 piece of this item ($16.60), it has calculated the unit price of 1 box (6 pieces) as $16.60 x 6 ($99.60).
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

==Step 3: Configure a Sales Price for a Particular UOM==
To configure a sales price for a box of apple jam, do the following:[anchor|#_6d276634-e9aa-4793-bb5c-f6629956388c]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form.
#In the table toolbar, click '''Add Row''', and specify the following settings in the added row:
#*'''Price Type''': ''Base''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''APJAM32''
#* '''UOM''': ''BOX''
#* '''Price''': ''96''
#* '''Effective Date''': '' 1/30/2020''
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

==Step 4: Update the Prices in the Sales Order==
To update the prices in the sales order, do the following:[anchor|#_659b504e-fecc-4b41-8a4c-e3f01078b369]
#Open the ''Sales Orders'' (SO3010PL) form.
#Find the sales order you created in Step 2, and open it.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Recalculate Prices'''.
#In the '''Recalculate Prices''' dialog box, which opens, leave the default values, and click '''OK'''.
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, review the price in the '''Unit Price''' column of the table. Because a sales price ($96) has been now defined in the system for this unit of measure (''BOX'') of this particular stock item (''APJAM32''), the system has updated the previous price from $99.60 to $96.

In this activity, you will learn how to configure sales prices for a particular warehouse.
==Story==
Suppose that the Sales Manager of the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company decided that on January 30,  2020 the company will start selling one of its products (a 96-ounce jar of lemon jam, defined in the system as ''LEMJAM96'') from the wholesale warehouse at special prices. {br}

Acting as the SweetLife accountant, you need to configure the sales price of the ''LEMJAM96'' stock item for this particular warehouse effective on the specified date. You also need to record the sale of 10 jars of lemon jam, 5 of which are sold from the wholesale warehouse.
==Process Overview==
You view sales prices configured for a particular warehouse on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form. By using the same form, you can configure a sales price of a particular item from a particular warehouse (that is, a warehouse-specific sales price). To test this configuration, you can create a sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, add lines to it (at least one for the item being sold from the particular warehouse for which you have added the sales price, and at least one for the item at another warehouse), and review the sales prices the system uses for these lines.
==System Preparation==
To prepare the system, do the following:[anchor|#_9518e56e-9894-425b-87ca-0971f8e35a4c]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as an accountant by using the ''johnson'' login and the ''123'' password.
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to '' 1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button and select '' 1/30/2020''. For simplicity, in this lesson, you will create and process all documents in the system on this business date.
#On the company and branch selection menu, also on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center'' branch is selected. If it is not selected, click the selection menu to view the list of branches that you have access to, and then click ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center''.
#

==Step 1: View Sales Prices for a Particular Warehouse==
To view the sales prices configured for the ''WHOLESALE'' warehouse, do the following:[anchor|#_8d9dc88c-2529-44eb-a61a-6b0b2bac05b6]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form.
#In the '''Warehouse''' box of the Summary area, select ''WHOLESALE''.
#:Notice that the table shows no records, because no sales prices that are specific to this warehouse have been configured in the system.

==Step 2: Define the Sales Price of a Particular Item at the Wholesale Warehouse==
To create a sales price for the ''LEMJAM96'' stock item at the ''WHOLESALE'' warehouse, do the following:[anchor|#_f5f0c804-c584-47d9-8db3-c939ac078953]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the added row:
#*'''Price Type''': ''Base''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''LEMJAM96''
#* '''UOM''': ''PIECE'' (selected by default)
#*'''Warehouse''': ''WHOLESALE''
#* '''Price''': <tt>43</tt>
#*'''Effective Date''': '' 1/30/2020''
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.
#In the Summary area, select ''LEMJAM96'' in the '''Inventory ID''' box, clear the value in the '''Warehouse''' box, and review the prices that are defined in the system for the ''LEMJAM96'' item.

==Step 3: Create a Sales Order==
To make sure the system is inserting a different price for the item when it is sold from the ''WHOLESALE'' warehouse than when it is sold from another warehouse, you will create a sales order with two lines from different warehouses. Do the following:[anchor|#_202a418e-b2f4-40d2-a3b9-2cd0e7470ce6]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record''', and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Order Type''': ''SO''
#* '''Customer''': ''GOODFOOD''
#* '''Date''': '' 1/30/2020''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Lemon jam 96 oz.</tt>
#On the table toolbar, click '''Add Row''', and specify the following settings for the first order line:
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''LEMJAM96''
#* '''Warehouse''': ''WHOLESALE''
#* '''UOM''': ''PIECE''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>5</tt>
#Notice the value in the '''Unit Price''' column. Because you specified the warehouse, the system has inserted the unit price ($43) that you have specified for this warehouse in Step 2.
#On the table toolbar, click '''Add Row''', and specify the following settings for the second order line:
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''LEMJAM96''
#* '''Warehouse''': ''RETAIL''
#* '''UOM''': ''PIECE''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>5</tt>
#Notice the value in the '''Unit Price''' column. Because no sales price has been specified for this stock item specific to the RETAIL warehouse, the system has used the base price for this stock item ($49.49).
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save''' to save the sales order.

In this activity, you will learn how to configure volume-based sales prices for a particular stock item.
==Story==
Suppose that on December 2, 2019, the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company decided to introduce volume-based prices for 32-ounce jars of orange jam. {br}

Acting as the SweetLife accountant, you need to define the following prices in the system:[anchor|#_b6cb3373-17ac-4a72-9395-df28f1c06e97]
*From 1 to 4 pieces: $13.80
*From 5 to 9 pieces: $12
*More than 9 pieces: $10

==Process Overview==
You view the sales prices configured for a particular stock item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form. Then, on the same form, you enter volume-based prices for this stock item. To test the volume-based prices you have entered, you create a sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, and add lines with different quantities to make sure that the system uses the needed prices for each line.{br}

You do not need to save the sales order you create in this lesson; it is for training purposes only.
==System Preparation==
To prepare the system, do the following:[anchor|#_d69a2cf3-cc5e-4bc0-803c-fbb64b5a0e4a]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as an accountant by using the ''johnson'' login and the ''123'' password.
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''12/2/2019''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button and select ''12/2/2019''. For simplicity, in this lesson, you will create and process all documents in the system on this business date.
#On the company and branch selection menu, also on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center'' branch is selected. If it is not selected, click the selection menu to view the list of branches that you have access to, and then click ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center''.
#Make sure the ''Volume Pricing'' feature is enabled as follows:
##Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form by searching for it or navigating to it.
##Locate the '''Volume Pricing''' check box under the '''Standard Financials''' section to see if it is selected.
##If the check box is cleared, click '''Modify''' on the form toolbar, select the '''Volume Pricing''' check box, and then click '''Enable''' on the form toolbar.

#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form.
#In the '''Inventory ID''' box of the Summary area, select ''ORJAM32''.
#:Notice that the table shows the $13 price, which was effective starting on 3/30/2019.

==Step 2: Specify Volume-Based Prices for a Particular Stock Item==
To specify volume-based prices for the ''ORJAM32'' stock item, do the following.[anchor|#_4c207307-cdac-4aec-940e-21d9739da802]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form.
#In the '''Inventory ID''' box of the Summary area, select ''ORJAM32''. The table displays the base price for this stock item defined in the system.
#:To configure a new price for this stock item, you must first set the expiration date for the current price.
#In the '''Expiration Date''' column for the only row in the table, select ''12/1/2019''. Click '''Save''' on the form toolbar.
#On the table toolbar, click '''Add Row''', and specify the following settings in the row, which apply to fewer than 5 pieces of the stock item:
#*'''Price Type''': ''Base''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''ORJAM32''
#* '''UOM''': ''PIECE''
#* '''Break Qty.''': <tt>0</tt>
#*'''Price''': <tt>13.80</tt>
#*'''Effective Date''': ''12/2/2019'' (selected by default)
#On the table toolbar, click '''Add Row''', and specify the following settings in the row, which apply to 5 to 9 pieces of the stock item:
#*'''Price Type''': ''Base''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''ORJAM32''

#*'''Effective Date''': ''12/2/2019'' (selected by default)
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.
#Review all the prices that now exist in the system for this stock item.
#:The base price for this item, which was effective from 3/30/2019 to 12/1/2019, is $13. Starting on 12/2/2019, volume-based prices ($13.80, $12, and $10) are effective for fewer than 5 pieces, 5 to 9 pieces, and more than 9 pieces, respectively.

==Step 3: Create a Sales Order==
To begin the creation of a sales order in order to test the prices of different quantities of the ''ORJAM32'' stock item, do the following:[anchor|#_caf412fd-d1a4-42e7-96dc-fd16ddfdadcf]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form.

#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''ORJAM32''
#* '''Warehouse''': ''WHOLESALE''
#* '''UOM''': ''PIECE''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>2</tt>
#:The system has inserted the price you specified for the break quantity of <tt>0</tt> in the '''Unit Price''' column, which means that the unit price is $13.80 when the quantity of this stock item in the order line is less than the quantity specified in the second tier.
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the second line:
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''ORJAM32''
#* '''Warehouse''': ''WHOLESALE''
#* '''UOM''': ''PIECE''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>6</tt>
#:Notice that the system has inserted the price you specified for the break quantity of <tt>5</tt> in the '''Unit Price''' column, which means that the unit price is $12 when the quantity of this stock item in the order line is not less that 5, but does not reach the quantity in the third tier (10).
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the third line:
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''ORJAM32''
#* '''Warehouse''': ''WHOLESALE''
#* '''UOM''': ''PIECE''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>15</tt>
#:The system has inserted the price you specified for the break quantity of <tt>10</tt> to the '''Unit Price''' column, which means that the unit price is $10 when the quantity of this stock item in the order line is 10 or more.

==Learning Objectives==
You will learn how to upload a sales price list to Acumatica ERP using a sales price worksheet.
==Applicable Scenarios==
Sales price worksheets in Acumatica ERP are a convenient way of adding new sales prices or updating existing sales price lists in bulk. {br}

By using a sales price worksheet, you can upload from an external source, for example, an Excel file, prices of any types, except for default prices—that is, base prices, prices specific to a customer or customer price class, including sales prices that have been marked as promotional, or that have been defined for a particular unit of measure or a particular warehouse.
==Uploading Sales Price Lists By Using Sales Price Worksheets==
You upload a sales price list prepared in an external Excel file, by performing the following steps. First, you create an empty worksheet on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_10|Sales Price Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202010|AR202010]) form and then add to it the external price list by clicking '''Load Records from File''' and selecting the prepared Excel file with the prices to upload.{br}

Prices defined in a worksheet become effective only after you release the worksheet (on a date specified as the effective date). Before the worksheet is released, you can edit records in it: by making changes manually to individual records or by recalculating price values for all records in the worksheet. For more information about recalculating existing prices, see [HelpRoot_PricesAndDiscounts\PriceDiscount_CalculatingPendingPrices_Process_Activity2|Mass-Update of Sales Prices: Process Activity].
==Sales Price Retention==
When you update sales price records in the system by using sales price worksheets on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_10|Sales Price Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202010|AR202010]) form, it might be useful to keep the history of price changes over time.{br}

In Acumatica ERP, you set up how the system keeps the historical sales priceson the '''Price/Discount Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) form. In the '''Price Retention''' group of settings, you can choose one of the following retention types in the '''Retention Type''' box:[anchor|#_e6179427-50e1-4f44-9167-c59a2445bd26]
*''Last Price'': To keep the last price and the current price for each item.
*''Fixed Number of Months'': To keep the changes of the price records for a specific number of months. If this option is selected, the '''Number of Months''' box becomes available, in which you specify a particular number.
((({S:Warn}By default, '''Retention Type''' is set to ''Fixed Number of Months'' and '''Number of Months''' is set to ''0'', which means that the history of prices will be kept forever.

In this activity, you will learn how to upload sales price lists with regular prices and promotional prices. You will also review how the history of updated prices is kept in the system.
==Story==
Suppose that the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company decided to update the regular sales prices for  2020 and set up promotional prices for some items during the holiday season. Acting as the SweetLife accountant, you need to upload two Excel files with both sales price worksheets and see how the system uses them.{br}

You also want to review how the sales prices are retained in the system.
==Process Overview==
You create sales price worksheets by uploading Excel files on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_10|Sales Price Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202010|AR202010]) form. You then release each sales price worksheet and review the new prices on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form. To analyze how the system selects prices, you create an AR invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form. You do not need to release the invoice you create in this lesson, it is for training purposes only.
==System Preparation==[anchor|#_77b055cf-33d8-475c-9e2f-e84bd525b454]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as an accountant by using the ''johnson'' login and the ''123'' password.
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to '' 1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button and select '' 1/30/2020''. For simplicity, in this lesson, you will create and process all documents in the system on this business date.
#On the Company and Branch Selection menu, also on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center'' branch is selected. If it is not selected, click the selection menu to view the list of branches that you have access to, and then click ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center''.

==Step 1: Import a Sales Price Worksheet with Base Prices==
To import a sales price worksheet with base prices effective from 1/1/ 2020, do the following:[anchor|#_bc293c5c-76cd-4947-b40f-d6814f52f5f0]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_10|Sales Price Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202010|AR202010]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record'''.
#In the '''Effective Date''' box, select ''1/1/ 2020''.
#In the '''Description''' box, enter ''Base prices for 2020''.
#On the table toolbar, click '''Load Records from File'''.
#In the window that opens, find the <tt>PricesAndDiscounts&#95;SalesPrices&#95;Base&#95;2020&#95;01&#95;01.xlsx</tt> file and select it for upload. While you are uploading the worksheet, in the '''Columns''' dialog box, for the '''Price''' column name, specify the '''Pending Price''' property name and leave the other default settings and column mapping.
#Save the worksheet.
#Clear the '''Hold''' check box and, on the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the worksheet.

==Step 2: Import a Sales Price Worksheet with Promotional Prices==

#While you are still on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_10|Sales Price Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202010|AR202010]) form, on the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record'''.
#In the '''Effective Date''' box, select ''12/1/2019''.
#Select the '''Promotional''' check box.
#In the '''Expiration Date''' box, select ''1/15/ 2020''.
#In the '''Description''' box, enter ''Promotional prices 12/1/2019 - 1/15/2020''.
#On the table toolbar, click '''Load Records from File'''.
#In the window that opens, find the <tt>PricesAndDiscounts&#95;SalesPrices&#95;Promotion&#95;2019&#95;12&#95;01.xlsx</tt> file and select it for upload. While you are uploading the worksheet, in the '''Columns''' dialog box, for the '''Price''' column name, specify the '''Pending Price''' property name and leave the other default settings and column mapping.
#Save the worksheet.
#In the Summary area of the form, clear the '''Hold''' check box and, on the form toolbar, click '''Release'''.

==Step 3: Review How the System Retains the Sales Prices==
To review the sales prices for the ''ONLCOURSE'' non-stock item, do the following:[anchor|#_873c0d95-bf9e-4fdc-821c-ccfc6c2167b4]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form.
#In the '''Price Type''' box of the Summary area, make sure that ''All Prices'' is selected.
#In the '''Inventory ID''' box, select ''ONLCOURSE''.
#In the table, review the prices that exist for the ''ONLCOURSE'' non-stock item.
#:The base price of $15 is effective from 1/1/2019 to 12/31/2019. For the period from 12/1/2019 to 1/15/ 2020, the promotional price of $12, which you uploaded in this step, is effective. Also, starting from 1/1/ 2020, a new base price of $17, which you uploaded in Step 1, is effective.
#:Besides, the customer-specific price configured for ''COFFEESHOP'' ($13) and the price for the ''LOCAL'' customer price class ($14.50) are also effective in the system starting from 1/1/2019.

==Step 4: Create an Invoice with the New Price==
To create an AR invoice with a new sales price, do the following:[anchor|#_2bdede16-5cef-4a8a-9f1b-4c64a5438fd9]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record''' and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Type''': ''Invoice''
#* '''Customer''': ''LAKECAFE''
#* '''Date''': '' 1/30/2020''
#* '''Post Period''': ''01- 2020''
#* '''Description''': <tt>One-day online course</tt>
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the added row:
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''ONLCOURSE''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>1</tt>
#Review the price in the '''Unit Price''' column. It shows the new base price ($17) effective from 1/1/2020, which you uploaded in Step 1.
#In the '''Date''' box of the Summary area, change the date to ''1/3/ 2020''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Recalculate Prices'''.
#In the '''Recalculate Prices''' dialog box, which opens, leave the default values and click '''OK'''.
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, review the price in the '''Unit Price''' column. It now shows the new promotional price ($12) effective from 12/1/2019 to 1/15/2020, because the invoice date is within this date range, and promotional prices have a priority over base prices.

It is not necessary to release this AR invoice; you have created it only to see how the price is suggested.]]></column>
			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Uploading Sales Price Lists: Activity In this activity, you will learn how to upload sales price lists with regular prices                 and promotional prices. You will also review how the history of updated prices is                 kept in the system. Story Suppose that the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company decided to update the regular                 sales prices for                       2020 and set up promotional prices for some items during the holiday                 season. Acting as the SweetLife accountant, you need to upload two Excel files with                 both sales price worksheets and see how the system uses them. You also want to review how the sales prices are retained in the system. Process Overview You create sales price worksheets by uploading Excel files on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR202010|AR202010]) Sales Price Worksheets (AR202010) form. You then release each sales price                 worksheet and review the new prices on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) Sales Prices                 (AR202000) form. To analyze how the system selects prices, you create an AR invoice                 on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form. You do not need to release                 the invoice you create in this lesson, it is for training purposes only. System Preparation Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as an accountant by using the  johnson  login and                     the  123  password.

If a different date is displayed, click the                     Business Date menu button and select                               1/30/2020. For simplicity, in this lesson, you will create                     and process all documents in the system on this business date. On the                      C ompany                     and                      B ranch                      S election                     menu, also on the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the  SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center                      branch is selected.

Every once in a while, you might need to update sales prices of your stock and non-stock items. Acumatica ERP provides you with the ability to recalculate the existing sales prices in bulk by using specific criteria.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
You will learn how to recalculate existing sales prices based on the manufacturer&rsquo;s suggested retail price (MSRP).
==Applicable Scenarios==
By using sales price worksheets, you can bulk-calculate prices of any types, except for default prices—that is, base prices, prices specific to a customer or customer price class, including sales prices that have been marked as promotional, or that have been defined for a particular unit of measure or a particular warehouse.
==Price Basis==
Your company may use a cost-plus approach, or set prices to achieve specific profit targets. In Acumatica ERP, you can calculate pending sales prices for both non-stock items and stock items by using the approach—that is, by choosing the price basis—that makes the most sense at a particular time.{br}

In Acumatica ERP, the options for the price basis can be divided into the following groups:[anchor|#ul_orr_gxp_cp]
*Inventory-related: A cost-plus basis (the ''Last Cost + Markup %''option or ''Avg./Std. Cost + Markup %'' option) or the manufacturer&rsquo;s suggested retail price (the ''MSRP'' option). You specify values for these options by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form for stock items. Also, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form, you can define the markup percentage and MSRP specific to a particular warehouse. For non-stock items, only the ''Avg./Std. Cost + Markup %'' option is applicable, and the system uses (instead of the average or standard cost) the current cost of a non-stock item, which is specified in the '''Current Cost''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form.
*Price record-related: The item&rsquo;s current price (''Source Price'') or pending price (''Pending Price''). You specify values for these options by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_10|Sales Price Worksheets] form.

==Calculation of Pending Prices Based on MSRP==
An item&rsquo;s MSRP—that is, the manufacturer&rsquo;s suggested retail price—is specified on the '''Price/Cost Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. A similar box is available on the '''Price/Cost Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form for non-stock items.{br}

You perform mass-calculation of pending prices based on the items&rsquo; MSRP by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_10|Sales Price Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202010|AR202010]) form. On this form, you add to the sales price worksheet the price records for the items for which you want to recalculate prices. Then, you click '''Calculate Pending Prices''' on the table toolbar to invoke the '''Calculate Pending Prices''' dialog box. In this dialog box, you select ''MSRP'' as the price basis and click '''Update''' to add to the worksheet the pending prices recalculated based on MSRP. The recalculated pending prices become effective after you release the worksheet (on a date specified as the effective date).]]></column>

Applicable Scenarios By using sales price worksheets, you can bulk-calculate prices of any types, except for         default prices—that is, base prices, prices specific to a customer or customer price class,         including sales prices that have been marked as promotional, or that have been defined for a         particular unit of measure or a particular warehouse. Price Basis Your company may use a cost-plus approach, or set prices to achieve specific profit         targets. In  Acumatica ERP, you can calculate pending sales prices for both non-stock items and stock items by using         the approach—that is, by choosing the price basis—that makes the most sense at a particular         time. In  Acumatica ERP, the options for the price basis can be divided into the following groups: Inventory-related: A cost-plus basis (the  Last Cost + Markup % option            or  Avg./Std. Cost + Markup %  option) or the manufacturer's           suggested retail price (the  MSRP  option). You specify values for these options by           using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form for stock items.           Also, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details (IN204500) form, you can define the markup           percentage and MSRP specific to a particular warehouse. For non-stock items, only the              Avg./Std. Cost + Markup %  option is applicable, and the system uses (instead of           the average or standard cost) the current cost of a non-stock item, which is specified in           the  Current Cost  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form. Price record-related: The item's current price ( Source Price ) or pending price             ( Pending Price ). You specify values for these options by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR202010|AR202010]) Sales Price Worksheets form. Calculation of Pending Prices Based on MSRP An item's MSRP—that is, the manufacturer's suggested retail price—is specified on the            Price/Cost Info  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form. A similar box is available on the  Price/Cost           Info  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form for non-stock         items. You perform mass-calculation of pending prices based on the items' MSRP by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR202010|AR202010]) Sales Price Worksheets (AR202010) form. On this form, you add to the sales price         worksheet the price records for the items for which you want to recalculate prices. Then,         you click  Calculate Pending Prices  on the table toolbar to invoke the            Calculate Pending Prices  dialog box. In this dialog box, you select            MSRP  as the price basis and click  Update  to add to the         worksheet the pending prices recalculated based on MSRP. The recalculated pending prices         become effective after you release the worksheet (on a date specified as the effective         date). ]]></column>

In this activity, you will calculate new sales prices based on the manufacturer&rsquo;s suggested retail price (MSRP).
==Story==
Suppose that on January 30, 2020 you, as the SweetLife accountant, need to update the price of one of the juicers that the Equipment Sale Center of SweetLife sells to customers. The company wants to sell this commercial juicer (''JUICER20C'') at 110% of the MSRP price set by the original manufacturer.
==Process Overview==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_10|Sales Price Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202010|AR202010]) form, you create a sales price worksheet and fill it with the price records that you want to recalculate. Then you calculate sales prices based on the MSRP of the items and create a sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form.
==System Preparation==[anchor|#_77b055cf-33d8-475c-9e2f-e84bd525b454]

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[ Acumatica ERP provides you with the ability to configure customer discounts to meet the needs of your organization.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
You will learn how to configure customer discounts of different types in Acumatica ERP and how the system applies the discounts in AR invoices and sales orders.
==Applicable Scenarios==
Customer discounts can be used as an effective tool of your organization’s overall marketing strategy—for example, to stimulate sales of new products, promote new branches of the organization, and accelerate sales of items that are becoming obsolete. In Acumatica ERP, your company can configure various types of customer discounts: unconditional or condition-based, simple or tiered, and automatically or manually applied (including rebates and coupons).
==Discount Configuration==
In Acumatica ERP, any customer discount is defined by a combination of parameters specified for a discount code on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_90_00|Discount Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209000|AR209000]) form and for a discount sequence specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_95_00|Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209500|AR209500]) form.[anchor|#_af728c50-0c41-41f5-8a51-205715adc581]
*You design ''discount codes'' by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_90_00|Discount Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209000|AR209000]) form, where for each discount code, you specify the type of the discount (automatic or manual), the level on which the discount is applied (a particular line, group of lines, or the entire document), and the type of conditions under which the discounts of the discount code are applied. For more information about discount codes, see [HelpRoot_PricesAndDiscounts\AR__con_Customer_Discounts_Codes|Customer Discounts: Discount Codes].
*You create ''discount sequences'' for each discount code by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_95_00|Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209500|AR209500]) form. A discount sequence defines a particular discount percent, fixed amount, or quantity of a free item; the sequence also defines the particular conditions of discount application. For more information about discount sequences, see [HelpRoot_PricesAndDiscounts\AR__con_Customer_Discount_Sequences|Customer Discounts: Discount Sequences].

==GL Accounts for Customer Discounts==
''Line-level discounts''. Line discounts are not accounted for in a separate GL account. The discount amount is simply deducted from the amount to be paid by the customer and the reduced amount is debited to an accounts receivable account specified in the '''AR Account''' box on the '''GL Accounts''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form.{br}

''Group and document-level discounts''. Unlike line discounts, discounts applied to a group of lines or a document as a whole are debited to a separate expense account specified for the customer in the '''Discount Account''' box on the '''GL Accounts''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form.]]></column>

Discount Configuration In  Acumatica ERP, any customer discount is defined by a combination of parameters specified for a discount         code on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR209000|AR209000]) Discount Codes (AR209000) form and for a discount sequence         specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR209500|AR209500]) Discounts (AR209500) form. You design  discount codes  by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR209000|AR209000]) Discount Codes (AR209000)           form, where for each discount code, you specify the type of the discount (automatic or           manual), the level on which the discount is applied (a particular line, group of lines, or           the entire document), and the type of conditions under which the discounts of the discount           code are applied. For more information about discount codes, see  Customer Discounts: Discount Codes. You create  discount sequences  for each discount code by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR209500|AR209500]) Discounts (AR209500) form. A discount sequence defines a particular           discount percent, fixed amount, or quantity of a free item; the sequence also defines the           particular conditions of discount application. For more information about discount           sequences, see  Customer Discounts: Discount Sequences. GL Accounts for Customer Discounts Line-level discounts . Line discounts are not accounted for in a separate GL account.         The          discount  amount is simply deducted from the amount to be paid by the         customer and the reduced amount is debited to an accounts receivable account specified in         the  AR Account  box on the  GL Accounts  tab of         the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000) form. Group and document-level discounts . Unlike line discounts, discounts applied to a         group of lines or a document as a whole are debited to a separate expense account specified         for the customer in the  Discount Account  box on the  GL           Accounts  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers form. ]]></column>

In Acumatica ERP, any customer discount is defined by a combination of parameters specified for a discount code on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_90_00|Discount Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209000|AR209000]) form and for a discount sequence specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_95_00|Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209500|AR209500]) form. {br}

When you create a discount code on the ''Discount Codes'' form, you specify the following:[anchor|#_53717b2d-4d7f-41c5-ae5c-b5d8f1b489ee]
*The level on which the discounts of this document type are applied: a specific line, group of lines or the entire document
*Whether the discounts are applied automatically or manually
*Whether the discounts are applied unconditionally or based on a set of conditions
{br}{TOC}
==Line, Group, and Document Discounts==
For a discount code that you create on the ''Discount Codes'' form, you select one of the following levels at which this discount is applied:[anchor|#_f16d899b-79c4-4251-a683-cd514f0bece3]
*''Line'': These discounts apply to a document line. Line-level discounts may be based on the line amount or quantity of the line, and they can be expressed as percentages or fixed amounts. Line-level discounts can be applied to the unit price of an item or the extended price of the item (line amount), depending on the '''Line Discount Basis''' box value selected on the '''Price/Discount Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) form.
*''Group'': These discounts apply to multiple lines of the same document. Group-level discounts may be based on the amount or quantity that is in the sum of multiple lines, and the discounts can be expressed as percentages, fixed amounts, or specific quantities of free items. Because some of the discounts can be free items, the system cannot determine which of the group discounts is the best, so it applies all group discounts that are applicable based on the discount conditions.
*''Document'': These discounts apply to the document total. Document-level discounts are based on the document total, and they can be expressed as percentages or as fixed amounts.

Once you have configured a discount code for your customer discount, you proceed to setting up specific discount sequences for this code on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_95_00|Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209500|AR209500]) form, that is, to specifying particular values for entities and items to which the discounts will be applied. For each discount code, multiple sequences can be configured. {br}

In Acumatica ERP, the settings you can specify for discount sequences include the discount percent, the discount amount, and the list of entity values to which the discount is applied. Discount sequences can define simple discounts (which are applicable to any amount or quantity) or tiered discounts (for which you can specify different percents or fixed amounts based on the quantities of items or on the amounts).{br}

In this section, you will find information about discount sequences for customer discounts in Acumatica ERP.{br}{TOC}
==Discount Sequence Settings==
Discount sequences are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_95_00|Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209500|AR209500]) form. Each discount sequence is related to a discount code and inherits its settings. Each discount code can have multiple sequences, therefore each sequence related to the same discount code must have a unique identifier. If auto-numbering is configured for the discount code, when you create a new sequence for this discount code, the system assigns its sequence ID automatically. By default, the discount code is used as a prefix for generating sequence IDs. If auto-numbering is not configured for the discount code, you must enter an identifier for each sequence manually.{br}

For each discount sequence, you specify the following:[anchor|#ul_tqy_dcb_vm]
*Whether the discount is regular or promotional. If the discount is promotional, it is only effective during the date range that you specify. When you mark a discount as promotional, you must specify the start and end dates of the period during which it is effective. Regular discounts—that is, all other discounts that are not marked as promotional—have the start date but do not have an expiration date.
*How the discount is expressed: as a percentage, as an amount, or as a specific quantity of a free item.
*What are the particular entities (such as items, customers, or warehouses) to which the discount can be applied. The applicable entity type or combination of entity types is defined by the discount code, and tabs that apply to the entity type or types specified for the discount code appear on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_95_00|Discounts] form. For instance, if the discount code was defined for discounts to be applied to items, this form will have the '''Items''' tab, which you can use to list the particular items to which the sequence is applicable.
*How the discount is tiered (if applicable): by amount (for discount codes of all types) or by quantity (for only discount codes of the ''Line'' and ''Group'' types).

==Updating Discount Sequences==
A discount sequence can define a ''regular (updatable)'' discount or a ''promotional'' discount.{br}

A promotional discount sequence is effective over a limited time, so this sequence should have an effective (start) date and an expiration date. After the expiration date, the promotional discount is not applicable. To mark a discount sequence as a promotional discount, you select the '''Promotional''' check box in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_95_00|Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209500|AR209500]) form.{br}

A regular sequence—that is, a sequence for which the '''Promotional''' check box is cleared—has only a start date and does not have an expiration date. You can have the following versions of a regular sequence:[anchor|#ul_uds_ms3_vm]
*The current (active) version, which defines the discount currently in effect
*The future (pending) version, which defines the discount to be in effect on a particular date in the future
*The previous (last) version, which defines the discount that was in effect before the current discount

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_95_00|Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209500|AR209500]) form, you can update break amounts or quantities for each sequence by entering new values in the '''Pending Break Amount''' and in either '''Pending Discount Percent''' or '''Pending Discount Amount''' columns; you also enter the new effective date in the '''Pending Date''' column. When the effective date comes, you update the discount sequence by using the '''Update Discounts''' button. After the update, the current sequence version becomes the previous version, and the future version becomes the current one.{br}

If you change properties of multiple discount sequences, you can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_50_25_00|Update Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AR502500|AR502500]) form to update these sequences at once.
==Updating Discounts Applied to Documents==
For documents with the ''On Hold'' status, you can update discounts to include any new discounts or updates to existing ones. To update the discounts, you use the '''Recalculate Prices''' dialog box, which opens when you select '''Actions''' > '''Recalculate Prices''' on the form toolbar of the respective data entry form, such as [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]). In this dialog box, you can select the types of discounts the system will update as follows:[anchor|#ul_mfm_vyf_xdb]
*If you want the system to recalculate discounts in the document, you select the '''Recalculate Discounts''' check box.
*If you want the system to replace manual line-level discounts with the applicable automatic discounts in the document, you select the '''Override Manual Line Discounts''' check box.
*If you want the system to replace manual group-level and document-level discounts with the applicable automatic discounts in the document, you select the '''Override Manual Group and Document Discounts''' check box.

For instance, if the discount      code was defined for discounts to be applied to items, this form will have the        Items  tab, which you can use to list the particular items to which the      sequence is applicable. How the discount is tiered (if applicable): by amount (for discount codes of all types) or      by quantity (for only discount codes of the  Line  and  Group  types). Updating Discount Sequences A discount sequence can define a  regular (updatable)  discount or a  promotional      discount. A promotional discount sequence is effective over a limited time, so this sequence should have     an effective (start) date and an expiration date. After the expiration date, the promotional     discount is not applicable. To mark a discount sequence as a promotional discount, you select     the  Promotional  check box in the Summary area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR209500|AR209500]) Discounts (AR209500) form. A regular sequence—that is, a sequence for which the  Promotional      check box is cleared—has only a start date and does not have an expiration date. You can     have the following versions of a regular sequence: The current (active) version, which defines the discount currently in effect The future (pending) version, which defines the discount to be in effect on a particular      date in the future The previous (last) version, which defines the discount that was in effect before the      current discount On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR209500|AR209500]) Discounts (AR209500) form, you can update break amounts or     quantities for each sequence by entering new values in the  Pending Break      Amount  and in either  Pending Discount Percent  or       Pending Discount Amount  columns; you also enter the new effective date     in the  Pending Date  column. When the effective date comes, you update the     discount sequence by using the  Update Discounts  button. After the update,     the current sequence version becomes the previous version, and the future version becomes the     current one. If you change properties of multiple discount sequences, you can use the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR502500|AR502500]) Update Discounts (AR502500) form to update these sequences at once. Updating Discounts Applied to Documents For documents with the  On Hold  status, you can update discounts to include any new     discounts or updates to existing ones. To update the discounts, you use the       Recalculate Prices  dialog box, which opens when you select  Actions Recalculate Prices  on the form toolbar of the respective data entry form, such as   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000). In this dialog box, you can select the types of discounts     the system will update as follows: If you want the system to recalculate discounts in the document, you select the        Recalculate Discounts  check box. If you want the system to replace manual line-level discounts with the applicable automatic      discounts in the document, you select the  Override Manual Line Discounts       check box. If you want the system to replace manual group-level and document-level discounts with the      applicable automatic discounts in the document, you select the  Override Manual Group       and Document Discounts  check box. ]]></column>

*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_40_00|Cash Sales] ([~/?ScreenId=AR304000|AR304000])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000])

You can enter manual discounts either by selecting an existing discount code with the '''Manual''' check box selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_90_00|Discount Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209000|AR209000]) form (in this case, the system applies the discounts that correspond to this code) or by entering a discount percent or discount amount manually.
==Application of Line-Level Manual Discounts==
You can apply manual line-level discounts to a document on the '''Document Details''' tab of the appropriate form as follows:[anchor|#_5a9b8b24-ef63-49aa-9b14-dcc05bc4614d]
*If you want to use an existing discount code, in the '''Discount Code''' column, you select this code.
*If you want to enter a discount manually, in the '''Discount Percent''' or '''Discount Amount''' column, you type the appropriate percent or amount and select the '''Manual Discount''' check box.

==Application of Group-Level and Document-Level Manual Discounts==
You can apply manual group-level or document-level discounts on the '''Discount Details''' tab of the appropriate form as follows:[anchor|#_a3b77ba5-1de4-45b5-9521-22f5eae5d52f]
*If you want to use an existing discount code, in the '''Discount Code''' column, you select this code, and in the '''Sequence ID''' column, you select the appropriate discount sequence for this code.
*If you want to enter a document discount manually, in the '''Discount Percent''' or '''Discount Amt.''' column, you type the appropriate percent or amount and select the '''Manual Discount''' check box.

If the ''Customer Discounts'' feature is disabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can enter a manual document-level discount in the '''Discount Total''' box in the Summary area of an appropriate form.
==Recalculation of Discounts after Updating Item Quantities==
If you change the line quantities after adding manual discounts, manual discounts will be recalculated. They will not, however, be replaced by automatic discounts, even if the automatic discounts would result in a greater discount amount. Recalculation rules apply as follows:[anchor|#_3a628923-3751-48ca-b5c7-2545b4ed6556]
*''Line-level discounts.'' Once you have applied a line-level discount to a line, its percentage value becomes fixed. If you update the quantity of the line item or its discountable amount, the discount amount will be recalculated automatically even if you initially specified the discount as a specific amount.
*''Document-level discounts.'' When you save the document to which you have applied a document-level discount, its amount value becomes fixed. If anything changes in the document lines, the discount amount will remain the same unless you manually change its value.

In this activity, you will create and release two invoices: one with a manual line discount, and the other with a manual document discount.
==Story==
Suppose that the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company has offered five days of the offline training course at a 15% discount to one of its customers, Thai Food Restaurant (''TOMYUM''), which wants to purchase both the online training course and the offline training course. Another customer, GoodFood One Restaurant (''GOODFOOD''), also wants to purchase three days of the online training course, and the SweetLife sales personnel agreed to give the customer a $10 discount.{br}

Acting as the SweetLife accountant, you need to enter invoices for these customers and manually enter these discounts.
==Process Overview==
You specify a manual line discount or a manual document discount on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form. To specify a manual line discount, on the '''Document Details''' tab, you enter either a '''Discount Amount''' or a '''Discount Percent''' for the line. To specify a manual document discount, you enter the amount in the '''Discount Total''' box in the Summary area.
==System Preparation==
To prepare the system, do the following:[anchor|#_9518e56e-9894-425b-87ca-0971f8e35a4c]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as an accountant by using the ''johnson'' login and the ''123'' password.
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to '' 1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button and select '' 1/30/2020''. For simplicity, in this lesson, you will create and process all documents in the system on this business date.
#On the company and branch selection menu, which is also on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center'' branch is selected. If it is not selected, click the selection menu to view the list of branches that you have access to, and then click ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center''.

==Step 1: Create the AR Invoice with a Manual Line Discount==
To create the AR invoice for Thai Food Restaurant and apply a manual line discount in it, do the following:[anchor|#_b69edb6d-0302-42bf-a312-33957533d094]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record''', and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Type''': ''Invoice''
#* '''Customer''': ''TOMYUM''
#* '''Date''': '' 1/30/2020'' (inserted by default)
#*'''Post Period''': ''01- 2020''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Offline training</tt>
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the new invoice line:
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''OFLCOURSE''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>5</tt>
#*'''UOM''': ''DAY''
#* '''Unit Price''': <tt>45</tt>
#*'''Discount Percent''': <tt>15</tt>
#Save the invoice.
#:The system has calculated the 15% manual discount and applied it to the invoice line. For a manual line discount, you can specify either a discount percent or a discount amount. (Just as in this example, the system calculated the discount amount based on the discount percent you entered for the line, if you enter a discount amount, the system automatically calculates the corresponding discount percent.)
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and on the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the invoice.
#On the '''Financial Details''' tab, click the link in the '''Batch Nbr.''' box to review the generated GL batch, which the system opens in a pop-up window on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_30_10_00|Journal Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=GL301000|GL301000]) form.
#:The ''11000 - Accounts Receivable'' account has been debited with the amount of $191.25, which is the invoice amount less the manual line discount you applied to the invoice.

==Step 2: Create the AR Invoice with a Manual Document Discount==
To create the AR invoice for GoodFood One Restaurant with a manual document discount, do the following:[anchor|#_11be60a7-5953-4339-ab52-de9c52679191]
#While you are still on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form, click '''Add New Record''' on the form toolbar, and specify the following settings in the Summary area: 
#*'''Type''': ''Invoice''
#* '''Customer''': ''GOODFOOD''
#* '''Date''': '' 1/30/2020'' (selected by default)
#*'''Post Period''': ''01- 2020''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Online course 3 days</tt>
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the new invoice line:
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''ONLCOURSE''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>3</tt>
#*'''UOM''': ''DAY''
#* '''Unit Price''': <tt>14.5</tt>
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save''' to save the invoice.
#In the '''Discount Total''' box in the Summary area, enter <tt>10</tt>.
#:This is the $10 manual discount you have agreed to give your customer. The total amount of the invoice before the discount is displayed in the '''Detail Total''' box ($43.50), and the amount due (with the manual document discount applied) is displayed in the '''Balance''' box ($33.50).
#On the form toolbar, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and on the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the invoice.
#On the '''Financial Details''' tab, click the link in the '''Batch Nbr.''' box to review the generated GL batch, which the system opens in a pop-up window on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_30_10_00|Journal Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=GL301000|GL301000]) form. 
#:The ''53000 - Discount Given'' account has been debited in the amount of the document discount you specified for this invoice ($10).

In this activity, you will learn how to configure and apply a manual promotional discount. These discounts may be useful, for example, if you want to provide customer discounts based on promotional coupons.
==Story==
Suppose that SweetLife Fruits & Jams company has decided to sell online training courses at a 20% discount, for which it has distributed promotional coupons. This discount is applicable from December 15, 2019 to January 10, 2020 for all customers. {br}

Acting as the SweetLife accountant, you will configure the discount code and discount in the system. You also need to enter an AR invoice for five days of the online home canning course for Lake Cafe on December 20, 2019.
==Process Overview==
You create a discount code on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_90_00|Discount Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209000|AR209000]) form, and then configure a manual promotional discount on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_95_00|Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209500|AR209500]) form.{br}

To test how the configured manual promotional discount is applied, on the Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form, you create an AR invoice and apply the manual discount you configured.
==System Preparation==
Before you start the activity, do the following:[anchor|#_9518e56e-9894-425b-87ca-0971f8e35a4c]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as an accountant by using the ''johnson'' login and the ''123'' password.
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''12/20/2019''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button and select ''12/20/2019''. For simplicity, in this lesson, you will create and process all documents in the system on this business date.
#On the company and branch selection menu, also on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center'' branch is selected. If it is not selected, click the selection menu to view the list of branches that you have access to, and then click ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center''.
#Make sure the ''Customer Discounts'' feature is enabled as follows:
##Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
##Locate the '''Customer Discounts''' check box under the '''Advanced Financials''' section.
##If the check box is cleared, click '''Modify''' on the form toolbar, select the check box, and then click '''Enable''' on the form toolbar.

==Step 1: Configure the Manual Promotional Discount==
To configure the 20% manual promotional discount, do the following:[anchor|#_cb8e5601-e07c-437d-a99b-c5c833818c23]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_90_00|Discount Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209000|AR209000]) form.

The system always applies automatic discounts in the following order when a user saves a document:[anchor|#ul_ub2_pvd_tm]
#Line-level discounts (which are applied to each line of the document): For each document line, the system checks the applicable line-level discounts and applies the one with the largest discount amount.
#Group-level discounts (which are applied to multiple lines of the document): The system finds the applicable group-level discounts and applies all of them.
#Document-level discounts: The system finds and applies the applicable document-level discount with the largest discount amount for a document. The system can apply only one (the best) document-level discount to the document. 
#:((({S:Warn}You can use group-level discounts as document-level discounts. For example, if you create a group-level discount that is applicable to a specific customer price class, it will work as a document-level discount affecting each line of a document.

The following settings, which are specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_90_00|Discount Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209000|AR209000]) form, affect the order of discount application and the calculation of the discounts:

*'''Exclude from Discountable Amount''': If this check box (which is available only for line-level discounts) is selected, the discountable amount of the line-level discount is excluded from the discountable amount for higher-level (group or document) discounts. For example, suppose that you have a line-level clearance discount of 75% and a document-level discount of 5% for documents with total of more than $2000. You select this check box if you do not want to apply an additional document-level discount of 5% to the already-discounted line amounts.
*'''Skip Document Discount''': If this check box (which is available only for group-level discounts) is selected, the system does not apply document discounts when this group discount is applied to the document. For example, suppose that the following discounts have been defined: a group-level discount that is applicable to multiple lines and significantly reduces the document total, and a document-level discount. You select this check box if you do not want to apply the document-level discount to the documents to which this group-level discount has been applied.

In this activity, you will learn how to configure line-level customer discounts of different types (discount by percent with the break point by amount and discount by amount with the break point by quantity) and explore how these discounts are applied in AR invoices.
==Story==
Suppose that starting in January  2020, the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company is offering the following discounts, which will be applied in AR invoices, for the offline training courses that the company sells to its customers:[anchor|#_a071143c-7cec-4b40-9f2a-31a0e0a952eb]
*An automatic line discount of 5% that will be applied to the GOODFOOD customer when the invoice line amount exceeds $200 (discount by percent with the break point by amount)
*An automatic line discount of $100 that will be applied to local customers who order 10 or more days of offline training (discount by amount with the break point by quantity)

On January 30,  2020, GoodFood One Restaurant purchased 16 days of the home canning course (that is, the offline course).{br}

Acting as the SweetLife accountant, you will configure these discounts and create the invoice for the GoodFood One Restaurant, noting how the discounts are applied.
==Process Overview==
Before you configure and apply an automatic line discount, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you enable the ''Customer Discounts'' feature. You create a discount code on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_90_00|Discount Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209000|AR209000]) form, and then configure a discount on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_95_00|Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209500|AR209500]) form. {br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form, you create an AR invoice with lines to which discounts may be applied. You then review how the discounts you have configured are applied automatically.
==System Preparation==
To prepare the system, do the following:[anchor|#_9518e56e-9894-425b-87ca-0971f8e35a4c]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as an accountant by using the ''johnson'' login and the ''123'' password.
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to '' 1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button and select '' 1/30/2020''. For simplicity, in this lesson, you will create and process all documents in the system on this business date.
#On the Company and Branch Selection menu, also on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center'' branch is selected. If it is not selected, click the selection menu to view the list of branches that you have access to, and then click ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center''.
#Make sure that the ''Customer Discounts'' feature is enabled as follows:
##Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
##On the form toolbar, click '''Modify''' and select the '''Customer Discounts''' check box under the '''Advanced Financials''' section.
##On the form toolbar, click '''Enable'''.

==Step 1: Configure the Discount by Percent for a Particular Customer==
To configure the discount by amount for the ''GOODFOOD'' customer, do the following:[anchor|#_b0f7047d-8ecd-4a05-b2db-259d7ad3f6f6]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_90_00|Discount Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209000|AR209000]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add Row''', and specify the following settings in the added row:
#*'''Discount Code''': <tt>LICUS00000</tt>
#*'''Description''': <tt>Line discount by customer</tt>
#*'''Discount Type''': ''Line''
#* '''Applicable To''': ''Customer''
#* '''Auto-Numbering''': Selected
#*'''Last Number''': <tt>LICUS00000</tt>
#:With these settings, discounts of this discount code are line discounts that are applicable to specific customers; because the '''Manual''' check box is cleared, these line discounts will be applied automatically.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_95_00|Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209500|AR209500]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record''', and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Discount Code''': ''LICUS00000''
#* '''Discount by''': ''Percent''
#* '''Break by''': ''Amount''
#* '''Active''': Selected
#*'''Description''': <tt>Line discount for GOODFOOD</tt>
#:These settings convey that this discount (of the discount code you just defined for line discounts that are applicable to particular customers) is by percent, with break points by line amount.
#On the '''Discount Breakpoints''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the added row:
#*'''Pending Break Amount''': <tt>200</tt>
#*'''Pending Discount Percent''': <tt>5</tt>
#*'''Pending Date''': ''1/1/ 2020''
#:With these settings, the discount of 5% is applicable to a line with an amount greater than or equal to $200.
#On the '''Customers''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and in the '''Customer''' column, select ''GOODFOOD''. Because this is the only row defined on this tab, this discount can be applied to only the ''GOODFOOD'' customer.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Update Discounts'''.
#In the '''Update Discounts''' dialog box, which opens, leave the default value ('' 1/30/2020'') in the '''Filter Date''' box, and click '''OK'''.

==Step 2: Configure the Discount by Amount for a Particular Customer Price Class==
To configure the discount by quantity for the ''LOCAL'' customer price class, do the following:[anchor|#_b249c478-cc41-4f0c-90cf-ef8f81c4cc96]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_90_00|Discount Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209000|AR209000]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add Row''' and specify the following settings:
#*'''Discount Code''': <tt>LIITE00000</tt>
#*'''Description''': <tt>Line discount by item and customer price class</tt>
#*'''Discount Type''': ''Line''
#* '''Applicable To''': ''Customer Price Class and Item''
#* '''Auto-Numbering''': Selected
#*'''Last Number''': <tt>LIITE00000</tt>
#:Discounts of this discount code are automatic line discounts that are applicable if the line refers to a specific item and the document refers to a customer of a specific price class.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_95_00|Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209500|AR209500]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record''', and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Discount Code''': ''LIITE00000''
#* '''Discount by''': ''Amount''
#* '''Break by''': ''Quantity''
#* '''Active''': Selected
#*'''Description''': <tt>Line discount for local customers by item</tt>
#:With these settings, the discount (of the discount code you just defined for line discounts that are applicable to a specific item and a customer of a particular price class) is by amount, with break points by quantity.
#On the '''Discount Breakpoints''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the added row:
#*'''Pending Break Quantity''': <tt>10</tt>
#*'''Pending Discount Amount''': <tt>100</tt>
#*'''Pending Date''': ''1/1/ 2020''
#:The discount of $100 is applicable to a line with a quantity greater than or equal to 10.
#On the '''Items''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and in the '''Inventory ID''' column, select ''OFLCOURSE''. Because this is the only row on the tab, this discount applies to only the ''OFLCOURSE'' item.
#On the '''Customer Price Classes''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar and in the '''Price Class ID''' column, select ''LOCAL''. The discount applies to only customers of the ''LOCAL'' customer price class.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Update Discounts''' to make the discounts you have just added effective.
#In the '''Update Discounts''' dialog box, which opens, leave the default value ('' 1/30/2020'') in the '''Filter Date''' box, and click '''OK'''.

==Step 3: Create the AR Invoice and Explore Discount Application==
To create the AR invoice to GoodFood One Restaurant and explore how the automatic line discounts are applied, do the following:[anchor|#_88067040-d330-4b06-8948-fab9e96d0364]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record''', and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Type''': ''Invoice''
#* '''Customer''': ''GOODFOOD''
#* '''Date''': '' 1/30/2020'' (inserted by default)
#*'''Description''': <tt>Offline training</tt>
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, click '''Add Row''', and specify the following settings in the added row:
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''OFLCOURSE''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>5</tt>
#*'''UOM''': ''DAY''
#* '''Unit Price''': <tt>45</tt>
#:The '''Discount Percent''' column contains the 5% discount that you configured in Step 1. The discount has been applied automatically, because the amount in the '''Ext. Price''' column exceeds the break point of $200.
#On the table toolbar, click '''Add Row''', and specify the following settings in the row:
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''OFLCOURSE''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>12</tt>
#*'''UOM''': ''DAY''
#* '''Unit Price''': <tt>45</tt>
#:The '''Discount Amount''' column contains the $100 discount that you configured in Step 2. The discount has been applied automatically to this line, because the quantity exceeds 10 and the customer belongs to the ''LOCAL'' price class. Since this line meets the criteria for more than one discount, the system has applied the best available discount.
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and on the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the invoice.
#On the '''Financial Details''' tab, click the link in the '''Batch Nbr.''' box to review the GL batch, which the system opens in a pop-up window on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_30_10_00|Journal Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=GL301000|GL301000]) form. 
#:The ''11000 - Accounts Receivable'' account is debited and the ''40000 - Sales Revenue'' account is credited in the amount of the invoice.

==Step 4: Make the Created Discounts Inactive==
To make the discounts you created in this lesson inactive so that they will not affect other documents later, do the following:[anchor|#_4a5ae1cb-d499-4545-b27d-280870e94946]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_95_00|Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209500|AR209500]) form.
#In the '''Discount Code''' box, select ''LICUS00000''.
#In the '''Sequence''' box, select ''LICUS00001''.
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Active''' check box; save the discount.
#Repeat Instructions 2 through 4 for the ''LIITE00000'' discount code.

On the  Discount Breakpoints  tab, click  Add             Row  on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the added             row: Pending Break Quantity :  10 Pending Discount Amount :  100 Pending Date :                    1/1/  2020The discount of $100 is applicable to a line with a quantity greater than or equal             to 10. On the  Items  tab, click  Add Row  on the           table toolbar, and in the  Inventory ID  column, select              OFLCOURSE . Because this is the only row on the tab, this discount applies to only           the  OFLCOURSE  item. On the  Customer Price Classes  tab, click  Add             Row  on the table toolbar and in the  Price Class ID            column, select  LOCAL . The discount applies to only customers of the  LOCAL            customer price class. On the form toolbar, click  Save . On the form toolbar, click              Update             Discounts  to make the discounts you have just added           effective. In the  Update Discounts  dialog box, which opens, leave the           default value               (  1/30/2020) in the  Filter Date  box, and click              OK . Step 3: Create the AR Invoice and Explore Discount Application To create the AR invoice to GoodFood One Restaurant and explore how the automatic line         discounts are applied, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form. On the form toolbar, click  Add New Record , and specify the           following settings in the Summary area: Type :  Invoice Customer :  GOODFOOD Date :                     1/30/2020 (inserted by default) Description :  Offline training On the  Document Details  tab, click  Add           Row , and specify the following settings in the added row: Branch :  HEADOFFICE Inventory ID :  OFLCOURSE Quantity :  5 UOM :  DAY Unit Price :  45 The  Discount Percent  column contains the 5% discount that             you configured in Step 1. The discount has been applied automatically, because the             amount in the  Ext. Price  column exceeds the break point              of              $200. On the table toolbar, click  Add Row , and specify the following           settings in the row: Branch :  HEADOFFICE Inventory ID :  OFLCOURSE Quantity :  12 UOM :  DAY Unit Price :  45 The  Discount Amount  column contains the $100 discount that             you configured in Step 2. The discount has been applied automatically to this line,             because the quantity exceeds 10 and the customer belongs to the  LOCAL  price             class. Since this line meets the criteria for more than one discount, the system has             applied the best available discount. In the Summary area, clear the  Hold  check box, and on the form           toolbar, click  Release  to release the invoice. On the  Financial Details  tab, click the link in the              Batch Nbr.  box to review the GL batch, which the system opens in           a pop-up window on the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL301000|GL301000]) Journal Transactions (GL301000) form.              The  11000 - Accounts Receivable  account is debited and the  40000 - Sales               Revenue  account is credited in the amount of the invoice. Step 4: Make the Created Discounts Inactive To make the discounts you created in this lesson inactive so that they will not affect         other documents later, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR209500|AR209500]) Discounts (AR209500) form. In the  Discount Code  box, select  LICUS00000 . In the  Sequence  box, select  LICUS00001 . In the Summary area, clear the  Active  check box; save the           discount. Repeat Instructions 2 through 4 for the  LIITE00000  discount code. ]]></column>

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
In this activity, you will learn how to configure and apply a promotional discount for particular stock items sold from a specific warehouse and a free item discount, and how the system applies these discounts to a sales order.
==Story==
Suppose that on January 30, 2020, the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company starts selling 32-ounce and 96-ounce jars of apple jam at a 3% discount from the ''WHOLESALE'' warehouse; also, for sales orders with dates from  1/30/2020 to 2/15/2020, the company also wants to add a free jar of 96-ounce of lemon jam for the customers who have bought the apple jam for the amount of $350 and more.{br}

Acting as the accountant, you need to configure an automatic group discount of 3% for the ''APJAM96'' and ''APJAM32'' stock items sold from the ''WHOLESALE'' warehouse, and a free-item promotional group discount for sales orders in which the total amount of the ''APJAM96'' and ''APJAM32'' stock items exceeds $350. You will also create a sales order to see how the discounts are applied (you will not save or process this sales order), and then deactivate the discounts.((({S:Warn}A group discount is based on the amount or quantity that is in one line or the sum of multiple lines. In this case, a group discount is used because the free-item discount is based on the sum of amounts of the 32-ounce jars of apple jam and the 96-ounce jars of apple jam.
)))
==Process Overview==
To set up a promotional free-item discount and a warehouse-specific discount, you configure a discount code on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_90_00|Discount Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209000|AR209000]) form and then configure the needed discount on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_95_00|Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209500|AR209500]) form. {br}

To review how the discounts are applied to the sales order, you then create a sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form and add items to observe the application of discounts.
==System Preparation==
Before you start the lesson, do the following:[anchor|#_9518e56e-9894-425b-87ca-0971f8e35a4c]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as an accountant by using the ''johnson'' login and the ''123'' password.
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to '' 1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button and select '' 1/30/2020''. For simplicity, in this lesson, you will create and process all documents in the system on this business date.
#On the company and branch selection menu, also on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center'' branch is selected. If it is not selected, click the selection menu to view the list of branches that you have access to, and then click ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center''.
#Make sure the ''Customer Discounts'' feature is enabled as follows:
##Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
##Locate the '''Customer Discounts''' check box under the '''Advanced Financials''' section.
##If the check box is cleared, click '''Modify''' on the form toolbar, select the check box, and then click '''Enable''' on the form toolbar.

==Step 1: Configure the Warehouse-Specific Discount for Particular Items==
To configure the warehouse-specific discount for particular stock items (for the ''WHOLESALE'' warehouse and the ''APJAM96'' and ''APJAM32'' items), do the following:[anchor|#_667fb3a8-63b7-4ac6-9fb6-77873263ad68]

#*'''Discount Type''': ''Group''
#* '''Applicable To''': ''Warehouse and Item''
#* '''Auto-Numbering''': Selected
#*'''Last Number''': ''WHSE000000''
#:These settings define discounts of this discount code as automatic group discounts that are applicable to specific items sold in specific warehouses (which will be just one warehouse in this example).
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_95_00|Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209500|AR209500]) form.

#On the '''Items''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and in the '''Inventory ID''' column, select ''APJAM32''.
#Add another row, and in the '''Inventory ID''' column, select ''APJAM96''. The discount applies to the ''APJAM32'' and ''APJAM96'' items.
#On the '''Warehouses''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and in the '''Warehouse''' column, select ''WHOLESALE''. Because this is the only row on the tab, the discount is applicable to only the ''WHOLESALE'' warehouse.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Update Discounts''' to make the discount you have just added effective.
#In the '''Update Discounts''' dialog box, which opens, leave the '' 1/30/2020'' default value, and click '''OK'''.

==Step 2: Configure the Free-Item Promotional Discount==
To configure the free-item promotional group discount in which the ''LEMJAM96'' stock item is the free item, do the following:[anchor|#_173a15d3-bfc7-4fa5-b988-9e3c07969a49]

#:The free-item discount (of the discount code you just defined for group discounts that are applicable to specific items) is a promotional discount, effective for the specified date range, with break points by amount.
#On the '''Discount Breakpoints''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the added row:
#*'''Break Amount''': <tt>350</tt>
#*'''Free Item Quantity''': <tt>1</tt>
#:With these settings, the discount of one free item is applicable to a group with an amount greater than or equal to $350.
#On the '''Items''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and select ''APJAM96'' in the '''Inventory ID''' column.
#Add another row, and select ''APJAM32'' in the '''Inventory ID''' column. This discount is applicable to the ''APJAM32'' and ''APJAM96'' items.
#On the '''Free Items''' tab, in the '''Pending Free Item'''box, select ''LEMJAM96''.
#In the Summary area of the form, select the '''Active''' check box.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

==Step 3: Create a Sales Order and Explore Discount Application==
To create a sales order for testing purposes and explore how the discounts are applied to it, do the following:[anchor|#_d978e342-4b2a-4d76-8e5a-ecc20a33ce5a]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record''', and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Order Type''': ''SO''
#* '''Customer''': ''COFFEESHOP''
#* '''Date''': '' 1/30/2020'' (inserted by default)
#*'''Description''': <tt>Jam</tt>
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the added row:
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''ORJAM32''
#* '''UOM''': ''PIECE''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>5</tt>
#*'''Unit Price''': <tt>13</tt>
#:Notice that the '''Discount Percent''' and '''Discount Amount''' columns are empty, indicating that no discounts have been applied to this stock item, because there are no active discounts in the system for this stock item.
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, click '''Add Row''' and specify the following settings in the table:
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''APJAM96''
#* '''UOM''': ''PIECE''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>5</tt>
#*'''Unit Price''': <tt>45.15</tt>
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the added row:
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''APJAM32''
#* '''UOM''': ''PIECE''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>10</tt>
#*'''Unit Price''': <tt>16.60</tt>
#:Notice that another row, which contains the ''LEMJAM96'' stock item, has been automatically added to the order, and the '''Free Item''' check box has been selected in the row.
#On the '''Discount Details''' tab, review the discounts, which you configured earlier in this lesson and which have been applied to the sales order. 
#:The system does not select the best available group discount; instead, it adds all group discounts that are applicable to sales orders. The warehouse-specific discount (''WHSE000000'') has been applied because the ''APJAM32'' and ''APJAM96'' stock items were sold from the ''WHOLESALE'' warehouse specified in the discount. The free-item discount (''FRITE00000'') has been applied because the order date ( 1/30/2020) is within the range of effective dates of the promotional discount and the total price for ''APJAM32'' and ''APJAM96'' exceeds $350, the break point.
#:You do not need to save or process this sales order; you created it solely to test how the discounts are applied.

==Step 4: Make the Created Discounts Inactive==
To make the discounts you created in this lesson inactive so that they will not affect other documents later, do the following:[anchor|#_4a5ae1cb-d499-4545-b27d-280870e94946]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_95_00|Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209500|AR209500]) form.
#In the '''Discount Code''' box, select ''WHSE000000''.
#In the '''Sequence''' box, select ''WHSE000001''.
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Active''' check box; save the discount.
#Repeat Instructions 2 through 4 for the ''FRITE00000'' discount code.

Step 1: Configure the Warehouse-Specific Discount for Particular Items To configure the warehouse-specific discount for particular stock items (for the       WHOLESALE  warehouse and the  APJAM96  and  APJAM32  items), do the     following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR209000|AR209000]) Discount Codes (AR209000) form. On the form toolbar, click  Add Row , and specify the following      settings in the added row: Discount Code :  WHSE000000 Description :  Warehouse discount by        items Discount Type :  Group Applicable To :  Warehouse and Item Auto-Numbering : Selected Last Number :  WHSE000000 These settings define discounts of this discount code as automatic group discounts that       are applicable to specific items sold in specific warehouses (which will be just one warehouse       in this example). On the form toolbar, click  Save . Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR209500|AR209500]) Discounts (AR209500) form.

On the form toolbar, click  Update Discounts  to make the discount you      have just added effective. In the  Update Discounts  dialog box, which opens, leave the                 1/30/2020 default value, and click  OK . Step 2: Configure the Free-Item Promotional Discount To configure the free-item promotional group discount in which the  LEMJAM96  stock item     is the free item, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR209000|AR209000]) Discount Codes (AR209000) form.

On the form toolbar, click  Add New Record , and specify the following      settings in the Summary area: Discount Code :  FRITE00000 Discount by :  Free Item Break by :  Amount Promotional : Selected Effective Date :                     1/30/2020Expiration Date :                    2/15/  2020Description :  Free-item discount (lemon        jam) The free-item discount (of the discount code you just defined for group discounts that       are applicable to specific items) is a promotional discount, effective for the specified date       range, with break points by amount. On the  Discount Breakpoints  tab, click  Add Row       on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the added row: Break Amount :  350 Free Item Quantity :  1 With these settings, the discount of one free item is applicable to a group with an       amount greater than or equal to $350. On the  Items  tab, click  Add Row  on the table      toolbar, and select  APJAM96  in the  Inventory ID  column. Add another row, and select  APJAM32  in the  Inventory ID       column. This discount is applicable to the  APJAM32  and  APJAM96  items. On the  Free Items  tab,            in           the              Pending              Free Item box ,           select  LEMJAM96 . In the Summary area of the form, select the  Active  check box. On the form toolbar, click  Save . Step          3 :         Create a Sales Order and Explore Discount Application To create a sales order for testing purposes and explore how the discounts are applied to it,     do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form. On the form toolbar, click  Add New Record , and specify the following      settings in the Summary area: Order Type :  SO Customer :  COFFEESHOP Date :                     1/30/2020 (inserted by default) Description :  Jam On the  Document Details  tab, click  Add Row  on           the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the added row: Branch :  HEADOFFICE Inventory ID :  ORJAM32 UOM :  PIECE Quantity :  5 Unit Price :  13 Notice that the  Discount Percent  and  Discount               Amount  columns are empty, indicating that no discounts have been applied             to this stock item, because there are no active discounts in the system for this stock             item. On the  Document Details  tab, click  Add Row  and      specify the following settings in the table: Branch :  HEADOFFICE Inventory ID :  APJAM96 UOM :  PIECE Quantity :  5 Unit Price :  45.15 On the  Document Details  tab, click  Add Row  on           the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the added row: Branch :  HEADOFFICE Inventory ID :  APJAM32 UOM :  PIECE Quantity :                  10 Unit Price :  16.60 Notice that another row, which contains the  LEMJAM96  stock item, has been             automatically added to the order, and the  Free Item  check box has             been selected in the row. On the  Discount Details  tab, review the discounts, which you           configured earlier in this lesson and which have been applied to the sales order.  The             system does not select the best available group discount; instead, it adds all group             discounts that are applicable to sales orders.              T he             warehouse-specific discount ( WHSE000000 ) has been applied because the                APJAM32  and  APJAM96  stock items were sold from the  WHOLESALE              warehouse specified in the discount. The free-item discount ( FRITE00000 ) has been             applied because the order date               (  1/30/2020) is within the range of effective dates of the promotional discount             and the total price for  APJAM32  and  APJAM96  exceeds $350, the break             point. You do not need to save or process this sales order; you created it solely             to test how the discounts are applied. Step          4 :         Make the Created Discounts Inactive To make the discounts you created in this lesson inactive so that they will not affect other     documents later, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR209500|AR209500]) Discounts (AR209500) form. In the  Discount Code  box, select  WHSE000000 . In the  Sequence  box, select  WHSE000001 . In the Summary area, clear the  Active  check box; save the      discount. Repeat Instructions 2 through 4 for the  FRITE00000  discount code. ]]></column>

In this activity, you will learn how to configure automatic document discounts, and you will explore how they are applied to AR invoices.
==Story==
Suppose that the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company has given one of its customers, Thai Food Restaurant (''TOMYUM''), a 7% discount. In addition, SweetLife has offered a 15% discount to all customers who purchase $200 or more in a single order (document).{br}

Acting as SweetLife&rsquo;s accountant, you need to configure a customer-specific document discount of 7% for the ''TOMYUM'' customer and an unconditional document discount of 15% for all customers who buy SweetLife&rsquo;s products for a document amount of $200 or more.{br}

On January 30,  2020 ''TOMYUM'' bought 2 days of the offline training course and 10 days of the online training course. You need to enter an AR invoice, to which the discounts should be applied automatically.
==Process Overview==
You configure discount codes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_90_00|Discount Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209000|AR209000]) form, and then configure document discounts on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_95_00|Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209500|AR209500]) form. After that you create an AR invoice for a particular customer on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form, and review the '''Discount Details''' tab to see how the discounts are applied.
==System Preparation==
Before you start the activity, do the following:[anchor|#_9518e56e-9894-425b-87ca-0971f8e35a4c]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as an accountant by using the ''johnson'' login and the ''123'' password.
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to '' 1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button and select '' 1/30/2020''. For simplicity, in this lesson, you will create and process all documents in the system on this business date.
#On the Company and Branch Selection menu, also on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center'' branch is selected. If it is not selected, click the selection menu to view the list of branches that you have access to, and then click ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center''.
#Make sure the ''Customer Discounts'' feature is enabled as follows:
##Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
##Locate the '''Customer Discounts''' check box under the '''Advanced Financials''' section.
##If the check box is cleared, click '''Modify''' on the form toolbar, select the check box, and then click '''Enable''' on the form toolbar.

==Step 1: Configure the Customer-Specific Document Discount==
To configure the document discount specific to the ''TOMYUM'' customer, do the following:[anchor|#_b4959081-5ec6-4862-9377-26927aee8d36]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_90_00|Discount Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209000|AR209000]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add Row''', and specify the following settings in the added row:
#*'''Discount Code''': ''DOCUM00000''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Document discount by customer</tt>
#*'''Discount Type''': ''Document''
#* '''Applicable To''': ''Customer''
#* '''Auto-Numbering''': Selected
#*'''Last Number''': <tt>DOCUM00000</tt>
#:These settings define discounts of this discount code as automatic document discounts that are applicable to specific customers (which will be only the ''TOMYUM'' customer in this example).
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_95_00|Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209500|AR209500]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record''', and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Discount Code''': ''DOCUM00000''
#* '''Discount by''': ''Percent''
#* '''Active''': Selected
#*'''Description''': <tt>Document discount for TOMYUM</tt>
#:These settings convey that this discount (of the discount code you just defined for document discounts that are applicable to specific customers) is by percent, with break points by amount. In this case, the value in the '''Break by''' box has been defined automatically based on the discount code configuration and cannot be changed by the user.
#On the '''Discount Breakpoints''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the added row:
#*'''Pending Break Amount''': <tt>0</tt>
#*'''Pending Discount Percent''': <tt>7</tt>
#*'''Pending Date''': '' 1/30/2020''
#:With these settings, the discount of 7% is applicable to a document of any amount (because the break amount is 0).
#On the '''Customers''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and in the '''Customer''' column, select ''TOMYUM''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Update Discounts''' to make the discount you have just added effective, and in the '''Update Discounts''' dialog box, which opens, leave '' 1/30/2020'' in the '''Filter Date''' box, and click '''OK'''.

==Step 3: Configure the Unconditional Document Discount==
To configure the unconditional document discount of 15% for documents of $200 or more, do the following:[anchor|#_709613f7-c483-458d-b2be-a70a10993926]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_90_00|Discount Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209000|AR209000]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add Row''', and specify the following settings in the added row:
#*'''Discount Code''': ''UNCON00000''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Document discount unconditional</tt>
#*'''Discount Type''': ''Document''
#* '''Applicable To''': ''Unconditional''
#* '''Auto-Numbering''': Selected
#*'''Last Number''': <tt>UNCON00000</tt>
#:With these settings, discounts of this discount code are unconditional automatic document discounts. In this case, ''Unconditional'' conveys that the discount code is not applicable to a limited set of entities. However, a discount of this discount code may have particular break points defined for specific discounts, as is the case in this example.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_95_00|Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209500|AR209500]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record''', and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Discount Code''': ''UNCON00000''
#* '''Discount by''': ''Percent''
#* '''Active''': Selected
#*'''Description''': <tt>Document discount unconditional</tt>
#:These settings convey that this discount (of the discount code you just defined for unconditional document discounts) is by percent, with break points by amount. In this case, the value in the '''Break by''' box has been defined automatically based on the discount code configuration and cannot be changed by the user.
#On the '''Discount Breakpoints''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the added row:
#*'''Pending Break Amount''': <tt>200</tt>
#*'''Pending Discount Percent''': <tt>15</tt>
#*'''Pending Date''': '' 1/30/2020''
#:The discount of 15% is applicable to a document with an amount greater than or equal to $200.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Update Discounts''', and in the '''Update Discounts''' dialog box, which opens, leave '' 1/30/2020'' in the '''Filter Date''' box, and click '''OK'''.

==Step 4: Create the AR Invoice and Explore the Discount Application==
To create the AR invoice for the ''TOMYUM'' customer and explore how the system automatically applies the discounts you have created, do the following:[anchor|#_d9c0d694-f4a6-4198-96cd-1b8f1c175482]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record''', and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Type''': ''Invoice''
#* '''Customer''': ''TOMYUM''
#* '''Date''': '' 1/30/2020''
#* '''Post Period''': ''01- 2020''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Training courses</tt>
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the added row:
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''OFLCOURSE''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>2</tt>
#*'''UOM''': ''DAY''
#* '''Unit Price''': <tt>45</tt>
#On the '''Discount Details''' tab, notice that a row with the ''DOCUM00000'' discount code, which you configured in Step 1, has been added, meaning that the discount has been applied to this document.
#:The '''Discount Percent''' column shows the discount percent (7%), the '''Discount Amt.''' column shows the discount amount and the same amount is shown in the '''Discount Total''' box in the Summary area.
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the added row:
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''ONLCOURSE''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>10</tt>
#*'''UOM''': ''DAY''
#* '''Unit Price''': <tt>15</tt>
#On the '''Discount Details''' tab, notice that a row with the ''UNCON00000'' discount code, which you configured in Step 2, has been added, meaning that the discount has been applied to this document. The 7% discount that was applied after you added the first document line has now disappeared.
#:Also notice that the '''Discount Percent''' column shows the discount percent (15%), the '''Discount Amt.''' column shows the discount amount, and the same amount is now shown in the '''Discount Total''' box in the Summary area. This discount has been applied because it is the best available discount for this document.
#On the form toolbar, clear the '''Hold''' check box and click '''Release''' to release the invoice.

==Step 5: Make the Created Discounts Inactive==
To make the discounts you created in this lesson inactive so that they will not affect other documents later, do the following:[anchor|#_4a5ae1cb-d499-4545-b27d-280870e94946]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_95_00|Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209500|AR209500]) form.
#In the '''Discount Code''' box, select ''DOCUM00000''.
#In the '''Sequence''' box, select ''DOCUM00001''.
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Active''' check box; save the discount.
#Repeat Instructions 2 through 4 for the ''UNCON00000'' discount code.

On the  Discount Breakpoints  tab, click  Add Row       on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the added row: Pending Break Amount :  200 Pending Discount Percent :  15 Pending Date :            1/30/2020The discount of 15% is applicable to a document with an amount greater than or equal to       $200. On the form toolbar, click  Save . On the form toolbar, click  Update Discounts , and in the        Update Discounts  dialog box, which opens, leave          1/30/2020 in the  Filter Date  box, and click        OK . Step 4: Create the AR Invoice and Explore the Discount Application To create the AR invoice for the  TOMYUM  customer and explore how the system     automatically applies the discounts you have created, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form. On the form toolbar, click  Add New Record , and specify the following      settings in the Summary area: Type :  Invoice Customer :  TOMYUM Date :            1/30/2020Post Period :           01-  2020Description :  Training courses On the  Document Details  tab, click  Add Row  on           the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the added row: Branch :  HEADOFFICE Inventory ID :  OFLCOURSE Quantity :  2 UOM :  DAY Unit Price :  45 On the  Discount Details  tab, notice that a row with the        DOCUM00000  discount code, which you configured in Step 1, has been added, meaning that      the discount has been applied to this       document. The         Discount Percent  column shows the discount percent (7%), the         Discount Amt.  column shows the discount amount and the same amount is       shown in the  Discount Total  box in the Summary       area. On the  Document Details  tab, click  Add Row  on           the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the added row: Branch :  HEADOFFICE Inventory ID :  ONLCOURSE Quantity :  10 UOM :  DAY Unit Price :  15 On the  Discount Details  tab, notice that a row with the              UNCON00000  discount code, which you configured in Step 2, has been added, meaning           that the discount has been applied to this document. The 7% discount that was applied           after you added the first document line has now             disappeared. Also             notice that  the  Discount Percent  column shows             the discount percent (15%), the  Discount Amt.  column shows the             discount amount, and the same amount is now shown in the  Discount               Total  box in the Summary area. This discount has been applied because it             is the best available discount for this document. On the form toolbar, clear the  Hold  check box and click        Release  to release the invoice.

==Calculation of Line-Level Discounts for Tiers Defined by Amounts==
The tiers for line-level discounts can be defined by amounts or by quantities. The method of calculation of line-level discounts depends on the option you select in the '''Line Discount Basis''' box on the '''Price/Discount Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) form. You can apply the discounts to the unit prices of items or the extended prices of items (the line amounts without taxes), and the selected option affects the discount calculation. Both methods are described in this section.{br}

'''Line Discounts Applied to Unit Prices'''{br}

If the system is configured to apply line discounts to the unit prices of items, for discounts with break points defined as amounts (rather than quantities), you should specify the break points to be compared to prices. In this case, the system calculates discounts as follows:[anchor|#ol_mpl_tsr_tm]
#The line item&rsquo;s price is compared to the first break point. If the item price is less than the first break point in the sequence, the discount equals $0, and no further comparison is performed.
#The item price is compared to the next break point. If the price is greater than or equal to this break point but less than the next break point (or greater than the last break point), the system calculates the discount as follows:
#*If the discount is a fixed amount, the fixed amount for this tier is deducted from the item&rsquo;s unit price, and the extended price is recalculated.
#*If the discount is a percentage, the percent (specified for this tier) of the unit price is calculated and deducted from the item&rsquo;s unit price.
#Comparison continues similarly, with Step 2 repeated until a discount is found or the last break point has been reached.

If the system is configured to apply line discounts to item prices and a sequence is divided by the quantity of the item, the line quantity of the item is compared to the quantities selected as break points, and the discount is calculated as follows:[anchor|#ul_cgl_z2s_tm]
*If the discount is defined as a percentage, the specified percent is deducted from the item price, and then the discounted price is multiplied by the item quantity.
*If the discount is defined as a fixed amount, the specified fixed amount is deducted from the item price and then the discounted price is multiplied by the item quantity.

'''Example 4:''' Suppose that a customer buys multiple items with prices of $95, $210, and $600. If a sequence for a line-level discount has tiers defined by amounts with the discounts expressed as percentages, the discount amount (calculated as the percent defined for the appropriate tier) of the item price is subtracted from the price. Suppose that the sequence is specified with the following break points: [anchor|#ul_vkt_5ms_tm]
*$100: 5%
*$200: 10%
*$500: 20%

For a line with 10 units of the item priced at $95, the discount will be $0. For a line with 20 units of the item priced at $210, the discount will be $21 per unit with the discount for the line of $420. And for a line with one item priced at $600, the discount will be $120.{br}

'''Line Discounts Applied to Extended Prices'''{br}

If the system is configured to apply line discounts to the extended prices of items and the tiers are defined by line amounts, the system calculates discounts as follows:[anchor|#ol_x4k_ppr_tm]
#The line amount (that is, the extended price of the item) is compared to the first break point. If the amount is less than the first break point in the sequence, the discount equals $0, and no further comparison is performed.
#The line amount is compared to the next break point. If the amount is greater than or equal to this break point but less than the next break point (or greater than the last break point), the system calculates the discount as follows:
#*If the discount is a fixed amount, the fixed amount for this tier is deducted from the line amount. No further comparison is performed.
#*If the discount is a percentage, the percent (specified for this tier) of the line amount is calculated and deducted from the line amount. No further comparison is performed.
#Comparison continues similarly, with Step 2 repeated until a discount is found or the last break point has been reached.

'''Example 3:''' Suppose that a customer buys an item whose unit cost is $95. If the sequence for the line-level discount has tiers defined by amounts and the discounts are expressed as percentages, the discount amount (calculated by using the percent defined for the appropriate tier) of the item&rsquo;s extended price is subtracted from the extended price. Suppose that the sequence is specified with the following break points: [anchor|#ul_uz1_rks_tm]
*$1000: 5%
*$2000: 10%
*$5000: 20%

For a line with 10 items (which means that the extended price is $950), the discount is $0. For a line with 20 items (for an extended price of $1900), the discount is $95 (5%). For the line with 60 items (and an extended price of $5700), the discount is $1140 (20%).]]></column>

For document-level discounts, the discount tiers can be created only by break points defined as amounts, and the discount can be defined as a fixed amount or a percentage of the document amount. When the system processes a sales order or an invoice and finds a qualifying discount (based on the application conditions), the system compares the discountable amount to the break points in the discount sequence as follows:[anchor|#ul_yj2_grq_tm]
#The document amount is compared to the first break point. If the document amount is less than the amount of the first break point in the sequence, the discount equals zero, and no further comparison is performed.
#The document amount is compared to the next break point. If the document amount is greater than or equal to the amount of this break point but less than the amount of the next break point (or greater than the amount of the last break point), the system calculates the discount as follows:
#*If the discount is a fixed amount, the fixed amount for this tier is deducted from the document amount.
#*If the discount is a percentage, the percent (specified for this tier) of the document amount is calculated and deducted from the document amount.
#*If the discount is a quantity of a free item, the quantity defined for this tier is added to the order or invoice with no additional cost.
#Comparison continues similarly, with Step 2 repeated until a discount is found or the last break point is reached.

The examples below illustrate the way these document-level discounts are calculated.{br}

'''Example 1''': If a sequence for a document-level discount has tiers defined by amounts and the discounts are expressed as percentages, the discount amount corresponding to the appropriate tier is subtracted from the document total. Suppose that the sequence is specified with the following break points:[anchor|#ul_hk2_grq_tm]
*$1000: 5%
*$2000: 7%
*$5000: 10%

For a document with a $900 total, the discount is $0. For a document with a $2500 total, the discount is $175 (7%), and for a document with a total of $9000, the discount is $900 (10%). {br}

'''Example 2''': Suppose that a sequence for a document-level discount is broken down by amount, with the discounts expressed as fixed amounts that are subtracted from the total amount of the document. Further suppose that the sequence is specified with the following break points:[anchor|#ul_pnd_frq_tm]
*$1000: $100
*$2000: $225
*$3000: $350

Customers receive a discount of $0 for orders with amounts less than $1000. The discount for an order with a total between $1000 and $1999.99 is $100, the discount for an order between $2000 and $2999.99 is $225, and the discount for an order of $3000 or more is $350.]]></column>

In this activity, you will learn how to configure an automatic volume discount for a particular stock item, and you will explore how it is applied to a sales order.
==Story==
Suppose that at the end of January, warehouse personnel at SweetLife Fruits & Jams found out that the company&rsquo;s wholesale warehouse contains a large lot of 32-ounce jars of orange jam with an approaching expiration date. Company personnel decided to sell these jars at the following discounts: [anchor|#_21be713f-1f01-4a34-8dce-5e7e7f85fab6]
*5% for 5 to 10 jars
*10% for 11 to 19 jars
*20% for 20 jars or more

Because no one can predict when the entire lot will be sold, this discount should be configured to start on  1/30/2020 and extend indefinitely.{br}

Acting as the SweetLife accountant, you will configure this discount in the system and create a sales order to see how the discount is applied. You will then deactivate the discount.
==Process Overview==
To configure an automatic volume discount for a particular stock item, you create the needed discount code on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_90_00|Discount Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209000|AR209000]) form, and then configure an automatic volume discount for the particular item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_95_00|Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209500|AR209500]) form.{br}

If the discount is broken by quantity, to see how the discount is applied, you can create a sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form with lines that have different quantities.
==System Preparation==
To prepare the system, do the following:[anchor|#_9518e56e-9894-425b-87ca-0971f8e35a4c]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as an accountant by using the ''johnson'' login and the ''123'' password.
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to '' 1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button and select '' 1/30/2020''. For simplicity, in this lesson, you will create and process all documents in the system on this business date.
#On the company and branch selection menu, also on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center'' branch is selected. If it is not selected, click the selection menu to view the list of branches that you have access to, and then click ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center''.
#Make sure the ''Customer Discounts'' feature is enabled as follows:
##Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
##Locate the '''Customer Discounts''' check box under the '''Advanced Financials''' section.
##If the check box is cleared, click '''Modify''' on the form toolbar, select the check box, and then click '''Enable''' on the form toolbar.

==Step 1: Configure the Automatic Volume Discount==

#:In the '''Discount Percent''' column, notice that the 5% discount you configured in Step 1 has been applied, because the quantity in the line is between 5 and 10.
#Click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the added row:
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''ORJAM32''
#* '''Warehouse''': ''WHOLESALE''
#* '''UOM''': ''PIECE''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>12</tt>
#*'''Unit Price''': <tt>13</tt>
#:In the '''Discount Percent''' column, notice that the 10% discount you configured in Step 1 has been applied, because the quantity in the line is between 11 and 19.
#Add one more row with the following settings:
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''ORJAM32''
#* '''Warehouse''': ''WHOLESALE''
#* '''UOM''': ''PIECE''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>22</tt>
#*'''Unit Price''': <tt>13</tt>
#:In the '''Discount Percent''' column, notice that the 20% discount you configured in Step 1 has been applied, because the quantity in the line is more than 20.
#:You do not need to save or process the sales order; you created it solely to learn how the discounts are applied.

==Step 3: Make the Discount Inactive==
To make the discount you created in this lesson inactive so that it will not affect other documents later, do the following:[anchor|#_4a5ae1cb-d499-4545-b27d-280870e94946]

Story Suppose that at the end of January, warehouse personnel at SweetLife Fruits &                 Jams found out that the company's wholesale warehouse contains a large lot of                 32-ounce jars of orange jam with an approaching expiration date. Company personnel                 decided to sell these jars at the following discounts:  5% for 5 to 10 jars 10% for 11 to 19 jars 20% for 20 jars or more Because no one can predict when the entire lot will be sold, this discount should be                 configured to start on                       1/30/2020 and extend indefinitely. Acting as the SweetLife accountant, you will configure this discount in the system                 and create a sales order to see how the discount is applied. You will then                 deactivate the discount. Process Overview To configure an automatic volume discount for a particular stock item, you create the                 needed discount code on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR209000|AR209000]) Discount Codes (AR209000) form, and                 then configure an automatic volume discount for the particular item on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR209500|AR209500]) Discounts (AR209500) form. If the discount is broken by quantity, to see how the discount is applied, you can                 create a sales order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form with                 lines that have different quantities.

In this activity, you will configure discounts of multiple types and learn how the system applies a combination of discounts to an AR invoice.
==Story==
Starting in January  2020, the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company is offering a discount of $100 to local customers who order 10 or more days of offline training.
Suppose that on January 30,  2020 one of the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company&rsquo;s local customers, FourStar Coffee & Sweets Shop (''COFFEESHOP''), bought 12 days of offline training and 5 days of online training, for which your company is offering a 12% discount effective on  1/30/2020 for more than 5 days of training. 
In addition, SweetLife has offered a 15% discount to all customers who purchase $200 or more in a single order.
Acting as SweetLife&rsquo;s accountant, you need to define the discounts for the ''OFLCOURSE'' and ''ONLCOURSE'' non-stock items, which will be applied automatically.{br}

Finally, you need to create and post the AR invoice for FourStar Coffee & Sweets Shop in the system, making sure that the three discounts are applied to this invoice.
==Process Overview==
To configure a group discount for particular non-stock items, you create a discount code on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_90_00|Discount Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209000|AR209000]) form, and then configure this discount on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_95_00|Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209500|AR209500]) form. {br}

You then create an AR invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form and review how the discounts defined in the system are applied to the invoice. You release the invoice on this form, and you review the resulting GL batch on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_30_10_00|Journal Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=GL301000|GL301000]) form.
==System Preparation==
To prepare the system, do the following:[anchor|#_9518e56e-9894-425b-87ca-0971f8e35a4c]

#On the form toolbar, click '''Update Discounts''', and in the '''Update Discounts''' dialog box, which opens, leave '' 1/30/2020'' in the '''Filter Date''' box, and click '''OK'''.

==Step 4: Create the AR Invoice and Explore Discount Application==
To create the AR invoice for FourStar Coffee & Sweets Shop and observe how the system automatically applies the discounts, do the following:[anchor|#_db8de60d-7d78-4017-b3ee-c9833a49a0a1]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record''', and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Type''': ''Invoice''
#* '''Customer''': ''COFFEESHOP''
#* '''Date''': '' 1/30/2020'' (inserted by default)
#*'''Post Period''': ''01- 2020''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Offline and online training</tt>
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the added row:
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''OFLCOURSE''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>12</tt>
#*'''UOM''': ''DAY''
#* '''Unit Price''': <tt>45</tt>
#:Notice that the '''Discount Code''' column in the line now contains ''LIITE00000''. This is the automatic line discount of $100 that you configured for 10 or more days of offline training on 1/1/ 2020. The '''Ext. Price''' column shows the amount before the discount ($540), the '''Discount Amount''' column shows the discount amount ($100), and the '''Amount''' column shows the amount with the discount applied ($440). This amount ($440) is also shown in the '''Detail Total''' box in the Summary area.
#Click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the added row:
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''ONLCOURSE''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>5</tt>
#*'''UOM''': ''DAY''
#* '''Unit Price''': <tt>13</tt>
#Review the '''Discount Details''' tab. Notice that lines have been added for the following discount codes, whose automatic discounts have been also applied to the AR invoice:
#*The ''GRITE00000'' discount code (the group discount of 12% for offline training on 1/30/2020). The '''Discountable Amount''' for this discount is the '''Detail Total''' amount, which is the total amount after the line discount is applied. The '''Discount Percent''' column contains the discount percent (12%), and the '''Discount Amt.''' column contains the discount amount, which is automatically calculated by the system.
#*The ''UNCON00000'' discount code (the unconditional document discount of 15% for amounts of $200 or more on 1/30/2020). The '''Discountable Amount''' for this invoice is the detail total amount with the group discount subtracted from it. The '''Discount Percent''' column shows the discount percent (15%), and the '''Discount Amt.''' column shows the discount amount, which is automatically calculated by the system.
#:The sum of these group and document discounts is shown in the '''Discount Total''' box in the Summary area. The line discount applied on the '''Document Details''' tab is not shown on the '''Discount Details''' tab; it has already been subtracted from the '''Detail Total''' shown in the Summary area.
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box so the system assigns the invoice the ''Balanced'' status, and on the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

==Step 5: Release the AR Invoice and Review the GL Batch==
To release the invoice, review the corresponding GL batch, and analyze which accounts were updated, do the following:[anchor|#_5141931f-85b1-47cf-b981-b77b63f9cded]
#While you are still on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form, click '''Release''' on the form toolbar to release the invoice.
#On the '''Financial Details''' tab, click the link in the '''Batch Nbr.''' box.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_30_10_00|Journal Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=GL301000|GL301000]) form, which opens, review the GL batch.
#:The ''40000 - Sales Revenue'' account is credited in the amount of $505, and the ''11000 Accounts Receivable'' account is debited in the amount of $377.74 (the balance of the invoice). The ''53000 - Discount Given'' account is debited in the amount of the group and document discounts applied to the invoice ($127.26).
#:((({S:Warn}The applied discounts and the document amounts may differ if you have skipped any steps in this activity or previously configured any other applicable discounts.
)))

==Step 6: Make the Created Discounts Inactive==
To make the discounts used in this lesson inactive so that they will not affect other documents later, do the following:[anchor|#_4a5ae1cb-d499-4545-b27d-280870e94946]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_95_00|Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209500|AR209500]) form.
#In the '''Discount Code''' box, select ''LIITE00000''.
#In the '''Sequence''' box, select ''LIITE00001''.
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Active''' check box; save the discount.
#Repeat Instructions 2 through 4 for the ''UNCON00000'' and ''GRITE00000'' discount codes.

Story Starting in January                       2020, the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company is offering a discount                 of $100 to local customers who order 10 or more days of offline training. Suppose that on January 30,                       2020 one of the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company's local                 customers, FourStar Coffee & Sweets Shop ( COFFEESHOP ), bought 12 days of                 offline training and 5 days of online training, for which your company is offering a                 12% discount effective on                       1/30/2020 for more than 5 days of training.  In addition, SweetLife has offered a 15% discount to all customers who purchase $200                 or more in a single order. Acting as SweetLife's accountant, you need to define the discounts for the                      OFLCOURSE  and  ONLCOURSE  non-stock items, which will be applied                 automatically. Finally, you need to create and post the AR invoice for FourStar Coffee & Sweets                 Shop in the system, making sure that the three discounts are applied to this                 invoice. Process Overview To configure a group discount for particular non-stock items, you create a discount                 code on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR209000|AR209000]) Discount Codes (AR209000) form, and then                 configure this discount on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR209500|AR209500]) Discounts                 (AR209500) form.  You then create an AR invoice on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos                 (AR301000) form and review how the discounts defined in the system are applied to                 the invoice. You release the invoice on this form, and you review the resulting GL                 batch on the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL301000|GL301000]) Journal Transactions (GL301000) form. System Preparation To prepare the system, do the following: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as an accountant by using the  johnson  login and                     the  123  password. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to                               1/30/2020. If a different date is displayed, click the                     Business Date menu button and select                               1/30/2020. For simplicity, in this lesson, you will create                     and process all documents in the system on this business date. On the company and branch selection menu, also on the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the  SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center                      branch is selected. If it is not selected, click the selection menu to view the                     list of branches that you have access to, and then click  SweetLife Head                         Office and Wholesale Center . Make sure the  Customer Discounts  feature is enabled as follows: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000)                             form. Locate the  Customer Discounts  check box under the                                  Advanced Financials  section. If the check box is cleared, click  Modify  on the                             form toolbar, select the check box, and then click                                  Enable  on the form toolbar.

In this case, the value in the  Break                             by  box has been defined automatically based on the discount                         code configuration and cannot be changed by the user.

Step 4: Create the AR Invoice and Explore Discount Application To create the AR invoice for FourStar Coffee & Sweets Shop and observe how the                 system automatically applies the discounts, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form.

Notice that lines have                     been added for the following discount codes, whose automatic discounts have been                     also applied to the AR invoice: The  GRITE00000  discount code (the group discount of 12% for                             offline training on                                  1/30/2020). The  Discountable Amount                              for this discount is the  Detail Total  amount,                             which is the total amount after the line discount is applied. The                                  Discount Percent  column contains the discount                             percent (12%), and the  Discount Amt.  column                             contains the discount amount, which is automatically calculated by the                             system. The  UNCON00000  discount code (the unconditional document discount                             of 15% for amounts of $200 or more on                                  1/30/2020). The  Discountable Amount                              for this invoice is the detail total amount with the group discount                             subtracted from it. The  Discount Percent  column                             shows the discount percent (15%), and the  Discount                                 Amt.  column shows the discount amount, which is                             automatically calculated by the system. The sum of these group and document discounts is shown in the                              Discount Total  box in the Summary area. The line                         discount applied on the  Document Details  tab is not                         shown on the  Discount Details  tab; it has already                         been subtracted from the  Detail Total  shown in the                         Summary area. In the Summary area, clear the  Hold  check box so the                     system assigns the invoice the  Balanced  status, and on the form toolbar,                     click  Save . Step 5: Release the AR Invoice and Review the GL Batch To release the invoice, review the corresponding GL batch, and analyze which accounts                 were updated, do the following: While                      you                     are  still on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000)                     form, click  Release  on the form toolbar to release the                     invoice. On the  Financial Details  tab, click the link in the                          Batch Nbr.  box. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL301000|GL301000]) Journal Transactions (GL301000) form, which opens, review the                     GL batch. The  40000 - Sales Revenue  account is credited in the amount                         of $505, and the  11000 Accounts Receivable  account is debited in the                         amount of                          $377.74                          (the balance of the invoice). The  53000 - Discount Given  account is                         debited in the amount of the group and document discounts applied to the                         invoice                          ($127.26) . The                         applied discounts and the document amounts may differ if you have skipped                         any steps in this activity or previously configured any other applicable                         discounts. Step 6: Make the Created Discounts Inactive To make the discounts used in this lesson inactive so that they will not affect other                 documents later, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR209500|AR209500]) Discounts (AR209500) form. In the  Discount Code  box, select  LIITE00000 . In the  Sequence  box, select                          LIITE0000 1 . In the Summary area, clear the  Active  check box; save the                     discount. Repeat Instructions 2 through 4 for the  UNCON00000  and  GRITE00000                      discount codes. ]]></column>

In this activity, you will configure two automatic document discounts. You will then explore how these discounts are applied to sales orders and learn how the system applies discounts to SO invoices that are prepared based on sales orders with different document discounts. Also, you will learn how to update the discount amount.
==Story==
Suppose that to facilitate sales in  2020, the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company has decided to introduce discounts for some customers. For FourStar Coffee & Sweets Shop, a $70 discount should be applied to sales orders when the total amount of all lines is $200 or more. For local customers, SweetLife is offering a 20% discount for sales orders when the total amount of all lines is $400 or more.{br}

Thus, as SweetLife&rsquo;s accountant, you need to configure the following discounts in the system:[anchor|#_ee0cf899-e934-4e3a-9fa1-607a0e96a0ac]
*A customer-specific document discount of $70
*A document discount of 20% specific for the ''LOCAL'' customer price class
{br}

You also need to create two sales orders for the FourStar Coffee & Sweets Shop (''COFFEESHOP'') customer, and notice how these discounts are applied. Further suppose that before you have processed the sales orders, the sales manager has informed you that the discount percent for the second order changed to 25%. You need to update the discount percent in the second sales order and issue one invoice for both sales orders.
==Process Overview==
You add discount codes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_90_00|Discount Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209000|AR209000]) form, and then configure document discounts on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_95_00|Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209500|AR209500]) form. You create sales orders for a particular customer on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, to which discounts can be applied. {br}

If a discount has changed while a sales order is being prepared, you update the discount on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_95_00|Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209500|AR209500]) form. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form, you recalculate the prices of the sales orders being prepared in case any have changed. {br}

To complete the processing of a sales order, you create and confirm a shipment for the sales order (or for multiple orders) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form, you create an SO invoice for one sales order or multiple sales orders, making sure that the automatic discounts for these sales orders are applied, and then release the invoice.
==System Preparation==
To prepare the system, do the following:[anchor|#_9518e56e-9894-425b-87ca-0971f8e35a4c]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as an accountant by using the ''johnson'' login and the ''123'' password.
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to '' 1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button and select '' 1/30/2020''. For simplicity, in this lesson, you will create and process all documents in the system on this business date.
#On the company and branch selection menu, also on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center'' branch is selected. If it is not selected, click the selection menu to view the list of branches that you have access to, and then click ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center''.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form, make sure that the price has been defined for the ''APJAM32'' stock item. If it has not been defined, add this price and save your changes.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, make sure that the default price specified for the ''APJAM08'' stock item on the '''Price/Cost Info''' tab is <tt>4.15</tt>. Change the default price if required.
#Make sure the ''Customer Discounts'' feature is enabled as follows:
##Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
##Locate the '''Customer Discounts''' check box under the '''Advanced Financials''' section.
##If the check box is cleared, click '''Modify''' on the form toolbar, select the check box, and then click '''Enable''' on the form toolbar.

#*'''Discount Code''': ''DOC0200000''
#* '''Discount by''': ''Percent''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Document discount for local customers</tt>
#:With these settings, the discount (of the discount code you just defined for document discounts that are applicable to specific customer price classes) is by percent, with break points by amount.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Customer Discounts: To Add Sales Orders with Different Document Discounts in a Single SO         Invoice In this activity, you will configure two automatic document discounts. You will then                 explore how these discounts are applied to sales orders and learn how the system                 applies discounts to SO invoices that are prepared based on sales orders with                 different document discounts. Also, you will learn how to update the discount                 amount. Story Suppose that to facilitate sales in                       2020, the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company has decided to                 introduce discounts for some customers.

For local customers, SweetLife is offering a 20% discount for sales                 orders when the total amount of all lines is $400 or more. Thus, as SweetLife's accountant, you need to configure the following discounts in the                     system: A customer-specific document discount of $70 A document discount of 20% specific for the  LOCAL  customer price                         class You also need to create two sales orders for the FourStar Coffee & Sweets Shop                     ( COFFEESHOP ) customer, and notice how these discounts are applied.

You                 need to update the discount percent in the second sales order and issue one invoice                 for both sales orders. Process Overview You add discount codes on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR209000|AR209000]) Discount Codes (AR209000)                 form, and then configure document discounts on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR209500|AR209500]) Discounts (AR209500) form. You create sales orders                 for a particular customer on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders                 (SO301000) form, to which discounts can be applied.  If a discount has changed while a sales order is being prepared, you update the                 discount on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR209500|AR209500]) Discounts (AR209500) form. On the                       ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders form, you recalculate the prices of                 the sales orders being prepared in case any have changed.  To complete the processing of a sales order, you create and confirm a shipment for                 the sales order (or for multiple orders) on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) form. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form, you create an SO invoice                 for one sales order or multiple sales orders, making sure that the automatic                 discounts for these sales orders are applied, and then release the invoice. System Preparation To prepare the system, do the following: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as an accountant by using the  johnson  login and                     the  123  password. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to                               1/30/2020. If a different date is displayed, click the                     Business Date menu button and select                               1/30/2020. For simplicity, in this lesson, you will create                     and process all documents in the system on this business date. On the company and branch selection menu, also on the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the  SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center                      branch is selected.

Click the  DOC0200000  code in the  Discount Code                          column. The  Discounts  form will open in a pop-up                         window. For                     the only row in the table, specify the following settings:  Pending Break Amount :                              400 Pending Discount Percent :                                  25 Pending Date :  1/30/2020On the form toolbar, click  Update Discounts  to make the                     updated discount effective.

On the form toolbar, click  Save  to save the sales                     order. Step 5: Prepare an SO Invoice for Both Sales Orders To prepare an SO invoice for both sales orders, do the following: While                      you                     are  still on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders                     (SO301000) form, on the form toolbar, click  Actions Create Shipment . In the  Specify Shipment Parameters  dialog box, leave the                     default values and click  OK .

On the  Document Details  tab, click  Add                         Order  on the table toolbar. In the Summary area of the  Add Sales Order  dialog box,                     which opens, in the  Order Nbr.  box, select the sales                     order                      that                      you created in Step 3. In the table of the dialog box, select the unlabeled check box for the sales                     order line with the  APJAM08  item and click  Add &                         Close . On the form toolbar, click  Save . On the form toolbar, click  Actions Confirm Shipment . You have created and confirmed one shipment for the sales                         orders you created in Step 3. On the form toolbar, click  Actions Prepare Invoice . On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form, which                     opens, review the invoice that has been created for both sales orders. On the  Discount Details  tab, review the discounts that                     have been applied to the invoice generated from the sales orders. As the                         screenshot below shows, the table contains two lines, one with the                              DOC0100000  document discount, in the amount of $70, and the other                         with the  DOC0200000  document discount by percent (25%). The                         amounts may be different from the ones in this step if some lessons in this                         course were skipped or the sales prices listed in the  Configuration                             Overview  section have not been defined in the system. In the Summary area, click  Actions Release  to release the invoice. Step 6: Make the Created Discounts Inactive To make the discounts you created in this lesson inactive so that they will not                 affect other documents later, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR209500|AR209500]) Discounts (AR209500) form. In the  Discount Code  box, select  DOC0100000 . In the  Sequence  box, select                          DOC010000 1 . In the Summary area, clear the  Active  check box; save the                     discount. Repeat Instructions 2  through 4                      for the  DOC0200000  discount code. ]]></column>

You can prorate discount sequences if the '''Prorate Discounts''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_95_00|Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AR209500|AR209500]) form. For prorated discount sequences, the system prevents customers from attempts to split a sales order to get greater discount amount or a larger quantity of free items. The functionality of prorated discounts is applicable to discount sequences with discountable quantities or discountable amounts, such as when you want to give your customers a discount of $5 for every 10 units purchased.{br}

For example, to determine the discount for a discountable quantity larger than one break point but less than the next break point, the system treats the discountable quantity as a combination of break point quantities and uses the largest possible break point quantities. It then calculates the discount according to the break points used. {br}

'''Example 5:''' Consider a prorated group-level discount with tiers based on quantity. The sequence defines the discount with the following tiers:[anchor|#ul_kct_qyd_tm]
*10 units: 1 unit of the free item
*20 units: 2 units of the free item
*40 units: 3 units of the free item

A sales order for 50 units would yield 4 units of the free item, computed as 3 (for 40 units) plus 1 (for 10 units). For an order of 70 units, the discount is calculated as 6 units of the free item: 3 as the discount for 40 units, plus 2 as the discount for 20 units, plus 1 as the discount for 10 units.]]></column>

Discounts configured in the system can be applied to various documents, including sales orders and SO invoices. The system can calculate discounts differently depending on the document type.

))){br}{TOC}
==Types of Discounts in Sales Orders==
When a user saves a sales order, the system selects and applies the types of automatic discounts configured in the system in the following order:[anchor|#ul_ltk_fjp_mdb]
#Line-level discounts (which are applied to each line of the document): For each sales order line, the system finds and applies the applicable line-level discount with the largest discount amount. The system can apply only one (the best) line-level discount to a sales order line. Line-level discounts that the system has automatically applied to sales order lines are shown on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form.
#Group-level discounts (which are applied to multiple lines of the document): The system finds and applies the applicable group-level discount or discounts. (Multiple group discounts can be applied to a sales order.) The discountable amount for each group discount is calculated as the sum of the extended prices of all lines in the group to which the group discount is applicable. Group discounts are applied in parallel. That is, if multiple group discounts are applicable to the same sales order lines, each discount is calculated based on the total of these lines, which is not affected by other group discounts. Group-level discounts that were applied to a document are shown on the '''Discount Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form.
#Document-level discounts (which are applied to the total amount of the document): The system finds and applies the applicable document-level discount with the largest discount amount for a particular sales order. The system can apply only one (the best) document-level discount to a document. Document-level discounts that were applied to a document are shown on the '''Discount Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form.
[anchor|#_c51b1831-3ee9-4d1b-976d-ed42ff6b75dd]((({S:Warn}Document and group discounts are not applicable to the following orders:[anchor|#_97a08cb5-fbde-4908-8aa6-4d22bf045d6b]
*Transfer orders
*Orders of an order type that has the ''RMA Order'' automation behavior and ''No Update'' selected in the '''AR Document Type''' box on the '''Template Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form
)))
==Discount Update in Sales Orders==
By default, Acumatica ERP updates all discounts in a sales order as you change any information in the order (such as adding new lines). Manual line discounts are fixed based on the discount percent: If you change the line details, the system keeps the current discount percentage and uses it to recalculate the discount amount. Manual document discounts are fixed based on the discount amount: If any changes have been introduced to the document, the system keeps the discount amount and uses it to recalculate the discount percentage.{br}

You can configure the system so that it does not update discounts automatically in orders of a particular type by selecting the '''Disable Automatic Discount Update''' check box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. For a particular order of a type, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, you can change the state of this check box on the '''Discount Details''' tab. {br}

When the '''Disable Automatic Discount Update''' check box is selected for an order, the already-applied discounts are treated as manual for the order. When you run discount recalculation or add new lines to the order, the system preserves the set of applied discounts; it checks whether these discounts are still applicable for the order, but does not apply any other new discounts to the order. If you manually change any of the discountable amounts or quantities in the order, the system recalculates the fixed set of applied discounts based on these changes.{br}

If you have disabled automatic updating of discounts on an order, you can initiate discount recalculation manually by using the '''Recalculate Prices''' dialog box, which you open by selecting '''Actions''' > '''Recalculate Prices''' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form toolbar.
==Transfer of Discounts to SO Invoices==
When an SO invoice is prepared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form for a sales order, the system transfers all applicable sales order discounts to this SO invoice by using the following rules:[anchor|#ul_a2f_plp_mdb]
*If the sales order has been shipped and billed in full, the discounts are transferred to the invoice in full.
*If the sales order has been shipped and billed partially, the applicable discounts are transferred to the invoice partially, by using the ratio of the invoice amount to sales order amount.
*If a consolidated invoice has been prepared for multiple sales orders, the document and group discounts from all orders are transferred to the invoice. If the same document or group discount applies to multiple orders, the system adds a separate discount line for each order; each discount line is linked to the sales order from which it was transferred.
*If the invoice is modified (for example, if invoice lines are added or deleted, or the date is changed) or if the user clicks '''Actions &gt; Recalculate Prices''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] form, the system removes the applicable discounts from the corresponding orders and recalculates the discounts as if they had been applied directly to the invoice. 
*:((({S:Warn}Discounts that provide free items on sales orders that have been shipped partially or in full are not recalculated when you edit a sales order, edit an invoice, or invoke the recalculation action.
)))

==General Ledger Transactions for SO Invoices==
On release of the SO invoice, the system generates a batch of the following General Ledger transactions.[anchor|#_2ac7d5c2-d53f-4c72-816f-91189239e805]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%"

When the SO invoice is released, all discounts applicable to the invoice at the moment of release are transferred to the created AR invoice. You can review applicable line discounts on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form, and group and document discounts on the '''Discount Details''' tab of this form.]]></column>

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
By maintaining vendor price lists in your system, you can take advantage of promotional prices and volume-based offers when planning your purchases and order items for the best available prices.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
You will learn how vendor prices are defined in Acumatica ERP and how you can upload a vendor price list by using a vendor price worksheet.
==Applicable Scenarios==
In Acumatica ERP, you can maintain vendor prices for both non-stock items and stock items. Configuring vendor prices for stock items is possible only if the ''Inventory'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
==Vendor Price Types==
'''Regular Vendor Prices'''{br}

Regular vendor prices are the most basic type of vendor prices supported in Acumatica ERP. Any price that is not promotional is considered regular. To define a regular vendor price, you specify the following parameters on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_20_00|Vendor Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AP202000|AP202000]) form: the vendor who provided the price, the item to which the price is applicable, the unit of measure in which the item is purchased, the price and the start date on which the price becomes effective. Regular prices do not necessarily have an expiration date. Those that do, are not applicable after that date. You can also import a price list with regular vendor prices by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_20_10|Vendor Price Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=AP202010|AP202010]) form.{br}

'''Promotional Vendor Prices'''{br}

If some of your vendors use promotions, in Acumatica ERP, you can enter promotional vendor prices—that is, temporary prices for specific items. Such prices have expiration dates, and they are not applicable after the expiration date. To enter promotional prices, you select the '''Promotional''' check box for each price record on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_20_00|Vendor Prices] form. You can also import the promotional price list by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_20_10|Vendor Price Worksheets] form and mark all the prices as promotional by selecting the '''Promotional''' check box of the worksheet.{br}

'''UOM-Specific Vendor Prices'''{br}

If some of your vendors maintain prices in multiple units of measure (UOM), you can define a price record for an item in each of these UOMs on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_20_00|Vendor Prices] form. You can also import a list with prices defined in multiple UOMs by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_20_10|Vendor Price Worksheets] form.{br}

A unit of measure is a required parameter for vendor prices of all types. When you a create a price record, you specify the UOM to which the price is applicable. Each UOM in which the item is purchased requires a new vendor price record to be created.{br}

'''Volume-Dependent Vendor Prices'''{br}

If the ''Volume Pricing'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can enter information about a particular vendor's price tiers by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_20_00|Vendor Prices] form. You can enter tiers by specifying for each tier a break quantity, a price, and a date when the price should be in effect.{br}

'''Warehouse-Specific Vendor Prices'''{br}

If the ''Multiple Warehouses'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form, you can define warehouse-specific prices. If a warehouse is not specified for a price, this price applies to all warehouses. The system does not use warehouse-specific prices in accounts payable documents, because these documents do not include warehouse information.]]></column>

To define a regular vendor         price, you specify the following parameters on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP202000|AP202000]) Vendor Prices         (AP202000) form: the vendor who provided the price, the item to which the price is         applicable, the unit of measure in which the item is purchased, the price and the start date         on which the price becomes effective. Regular prices do not necessarily have an expiration         date. Those that do, are not applicable after that date. You can also import a price list         with regular vendor prices by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP202010|AP202010]) Vendor Price Worksheets (AP202010) form. Promotional Vendor Prices If some of your vendors use promotions, in  Acumatica ERP, you can enter promotional vendor prices—that is, temporary prices for specific items.         Such prices have expiration dates, and they are not applicable after the expiration date. To         enter promotional prices, you select the  Promotional  check box for         each price record on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP202000|AP202000]) Vendor Prices form. You can also import the         promotional price list by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP202010|AP202010]) Vendor Price Worksheets form and mark all the         prices as promotional by selecting the  Promotional  check box of the         worksheet. UOM-Specific Vendor Prices If some of your vendors maintain prices in multiple units of measure (UOM), you can define         a price record for an item in each of these UOMs on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP202000|AP202000]) Vendor Prices         form. You can also import a list with prices defined in multiple UOMs by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP202010|AP202010]) Vendor Price Worksheets form. A unit of measure is a required parameter for vendor prices of all types. When you a create         a price record, you specify the UOM to which the price is applicable. Each UOM in which the         item is purchased requires a new vendor price record to be created. Volume-Dependent Vendor Prices If the  Volume Pricing  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features         (CS100000) form, you can enter information about a particular vendor's price tiers by using         the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP202000|AP202000]) Vendor Prices form. You can enter tiers by specifying for each tier a         break quantity, a price, and a date when the price should be in effect. Warehouse-Specific Vendor Prices If the  Multiple Warehouses  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features         form, you can define warehouse-specific prices. If a warehouse is not specified for a price,         this price applies to all warehouses. The system does not use warehouse-specific prices in         accounts payable documents, because these documents do not include warehouse         information. ]]></column>

Multiple prices of different types might be effective for an item at a particular time. When a user selects an item in a document line (or modifies the item&rsquo;s quantity), the system searches for an applicable price of the item that is effective on the date of the document. The system bases this search on the price search priority (highest to lowest) and stops searching when it finds an applicable price. The search for the item&rsquo;s price proceeds as follows:[anchor|#ol_dkx_5sn_f1b]
#The system searches for a promotional price for the item in the following order:
##A price specified for the item with the unit of measure that is selected in the document line. If multiple warehouses are defined in the system, the price specific to the warehouse selected in the document has a higher priority than the price that is not specific to a warehouse. 
##A price specified for the item with its base unit of measure. If multiple warehouses are defined in the system, the price specific to the warehouse selected in the document has a higher priority than the price that is not specific to a warehouse.
#The system searches for a regular price for the item in the following order:
##A price specified for the item with the unit of measure that is selected in the document line. If multiple warehouses are defined in the system, the price specific to the warehouse selected in the document has a higher priority than the price that is not specific to a warehouse. 
##A price specified for the item with its base unit of measure. If multiple warehouses are defined in the system, the price specific to the warehouse selected in the document has a higher priority than the price that is not specific to a warehouse.
#The system searches for a last vendor price for the item in the following order:
##A price specified for the item with the unit of measure that is selected in the document line 
##A price specified for the base unit of measure
#The system searches for the statistical last cost of the item for the warehouse specified in the document.
#The system searches for the last cost of the item.

Once the system finds an applicable price, it stops the search and inserts this price into the document line, but you can override this price. The price search priority is illustrated in the following diagram.[anchor|#fig_ayx_3sn_f1b][anchor|#image_byx_3sn_f1b][image:UserGuide/Images/AP_CON_VendorPrice_Priority.png|popup|Search priority for vendor prices|400px]{br}{TOC}]]></column>

In Acumatica ERP, users can update vendor prices in a variety of ways. You can modify existing vendor price records one by one on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_20_00|Vendor Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AP202000|AP202000]) form, for example, if you need to make only minor updates to individual price records, or use vendor price worksheets to upload or update multiple vendor price records at once on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_20_10|Vendor Price Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=AP202010|AP202010]) form.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
You will learn how to upload a vendor price list to Acumatica ERP by using vendor price worksheets.
==Applicable Scenarios==
Vendors share their product information by sending electronic versions of their catalogs or their price lists, or by making them available for download from their websites. Generally, some price lists include prices intended for all clients, others intended for those who buy occasionally, or those who buy in large volumes. If your company is a preferred customer of a specific vendor or buys in large volumes, the vendor might offer wholesale prices or special prices to your company on particular items or on its entire inventory.{br}

Methods of updating vendor prices described in this section are applicable to both regular and promotional vendor prices maintained on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_20_00|Vendor Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AP202000|AP202000]) form and the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_20_10|Vendor Price Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=AP202010|AP202010]) form. These include prices defined for both stock items and non-stock items.{br}

Depending on the type of the items (non-stock items or stock items) and the kind of vendor prices you want to work with, additional features might need to be enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form as follows:[anchor|#_718074cc-bcf0-40f0-8d1e-1ed2ee89c0b6]
*In order to be able to maintain vendor prices for stock items, you must enable the ''Inventory'' feature in the system.
*Warehouse-specific prices can only be maintained if the ''Multiple Warehouses'' feature is enabled.
*Volume-dependent vendor prices are supported if the ''Volume Pricing'' feature is enabled.

==Uploading Vendor Price Lists Using Vendor Price Worksheets==
In Acumatica ERP, you can upload price lists (or enter them manually) for each vendor separately by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_20_10|Vendor Price Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=AP202010|AP202010]) form. Uploading an Excel file with the prices that you have received from a vendor is the most common way of maintaining vendor prices. {br}

Prices defined in a worksheet become effective only after you release the worksheet (on a date specified as the effective date). Before the worksheet is released, you can edit records in it.
==Price Retention Settings==
You can specify how the system keeps the history of vendor prices on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_10_10_00|Accounts Payable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AP101000|AP101000]) form:[anchor|#_351342ac-164a-4d8a-a479-1bed9e0bd108]
*Keep only one previous price and update the previous price every time a new price is released.
*Keep the history of prices for the specified number of months.
{br}

When you add a new price, the system preserves the previous price. For new documents, the system inserts the price effective on the document date.{br}

For a non-stock item, the system also saves the last vendor price that you have used for the item in the vendor&rsquo;s bills. Vendors&rsquo; last prices for the non-stock item are shown on the '''Vendor Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. When you create a bill, if there is no promotional or regular price for the item, the system inserts the last vendor price that has been used in a previously released bill (if any) for that vendor. If there is no such price for the item, the system suggests the standard cost, which you can specify for the non-stock item on the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form.

In this activity, you will learn how to upload vendor price lists with regular prices and promotional prices and analyze how the system suggests vendor prices in bills and purchase orders.
==Story==
Suppose that, to make work with vendor documents easier, the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company decided to create a catalog of vendor prices for non-stock items. The system should be able to automatically suggest the vendor price of a specific non-stock item when a user enters this item in a line of a purchase order. SweetLife ordered advertising services from the Blueline Advertisement agency before, and wants to keep these prices in the system.{br}

Also, the agency offers prices that depend on the number of purchased hours of consulting services:[anchor|#_a3d56ace-8cde-4414-8aea-1fec708ed06d]
*$110/hour for 0 to 4 hours of consulting services
*$100/hour for 5 to 9 hours of consulting services
*$90/hour for 10 or more hours of consulting services

On March 15, 2019, the marketing manager of SweetLife decided to purchase consulting services from Blueline Advertisement and you, acting as the SweetLife accountant, need to create a purchase order for this agency in the system.
==Process Overview==
You create a list of regular prices on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_20_10|Vendor Price Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=AP202010|AP202010]) form. You then configure the price retention settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_10_10_00|Accounts Payable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AP101000|AP101000]) form, and then, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_20_00|Vendor Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AP202000|AP202000]) form, analyze how the system keeps a history of vendor prices depending on the selected settings.{br}

You create a list of vendor prices broken down by item quantity on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_20_10|Vendor Price Worksheets] form and review how the system suggests such prices when you create a purchase order for the vendor on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. You configure the standard cost for an item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, and then analyze how the system suggests the last purchase price and standard cost on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form.{br}

Finally, you add a promotional price for this vendor on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_20_00|Vendor Prices] form, create a purchase order for this vendor on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form, and analyze how the system suggests the vendor prices.
==System Preparation==[anchor|#_3a7ca99f-8a5a-4163-8d36-53fa6d330486]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as an accountant by using the ''johnson'' login and the ''123'' password.
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to '' 1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button and select '' 1/30/2020''. For simplicity, in this lesson, you will create and process all documents in the system on this business date.
#On the Company and Branch Selection menu, also on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center'' branch is selected. If it is not selected, click the selection menu to view the list of branches that you have access to, and then click ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center''.
#Make sure the ''Volume Pricing'' feature is enabled as follows:
##Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form by searching for it or navigating to it.
##Locate the '''Volume Pricing''' check box under the '''Standard Financials''' section to see if it is selected.
##If the check box is cleared, click '''Modify''' on the form toolbar, select the '''Volume Pricing''' check box, and then click '''Enable''' on the form toolbar.

==Step 1: Upload a List of Regular Prices for the Vendor==
To upload a list of regular vendor prices, do the following:[anchor|#_3ac877c6-7761-4fbe-a06d-f8593f625414]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_20_10|Vendor Price Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=AP202010|AP202010]) form.

#On the form toolbar, clear the '''Hold''' check box and click '''Release''' to release the worksheet and make the prices effective in the system. The prices from the worksheet will be suggested in documents starting on 1/1/2019.

==Step 2: Analyze How the System Keeps the History of Prices==
To analyze how the system keeps the history of vendor prices, do the following:[anchor|#_8b4cc189-f20f-4109-a8ed-11e35e6c2f44]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_10_10_00|Accounts Payable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AP101000|AP101000]) form.
#On the '''Price/Discount Settings''' tab, make sure that ''Last Price'' is selected in the '''Retention Type''' box.
#:This is the default setting, which means that the system keeps both the new price defined in the worksheet and the previous regular price.
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_20_10|Vendor Price Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=AP202010|AP202010]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record''', and specify the following settings for a worksheet effective starting on 6/1/2019:
#*'''Effective Date''': ''6/1/2019''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Regular prices of Blueline Advertisement</tt>
#On the table toolbar, click '''Load Records from File'''.
#In the window, which opens, find the <tt>PricesAndDiscounts&#95;VendorPrices&#95;BLUELINE&#95;2019&#95;06&#95;01.xlsx</tt> file and select it for upload. While you are uploading the worksheet, leave the default settings and column mapping.
#In the Summary area of the form, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and click '''Release''' on the form toolbar to release the worksheet and make the prices effective in the system.
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_20_00|Vendor Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AP202000|AP202000]) form.
#In the table, review the prices that are now defined in the system for the non-stock items.
#:The prices that you uploaded in Step 1 expire on 5/31/2019, because you have uploaded new prices effective from 6/1/2019.
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_20_10|Vendor Price Worksheets] form again and, on the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record''' and specify the following settings for a worksheet effective starting on 9/1/2019:
#*'''Effective Date''': ''9/1/2019''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Regular prices of Blueline Advertisement</tt>
#On the table toolbar, click '''Load Records from File'''.
#In the window that opens, find the <tt>PricesAndDiscounts&#95;VendorPrices&#95;BLUELINE&#95;2019&#95;09&#95;01.xlsx</tt> file and select it for upload. While you are uploading the worksheet, leave the default settings and column mapping.
#In the Summary area of the form, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and click '''Release''' on the form toolbar to release the worksheet and make the prices effective in the system.
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_20_00|Vendor Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AP202000|AP202000]) form.
#In the '''Vendor''' box of the Summary area, select ''BLUELINE''.
#In the '''Inventory ID''' box, select ''ADVERT'' and, in the table, review how the system has updated the prices.
#:The system has kept two prices—the most recent price ($45) effective from 9/1/2019 and the previous price ($30) that expired on 8/31/2019.
#:The system sets the expiration date automatically if you release a new price from a worksheet. If you add a new price directly on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_20_00|Vendor Prices] form, you have to specify the expiration date for the previous price manually.

==Step 3: Create a List of Vendor Prices Broken Down by Item Quantity==
To create a list of vendor prices broken down by item quantity, do the following:[anchor|#_ef35d031-9c18-4426-a291-37e5c3d21750]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_20_10|Vendor Price Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=AP202010|AP202010]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record''', and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Effective Date''': ''1/1/2019''

#*'''Pending Price''': <tt>100.00</tt>
#On the table toolbar, click '''Add Row''', and specify the following settings for 10 and more hours of consulting services:
#*'''Vendor''': ''BLUELINE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''CONSULT''
#* '''UOM''': ''HOUR''
#* '''Break Qty''': <tt>10.00</tt>
#*'''Pending Price''': <tt>90.00</tt>
#In the Summary area of the form, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and click '''Release''' on the form toolbar to release the worksheet.
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record''', and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Type''': ''Normal''
#* '''Vendor''': ''BLUELINE''
#* '''Date''': ''4/1/2019''

#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''CONSULT''
#* '''Order Qty.''': <tt>12</tt>
#:Depending on the quantity, the system suggests the different unit costs that you configured for these quantities. You do not need to save the purchase order created in this step. 

==Step 4: Analyze How the System Suggests the Last Purchase Price and Standard Cost==
To analyze how the system suggests the last purchase price and standard cost, do the following:[anchor|#_0d38f1bc-52d2-4151-bc7b-c847db585a3e]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form.
#In the '''Inventory ID''' box, select ''CAMPAIGN''.
#On the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab, specify <tt>390</tt> in the '''Pending Cost''' box in the '''Standard Cost''' section and ''1/1/2019'' in the '''Pending Cost Date''' box.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Update Cost'''.
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record''', and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Type''': ''Normal''
#* '''Vendor''': ''BLUELINE''
#* '''Date''': ''1/2/2019''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Advertising campaign</tt>
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the added row:
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''CAMPAIGN''
#* '''Order Qty.''': <tt>1</tt>
#:In the '''Unit Cost''' column, the system has suggested the $390 standard cost because there is no regular or promotional price effective for this vendor on the specified date.
#In the '''Unit Cost''' column, change the value to <tt>350</tt> and save the purchase order.
#In the Summary area of the form, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and on the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Enter AP Bill''' to create an AP bill for the order.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form, which opens, clear the '''Hold''' check box and click '''Release''' on the form toolbar to release the bill.
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form.
#In the '''Inventory ID''' box, select ''CAMPAIGN''.
#On the '''Vendor Details''' tab, review the information displayed on the tab. The last purchase price ($350) has been saved in the '''Last Vendor Price''' column for the ''BLUELINE'' vendor.
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record''', and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Type''': ''Bill''
#* '''Vendor''': ''BLUELINE''
#* '''Date''': ''1/2/2019''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Advertising campaign</tt>
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the added row:
#*'''Inventory ID''': ''CAMPAIGN''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>1</tt>
#:In the '''Unit Cost''' column, the system has suggested the last purchase price, which is now $350, because there is no regular or promotional price effective for this vendor on the specified date.

==Step 5: Add a Promotional Price and Create a Purchase Order==
To add a promotional price for the ''BLUELINE'' vendor and create a purchase order, do the following:[anchor|#_7e877a87-1418-4086-937e-ae0a0caa0cd3]
#Add a promotional price of $95/hour for the consulting services as follows:
##Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_20_00|Vendor Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AP202000|AP202000]) form.
##On the table toolbar, click '''Add Row''', and specify the following settings in the added row:
##*'''Vendor''': ''BLUELINE''
##* '''Inventory ID''': ''CONSULT''
##* '''UOM''': ''HOUR''
##* '''Promotional''': Selected
##*'''Price''': <tt>95.00</tt>
##*'''Effective Date''': ''1/1/2019''
##* '''Expiration Date''': ''3/31/2019''
##Click '''Save''' to save the price.
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record''', and specify the following parameters in the Summary area:
#*'''Type''': ''Normal''
#* '''Vendor''': ''BLUELINE''
#* '''Date''': ''03/15/2019''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Consulting services</tt>
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the added row:
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''CONSULT''
#* '''UOM''': ''HOUR''
#* '''Order Qty.''': <tt>2</tt>
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save''' to save the purchase order.
#:Because the system contains a vendor price for this non-stock item for the ''BLUELINE'' vendor, the system has copied this price ($95) to the '''Unit Cost''' column. This is a promotional price for this vendor that you have set up in this step, it is effective from 1/1/2019 to 3/31/2019 and overrides the regular vendor price defined in the system.
#In the '''Date''' box in the Summary area, change the date to ''4/15/2019''.
#In the '''Warning''' message that opens, click '''Yes'''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Recalculate Prices'''.
#In the '''Recalculate Prices''' dialog box, which opens, leave the default values and click '''OK'''.
#Review the value in the '''Unit Cost''' column. 
#:The unit cost of this item has changed to $110, because it is a regular vendor price for 0 to 4 hours of consulting services, which you set up in Step 3.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Vendor Prices: To Upload a Price List and Explore Price Selection In this activity, you will learn how to upload vendor price lists with regular prices                 and promotional prices and analyze how the system suggests vendor prices in bills                 and purchase orders. Story Suppose that, to make work with vendor documents easier, the SweetLife Fruits &                 Jams company decided to create a catalog of vendor prices for non-stock items. The                 system should be able to automatically suggest the vendor price of a specific                 non-stock item when a user enters this item in a line of a purchase order. SweetLife                 ordered advertising services from the Blueline Advertisement agency before, and                 wants to keep these prices in the system. Also, the agency offers prices that depend on the number of purchased hours of                 consulting services: $110/hour for 0 to 4 hours of consulting services $100/hour for 5 to 9 hours of consulting services $90/hour for 10 or more hours of consulting services On March 15,                  2019 ,                 the marketing manager of SweetLife decided to purchase consulting services from                 Blueline Advertisement and you, acting as the SweetLife accountant, need to create a                 purchase order for this agency in the system. Process Overview You create a list of regular prices on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP202010|AP202010]) Vendor Price Worksheets (AP202010)                 form. You then configure the price retention settings on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP101000|AP101000]) Accounts Payable Preferences (AP101000) form, and then, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP202000|AP202000]) Vendor Prices (AP202000) form, analyze how the system keeps a                 history of vendor prices depending on the selected settings. You create a list of vendor prices broken down by item quantity on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP202010|AP202010]) Vendor Price Worksheets form and review how the system suggests such prices                 when you create a purchase order for the vendor on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form. You configure the standard cost for an item on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form, and then analyze how the system                 suggests the last purchase price and standard cost on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form. Finally, you add a promotional price for this vendor on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP202000|AP202000]) Vendor Prices form, create a purchase order for this vendor on the                       ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form, and analyze how the system suggests the                 vendor prices. System Preparation Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as an accountant by using the  johnson  login and                     the  123  password.

Locate the  Volume Pricing  check box under the                                  Standard Financials  section to see if it is                             selected. If the check box is cleared, click  Modify  on the                             form toolbar, select the  Volume Pricing  check                             box, and then click  Enable  on the form                             toolbar. Step 1: Upload a List of Regular Prices for the Vendor To upload a list of regular vendor prices, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP202010|AP202010]) Vendor Price Worksheets (AP202010) form. Click  Add New Record  on the form toolbar, and specify the                     following settings in the Summary area: Effective Date :                                  1/1/ 2019 Description :  Regular prices of                                 Blueline Advertisement On the table toolbar, click  Load Records from File .

While you are uploading the worksheet, leave the                     default settings and column mapping. On the form toolbar, clear the  Hold  check box and click                          Release  to release the worksheet and make the prices                     effective in the system. The prices from the worksheet will be suggested in                     documents starting on                     1/1/ 2019 . Step 2: Analyze How the System Keeps the History of Prices To analyze how the system keeps the history of vendor prices, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP101000|AP101000]) Accounts Payable Preferences (AP101000) form. On the  Price/Discount Settings  tab, make sure that                          Last Price  is selected in the  Retention Type                          box. This is the default setting, which means that the system keeps both                         the new price defined in the worksheet and the previous regular                     price. Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP202010|AP202010]) Vendor Price Worksheets (AP202010) form. On the form toolbar, click  Add New Record , and specify                     the following settings for a worksheet effective starting on                         6/1/ 2019 : Effective Date :                                  6/1/ 2019 Description :  Regular prices of                                 Blueline Advertisement On the table toolbar, click  Load Records from File .

While you are uploading the worksheet, leave the                     default settings and column mapping. In the Summary area of the form, clear the  Hold  check                     box, and click  Release  on the form toolbar to release the                     worksheet and make the prices effective in the system. Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP202000|AP202000]) Vendor Prices (AP202000) form. In the table, review the prices that are now defined in the system for the                     non-stock items. The prices that you uploaded in Step 1 expire on                         5/31/ 2019 ,                         because you have uploaded new prices effective from                         6/1/201 9 . Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP202010|AP202010]) Vendor Price Worksheets form again and, on the form toolbar,                     click  Add New Record  and specify the following settings                     for a worksheet effective starting on                         9/1/201 9 : Effective Date :                                  9/1/ 2019 Description :  Regular prices of                                 Blueline Advertisement On the table toolbar, click  Load Records from File .

While you are uploading the worksheet, leave the                     default settings and column mapping. In the Summary area of the form, clear the  Hold  check                     box, and click  Release  on the form toolbar to release the                     worksheet and make the prices effective in the system. Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP202000|AP202000]) Vendor Prices (AP202000) form. In the  Vendor  box of the Summary area, select                          BLUELINE . In the  Inventory ID  box, select  ADVERT  and, in the                     table, review how the system has updated the prices. The system has kept two                         prices—the most recent price ($45) effective from                         9/1/201 9                          and the previous price ($30) that expired on                         8/31/ 2019 . The                         system sets the expiration date automatically if you release a new price                         from a worksheet.

Step 5: Add a Promotional Price and Create a Purchase Order To add a promotional price for the  BLUELINE  vendor and create a purchase                 order, do the following: Add a promotional price of $95/hour for the consulting services as follows: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP202000|AP202000]) Vendor Prices (AP202000) form.

Because the system contains a vendor price for                         this non-stock item for the  BLUELINE  vendor, the system has copied                         this price ($95) to the  Unit Cost  column. This is a                         promotional price for this vendor that you have set up in this step, it is                         effective from                         1/1/ 2019                          to                         3/31/ 2019                          and overrides the regular vendor price defined in the system.

In Acumatica ERP, you can configure and update vendor discounts based on information you have received from each vendor. When you have information on hand about vendor discounts, you can plan your orders more carefully—for instance, by ordering higher volumes less frequently if the vendor offers tiered discounts, by ordering earlier to get promotional discounts, or by adding specific items to orders (instead of placing a separate order for those items) to get a significant group discount.{br}

If the ''Vendor Discounts'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can configure discounts for each vendor. If the ''Inventory and Order Management'' group of features is not enabled on this form, the system automatically applies the best discounts to a bill when the document is being saved. If the ''Inventory and Order Management'' group of features is enabled on this form, the system also applies discounts to purchase orders.((({S:Warn}Cash discounts, which vendors use to encourage your company to pay sooner, are covered in [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__con_Credit_Terms|Setup of Credit Terms].

==Discount Configuration==
In Acumatica ERP, you do the following to configure vendor discounts:[anchor|#_ec7366c8-6a73-4ea7-a14a-4118bb5405d8]
#You design ''discount codes'' by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_40_00|Vendor Discount Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AP204000|AP204000]) form, where for each discount code, you specify the type of the discount and the type of conditions for this discount to be applied. For details, see [HelpRoot_PricesAndDiscounts\AP__con_Vendor_Discount_Codes|Vendor Discount Codes].
#You create ''discount sequences'' for each discount code by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_50_00|Vendor Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AP205000|AP205000]) form. A discount sequence defines the particular discount percent or fixed amount; the sequence also defines the particular conditions of application. For more information, see [HelpRoot_PricesAndDiscounts\AP__con_Vendor_Discount_Sequences|Vendor Discount Sequences].

==Vendor Discounts and Special Prices==
As an alternative to discounts, vendors can offer your organization special prices, which you can enter and maintain on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_20_00|Vendor Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AP202000|AP202000]) or the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_20_10_00|Vendor Inventory] ([~/?ScreenId=PO201000|PO201000]) forms.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
Once you have configured a discount code for your vendor discount, you proceed to setting up specific discount sequences for this code on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_50_00|Vendor Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AP205000|AP205000]) form, that is, to specifying particular values for entities and items to which the discounts will be applied. For each discount code, multiple sequences can be configured.{br}

In Acumatica ERP, the settings you can specify for discount sequences include the discount percent, the discount amount, and the list of entity values to which the discount is applied. Discount sequences can define simple discounts (which are applicable to any amount or quantity) or tiered discounts (for which you can specify different percents or fixed amounts based on the quantities of items or on the amounts).{br}

In this section, you will find information about discount sequences for vendor discounts in Acumatica ERP.{br}{TOC}
==Discount Sequence Settings==
Discount sequences are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_50_00|Vendor Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AP205000|AP205000]) form. Each discount sequence is related to a discount code and inherits its settings. Multiple discount sequences can be defined for a single discount code, that is why each sequence must have a unique identifier. If auto-numbering is enabled for the discount code, when you create a new sequence for this discount code, the system assigns its sequence ID automatically. By default, the discount code is used as a prefix for generating sequence IDs. If auto-numbering is not configured for the discount code, you must enter an identifier for each sequence manually.{br}

For each discount sequence, you specify the following:[anchor|#ul_tqy_dcb_vm]
*Whether the discount is regular or promotional. If the discount is promotional, it is only effective during the date range that you specify. When you mark a discount as promotional, you must specify the start and end dates of the period during which it is effective. Regular discounts—that is, all other discounts that are not marked as promotional—have the start date but do not have an expiration date.
*How the discount is expressed: as a percentage, as an amount, or as a specific quantity of a free item.
*What are the particular entities (such as items, customers, or warehouses) to which the discount can be applied. The applicable entity type or combination of entity types is defined by the discount code, and tabs that apply to the entity type or types specified for the discount code appear on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_50_00|Vendor Discounts] form. For instance, if the discount code was defined for discounts to be applied to items, this form will have the '''Items''' tab, which you can use to list the particular items to which the sequence is applicable.
*How the discount is tiered (if applicable): by amount (for discount codes of all types) or by quantity (for only discount codes of the ''Line'' and ''Group'' types).
*What is the effective (start) date when the sequence can be applied if the discount is promotional.

==Updating Discount Sequences==
A discount sequence can define a ''regular (updatable)'' discount or a ''promotional'' discount.{br}

A promotional discount sequence is effective over a limited time, so this sequence should have an effective (start) date and an expiration date. After the expiration date, the promotional discount is not applicable. To mark a discount sequence as a promotional discount, you select the '''Promotional''' check box in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_50_00|Vendor Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AP205000|AP205000]) form.{br}

A regular sequence—that is, a sequence for which the '''Promotional''' check box is cleared—has only an effective (start) date and does not have an expiration date. You can have the following versions of a regular sequence:[anchor|#_1bb52fef-760d-4616-bfbf-d52610b610d5]
*The current (active) version, which defines the discount currently in effect
*The future (pending) version, which defines the discount to be in effect on the particular date in future
*The previous (last) version, which defines the discount that was in effect before the current discount

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_50_00|Vendor Discounts] form, you can update break amounts or quantities for each sequence by entering new values in the '''Pending Break Amount''' and in either '''Pending Discount Percent''' or '''Pending Discount Amount''' columns; you also enter the new effective date in the '''Pending Date''' column. When the effective date comes, you update the discount sequence by using the '''Update Discounts''' button. After the update, the current sequence version becomes the previous version, and the future version becomes the current one.{br}

If you change properties of multiple discount sequences, you can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_50_25_00|Update Vendor Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AP502500|AP502500]) form to update these sequences at once.
==Updating Discounts Applied to Documents==
For documents with the ''On Hold'' status, you can update discounts, to be sure you are using the most up-to-date discounts in case discounts were updated in the system or new discounts were defined that can be applied to the documents. To update the discounts, you use the '''Recalculate Prices''' dialog box, which opens when you select '''Actions''' > '''Recalculate Prices''' on the form toolbar of the appropriate data entry form, such as [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]). In this dialog box, you can select types of discounts the system will update as follows:[anchor|#ul_mfm_vyf_xdb]
*If you want the system to recalculate discounts in the document, you select the '''Recalculate Discounts''' check box.
*If you want the system to replace manual line-level discounts with the applicable automatic discounts in the document, you select the '''Override Manual Line Discounts''' check box.
*If you want the system to replace manual group-level and document-level discounts with the applicable automatic discounts in the document, you select the '''Override Manual Group and Document Discounts''' check box.

What is the effective (start) date when the sequence can be applied if the discount is      promotional. Updating Discount Sequences A discount sequence can define a  regular (updatable)  discount or a  promotional      discount. A promotional discount sequence is effective over a limited time, so this sequence should have     an effective (start) date and an expiration date. After the expiration date, the promotional     discount is not applicable.

A regular sequence—that is, a sequence for which the  Promotional      check box is cleared—has only an effective (start) date and does not have an expiration     date. You can have the following versions of a regular sequence: The current (active) version, which defines the discount currently in effect The future (pending) version, which defines the discount to be in effect on the particular      date in future The previous (last) version, which defines the discount that was in effect before the      current discount On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP205000|AP205000]) Vendor Discounts form, you can update break amounts or quantities for     each sequence by entering new values in the  Pending Break Amount  and in     either  Pending Discount Percent  or  Pending Discount      Amount  columns; you also enter the new effective date in the  Pending      Date  column. When the effective date comes, you update the discount sequence by     using the  Update Discounts  button. After the update, the current sequence     version becomes the previous version, and the future version becomes the current one. If you change properties of multiple discount sequences, you can use the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP502500|AP502500]) Update Vendor Discounts (AP502500) form to update these sequences at once. Updating Discounts Applied to Documents For documents with the  On Hold  status, you can update discounts, to be sure you are     using the most up-to-date discounts in case discounts were updated in the system or new     discounts were defined that can be applied to the documents.

If the ''Vendor Discounts'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can configure line-level, group-level, and document-level discounts that will be applied to purchase orders. For information on configuring discounts of different types, see the topics of the chapter. This topic explains how Acumatica ERP applies discounts to purchase orders.
==Types of Discounts in Purchase Orders==
When a user enters a purchase order, the system selects and applies the automatic discounts configured in the system in the following order:[anchor|#ul_ltk_fjp_mdb]
#Line-level discounts (which are applied to each line of the document): For each purchase order line, the system finds and applies the line-level discount with the largest discount amount. The system can apply only one (the best) line-level discount to a purchase order line. When the accounts payable bill is prepared for the purchase order, the line discounts are prorated from the purchase order lines to the accounts payable bill lines.
#Group-level discounts (which are applied to multiple lines of the document): The system finds and applies the group-level discount or discounts. (Multiple group discounts can be applied to a purchase order.) The discountable amount for each group discount is calculated as the sum of the extended prices of all lines in the group to which the group discount is applicable. Group discounts are applied in parallel: if multiple group discounts are applicable to the same purchase order lines, each discount is calculated based on the total of these lines, which is not affected by other group discounts. When the accounts payable bill is prepared for the purchase order, group discounts are recalculated in the accounts payable bill according to the line quantity and amount in this bill.
#Document-level discounts (which are applied to the total amount of the document): The system finds the document-level discount with the largest discount amount for the purchase order and applies it. The system can apply only one (the best) document-level discount to a document. When the accounts payable bill is prepared for the purchase order, document discounts are recalculated in the accounts payable bill according to the line quantity and amount in this bill.

Line-level discounts that the system has automatically applied to purchase order lines are shown in the '''Discount Percent''', '''Discount Amount''' and '''Discount Code''' columns on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. Document-level and group-level discounts that were applied to a document are shown on the '''Discount Details''' tab of this form.

When a user saves a document (that is, a sales order or invoice), discounts of all levels are applied to the document automatically, except for the discounts for which the '''Manual''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_40_00|Vendor Discount Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AP204000|AP204000]) form.{br}

Manual discounts in Acumatica ERP can be of two types. The first type is non-configurable discounts, that is, the discounts that are applied by users directly by specifying a discount percentage or amount at the time of creating a document. The second type is configurable discounts. These discounts are set up beforehand and are applied manually by the user by specifying the discount code of this discount.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this section, you will learn:[anchor|#_e8f2b986-7180-4d71-80d3-dc2c62dd8575]
*How to manually apply vendor discounts that have not been configured in the system
*How to configure vendor discounts to be later manually applied to documents

==Applicable Scenarios==
Manual vendor discounts can be applied to AP bills and purchase orders. If the ''Vendor Discounts'' feature is not enabled in the system, a non-configurable manual discount can be applied at a document level and at a line level.{br}

If the ''Vendor Discounts'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, manual discounts can be applied at line, group, and document levels.{br}

Applying discounts to purchase orders is possible only if the ''Inventory and Order Management'' group of features and the ''Inventory'' feature are enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
==Application of Non-Configurable Manual Discounts==
Customer discounts that have not been previously defined in the system can be applied to a document at the following levels:[anchor|#_6f14fad6-4a7d-4bc3-b5c0-66aa702e866b]
*''Line-Level Discounts''. You apply manual line-level discounts to a document on the '''Document Details''' tab of the appropriate form by entering the appropriate percent in the '''Discount Percent''' column or the appropriate amount in the '''Discount Amount''' column and selecting the '''Manual Discount''' check box.
*''Group-Level Discounts'' and ''Document-Level Discounts''. You apply manual group-level and document-level discounts on the '''Discount Details''' tab of the appropriate form by typing the appropriate percent in the '''Discount Percent''' or amount in the '''Discount Amt.''' column and selecting the '''Manual Discount''' check box.
((({S:Warn}If the ''Vendor Discounts'' feature is disabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can enter a discount amount for the entire document manually in the '''Discount Total''' box in the Summary area of an appropriate form.
)))
When a discount is specified as a percentage, its amount value is calculated automatically. The opposite is also true: When a discount is specified as an amount, the system automatically calculates its percent value.
==Application of Configurable Manual Discounts==
Before a user can apply a configurable manual vendor discount to a document, it must first be defined in the system—that is, a discount code and discount sequence must be configured on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_40_00|Vendor Discount Codes] and [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_50_00|Vendor Discounts] forms, respectively. For more information on discount codes and discount sequences for vendor discounts, see [HelpRoot_PricesAndDiscounts\AP__con_Vendor_Discount_Codes|Vendor Discount Codes] and [HelpRoot_PricesAndDiscounts\AP__con_Vendor_Discount_Sequences|Vendor Discount Sequences].{br}

If a discount code is configured on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_40_00|Vendor Discount Codes] form with the '''Manual''' check box selected, the user can apply it manually to a document as follows:[anchor|#_4eeaaeb0-8a79-4f07-9034-16ed576a0c1a]
*''Line-level discounts''. You apply a manual line-level discount on the '''Document Details''' tab of the appropriate form by specifying an existing discount code in the '''Discount Code''' column.
*''Group-level discounts'' and ''document-level discounts''. You apply a manual group-level and document-level discounts on the '''Discount Details''' tab of the appropriate form by specifying an existing discount code in the '''Discount Code''' column and the appropriate discount sequence for this code in the '''Sequence ID''' column.

==Application of External Discounts==
In Acumatica ERP, you can apply to a document discounts that were created in external systems. For external discounts, you can create a discount code on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_40_00|Vendor Discount Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AP204000|AP204000]) form or enter a discount and specify the code of the external discount manually on a document.{br}

If you want to enter an external discount manually, you open the document to which you want to apply the discount on an appropriate entry form (see the list below), and in the '''Discount Amount''' or '''Discount Percent''' column of the '''Discount Details''' tab, you enter the discount. For a discount line with this manually entered external discount, you can type the external discount code (for informational use only) in the '''External Discount Code''' column.{br}

The system applies external discounts in the same way as it does manual document discounts; the system does not recalculate external discounts if there are changes to the document. You can specify manual external discounts for documents created on the following data entry forms:[anchor|#_a317b128-0daf-4b5a-9379-2a8ad5af5a2d]
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000])

Applying discounts to purchase orders is possible only if the  Inventory and Order      Management  group of features and the  Inventory  feature are enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. Application of Non-Configurable Manual Discounts Customer discounts that have not been previously defined in the system can be applied to a     document at the following levels: Line-Level Discounts . You apply manual line-level discounts to a document on the        Document Details  tab of the appropriate form by entering the      appropriate percent in the  Discount Percent  column or the appropriate      amount in the  Discount Amount  column and selecting the  Manual       Discount  check box. Group-Level Discounts  and  Document-Level Discounts . You apply manual      group-level and document-level discounts on the  Discount Details  tab of      the appropriate form by typing the appropriate percent in the  Discount       Percent  or amount in the  Discount Amt.  column and selecting      the  Manual Discount  check box. If the  Vendor Discounts  feature is disabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features     (CS100000) form, you can enter a discount amount for the entire document manually in the       Discount Total  box in the Summary area of an appropriate form. When a discount is specified as a percentage, its amount value is calculated automatically.     The opposite is also true: When a discount is specified as an amount, the system automatically     calculates its percent value. Application of Configurable Manual Discounts Before a user can apply a configurable manual vendor discount to a document, it must first be     defined in the system—that is, a discount code and discount sequence must be configured on the        ([~/?ScreenId=AP204000|AP204000]) Vendor Discount Codes and   ([~/?ScreenId=AP205000|AP205000]) Vendor Discounts forms, respectively. For     more information on discount codes and discount sequences for vendor discounts, see  Vendor Discount Codes and  Vendor Discount Sequences. If a discount code is configured on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP204000|AP204000]) Vendor Discount Codes form with the       Manual  check box selected, the user can apply it manually to a document     as follows: Line-level discounts . You apply a manual line-level discount on the        Document Details  tab of the appropriate form by specifying an existing      discount code in the  Discount Code  column. Group-level discounts  and  document-level discounts . You apply a manual      group-level and document-level discounts on the  Discount Details  tab of      the appropriate form by specifying an existing discount code in the  Discount       Code  column and the appropriate discount sequence for this code in the        Sequence ID  column. Application of External Discounts In  Acumatica ERP,     you can apply to a document discounts that were created in external systems. For external     discounts, you can create a discount code on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP204000|AP204000]) Vendor Discount Codes (AP204000) form     or enter a discount and specify the code of the external discount manually on a document. If you want to enter an external discount manually, you open the document to which you want to     apply the discount on an appropriate entry form (see the list below), and in the       Discount Amount  or  Discount Percent  column of the       Discount Details  tab, you enter the discount. For a discount line with     this manually entered external discount, you can type the external discount code (for     informational use only) in the  External Discount Code  column. The system applies external discounts in the same way as it does manual document discounts;     the system does not recalculate external discounts if there are changes to the document. You can     specify manual external discounts for documents created on the following data entry forms:  ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000)  ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) ]]></column>

In this activity you will manually apply a discount that one of the vendors offers to your organization. 
==Story==
The SweetLife Fruits & Jams company regularly buys billboard design, production, and installation services from one of its vendors, Blueline Advertisement agency (''BLUELINE''). The Blueline account manager has notified you that, as Blueline&rsquo;s preferred customer, you can now order the design of one billboard at a 10% discount. {br}

Also, the billboards you commissioned Blueline to install before the New Year were not installed on time, so your Blueline account manager has also offered you a compensation in the amount of $200 off your next order.{br}

On January 30, 2019, the marketing manager of SweetLife decided to order from Blueline Advertisement the design of a new billboard and the production of two billboards with the new design to be later installed in the city center. You need to create a bill for these items and manually apply the discounts offered by Blueline.
==Process Overview==
You specify a manual line discount or a manual document discount on the Bills and Adjustments form. To specify a manual line discount, on the '''Document Details''' tab, enter either a '''Discount Amount''' or a '''Discount Percent''' for the line. To specify a manual document discount, you enter the amount in the '''Discount Total''' box in the Summary area (if the ''Vendor Discounts'' feature is disabled), and in the '''Discount Amt.''' or '''Discount Percent''' (if the ''Vendor Discounts'' feature is enabled).
==Before You Proceed==
Before you start the exercise, do the following:[anchor|#_9518e56e-9894-425b-87ca-0971f8e35a4c]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as an accountant by using the ''johnson'' login and the ''123'' password.
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''1/30/2019''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button and select ''1/30/2019''. For simplicity, in this lesson, you will create and process all documents in the system on this business date.
#On the company and branch selection menu, which is also on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center'' branch is selected. If it is not selected, click the selection menu to view the list of branches that you have access to, and then click ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center''.

==Create a Bill with Manual Line-Level and Document-Level Discounts==
To create the AP bill for Blueline Advertising (''BLUELINE'') and apply a manual line discount and a manual document discount in it, do the following:[anchor|#_e4c25793-c939-4a48-bf2a-ec3d6ae32145]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record''', and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Type''': ''Bill''
#* '''Vendor''': ''BLUELINE''
#* '''Date''': ''1/30/2019'' (inserted by default)
#*'''Post Period''': ''01-2019''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Design and production of billboards - NY2019</tt>
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, specify the following settings in the new line, and save your changes:
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''BILLBDESIG''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>1</tt>
#*'''Unit Cost''': <tt>1000</tt>
#*'''Discount Percent''': <tt>10</tt>
#*:((({S:Warn}The '''Discount Percent''' field might be hidden from the table, so you might need to select it in the '''Column Configuration''' window.
)))
#:Note that the '''Unit Cost''' is specified because no vendor price is defined for design of a billboard in the system. If you have completed other activities on configuring vendor prices, the prices you configured in those activities might be suggested automatically.
#:Here you have specified a 10% discount applicable only to a billboard design service.
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, specify the following settings in the new line, and save your changes:
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''BILLBPROD''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>2</tt>
#*'''Unit Cost''': <tt>300</tt>
#:Note that the '''Unit Cost''' is specified because no vendor price is defined for the production of billboards in the system. If you have completed other activities on configuring vendor prices, the prices you configured in those activities might be suggested automatically.
#On the '''Discount Details''' tab, in the only row, enter <tt>200</tt> in the '''Discount Amt.''' column.
#:Notice that the '''Discount Total''' box in the Summary area now displays $200, which is the document discount that you have just applied. Line-level discounts decrease the amount of the line they are applied to and are not reflected in the '''Discount Total''' box.

You do not have to save or release the bill. You have started creating it only to see how manual discounts are applied.]]></column>

Vendor discounts are an effective tool that allows you to take advantage of special offerings provided by the vendors you work with. If your vendors offer discounts that are applicable to specific items, you can set up such discounts in Acumatica ERP so that they are automatically applied in AP bills and purchase orders.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this section, you will learn:[anchor|#_e8f2b986-7180-4d71-80d3-dc2c62dd8575]
*How to configure automatic line-level vendor discounts in Acumatica ERP
*How automatic line-level vendor discounts are applied in documents

==Applicable Scenarios==
To configure discounts for vendors, the ''Vendor Discounts'' feature must be enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

You can configure vendor discounts that are automatically applied to lines of documents of various types, including AP bills and purchase orders. Applying discounts to purchase orders is possible only if the ''Inventory and Order Management'' group of features and the ''Inventory'' feature are enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
==Application of Automatic Discounts==
The system always applies automatic discounts in the following order when a user saves a document:[anchor|#ul_ub2_pvd_tm]
#Line-level discounts (which are applied to each line of the document): For each document line, the system checks the applicable line-level discounts and applies the one with the largest discount amount.
#Group-level discounts (which are applied to multiple lines of the document): The system finds the applicable group-level discounts and applies all of them.
#Document-level discounts: The system finds and applies the applicable document-level discount with the largest discount amount for a document. The system can apply only one (the best) document-level discount to the document.

For each line-level discount that you configure on the [https://help-2019r1.acumatica.com/(W(11))/Wiki/ShowWiki|Vendor Discount Codes] form, you can select or clear the '''Exclude from Discountable Amount''' check box, which can affect the calculation and application of discounts. If this check box is selected, the discountable amount of the line-level discount is excluded from the discountable amount for higher-level (group or document) discounts. For example, suppose that your vendor provides a line-level clearance discount of 75% and a document-level discount of 5% for documents with a total of more than $2000. You select this check box if the vendor does not provide an additional document-level discount of 5% to the already-discounted line amounts.]]></column>
			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Automatic Line Vendor Discounts: General Information Vendor discounts are an effective tool that allows you to take advantage of special offerings     provided by the vendors you work with. If your vendors offer discounts that are applicable to     specific items, you can set up such discounts in  Acumatica ERP     so that they are automatically applied in AP bills and purchase orders. Learning Objectives In this section, you will learn: How to configure automatic line-level vendor discounts in  Acumatica ERPHow automatic line-level vendor discounts are applied in documents Applicable Scenarios To configure discounts for vendors, the  Vendor Discounts  feature must be enabled on the        ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. You can configure vendor discounts that are automatically applied to lines of documents of     various types, including AP bills and purchase orders. Applying discounts to purchase orders is     possible only if the  Inventory and Order Management  group of features and the       Inventory  feature are enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000)     form. Application of Automatic Discounts The system always applies automatic discounts in the following order when a user saves a     document: Line-level discounts (which are applied to each line of the document): For each document      line, the system checks the applicable line-level discounts and applies the one with the      largest discount amount. Group-level discounts (which are applied to multiple lines of the document): The system      finds the applicable group-level discounts and applies all of them. Document-level discounts: The system finds and applies the applicable document-level      discount with the largest discount amount for a document. The system can apply only one (the      best) document-level discount to the document. For each line-level discount that you configure on the  Vendor Discount Codes Vendor Discount Codes form, you can select or clear the       Exclude from Discountable Amount  check box, which can affect the     calculation and application of discounts. If this check box is selected, the discountable amount     of the line-level discount is excluded from the discountable amount for higher-level (group or     document) discounts. For example, suppose that your vendor provides a line-level clearance     discount of 75% and a document-level discount of 5% for documents with a total of more than     $2000. You select this check box if the vendor does not provide an additional document-level     discount of 5% to the already-discounted line amounts. ]]></column>

In this lesson you will learn how to configure line-level vendor discounts of different types (applicable to specific items and item price classes) and explore how these discounts are applied in AP bills.
==Story==
Suppose that starting in January 2019, one of your vendors, Blueline Advertising, is offering its preferred customers, including SweetLife Fruits & Jams, the following discounts:[anchor|#_f9bfa244-b529-4a56-97df-02579d03d859]
*A discount of $100 for the design of billboards (that is, the discount is applicable to lines containing the ''BILLBDESIG'' non-stock item)
*A discount of 10% for all services related to the production of billboards (that is, the discount is applicable to lines containing items of the ''BILLBPROD'' item price class)
{br}

On January 30, 2019, SweetLife ordered from Blueline the design of 2 new billboards and the production of 10 billboards in the new design.{br}

Acting as the SweetLife accountant, you need to configure the discounts and then create a bill for Blueline Advertising, noting how these discounts are applied.
==Process Overview==
To configure and apply an automatic line-level vendor discount, you create a discount code on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_40_00|Vendor Discount Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AP204000|AP204000]) form and then configure a discount sequence on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_50_00|Vendor Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AP205000|AP205000]) form.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form, you create an AP bill with lines to which these discounts may be applied. You then review how the discounts you have configured are applied automatically.
==Before You Proceed==
Before you start the exercise, do the following:[anchor|#_9518e56e-9894-425b-87ca-0971f8e35a4c]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as an accountant by using the ''johnson'' login and the ''123'' password.
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''1/30/2019''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button and select ''1/30/2019''. For simplicity, in this lesson, you will create and process all documents in the system on this business date.
#On the company and branch selection menu, also on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center'' branch is selected. If it is not selected, click the selection menu to view the list of branches that you have access to, and then click ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center''.

==Step 1: Create a Line Discount by Amount for a Specific Item==
To configure an automatic discount by amount for the ''BILLBDESIG'' non-stock item purchased from Blueline, do the following:[anchor|#_bde7e5c6-fb86-465b-b5df-7a01cb04b47e]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_40_00|Vendor Discount Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AP204000|AP204000]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add Row''', and specify the following settings in the added row:
#*'''Discount Code''': <tt>LIITA00000</tt>
#*'''Description''': <tt>Automatic line discount for a specific item</tt>
#*'''Discount Type''': ''Line''
#* '''Applicable To''': ''Item''
#* '''Auto-Numbering''': Selected
#:With these settings, discounts configured based on this discount code will be applicable to individual lines containing specific items; because the '''Manual''' check box is cleared, these line discounts will be applied automatically.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_50_00|Vendor Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AP205000|AP205000]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record''', and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Vendor''': ''BLUELINE''
#* '''Discount Code''': ''LIITA00000''
#* '''Discount by''': ''Amount''
#* '''Break by''': ''Amount''
#* '''Active''': Selected
#*'''Description''': <tt>Automatic line discount for a specific item - By Amount</tt>
#:These settings convey that this discount (of the discount code you just defined for line discounts that are applicable to specific items) is by amount.
#On the '''Discount Breakpoints''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the added row:
#*'''Pending Break Amount''': <tt>0</tt>
#*'''Pending Discount Amount''': <tt>100</tt>
#*'''Pending Date''': ''1/1/2019''
#:With these settings, the discount of $100 is applicable to a line containing specific item regardless of the line amount.
#On the '''Items''' tab, click '''Add Row''' and in the '''Inventory ID''' select ''BILLBDESIG''. Since no other items are defined on this tab, this discount will be applied only to the ''BILLBDESIG'' non-stock item.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Update Discounts'''.
#In the '''Update Discounts''' dialog box, which opens, leave the default value (''1/30/2019'') in the '''Filter Date''' box, and click '''OK'''.

==Step 2: Create a Line Discount by Percent for a Specific Item Price Class==
To configure an automatic discount by percent for the items of the ''BILLBOARD'' item price class purchased from Blueline, do the following:[anchor|#_a53b2923-0f86-4a36-8a1a-6f995db4b4f9]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_40_00|Vendor Discount Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AP204000|AP204000]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add Row''', and specify the following settings in the added row:
#*'''Vendor''': ''BLUELINE''
#* '''Discount Code''': <tt>LIITC00000</tt>
#*'''Description''': <tt>Automatic line discount for a specific item price class</tt>
#*'''Discount Type''': ''Line''
#* '''Applicable To''': ''Item Price Class''
#* '''Auto-Numbering''': Selected
#:With these settings, discounts configured based on this discount code will be applicable to individual lines containing items that belong to a particular item price class; because the '''Manual''' check box is cleared, these line discounts will be applied automatically.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_50_00|Vendor Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AP205000|AP205000]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record''', and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Vendor''': ''BLUELINE''
#* '''Discount Code''': ''LIITC00000''
#* '''Discount by''': ''Percent''
#* '''Break by''': ''Amount''
#* '''Active''': Selected
#*'''Description''': <tt>Automatic line discount for an item price class - By Percent</tt>
#:These settings convey that this discount (of the discount code you just defined for line discounts that are applicable to items of a certain item price class) is by percent.
#On the '''Discount Breakpoints''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the added row:
#*'''Pending Break Amount''': <tt>0</tt>
#*'''Pending Discount Amount''': <tt>10</tt>
#*'''Pending Date''': ''1/1/2019''
#:With these settings, the discount of 10% is applicable to a line containing items of a specific price class regardless of the line amount.
#On the '''Item Price Classes''' tab, click '''Add Row''' and in the '''Price Class ID''' select ''BILLBOARD''. Since no other items are defined on this tab, this discount will be applied only to items of the ''BILLBOARD'' item price class.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Update Discounts'''.
#In the '''Update Discounts''' dialog box, which opens, leave the default value (''1/30/2019'') in the '''Filter Date''' box, and click '''OK'''.

==Step 3: Create the AP Bill and Explore Discount Application==
To create the bill for Blueline Advertising and explore how the automatic line discounts are applied, do the following:[anchor|#_9f1e5753-79d9-4292-b5c3-522d666ab716]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record''', and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Type''': ''Bill''
#* '''Vendor''': ''BLUELINE''
#* '''Date''': ''1/30/2019'' (inserted by default)
#*'''Description''': <tt>Design and production of billboards</tt>
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, click '''Add Row''', and specify the following settings in the added row:
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''BILLBDESIG''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>2</tt>
#:The '''Discount Amount''' column contains the $100 discount that you configured in Step 1. The discount has been applied automatically because the line contains the specific item, ''BILLBDESIG''. Notice that the value in the '''Discount Percent''' column, which is 5%, has been calculated automatically.
#On the table toolbar, click '''Add Row''', and specify the following settings in the row:
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''BILLBPROD''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>10</tt>
#:The '''Discount Percent''' column contains the 10% discount that you configured in Step 2. The discount has been applied automatically to this line, because the ''BILLBPROD'' item belongs to the ''BILLBOARD'' item price class to which this discount is applicable.
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and on the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the bill.
#On the '''Financial Details''' tab, click the link in the '''Batch Nbr.''' box to review the GL batch, which the system opens in a pop-up window on the Journal Transactions (GL301000) form. 
#:The ''20000 - Accounts Payable'' account is credited and the ''61000 - Advertising Expense'' account is debited in the amount of the bill.

==Step 4: Make the Created Discounts Inactive==
To make the discounts you created in this activity inactive so that they will not affect other documents later, do the following:[anchor|#_4a5ae1cb-d499-4545-b27d-280870e94946]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_50_00|Vendor Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AP205000|AP205000]) form.
#In the '''Discount Code''' box, select ''LIITA00000''.
#In the '''Sequence''' box, select ''LIITA00000''.
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Active''' check box; save the discount.
#Repeat Instructions 2–3 for the ''LIITC00000'' discount code.

Step 3: Create the AP Bill and Explore Discount Application To create the bill for Blueline Advertising and explore how the automatic line                 discounts are applied, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form. On the form toolbar, click  Add New Record , and specify                     the following settings in the Summary area: Type :  Bill Vendor :  BLUELINE Date :  1/30/2019  (inserted by default) Description :  Design and production of                                 billboards On the  Document Details  tab, click  Add                         Row , and specify the following settings in the added row: Branch :  HEADOFFICE Inventory ID :  BILLBDESIG Quantity :  2 The  Discount Amount  column contains the $100                         discount that you configured in Step 1. The discount has been applied                         automatically because the line contains the specific item,                          BILLBDESIG . Notice that the value in the  Discount                             Percent  column, which is 5%, has been calculated                         automatically. On the table toolbar, click  Add Row , and specify the                     following settings in the row: Branch :  HEADOFFICE Inventory ID :  BILLBPROD Quantity :  10 The  Discount Percent  column contains the 10%                         discount that you configured in Step 2. The discount has been applied                         automatically to this line, because the  BILLBPROD  item belongs to the                              BILLBOARD  item price class to which this discount is                         applicable. In the Summary area, clear the  Hold  check box, and on the                     form toolbar, click  Release  to release the bill. On the  Financial Details  tab, click the link in the                          Batch Nbr.  box to review the GL batch, which the                     system opens in a pop-up window on the Journal Transactions (GL301000) form.                          The  20000 - Accounts Payable  account is credited and the  61000                             - Advertising Expense  account is debited in the amount of the                         bill. Step 4: Make the Created Discounts Inactive To make the discounts you created in this activity inactive so that they will not                 affect other documents later, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP205000|AP205000]) Vendor Discounts (AP205000) form. In the  Discount Code  box, select  LIITA00000 . In the  Sequence  box, select  LIITA00000 . In the Summary area, clear the  Active  check box; save the                     discount.

*How to configure automatic group-level vendor discounts
*How automatic group-level vendor discounts are applied in documents

==Applicable Scenarios==
To configure discounts for vendors, the ''Vendor Discounts'' feature must be enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

You can configure vendor discounts that can be manually applied to multiple lines of documents of various types, including AP bills and purchase orders. Applying discounts to purchase orders is possible only if the ''Inventory and Order Management'' group of features and the ''Inventory'' feature are enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
==Application of Automatic Discounts==
The system always applies automatic discounts in the following order when a user saves a document:[anchor|#ul_ub2_pvd_tm]
#Line-level discounts (which are applied to each line of the document): For each document line, the system checks the applicable line-level discounts and applies the one with the largest discount amount.
#Group-level discounts (which are applied to multiple lines of the document): The system finds the applicable group-level discounts and applies all of them.
#Document-level discounts: The system finds and applies the applicable document-level discount with the largest discount amount for a document. The system can apply only one (the best) document-level discount to the document.

For each group-level discount that you configure on the [https://help-2019r1.acumatica.com/(W(11))/Wiki/ShowWiki|Vendor Discount Codes] form, you can select or clear the '''Skip Document Discount''' check box, which can affect the calculation and application of discounts. If this check box is selected, the system does not apply document-level discounts to a document when this group discount is applied to the document. For example, suppose that the following discounts have been defined: a group-level discount that is applicable to multiple lines and significantly reduces the document total, and a document-level discount. You select this check box if you do not want to apply the document-level discount to the documents to which this group-level discount has been applied.]]></column>

In this activity, you will learn how to configure and apply an automatic vendor discount that is based on the amount or quantity in one line or in a group of document lines.
==Story==
Starting in January 2019, Blueline Advertising introduced a new discounting policy, offering its customers a 10% discount if they order billboard production and installation services worth of $3000 or more.{br}

On January 30, 2019 SweetLife purchased the development of two new billboard designs as well as the production and installation of 6 billboards. Blueline charges 2 billable hours per installation of a single billboard.{br}

Acting as the SweetLife accountant, you first define the group vendor discount. Then you create a bill for Blueline reflecting the purchase, and after that you review how the group discount is applied to the bill.
==Process Overview==
To configure a group-level vendor discount, you create a discount code on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_40_00|Vendor Discount Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AP204000|AP204000]) form and then configure a discount sequence on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_50_00|Vendor Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AP205000|AP205000]) form.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form, you create an AP bill with lines to which these discounts may be applied. You then review how the discounts you have configured are applied automatically.
==Before You Proceed==
Before you start the lesson, do the following:[anchor|#_9518e56e-9894-425b-87ca-0971f8e35a4c]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as an accountant by using the ''johnson'' login and the ''123'' password.
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''01/30/2019''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button and select ''01/30/2019''. For simplicity, in this lesson, you will create and process all documents in the system on this business date.
#On the company and branch selection menu, also on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center'' branch is selected. If it is not selected, click the selection menu to view the list of branches that you have access to, and then click ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center''.

==Step 1: Configure the Group Vendor Discount by Percent==
To configure an automatic group discount by amount for the ''BILLBPROD'' and ''BILLBINSTA'' non-stock items purchased from Blueline, do the following:[anchor|#_bde7e5c6-fb86-465b-b5df-7a01cb04b47e]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_40_00|Vendor Discount Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AP204000|AP204000]) form.
#In the Selection area, in the '''Vendor''' box, select ''BLUELINE''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add Row''', and specify the following settings in the added row:
#*'''Discount Code''': <tt>GRIT00000</tt>
#*'''Description''': <tt>Automatic group discount for specific items</tt>
#*'''Discount Type''': ''Group''
#* '''Applicable To''': ''Item''
#* '''Auto-Numbering''': Selected
#:With these settings, discounts configured based on this discount code will be applicable to groups of lines containing specific items; because the '''Manual''' check box is cleared, these group discounts will be applied automatically.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_50_00|Vendor Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AP205000|AP205000]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record''', and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Vendor''': ''BLUELINE''
#* '''Discount Code''': ''GRIT00000''
#* '''Discount by''': ''Percent''
#* '''Break by''': ''Amount''
#* '''Active''': Selected
#*'''Description''': <tt>Automatic group discount for specific items - By Percent</tt>
#:These settings convey that this discount (of the discount code you just defined for group discounts that are applicable to specific items) is applicable to multiple lines containing specific items and is calculated as a percentage of the amount in these lines.
#On the '''Discount Breakpoints''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the added row:
#*'''Pending Break Amount''': <tt>3000</tt>
#*'''Pending Discount Percent''': <tt>10</tt>
#*'''Pending Date''': ''1/1/2019''
#:With these settings, the discount of 10% is applicable to the document if the amount of a line or a group of lines containing specific items is equal to or more than $3000.
#On the '''Items''' tab, click '''Add Row''' and in the '''Inventory ID''' column select ''BILLBPROD''. Then add another row and in the '''Inventory ID''' column, select ''BILLBINSTA''.
#:These settings imply that the discount will be applied to a document if the amount in all lines containing the ''BILLBPROD'' and ''BILLBINSTA'' non-stock items is larger than $3000.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Update Discounts'''.
#In the '''Update Discounts''' dialog box, which opens, leave the default value (''1/30/2019'') in the '''Filter Date''' box, and click '''OK'''.

==Step 2: Create the AP Bill for Blueline and Explore Discount Application==
To create the bill for Blueline Advertising and explore how the automatic group discount is applied, do the following:[anchor|#_e56e3b53-fc57-4111-8212-6a497cb852b6]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record''', and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Type''': ''Bill''
#* '''Vendor''': ''BLUELINE''
#* '''Date''': ''1/30/2019'' (inserted by default)
#*'''Description''': <tt>Design, production, and installation of billboards - January 2019</tt>
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, click '''Add Row''', and specify the following settings in the added row:
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''BILLBDESIG''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>2</tt>
#*'''Unit Cost''': <tt>1000</tt>
#While you are still on '''Document Details''' tab, add two more rows with the following settings:
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''BILLBPROD''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>6</tt>
#*'''Unit Cost''': <tt>300</tt>
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''BILLBINSTA''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>12</tt>
#*'''Unit Cost''': <tt>80</tt>
#:Notice that the sum of amounts for the ''BILLBPROD'' and ''BILLBINSTA'' items is $2,760, which is less than the break point of the group discount you defined in Step 1, so the discount has not been applied.
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, change the quantity of the ''BILLBPROD'' item to <tt>8</tt>.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Recalculate Prices'''. 
#In the '''Recalculate Prices''' window, which opens, leave the default values and click '''OK'''.
#On the '''Discount Details''' tab, notice that there is now a row corresponding to the group discount you configured in Step 1, with the discount code and discount sequence specified in the '''Discount Code''' and '''Sequence ID''' columns. The '''Discount Percent''' column contains the discount percentage that you have configured in the discount sequence, and the '''Discount Amt.''' is the amount of the discount calculated based on this percentage. The value in the '''Discountable Amt.''' column is the sum of amounts in the lines containing the ''BILLBPROD'' and ''BILLBINSTA'' items, to which the discount has been applied. Notice also that the '''Discount Total''' box of the Summary area 
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and on the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the bill.
#On the '''Financial Details''' tab, click the link in the '''Batch Nbr.''' box to review the GL batch, which the system opens in a pop-up window on the Journal Transactions (GL301000) form. 
#:The ''20000 - Accounts Payable'' account is credited and the ''61000 - Advertising Expense'' account is debited in the amount of the bill. Notice that the discount applied to the group of lines is credited to the ''49000 - Discount Taken'' account.

==Step 3: Make the Created Discounts Inactive==
To make the discounts you created in this activity inactive so that they will not affect other documents later, do the following:[anchor|#_4a5ae1cb-d499-4545-b27d-280870e94946]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_50_00|Vendor Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AP205000|AP205000]) form.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Automatic Group Vendor Discounts: Implementation Activity In this activity, you will learn how to configure and apply an automatic vendor                 discount that is based on the amount or quantity in one line or in a group of                 document lines. Story Starting in January 2019, Blueline Advertising introduced a new discounting policy,                 offering its customers a 10% discount if they order billboard production and                 installation services worth of $3000 or more. On January 30, 2019 SweetLife purchased the development of two new billboard designs                 as well as the production and installation of 6 billboards. Blueline charges 2                 billable hours per installation of a single billboard. Acting as the SweetLife accountant, you first define the group vendor discount. Then                 you create a bill for Blueline reflecting the purchase, and after that you review                 how the group discount is applied to the bill. Process Overview To configure a group-level vendor discount, you create a discount code on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP204000|AP204000]) Vendor Discount Codes (AP204000) form and then configure a discount sequence                 on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP205000|AP205000]) Vendor Discounts (AP205000) form. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form, you create an AP bill with                 lines to which these discounts may be applied. You then review how the discounts you                 have configured are applied automatically. Before You Proceed Before you start the lesson, do the following: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as an accountant by using the  johnson  login and                     the  123  password. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to                          01/30/2019 . If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date                     menu button and select  01/30/2019 . For simplicity, in this lesson, you                     will create and process all documents in the system on this business date. On the company and branch selection menu, also on the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the  SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center                      branch is selected. If it is not selected, click the selection menu to view the                     list of branches that you have access to, and then click  SweetLife Head                         Office and Wholesale Center . Step 1: Configure the Group Vendor Discount by Percent To configure an automatic group discount by amount for the  BILLBPROD  and                      BILLBINSTA  non-stock items purchased from Blueline, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP204000|AP204000]) Vendor Discount Codes (AP204000) form. In the Selection area, in the  Vendor  box, select                          BLUELINE . On the form toolbar, click  Add Row , and specify the                     following settings in the added row: Discount Code :                              GRIT00000 Description :  Automatic group discount                                 for specific items Discount Type :  Group Applicable To :  Item Auto-Numbering : Selected With these settings, discounts configured based on this discount code                         will be applicable to groups of lines containing specific items; because the                              Manual  check box is cleared, these group                         discounts will be applied automatically. On the form toolbar, click  Save . Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP205000|AP205000]) Vendor Discounts (AP205000) form. On the form toolbar, click  Add New Record , and specify                     the following settings in the Summary area: Vendor :  BLUELINE Discount Code :  GRIT00000 Discount by :  Percent Break                                 by :  Amount Active : Selected Description :  Automatic group discount                                 for specific items - By Percent These settings convey that this discount (of the discount code you just                         defined for group discounts that are applicable to specific items) is                         applicable to multiple lines containing specific items and is calculated as                         a percentage of the amount in these lines. On the  Discount Breakpoints  tab, click  Add                         Row  on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in                     the added row: Pending Break Amount :                              3000 Pending Discount Percent :                                  10 Pending Date :  1/1/2019 With these settings, the discount of 10% is applicable to the document                         if the amount of a line or a group of lines containing specific items is                         equal to or more than $3000. On the  Items  tab, click  Add Row                      and in the  Inventory ID  column select  BILLBPROD .                     Then add another row and in the  Inventory ID  column,                     select  BILLBINSTA . These settings imply that the discount will be                         applied to a document if the amount in all lines containing the                              BILLBPROD  and  BILLBINSTA  non-stock items is larger than                         $3000. On the form toolbar, click  Save . On the form toolbar, click  Update Discounts . In the  Update Discounts  dialog box, which opens, leave                     the default value ( 1/30/2019 ) in the  Filter Date                      box, and click  OK . Step 2: Create the AP Bill for Blueline and Explore Discount Application To create the bill for Blueline Advertising and explore how the automatic group                 discount is applied, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form. On the form toolbar, click  Add New Record , and specify                     the following settings in the Summary area: Type :  Bill Vendor :  BLUELINE Date :  1/30/2019  (inserted by default) Description :  Design, production, and                                 installation of billboards - January 2019 On the  Document Details  tab, click  Add                         Row , and specify the following settings in the added row: Branch :  HEADOFFICE Inventory ID :  BILLBDESIG Quantity :  2 Unit Cost :  1000 While you are still on  Document Details  tab, add two more                     rows with the following settings: Branch :  HEADOFFICE Inventory ID :  BILLBPROD Quantity :  6 Unit Cost :  300 Branch :  HEADOFFICE Inventory ID :  BILLBINSTA Quantity :  12 Unit Cost :  80 Notice that the sum of amounts for the  BILLBPROD  and                              BILLBINSTA  items is $2,760, which is less than the break point of                         the group discount you defined in Step 1, so the discount has not been                         applied. On the  Document Details  tab, change the quantity of the                          BILLBPROD  item to  8 . On the form toolbar, click  Actions Recalculate Prices .  In the  Recalculate Prices  window, which opens, leave the                     default values and click  OK . On the  Discount Details  tab, notice that there is now a                     row corresponding to the group discount you configured in Step 1, with the                     discount code and discount sequence specified in the  Discount                         Code  and  Sequence ID  columns. The                          Discount Percent  column contains the discount                     percentage that you have configured in the discount sequence, and the                          Discount Amt.  is the amount of the discount                     calculated based on this percentage. The value in the  Discountable                         Amt.  column is the sum of amounts in the lines containing the                          BILLBPROD  and  BILLBINSTA  items, to which the discount has been                     applied. Notice also that the  Discount Total  box of the                     Summary area  In the Summary area, clear the  Hold  check box, and on the                     form toolbar, click  Release  to release the bill. On the  Financial Details  tab, click the link in the                          Batch Nbr.  box to review the GL batch, which the                     system opens in a pop-up window on the Journal Transactions (GL301000) form.                          The  20000 - Accounts Payable  account is credited and the  61000                             - Advertising Expense  account is debited in the amount of the bill.                         Notice that the discount applied to the group of lines is credited to the                              49000 - Discount Taken  account. Step 3: Make the Created Discounts Inactive To make the discounts you created in this activity inactive so that they will not                 affect other documents later, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP205000|AP205000]) Vendor Discounts (AP205000) form. In the  Discount Code  box, select  GRIT00000 . In the  Sequence  box, select  GRIT00000 . In the Summary area, clear the  Active  check box; save the                     discount. ]]></column>

Vendor discounts are an effective tool that allows you to take advantage of special offerings provided by the vendors you work with. If your vendors offer discounts that are applicable to specific items, you can set up such discounts in Acumatica ERP so that they are automatically applied in AP bills and purchase orders. An automatic document discount, as the name suggests, is applied automatically to an entire document.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this section, you will learn:[anchor|#_e6293614-47c1-427b-a8bd-fa002d6714bb]
*How to configure automatic document-level vendor discounts
*How automatic document-level vendor discounts are applied to documents

==Applicable Scenarios==
To configure discounts for vendors, the ''Vendor Discounts'' feature must be enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

You can configure customer discounts that are automatically applied to lines of documents of various types, including AP bills and purchase orders. Applying discounts to purchase orders is possible only if the ''Inventory and Order Management'' group of features and the ''Inventory'' feature are enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
==Other Configuration Settings==
Make sure that the following settings are configured in the system:{br}

The vendors for which you plan to define discounts in Acumatica ERP have been configured on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form.{br}

For item-specific discounts, the non-stock and stock items for which you plan to define discounts have been configured on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form and [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, respectively.
==Application of Automatic Discounts==
The system always applies automatic discounts in the following order when a user saves a document:[anchor|#ul_ub2_pvd_tm]
#Line-level discounts (which are applied to each line of the document): For each document line, the system checks the applicable line-level discounts and applies the one with the largest discount amount.
#Group-level discounts (which are applied to multiple lines of the document): The system finds the applicable group-level discounts and applies all of them.
#Document-level discounts: The system finds and applies the applicable document-level discount with the largest discount amount for a document. The system can apply only one (the best) document-level discount to the document.

In this activity, you will learn how to configure an automatic document discount, and you will explore how it is applied to a AP bill.
==Story==
Suppose that starting in January 2019, Blueline Advertising provides its most valued customers, including SweetLife, an unconditional discount of 3% that is applied to any order.{br}

On January 30, 2019 SweetLife purchased the installation of 10 billboards from Blueline (which is equivalent to 20 hours of billable work).{br}

Acting as the SweetLife accountant, you need to define the 3% discount. You then need to create a bill for Blueline for the purchased billboard installation services.
==Process Overview==
You configure a discount code on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_40_00|Vendor Discount Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AP204000|AP204000]) form and then configure a discount sequence on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_50_00|Vendor Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AP205000|AP205000]) form.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form, you create an AP bill to which the discount may be applied. You then review the '''Discount Details''' tab of the form and review how the discount is applied.
==Before You Proceed==
Before you start the activity, do the following:[anchor|#_9518e56e-9894-425b-87ca-0971f8e35a4c]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as an accountant by using the ''johnson'' login and the ''123'' password.
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''1/30/2019''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button and select ''1/30/2019''. For simplicity, in this lesson, you will create and process all documents in the system on this business date.
#On the company and branch selection menu, also on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center'' branch is selected.

==Step 1: Create an Unconditional Document Discount by Percent==
To configure an unconditional document discount by percent, do the following:[anchor|#_bde7e5c6-fb86-465b-b5df-7a01cb04b47e]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_40_00|Vendor Discount Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AP204000|AP204000]) form.

#*'''Discount Type''': ''Document''
#* '''Applicable To''': ''Unconditional''
#* '''Auto-Numbering''': Selected
#:With these settings, discounts configured based on this discount code will be applicable to a document as a whole; because the '''Manual''' check box is cleared, these document discounts will be applied automatically.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_50_00|Vendor Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AP205000|AP205000]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record''', and specify the following settings in the Summary area:

#*'''Pending Break Amount''': <tt>0</tt>
#*'''Pending Discount Percent''': <tt>5</tt>

#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Update Discounts'''.
#In the '''Update Discounts''' dialog box, which opens, leave the default value (''1/30/2019'') in the '''Filter Date''' box, and click '''OK'''.

==Step 2: Create the AP Bill and Explore Discount Application==
To create the bill for Blueline Advertising and explore how the automatic document discount is applied, do the following:[anchor|#_9f1e5753-79d9-4292-b5c3-522d666ab716]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record''', and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Type''': ''Bill''
#* '''Vendor''': ''BLUELINE''
#* '''Date''': ''1/30/2019'' (inserted by default)
#*'''Description''': <tt>Billboard installation - January 2019</tt>

#* '''Inventory ID''': ''BILLBINSTA''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>20</tt>
#*'''UOM''': ''HOUR''
#* '''Unit Cost''': 80
#:Notice that the '''Discount Total''' box of the Summary area of the form now has the value of $48, which is the amount of the unconditional discount which has been automatically applied to the bill as this discount is effective for any documents for Blueline.
#On the '''Discount Details''' tab, notice that the '''Discount Code''' column contains the ''DOCUN00000'' value, which is the vendor discount code for the unconditional document discount that you have configured in Step 1, and the '''Sequence ID''' column contains the ID of the discount sequence, which you also have configured in Step 1. The '''Discount Percent''' is 3%, which you have specified in the discount sequence. Note that the discount amount was calculated automatically and is now reflected in the '''Discount Amt.''' column.
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and on the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the bill.
#On the '''Financial Details''' tab, click the link in the '''Batch Nbr.''' box to review the GL batch, which the system opens in a pop-up window on the Journal Transactions (GL301000) form. 
#:The ''20000 - Accounts Payable'' account is credited and the ''61000 - Advertising Expense'' account is debited in the amount of the bill. Notice that the discount applied to the entire document is credited to the ''49000 - Discount Taken'' account.

==Step 3: Make the Created Discounts Inactive==
To make the discounts you created in this activity inactive so that they will not affect other documents later, do the following:[anchor|#_4a5ae1cb-d499-4545-b27d-280870e94946]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_50_00|Vendor Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AP205000|AP205000]) form.
#In the '''Discount Code''' box, select ''LIITA00000''.
#In the '''Sequence''' box, select ''LIITA00000''.
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Active''' check box; save the discount.
#Repeat Instructions 2–3 for the ''LIITC00000'' discount code.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Automatic Document Vendor Discounts: Implementation Activity In this activity, you will learn how to configure an automatic document discount, and                 you will explore how it is applied to a AP bill. Story Suppose that starting in January 2019, Blueline Advertising provides its most valued                 customers, including SweetLife, an unconditional discount of 3% that is applied to                 any order. On January 30, 2019 SweetLife purchased the installation of 10 billboards from                 Blueline (which is equivalent to 20 hours of billable work). Acting as the SweetLife accountant, you need to define the 3% discount. You then need                 to create a bill for Blueline for the purchased billboard installation services. Process Overview You configure a discount code on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP204000|AP204000]) Vendor Discount Codes (AP204000) form                 and then configure a discount sequence on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP205000|AP205000]) Vendor Discounts                 (AP205000) form. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form, you create an AP bill to                 which the discount may be applied. You then review the  Discount                     Details  tab of the form and review how the discount is applied. Before You Proceed Before you start the activity, do the following: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as an accountant by using the  johnson  login and                     the  123  password. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to                          1/30/2019 . If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date                     menu button and select  1/30/2019 . For simplicity, in this lesson, you                     will create and process all documents in the system on this business date. On the company and branch selection menu, also on the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the  SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center                      branch is selected. If it is not selected, click the selection menu to view the                     list of branches that you have access to, and then click  SweetLife Head                         Office and Wholesale Center .

*How to configure promotional vendor discounts in Acumatica ERP
*How manual promotional vendor discounts are applied in documents

==Applicable Scenarios==
To configure discounts for vendors, the ''Vendor Discounts'' feature must be enabled on the Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form.{br}

You can configure vendor discounts that can be manually applied to various types of documents, including AP bills and purchase orders. Applying discounts to purchase orders is possible only if the ''Inventory and Order Management'' group of features and the ''Inventory'' feature are enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
==Configuration of Promotional Discounts==
A promotional discount sequence is effective over a limited time, so this sequence should have an effective (start) date and an expiration date. After the expiration date, the promotional discount is no longer applicable.{br}

Promotional discounts are configured in a similar way to regular discounts. That is, you first configure a discount code on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_40_00|Vendor Discount Codes] form and then set up a discount sequence for the code on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_50_00|Vendor Discounts] form. To indicate that a discount is promotional and should only be effective for a limited time, you select the '''Promotional''' check box. When the check box is selected, another required box, '''Expiration Date''', appears on the form. You must specify the expiration (end) date for the promotional discount to save it.{br}

Promotional discounts can be configured to be applied either manually or automatically. To indicate that a discount should be applied to a document manually by the user, when configuring a discount code on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_40_00|Vendor Discount Codes] form, you select the check box in the '''Manual''' column.{br}

Unlike regular discounts, for which you first specify pending values on the '''Discount Breakpoints''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_50_00|Vendor Discounts] form and then updating the sequence (either by using the '''Update Discounts''' button on the form toolbar or by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_50_25_00|Update Vendor Discounts] form) to make it active, promotional discounts do not need to be updated to become effective.]]></column>

In this activity, you will learn how to configure and apply a promotional vendor discount. 
==Story==
Suppose that in December 2019, SweetLife&rsquo;s procurement manager attended an exhibition, where sales representatives of Blueline Advertising offered all prospective and existing customers a 15% discount on billboard design services. The discount is effective only for purchases made in December and January 2019.{br}

On January 15, 2019 SweetLife&rsquo;s marketing manager wants to take advantage of this opportunity and purchases the design of 3 new billboards.{br}

As the SweetLife accountant, you need to define this discount in the system. Also, you need to create a bill for Blueline reflecting this purchase, and then apply the discount.
==Process Overview==
You configure a discount code on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_40_00|Vendor Discount Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AP204000|AP204000]) form and then configure a discount sequence on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_50_00|Vendor Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AP205000|AP205000]) form.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form, you create an AP bill with a line for the design of 3 new billboards to which the discount may be applied. You then manually apply the promotional discount to the document line.
==Before You Proceed==
Before you start the activity, do the following:[anchor|#_9518e56e-9894-425b-87ca-0971f8e35a4c]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as an accountant by using the ''johnson'' login and the ''123'' password.
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''1/30/2019''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button and select ''1/30/2019''. For simplicity, in this lesson, you will create and process all documents in the system on this business date.
#On the company and branch selection menu, also on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center'' branch is selected. If it is not selected, click the selection menu to view the list of branches that you have access to, and then click ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center''.

==Step 1: Configure the Manual Promotional Discount==
To configure the promotional vendor discount, do the following:[anchor|#_bde7e5c6-fb86-465b-b5df-7a01cb04b47e]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_40_00|Vendor Discount Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AP204000|AP204000]) form.
#In the Selection area, in the '''Vendor''' box, select ''BLUELINE''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add Row''', and specify the following settings in the added row:
#*'''Discount Code''': <tt>LIITP00000</tt>
#*'''Description''': <tt>Promotional discount for a specific item</tt>
#*'''Discount Type''': ''Line''
#* '''Applicable To''': ''Item''
#* '''Auto-Numbering''': Selected
#:With these settings, discounts configured based on this discount code will be applicable to individual lines containing specific items; because the '''Manual''' check box is cleared, the discounts based on this code will be applied to documents automatically.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_50_00|Vendor Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AP205000|AP205000]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record''', and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Vendor''': ''BLUELINE''
#* '''Discount Code''': ''LIITP00000''
#* '''Discount by''': ''Percent''
#* '''Break by''': ''Amount''
#* '''Active''': Selected
#*'''Description''': <tt>Manual promotional discount for an item - By percent</tt>
#*'''Effective Date''': ''12/1/2018''
#* '''Expiration Date''': ''1/31/2019''
#:These settings convey that this discount is promotional—that is, it is effective only a specified period of time (from December 1, 2018 to January 31, 2019) and is calculated as a percentage of the line amount.
#On the '''Discount Breakpoints''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the added row:
#*'''Break Amount''': <tt>0</tt>
#*'''Discount Amount''': <tt>15</tt>
#:With these settings, the discount of 15% is applicable to a line regardless of the line amount.
#On the '''Items''' tab, click '''Add Row''' and in the '''Inventory ID''' select ''BILLBDESIG''. Since no other items are defined on this tab, this discount will be applied only to the ''BILLBDESIG'' non-stock item.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

==Step 2: Create the AP Bill for Blueline Advertising and Review Discount Application==
To create the AP bill for Blueline and apply the promotional discount to it, do the following:[anchor|#_9f1e5753-79d9-4292-b5c3-522d666ab716]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record''', and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Type''': ''Bill''
#* '''Vendor''': ''BLUELINE''
#* '''Date''': ''1/30/2019'' (inserted by default)
#*'''Description''': <tt>Billboard design: 3 designs, January</tt>
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, click '''Add Row''', and specify the following settings in the added row:
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''BILLBDESIG''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>3</tt>
#*'''UOM''': ''PIECE''
#* '''Unit Cost''': 1000
#:The '''Discount Percent''' column in the row contains the promotional 15% discount, which you configured in Step 1. The value of the discount amount, which is reflected in the '''Discount Amount''', has been calculated automatically based on the discount percentage. Notice that the '''Discount Total''' box of the Summary area is 0. This is because, unlike group- or document-level discounts, line-level discounts only decrease line amounts and are not accounted for separately (that is, in a specific account designated for this purpose).
#In the Summary area of the Bills and Adjustments form, change the date in the '''Date''' box to ''2/1/2019''.
#In the form toolbar, select '''Actions''' > '''Recalculate Prices'''.
#In the '''Recalculate Prices''' window, which opens, leave the default values and click '''OK'''.
#:Notice that the '''Discount Percent''' and '''Discount Amount''' columns now show zeroes, because the promotional discount is effective only until January 31 and cannot be applied to documents created after that date.

==Step 3: Make the Created Discount Inactive==
To make the discounts you created in this activity inactive so that they will not affect other documents later, do the following:[anchor|#_4a5ae1cb-d499-4545-b27d-280870e94946]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_50_00|Vendor Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AP205000|AP205000]) form.
#In the '''Discount Code''' box, select ''LIITP00000''.
#In the '''Sequence''' box, select ''LIITP00000''.
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Active''' check box; save the discount.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Promotional Vendor Discounts: Implementation Activity In this activity, you will learn how to configure and apply a promotional vendor                 discount.  Story Suppose that in December 2019, SweetLife's procurement manager attended an                 exhibition, where sales representatives of Blueline Advertising offered all                 prospective and existing customers a 15% discount on billboard design services. The                 discount is effective only for purchases made in December and January 2019. On January 15, 2019 SweetLife's marketing manager wants to take advantage of this                 opportunity and purchases the design of 3 new billboards. As the SweetLife accountant, you need to define this discount in the system. Also,                 you need to create a bill for Blueline reflecting this purchase, and then apply the                 discount. Process Overview You configure a discount code on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP204000|AP204000]) Vendor Discount Codes (AP204000) form                 and then configure a discount sequence on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP205000|AP205000]) Vendor Discounts                 (AP205000) form. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form, you create an AP bill with a                 line for the design of 3 new billboards to which the discount may be applied. You                 then manually apply the promotional discount to the document line. Before You Proceed Before you start the activity, do the following: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as an accountant by using the  johnson  login and                     the  123  password. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to                          1/30/2019 . If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date                     menu button and select  1/30/2019 . For simplicity, in this lesson, you                     will create and process all documents in the system on this business date. On the company and branch selection menu, also on the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the  SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center                      branch is selected. If it is not selected, click the selection menu to view the                     list of branches that you have access to, and then click  SweetLife Head                         Office and Wholesale Center . Step 1: Configure the Manual Promotional Discount To configure the promotional vendor discount, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP204000|AP204000]) Vendor Discount Codes (AP204000) form. In the Selection area, in the  Vendor  box, select                          BLUELINE . On the form toolbar, click  Add Row , and specify the                     following settings in the added row: Discount Code :                              LIITP00000 Description :  Promotional discount for                                 a specific item Discount Type :  Line Applicable To :  Item Auto-Numbering : Selected With these settings, discounts configured based on this discount code                         will be applicable to individual lines containing specific items; because                         the  Manual  check box is cleared, the discounts based                         on this code will be applied to documents automatically. On the form toolbar, click  Save . Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP205000|AP205000]) Vendor Discounts (AP205000) form. On the form toolbar, click  Add New Record , and specify                     the following settings in the Summary area: Vendor :  BLUELINE Discount Code :  LIITP00000 Discount by :  Percent Break                                 by :  Amount Active : Selected Description :  Manual promotional                                 discount for an item - By percent Effective Date :  12/1/2018 Expiration Date :  1/31/2019 These settings convey that this discount is promotional—that is, it is                         effective only a specified period of time (from December 1, 2018 to January                         31, 2019) and is calculated as a percentage of the line amount. On the  Discount Breakpoints  tab, click  Add                         Row  on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in                     the added row: Break Amount :  0 Discount Amount :  15 With these settings, the discount of 15% is applicable to a line                         regardless of the line amount. On the  Items  tab, click  Add Row                      and in the  Inventory ID  select  BILLBDESIG . Since                     no other items are defined on this tab, this discount will be applied only to                     the  BILLBDESIG  non-stock item. On the form toolbar, click  Save . Step 2: Create the AP Bill for Blueline Advertising and Review Discount                 Application To create the AP bill for Blueline and apply the promotional discount to it, do the                 following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form. On the form toolbar, click  Add New Record , and specify                     the following settings in the Summary area: Type :  Bill Vendor :  BLUELINE Date :  1/30/2019  (inserted by default) Description :  Billboard design: 3                                 designs, January On the  Document Details  tab, click  Add                         Row , and specify the following settings in the added row: Branch :  HEADOFFICE Inventory ID :  BILLBDESIG Quantity :  3 UOM :  PIECE Unit Cost : 1000 The  Discount Percent  column in the row contains                         the promotional 15% discount, which you configured in Step 1. The value of                         the discount amount, which is reflected in the  Discount                             Amount , has been calculated automatically based on the                         discount percentage. Notice that the  Discount Total                          box of the Summary area is 0. This is because, unlike group- or                         document-level discounts, line-level discounts only decrease line amounts                         and are not accounted for separately (that is, in a specific account                         designated for this purpose). In the Summary area of the Bills and Adjustments form, change the date in the                          Date  box to  2/1/2019 . In the form toolbar, select  Actions Recalculate Prices . In the  Recalculate Prices  window, which opens, leave the                     default values and click  OK .

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
Vendors you purchase from can offer ''simple'' discounts, which are applicable to any amount or quantity, or ''volume (or tiered)'' discounts, which may apply based on the quantities of items or on the amounts in documents.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this section, you will learn:[anchor|#_e8f2b986-7180-4d71-80d3-dc2c62dd8575]
*How to configure volume vendor discounts based on the ordered quantities or amounts
*How automatic volume vendor discounts are applied when you save new documents

==Applicable Scenarios==
To configure discounts for vendors, the ''Vendor Discounts'' feature must be enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

You can configure customer discounts that are automatically applied to lines of documents of various types, including AP bills and purchase orders. Applying discounts to purchase orders is possible only if the ''Inventory and Order Management'' group of features and the ''Inventory'' feature are enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
==Tiered Discounts==
In a sequence, you can configure a simple discount, which is applicable to any amount or quantity, or a tiered discount, for which you can specify different percents or fixed amounts based on the quantities of items or on the amounts. To configure tiers for a discount, you specify the break points that define the ranges of amounts or quantities for which different discount percentages, amounts, or quantities of free items are applicable.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_50_00|Vendor Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AP205000|AP205000]) form, the following parameters can be used as a basis for break points for discounts applied at different levels:[anchor|#_1956a5ac-d624-482d-b5b6-75ff78d68ad4]
*For line- or group-level discounts, you can configure tiers based on the amounts or quantities.
*For document-level discounts, tiers can only be based on the document amounts.

Below you can find examples of discount sequences. For these examples, assume that the appropriate discount codes have been defined.{br}

'''Example 1: A Simple Discount Sequence'''{br}

Suppose that Vendor A gives your organization a permanent discount of 10% per order. To set up this discount in Acumatica ERP, you create a discount sequence and on the '''Discount Breakpoints''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_50_00|Vendor Discounts] form, you add a break point with the following values.[anchor|#_e4a8972a-fdb7-45c8-94af-7c510eabda70]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="50%" ! Break Amount
!width="50%" ! Discount Percent
|- 
| 0
| 10
|}
'''Example 2: A Discount Sequence Based on Quantity'''{br}

Suppose that your organization buys computer equipment from Vendor B, and this vendor provides your organization with a discount for keyboards based on the ordered quantity. You create a discount sequence, and you add break points with the following settings on the '''Discount Breakpoints''' tab.[anchor|#_577b40fd-5bd4-416b-92e2-5a3a4e923b8d]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="50%" ! Break Quantity
!width="50%" ! Discount Percent
|- 
| 100
| 5
|- 
| 200
| 7
|- 
| 300
| 10
|}
'''Example 3: A Discount Sequence Based on Amount'''{br}

Suppose that Vendor C provides your organization with a fixed-amount discount based on the document total; that is, it does not matter which goods or services you buy from this vendor. You create a discount sequence, and you add the break points with the following settings on the '''Discount Breakpoints''' tab.[anchor|#_4bec437b-d60f-4aab-9637-849c7cdfff2a]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="50%" ! Break Amount
!width="50%" ! Discount Amount
|- 
| $1000
| $10
|- 
| $2000
| $25
|- 
| $3000
| $40
|}
==Calculation of Document-Level Discounts with Tiers Defined by Amounts==
For document-level discounts, which are unconditional, the discount tiers can be created only by break points defined as amounts, and the discount can be defined as a percentage of the document amount or as a fixed amount. When the system processes a purchase order or bill and finds a qualifying discount sequence, the discountable amount is compared to the break points in the discount sequence as follows:[anchor|#ul_yj2_grq_tm]
#The document amount is compared to the first break point. If the document amount is less than the amount of the first break point in the sequence, the discount equals zero, and further comparison is not performed.
#The document amount is compared to the next break point. If the document amount is greater than or equal to the amount of this break point but less than the amount of the next break point (or greater than the amount of the last break point), the system calculates the discount as follows:
#*If the discount is a fixed amount, the fixed amount specified as a discount for this tier is deducted from the document amount.
#*If the discount is a percentage, the percent (specified for this tier) of the document amount is calculated and deducted from the document amount.
#Comparison continues similarly, with Step 2 repeated until a discount is found or the last break point is checked.

The examples below illustrate the way these document-level discounts are calculated.{br}

'''Example 1''': If a sequence for a document-level discount has tiers defined by amounts and the discounts are expressed as percentages, the discount amount corresponding to the appropriate tier is subtracted from the document total. Suppose that the sequence is specified with the following break points:[anchor|#ul_hk2_grq_tm]
*$1000: 5%
*$2000: 7%
*$5000: 10%

For a document with a $900 total, the discount is $0. For a document with a $2500 total, the discount is $175 (7%), and for a document with a total of $9000, the discount is $900 (10%).{br}

'''Example 2''': Suppose that a sequence for a document-level discount has tiers defined by amounts, with the discounts expressed as fixed amounts that are subtracted from the total amount of the document. Further suppose that the sequence is specified with the following break points:[anchor|#ul_pnd_frq_tm]
*$1000: $100
*$2000: $225
*$3000: $350

For purchase orders with amounts less than $1000, your company receives a discount of $0. The discount for an order with a total between $1000 and $1999.99 is $100, the discount on an order between $2000 and $2999.99 is $225, and the discount for an order of $3000 or more is $350.
==Calculation of Line-Level Discounts for Tiers Defined by Amounts==
The tiers for line-level discounts can be defined by amounts or by quantities. The method of calculation of line-level discounts depends on whether the discount should be applied to the unit prices of items or to the extended prices of the items. Based on the information received from each vendor, you select the appropriate option in the '''Apply Line-Discounts to''' box on the '''Calculation Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_40_00|Vendor Discount Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AP204000|AP204000]) form for this vendor.{br}

'''Line Discounts Applied to Unit Prices'''{br}

The system calculates line discounts applied to unit prices as follows:[anchor|#ol_mpl_tsr_tm]
#The line item&rsquo;s price is compared to the first break point. If the item price is less than the first break point in the sequence, the discount equals $0, and further comparison is not performed.
#The item price is compared to the next break point. If the price is greater than or equal to this break point but less than the next break point (or greater than the last break point), the system calculates the discount as follows:
#*If the discount is a fixed amount, the fixed amount specified as a discount for this tier is deducted from the item price, and the extended price is recalculated.
#*If the discount is a percentage, the percent (specified for this tier) of the item price is calculated and deducted from the item price.
#Comparison continues similarly, with Step 2 repeated until a discount is found or the last break point has been reached.

For the particular vendor, if the discounts should be applied to item prices and a sequence is broken down by the quantity of the item, the line quantity of the item is compared to the quantities selected as break points, and the discount is calculated as follows:[anchor|#ul_cgl_z2s_tm]
*If the discount is defined as a percentage, the specified percent is deducted from the item price, and then the discounted price is multiplied by the line quantity.
*If the discount is defined as a fixed amount, the specified fixed amount is deducted from the item price and then the discounted price is multiplied by the line quantity.

'''Example 4''': Your company buys different items with the prices $95, $210, and $600 from the same vendor in the same purchase order. If a sequence for a line-level discount has tiers defined by amounts with the discounts expressed as percentages, the discount amount is calculated as the percent (defined for the appropriate tier) of the item price and is subtracted from the price. Suppose that the sequence is specified with the following break points:[anchor|#ul_vkt_5ms_tm]
*$100: 5%
*$200: 10%
*$500: 20%

For a line with 10 units of the item priced at $95, the discount will be $0. For a line with 20 units of the item priced at $210, the discount will be $21.0 (10%) per unit with a discount for the line of $420. And for a line with one $600 item, the discount will be $120.{br}

'''Line Discounts Applied to Extended Prices'''{br}

If the system is configured to apply line discounts to the extended prices of items and the tiers are defined by line amounts, the system calculates discounts as follows:[anchor|#ol_x4k_ppr_tm]
#The line amount (that is, the extended price of the item) is compared to the first break point. If the amount is less than the first break point in the sequence, the discount equals $0, and no further comparison is performed.
#The line amount is compared to the next break point. If the amount is greater than or equal to this break point but less than the next break point (or greater than the last break point), the system calculates the discount as follows:
#*If the discount is a fixed amount, the fixed amount for this tier is deducted from the line amount. No further comparison is performed.
#*If the discount is a percentage, the percent (specified for this tier) of the line amount is calculated and deducted from the line amount. No further comparison is performed.
#Comparison continues similarly, with Step 2 repeated until a discount is calculated or the last break point has been checked.

'''Example 3''': Your company buys an item for $95. If a sequence for a line-level discount has tiers defined by amounts and the discounts are expressed as percentages, the discount amount (calculated by using the percent defined for the appropriate tier) of the extended price of the item is subtracted from the extended price. Suppose that the sequence is specified with the following break points:[anchor|#ul_uz1_rks_tm]
*$1000: 5%
*$2000: 10%
*$5000: 20%

For a line with 10 items (which means that the extended price is $950), the discount is $0. For a line with 30 items (for an extended price of $2850), the discount is $285 (10%). And for a line with a total of 60 items (the extended price is $5700), the discount is $1140 (20%). ]]></column>

Learning Objectives In this section, you will learn: How to configure volume vendor discounts based on the ordered quantities or amounts How automatic volume vendor discounts are applied when you save new documents Applicable Scenarios To configure discounts for vendors, the  Vendor Discounts  feature must be enabled on the        ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. You can configure customer discounts that are automatically applied to lines of documents of     various types, including AP bills and purchase orders. Applying discounts to purchase orders is     possible only if the  Inventory and Order Management  group of features and the       Inventory  feature are enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000)     form. Tiered Discounts In a sequence, you can configure a simple discount, which is applicable to any amount or     quantity, or a tiered discount, for which you can specify different percents or fixed amounts     based on the quantities of items or on the amounts. To configure tiers for a discount, you     specify the break points that define the ranges of amounts or quantities for which different     discount percentages, amounts, or quantities of free items are applicable. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP205000|AP205000]) Vendor Discounts (AP205000) form, the following parameters can be used     as a basis for break points for discounts applied at different levels: For line- or group-level discounts, you can configure tiers based on the amounts or      quantities. For document-level discounts, tiers can only be based on the document amounts. Below you can find examples of discount sequences. For these examples, assume that the     appropriate discount codes have been defined. Example 1: A Simple Discount Sequence Suppose that Vendor A gives your organization a permanent discount of 10% per order. To set up     this discount in  Acumatica ERP,     you create a discount sequence and on the  Discount Breakpoints  tab of the        ([~/?ScreenId=AP205000|AP205000]) Vendor Discounts form, you add a break point with the following values. Break Amount Discount Percent 0 10 Example 2: A Discount Sequence Based on Quantity Suppose that your organization buys computer equipment from Vendor B, and this vendor provides     your organization with a discount for keyboards based on the ordered quantity. You create a     discount sequence, and you add break points with the following settings on the       Discount Breakpoints  tab. Break Quantity Discount Percent 100 5 200 7 300 10 Example 3: A Discount Sequence Based on Amount Suppose that Vendor C provides your organization with a fixed-amount discount based on the     document total; that is, it does not matter which goods or services you buy from this vendor.     You create a discount sequence, and you add the break points with the following settings on the       Discount Breakpoints  tab. Break Amount Discount Amount $1000 $10 $2000 $25 $3000 $40 Calculation of Document-Level Discounts with Tiers Defined by Amounts For document-level discounts, which are unconditional, the discount tiers can be created only     by break points defined as amounts, and the discount can be defined as a percentage of the     document amount or as a fixed amount. When the system processes a purchase order or bill and     finds a qualifying discount sequence, the discountable amount is compared to the break points in     the discount sequence as follows: The document amount is compared to the first break point. If the document amount is less      than the amount of the first break point in the sequence, the discount equals zero, and further      comparison is not performed. The document amount is compared to the next break point. If the document amount is greater      than or equal to the amount of this break point but less than the amount of the next break      point (or greater than the amount of the last break point), the system calculates the discount      as follows: If the discount is a fixed amount, the fixed amount specified as a discount for this tier        is deducted from the document amount. If the discount is a percentage, the percent (specified for this tier) of the document        amount is calculated and deducted from the document amount. Comparison continues similarly, with Step 2 repeated until a discount is found or the last      break point is checked. The examples below illustrate the way these document-level discounts are calculated. Example 1 : If a sequence for a document-level discount has tiers defined by amounts and     the discounts are expressed as percentages, the discount amount corresponding to the appropriate     tier is subtracted from the document total. Suppose that the sequence is specified with the     following break points: $1000: 5% $2000: 7% $5000: 10% For a document with a $900 total, the discount is $0. For a document with a $2500 total, the     discount is $175 (7%), and for a document with a total of $9000, the discount is $900 (10%). Example 2 : Suppose that a sequence for a document-level discount has tiers defined by     amounts, with the discounts expressed as fixed amounts that are subtracted from the total amount     of the document. Further suppose that the sequence is specified with the following break     points: $1000: $100 $2000: $225 $3000: $350 For purchase orders with amounts less than $1000, your company receives a discount of $0. The     discount for an order with a total between $1000 and $1999.99 is $100, the discount on an order     between $2000 and $2999.99 is $225, and the discount for an order of $3000 or more is $350. Calculation of Line-Level Discounts for Tiers Defined by Amounts The tiers for line-level discounts can be defined by amounts or by quantities. The method of     calculation of line-level discounts depends on whether the discount should be applied to the     unit prices of items or to the extended prices of the items. Based on the information received     from each vendor, you select the appropriate option in the  Apply Line-Discounts      to  box on the  Calculation Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP204000|AP204000]) Vendor Discount Codes (AP204000) form for this vendor. Line Discounts Applied to Unit Prices The system calculates line discounts applied to unit prices as follows: The line item's price is compared to the first break point. If the item price is less than      the first break point in the sequence, the discount equals $0, and further comparison is not      performed. The item price is compared to the next break point. If the price is greater than or equal to      this break point but less than the next break point (or greater than the last break point), the      system calculates the discount as follows: If the discount is a fixed amount, the fixed amount specified as a discount for this tier        is deducted from the item price, and the extended price is recalculated. If the discount is a percentage, the percent (specified for this tier) of the item price        is calculated and deducted from the item price. Comparison continues similarly, with Step 2 repeated until a discount is found or the last      break point has been reached. For the particular vendor, if the discounts should be applied to item prices and a sequence is     broken down by the quantity of the item, the line quantity of the item is compared to the     quantities selected as break points, and the discount is calculated as follows: If the discount is defined as a percentage, the specified percent is deducted from the item      price, and then the discounted price is multiplied by the line quantity. If the discount is defined as a fixed amount, the specified fixed amount is deducted from      the item price and then the discounted price is multiplied by the line quantity. Example 4 : Your company buys different items with the prices $95, $210, and $600 from     the same vendor in the same purchase order. If a sequence for a line-level discount has tiers     defined by amounts with the discounts expressed as percentages, the discount amount is     calculated as the percent (defined for the appropriate tier) of the item price and is subtracted     from the price. Suppose that the sequence is specified with the following break points: $100: 5% $200: 10% $500: 20% For a line with 10 units of the item priced at $95, the discount will be $0. For a line with     20 units of the item priced at $210, the discount will be $21.0 (10%) per unit with a discount     for the line of $420. And for a line with one $600 item, the discount will be $120. Line Discounts Applied to Extended Prices If the system is configured to apply line discounts to the extended prices of items and the     tiers are defined by line amounts, the system calculates discounts as follows: The line amount (that is, the extended price of the item) is compared to the first break      point. If the amount is less than the first break point in the sequence, the discount equals      $0, and no further comparison is performed. The line amount is compared to the next break point. If the amount is greater than or equal      to this break point but less than the next break point (or greater than the last break point),      the system calculates the discount as follows: If the discount is a fixed amount, the fixed amount for this tier is deducted from the        line amount. No further comparison is performed. If the discount is a percentage, the percent (specified for this tier) of the line amount        is calculated and deducted from the line amount. No further comparison is performed. Comparison continues similarly, with Step 2 repeated until a discount is calculated or the      last break point has been checked. Example 3 : Your company buys an item for $95. If a sequence for a line-level discount     has tiers defined by amounts and the discounts are expressed as percentages, the discount amount     (calculated by using the percent defined for the appropriate tier) of the extended price of the     item is subtracted from the extended price. Suppose that the sequence is specified with the     following break points: $1000: 5% $2000: 10% $5000: 20% For a line with 10 items (which means that the extended price is $950), the discount is $0.     For a line with 30 items (for an extended price of $2850), the discount is $285 (10%). And for a     line with a total of 60 items (the extended price is $5700), the discount is $1140 (20%).  ]]></column>

In this activity, you will learn how to configure automatic vendor discounts dependent on the amounts or quantities in document lines or the amount of the entire document. It is recommended that you review the information about line vendor discounts and document vendor discounts before completing this activity.
==Story==
At the end of 2018, one of SweetLife&rsquo;s vendors, Blueline Advertising, purchased a new facility and drastically improved its capacity for production of outdoor advertising constructions. To increase the utilization ratio of the new facility, Blueline offers discounts to its customers who order production of outdoor ad constructions in large quantities. SweetLife purchases billboard production from Blueline, so the company is interested in the following Blueline&rsquo;s discounts:[anchor|#_b9460a16-eca2-494f-9b35-b0b3a9df7726]
*5–9 billboards - 5%
*10–14 billboards - 7%
*15–19 billboards - 10%
*20 and more billboards - 15%

Also, Blueline offers discounts to its most valued customers, which place large orders, as follows:[anchor|#_acf849b4-ea94-4317-9907-0ceb5363dd67]
*$3,000–4,999 - 3%
*$5,000–6,999 - 5%
*$7,000 and more - 7%

As a regular customer of Blueline, SweetLife wants to take advantage of these discounts. {br}

On January 30, 2019 Sweetlife purchases the design of a new billboard, the production and installation of 15 billboards in the new design. Blueline charges for its installation services by the hour, that is 2 billable hours for installation of a single billboard.{br}

As the SweetLife accountant, you first define these discounts so that they are applied automatically to documents created for Blueline. Also, you need to create a bill for the purchase of the services and explore how these discounts are applied to it.
==Process Overview==
You configure discount codes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_40_00|Vendor Discount Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AP204000|AP204000]) form and then configure appropriate discount sequences on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_50_00|Vendor Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AP205000|AP205000]) form.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form, you create an AP bill to which the discounts may be applied. You then review the '''Discount Details''' tab of the form and review how the discounts are applied.
==Before You Proceed==
Before you start the activity, do the following:[anchor|#_9518e56e-9894-425b-87ca-0971f8e35a4c]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as an accountant by using the ''johnson'' login and the ''123'' password.
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''1/30/2019''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button and select ''1/30/2019''. For simplicity, in this lesson, you will create and process all documents in the system on this business date.
#On the company and branch selection menu, also on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center'' branch is selected. If it is not selected, click the selection menu to view the list of branches that you have access to, and then click ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center''.

==Step 1: Configure the Tiered Line Vendor Discount (Applicable to Item, Tiered by Quantity, Calculated by Percent)==

#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Update Discounts'''.
#In the '''Update Discounts''' dialog box, which opens, leave the default value (''1/30/2019'') in the '''Filter Date''' box, and click '''OK'''.

==Step 3: Create the Bill for Blueline and Explore Discount Application==
To create the bill for Blueline Advertising and explore how these tiered discounts are applied, do the following:[anchor|#_9f1e5753-79d9-4292-b5c3-522d666ab716]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record''', and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Type''': ''Bill''
#* '''Vendor''': ''BLUELINE''
#* '''Date''': ''1/30/2019'' (inserted by default)
#*'''Description''': <tt>Billboard design and installation - January 2019</tt>
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, click '''Add Row''', and specify the following settings in the added row:
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''BILLBDESIG''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>1</tt>
#*'''UOM''': ''PIECE''
#* '''Unit Cost''': <tt>1000</tt>
#Add another row with the following settings:
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''BILLBPROD''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>15</tt>
#*'''UOM''': ''PIECE''
#* '''Unit Cost''': <tt>300</tt>
#:Notice that the '''Discount Percent''' column in this row contains the discount percentage that you configured in Step 1 (which is 10% for the 15–19 tier).
#On the '''Discount Details''' tab, notice that there is one table row that corresponds to the document discount that you have configured in Step 2, which is a 5% discount applicable to documents with the amount between $5,000 and $7,000.
#:Notice that the '''Discount Total''' box of the Summary area of the form also displays this discount amount.
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, add another row with the following settings:
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''BILLBINSTA''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>30</tt>
#*'''UOM''': ''HOUR''
#* '''Unit Cost''': <tt>80</tt>
#On the '''Discount Details''' tab, notice that the document discount has now changed to 7%, which corresponds to the documents amounts that equal or exceed $7,000. The same amount is reflected in the '''Discount Total''' box in the Summary area of the form.
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and on the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the bill.
#On the '''Financial Details''' tab, click the link in the '''Batch Nbr.''' box to review the GL batch, which the system opens in a pop-up window on the Journal Transactions (GL301000) form.

It is recommended that you review the information about line vendor                 discounts and document vendor discounts before completing this activity. Story At the end of 2018, one of SweetLife's vendors, Blueline Advertising, purchased a new                 facility and drastically improved its capacity for production of outdoor advertising                 constructions. To increase the utilization ratio of the new facility, Blueline                 offers discounts to its customers who order production of outdoor ad constructions                 in large quantities. SweetLife purchases billboard production from Blueline, so the                 company is interested in the following Blueline's discounts: 5–9 billboards - 5% 10–14 billboards - 7% 15–19 billboards - 10% 20 and more billboards - 15% Also, Blueline offers discounts to its most valued customers, which place large                 orders, as follows: $3,000–4,999 - 3% $5,000–6,999 - 5% $7,000 and more - 7% As a regular customer of Blueline, SweetLife wants to take advantage of these                 discounts.  On January 30, 2019 Sweetlife purchases the design of a new billboard, the production                 and installation of 15 billboards in the new design. Blueline charges for its                 installation services by the hour, that is 2 billable hours for installation of a                 single billboard. As the SweetLife accountant, you first define these discounts so that they are                 applied automatically to documents created for Blueline. Also, you need to create a                 bill for the purchase of the services and explore how these discounts are applied to                 it. Process Overview You configure discount codes on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP204000|AP204000]) Vendor Discount Codes (AP204000) form                 and then configure appropriate discount sequences on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP205000|AP205000]) Vendor Discounts (AP205000) form. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form, you create an AP bill to                 which the discounts may be applied. You then review the  Discount                     Details  tab of the form and review how the discounts are                 applied. Before You Proceed Before you start the activity, do the following: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as an accountant by using the  johnson  login and                     the  123  password. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to                          1/30/2019 . If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date                     menu button and select  1/30/2019 . For simplicity, in this lesson, you                     will create and process all documents in the system on this business date. On the company and branch selection menu, also on the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the  SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center                      branch is selected. If it is not selected, click the selection menu to view the                     list of branches that you have access to, and then click  SweetLife Head                         Office and Wholesale Center .

Step 3: Create the Bill for Blueline and Explore Discount Application To create the bill for Blueline Advertising and explore how these tiered discounts                 are applied, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form. On the form toolbar, click  Add New Record , and specify                     the following settings in the Summary area: Type :  Bill Vendor :  BLUELINE Date :  1/30/2019  (inserted by default) Description :  Billboard design and                                 installation - January 2019 On the  Document Details  tab, click  Add                         Row , and specify the following settings in the added row: Branch :  HEADOFFICE Inventory ID :  BILLBDESIG Quantity :  1 UOM :  PIECE Unit Cost :  1000 Add another row with the following settings: Branch :  HEADOFFICE Inventory ID :  BILLBPROD Quantity :  15 UOM :  PIECE Unit Cost :  300 Notice that the  Discount Percent  column in this                         row contains the discount percentage that you configured in Step 1 (which is                         10% for the 15–19 tier). On the  Discount Details  tab, notice that there is one                     table row that corresponds to the document discount that you have configured in                     Step 2, which is a 5% discount applicable to documents with the amount between                     $5,000 and $7,000.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
When a document (such as a bill) is saved, vendor discounts of all levels are applied to the document automatically, except for the discounts for which the '''Manual''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_40_00|Vendor Discount Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AP204000|AP204000]) form. This topic provides details about the automatic and manual application of vendor discounts.{br}{TOC}
==Application of Automatic Discounts==
The system always applies the automatic discounts in the following order when a user saves a document:[anchor|#ul_ub2_pvd_tm]
#Line-level discounts (which are applied to each line of the document): For each document line, the system checks the applicable line-level discounts and applies the one with the largest discount amount.
#Group-level discounts (which are applied to multiple lines of the document): The system finds the applicable group-level discounts and applies all of them.
#Document-level discounts (which are applied to the total amount of the document): The system finds and applies the applicable document-level discount with the largest discount amount for a document. The system can apply only one (the best) document-level discount to the document.

The following settings, which are specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_40_00|Vendor Discount Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AP204000|AP204000]) form, affect the order of discount application and the calculation of the discounts:[anchor|#ul_d2j_cn3_vm]
*'''Exclude from Discountable Amount''': If this check box (which is available only for line-level discounts) is selected, the discountable amount of the line-level discount is excluded from the discountable amount for higher-level (group or document) discounts. For example, suppose that your vendor provides a line-level clearance discount of 75% and a document-level discount of 5% for documents with a total of more than $2000. You select this check box if the vendor does not provide an additional document-level discount of 5% to the already-discounted line amounts.
*'''Skip Document Discount''': If this check box (which is available only for group-level discounts) is selected, the system does not apply document discounts when this group discount is applied to the document. For example, suppose that the following discounts have been defined: a group-level discount that is applicable to multiple lines and significantly reduces the document total, and a document-level discount. You select this check box if you do not want to apply the document-level discount to the documents to which this group-level discount has been applied.

==Application of Manual Discounts==
If some vendors provide discounts that do not have formal conditions for automatic application (that is, document-specific discounts), you can enter line-level and document-level discounts manually in each document on the following forms:[anchor|#ul_ytt_2yb_xm]
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) 

You can enter manual discounts either by selecting an existing discount code with the '''Manual''' check box selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_40_00|Vendor Discount Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AP204000|AP204000]) form (in this case, the system applies the discounts that correspond to this code) or by entering a discount percent or discount amount manually.{br}

You can apply manual line-level discounts to a document on the '''Document Details''' tab of the appropriate form as follows:[anchor|#_5a9b8b24-ef63-49aa-9b14-dcc05bc4614d]
*If you want to use an existing discount code, in the '''Discount Code''' column, you select this code.
*If you want to enter a discount manually, in the '''Discount Percent''' or '''Discount Amount''' column, you type the appropriate percent or amount and select the '''Manual Discount''' check box.

You can apply manual group-level or document-level discounts on the '''Discount Details''' tab of the appropriate form as follows:[anchor|#_a3b77ba5-1de4-45b5-9521-22f5eae5d52f]
*If you want to use an existing discount code, in the '''Discount Code''' column, you select this code, and in the '''Sequence ID''' column, you select the appropriate discount sequence for this code.
*If you want to enter a document discount manually, in the '''Discount Percent''' or '''Discount Amt.''' column, you type the appropriate percent or amount and select the '''Manual Discount''' check box.

If you change the line quantities when adding manual discounts, the manual discounts will be calculated. (They will not, however, be replaced by automatic discounts, even if the automatic discounts would result in a greater discount amount.){br}

If the ''Vendor Discounts'' feature is disabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can enter a manual document-level discount in the '''Discount Total''' box in the Summary area of an appropriate data entry form.
==Application of External Discounts==
In Acumatica ERP, you can apply to a document discounts that were created in external systems. For external discounts, you can create a discount code on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_40_00|Vendor Discount Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AP204000|AP204000]) form or enter a discount and specify the code of the external discount manually on a document.{br}

If you want to enter an external discount manually, you open the document to which you want to apply the discount on an appropriate entry form (see the list below), and in the '''Discount Amount''' or '''Discount Percent''' column of the '''Discount Details''' tab, you enter the discount. For a discount line with this manually entered external discount, you can type the external discount code (for informational use only) in the '''External Discount Code''' column.{br}

The system applies external discounts in the same way as it does manual document discounts; the system does not recalculate external discounts if there are changes to the document. You can specify manual external discounts for documents created on the following data entry forms:[anchor|#_a317b128-0daf-4b5a-9379-2a8ad5af5a2d]
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000])

The system can apply only one (the best) document-level discount to           the document.

For example, suppose that your vendor provides a line-level clearance           discount of 75% and a document-level discount of 5% for documents with a total of more           than $2000. You select this check box if the vendor does not provide an additional           document-level discount of 5% to the already-discounted line amounts. Skip Document Discount : If this check box (which is available           only for group-level discounts) is selected, the system does not apply document discounts           when this group discount is applied to the document. For example, suppose that the           following discounts have been defined: a group-level discount that is applicable to           multiple lines and significantly reduces the document total, and a document-level           discount. You select this check box if you do not want to apply the document-level           discount to the documents to which this group-level discount has been applied. Application of Manual Discounts If some vendors provide discounts that do not have formal conditions for automatic         application (that is, document-specific discounts), you can enter line-level and         document-level discounts manually in each document on the following forms:  ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000)  ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000)  You can enter manual discounts either by selecting an existing discount code with the            Manual  check box selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP204000|AP204000]) Vendor Discount Codes         (AP204000) form (in this case, the system applies the discounts that correspond to this         code) or by entering a discount percent or discount amount manually. You can apply manual line-level discounts to a document on the  Document           Details  tab of the appropriate form as follows: If you want to use an existing discount code, in the  Discount             Code  column, you select this code. If you want to enter a discount manually, in the  Discount Percent            or  Discount Amount  column, you type the appropriate percent or           amount and select the  Manual Discount  check box. You can apply manual group-level or document-level discounts on the  Discount           Details  tab of the appropriate form as follows: If you want to use an existing discount code, in the  Discount             Code  column, you select this code, and in the  Sequence             ID  column, you select the appropriate discount sequence for this code. If you want to enter a document discount manually, in the  Discount             Percent  or  Discount Amt.  column, you type the           appropriate percent or amount and select the  Manual Discount  check           box. If you change the line quantities when adding manual discounts, the manual discounts will         be calculated. (They will not, however, be replaced by automatic discounts, even if the         automatic discounts would result in a greater discount amount.) If the  Vendor Discounts  feature is disabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features         (CS100000) form, you can enter a manual document-level discount in the  Discount           Total  box in the Summary area of an appropriate data entry form. Application of External Discounts In  Acumatica ERP, you can apply to a document discounts that were created in external systems. For         external discounts, you can create a discount code on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP204000|AP204000]) Vendor Discount Codes         (AP204000) form or enter a discount and specify the code of the external discount manually         on a document. If you want to enter an external discount manually, you open the document to which you want         to apply the discount on an appropriate entry form (see the list below), and in the            Discount Amount  or  Discount Percent  column         of the  Discount Details  tab, you enter the discount. For a discount         line with this manually entered external discount, you can type the external discount code         (for informational use only) in the  External Discount Code          column. The system applies external discounts in the same way as it does manual document discounts;         the system does not recalculate external discounts if there are changes to the document. You         can specify manual external discounts for documents created on the following data entry         forms:  ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000)  ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) ]]></column>

With the algorithms used to calculate vendor discounts in Acumatica ERP, you can receive the best discount amount on your purchase orders and bills according to the information on vendor discounts available in your system.{br}

You enter discount codes and discount sequences based on information received from specific vendors. You enter a discount code for the vendor on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_40_00|Vendor Discount Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AP204000|AP204000]) form to define the basic settings of discounts for that vendor. To specify extended discount settings, you can create discount sequences related to a discount code by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_50_00|Vendor Discounts] ([~/?ScreenId=AP205000|AP205000]) form. For a discount sequence, you can specify the same discount for all amounts (or quantities). Alternatively, you can create tiers by specifying the ''break points''—with each break point defining the minimum discountable quantity discounts for these tiers expressed as percentages or fixed amounts. For more information, see [HelpRoot_PricesAndDiscounts\AP__con_Vendor_Discount_Codes|Vendor Discount Codes] and [HelpRoot_PricesAndDiscounts\AP__con_Vendor_Discount_Sequences|Vendor Discount Sequences].{br}

This topic describes how, based on the discount type and the selected options, the system calculates the discount amounts or percentages. {br}{TOC}
==Discount Calculation for Multiple Units of Measure==
If the ''Multiple Units of Measure'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, particular items can be bought in different units of measure (UOMs). This may influence the calculation of discounts defined by quantity. You can specify which UOMs the system uses to calculate discounts. In the '''Apply Quantity Discounts To''' box on the '''Price/Discount Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_10_10_00|Accounts Payable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AP101000|AP101000]) form, you can select one of the following options:[anchor|#_862b627b-e842-4c52-aa27-382616f79b28]
*''Document Line UOM'': The system uses the document line&rsquo;s UOM and quantity for calculating the discount.
*''Base UOM'': The system converts the quantity of the ordered items in the document line&rsquo;s UOM to a quantity in the base UOM for the item; the discount is applied to this calculated base quantity.

==Calculation of Document-Level Discounts with Tiers Defined by Amounts==
For ''document-level'' vendor discounts, which are unconditional, the discount tiers can be created only by break points defined as amounts, and the discount can be defined as a percentage of the document amount or as a fixed amount. When the system processes a purchase order or a bill and finds a qualifying discount sequence the discountable amount is compared to the break points in the discount sequence as follows:[anchor|#ul_yj2_grq_tm]
#The document amount is compared to the first break point. If the document amount is less than the amount of the first break point in the sequence, the discount equals zero, and further comparison is not performed.
#The document amount is compared to a next break point. If the document amount is greater than or equal to the amount of any break point but less than the amount of the next break point (or greater than the amount of the last break point), the system calculates the discount as follows:
#*If the discount is a fixed amount, the fixed amount specified as the discount for this tier is deducted from the document amount.
#*If the discount is a percentage, the percent (specified for this tier) of the document amount is calculated and deducted from the document amount.
#*Further comparison is not performed.
#Comparison continues similarly, with Step 2 repeated until a discount is found or the last break point is checked.

The examples below illustrate the way these document-level discounts are calculated.{br}

'''Example 1''': If a sequence for a document-level discount has tiers defined by amounts and the discounts are expressed as percentages, the discount amount corresponding to the appropriate tier is subtracted from the document total. Suppose that the sequence is specified with the following break points: [anchor|#ul_hk2_grq_tm]
*$1000: 5%
*$2000: 7%
*$5000: 10%

For a document with a $900 total, the discount is $0. For a document with a $2500 total, the discount is $175 (7%), and for a document with a total of $9000, the discount is $900 (10%). {br}

'''Example 2''': Suppose that a sequence for a document-level discount has tiers defined by amounts, with the discounts expressed as fixed amounts that are subtracted from the total amount of the document. Further suppose that the sequence is specified with the following break points: [anchor|#ul_pnd_frq_tm]
*$1000: $100
*$2000: $225
*$3000: $350

For purchase orders with amounts less than $1000, your company receives a discount of $0. The discount for an order with a total between $1000 and $1999.99 is $100, the discount on an order between $2000 and $2999.99 is $225, and the discount for an order of $3000 or more is $350. 
==Calculation of Line-Level Discounts for Tiers Defined by Amounts==
The tiers for line-level discounts can be defined by amounts or by quantities. The method of calculation of line-level discounts depends on whether the discount should be applied to the unit prices of items or to the extended prices of the items. Based on the information received from each vendor, you select the appropriate option in the '''Apply Line-Discounts to''' box on the '''Calculation Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_40_00|Vendor Discount Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AP204000|AP204000]) form for this vendor.
'''Line Discounts Applied to Unit Prices'''{br}

The system calculates line discounts applied to unit prices as follows:[anchor|#ol_mpl_tsr_tm]
#The line item&rsquo;s price is compared to the first break point. If the item price is less than the first break point in the sequence, the discount equals $0, and no further comparison is performed.
#The item price is compared to the next break point. If the price is greater than or equal to this break point but less than the next break point (or greater than the last break point), the system calculates the discount as follows:
#*If the discount is a fixed amount, the fixed amount for this tier is deducted from the item price, and the extended price is recalculated.
#*If the discount is a percentage, the percent (specified for this tier) of the item price is calculated and deducted from the item price.
#Comparison continues similarly, with Step 2 repeated until a discount is found or the last break point has been reached.

For the particular vendor, if the discounts should be applied to item prices and a sequence is broken down by the quantity of the item, the line quantity of the item is compared to the quantities selected as break points, and the discount is calculated as follows:[anchor|#ul_cgl_z2s_tm]
*If the discount is defined as a percentage, the specified percent is deducted from the item price, and then the discounted price is multiplied by the line quantity.
*If the discount is defined as a fixed amount, the specified fixed amount is deducted from the item price and then the discounted price is multiplied by the line quantity.

'''Example 4''': Your company buys different items with the prices $95, $210, and $600 from the same vendor in the same purchase order. If a sequence for a line-level discount has tiers defined by amounts with the discounts expressed as percentages, the discount amount is calculated as the percent (defined for the appropriate tier) of the item price and is subtracted from the price. Suppose that the sequence is specified with the following break points:[anchor|#ul_vkt_5ms_tm]
*$100: 5%
*$200: 10%
*$500: 20%

For a line with 10 units of the item priced at $95, the discount will be $0. For a line with 20 units of the item priced at $210, the discount will be $21.0 (10%) per unit with a discount for the line of $420. And for a line with one $600 item, the discount will be $120.{br}

'''Line Discounts Applied to Extended Prices'''{br}

If the system is configured to apply line discounts to the extended prices of items and the tiers are defined by line amounts, the system calculates discounts as follows:[anchor|#ol_x4k_ppr_tm]
#The line amount (that is, the extended price of the item) is compared to the first break point. If the amount is less than the first break point in the sequence, the discount equals $0, and no further comparison is performed.
#The line amount is compared to the next break point. If the amount is greater than or equal to this break point but less than the next break point (or greater than the last break point), the system calculates the discount as follows:
#*If the discount is a fixed amount, the fixed amount for this tier is deducted from the line amount. No further comparison is performed.
#*If the discount is a percentage, the percent (specified for this tier) of the line amount is calculated and deducted from the line amount. No further comparison is performed.
#Comparison continues similarly, with Step 2 repeated until a discount is calculated or the last break point has been checked.

'''Example 3''': Your company buys an item for $95. If a sequence for a line-level discount has tiers defined by amounts and the discounts are expressed as percentages, the discount amount (calculated by using the percent defined for the appropriate tier) of the extended price of the item is subtracted from the extended price. Suppose that the sequence is specified with the following break points:[anchor|#ul_uz1_rks_tm]
*$1000: 5%
*$2000: 10%
*$5000: 20%

For a line with 10 items (which means that the extended price is $950), the discount is $0. For a line with 30 items (for an extended price of $2850), the discount is $285 (10%). And for a line with a total of 60 items (the extended price is $5700), the discount is $1140 (20%).

The     discount for an order with a total between $1000 and $1999.99 is $100, the discount on an order     between $2000 and $2999.99 is $225, and the discount for an order of $3000 or more is $350.

Line Discounts Applied to Unit Prices The system calculates line discounts applied to unit prices as follows: The line item's price is compared to the first break point. If the item price is less than      the first break point in the sequence, the discount equals $0, and no further comparison is      performed. The item price is compared to the next break point. If the price is greater than or equal to      this break point but less than the next break point (or greater than the last break point), the      system calculates the discount as follows: If the discount is a fixed amount, the fixed amount for this tier is deducted from the        item price, and the extended price is recalculated.

If the discount is defined as a fixed amount, the specified fixed amount is deducted from      the item price and then the discounted price is multiplied by the line quantity. Example 4 : Your company buys different items with the prices $95, $210, and $600 from     the same vendor in the same purchase order. If a sequence for a line-level discount has tiers     defined by amounts with the discounts expressed as percentages, the discount amount is     calculated as the percent (defined for the appropriate tier) of the item price and is subtracted     from the price. Suppose that the sequence is specified with the following break points: $100: 5% $200: 10% $500: 20% For a line with 10 units of the item priced at $95, the discount will be $0. For a line with     20 units of the item priced at $210, the discount will be $21.0 (10%) per unit with a discount     for the line of $420. And for a line with one $600 item, the discount will be $120. Line Discounts Applied to Extended Prices If the system is configured to apply line discounts to the extended prices of items and the     tiers are defined by line amounts, the system calculates discounts as follows: The line amount (that is, the extended price of the item) is compared to the first break      point. If the amount is less than the first break point in the sequence, the discount equals      $0, and no further comparison is performed. The line amount is compared to the next break point. If the amount is greater than or equal      to this break point but less than the next break point (or greater than the last break point),      the system calculates the discount as follows: If the discount is a fixed amount, the fixed amount for this tier is deducted from the        line amount. No further comparison is performed. If the discount is a percentage, the percent (specified for this tier) of the line amount        is calculated and deducted from the line amount. No further comparison is performed. Comparison continues similarly, with Step 2 repeated until a discount is calculated or the      last break point has been checked. Example 3 : Your company buys an item for $95. If a sequence for a line-level discount     has tiers defined by amounts and the discounts are expressed as percentages, the discount amount     (calculated by using the percent defined for the appropriate tier) of the extended price of the     item is subtracted from the extended price. Suppose that the sequence is specified with the     following break points: $1000: 5% $2000: 10% $5000: 20% For a line with 10 items (which means that the extended price is $950), the discount is $0.
