''API users'' are client applications that sign in to Acumatica ERP by using one of the following ways:[anchor|#_74143e75-af41-4218-9665-834cb368a47e]
*The sign-in method of the contract-based REST API
*The sign-in method of the contract-based SOAP API
*The sign-in method of the screen-based SOAP API
*The OAuth 2.0 mechanism of authorization for applications
{br}

Each Acumatica ERP license includes the limits on the number of web services API users, the number of concurrent API requests, and the number of web services API requests per minute. You can view these limits of the Acumatica ERP license on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_60_40_00|License Monitoring Console] ([~/?ScreenId=SM604000|SM604000]) form. The following sections describe these limits and the life cycle of API requests.{br}{TOC}
==Number of Web Services API Users==
On the '''License''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_60_40_00|License Monitoring Console] ([~/?ScreenId=SM604000|SM604000]) form, the '''Maximum Number of Web Services API Users''' box displays the license restriction for the number of API users that can work with Acumatica ERP. When an extra API user tries to sign in to the system and the number of API user sessions exceeds your license restriction, an error message is returned and the sign-in process is interrupted. The following diagram shows an example of how this limitation works with three sign-in requests when the '''Maximum Number of Web Services API Users''' is set to ''2''.[anchor|#_c4523be2-084a-4eb1-9962-0e669ca7bf22][anchor|#_8e88f0b8-1da9-4b0e-8392-43fff166c378][image:UserGuide/Images/NumberOfWebServicesAPIUsers.png|popup|Rejection of an API user|450px]{br}

To avoid exceeding the maximum number of API users, external applications must properly implement the signing in to and signing out from Acumatica ERP. If an external application does not close its sessions in Acumatica ERP (that is, does not sign out from Acumatica ERP in each session), this application can prevent other applications from signing in. For details about the implementation of signing in and signing out, see the following sources:[anchor|#_2d0134df-a992-41b8-87dd-2d4c2d5412b1]
*[HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_REST_Login|Sign-In to the Service] for the REST API
*[HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_CB_Login|Login() Method] for the contract-based SOAP API
*[HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_SB_Login|Login() Method] for the screen-based SOAP API
*The descriptions of the scopes in [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_OAuth_Authorization_Code_Flow|Authorization Code Flow], [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_OAuth_Implicit_Flow|Implicit Flow], and [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_OAuth_Resource_Owner_Flow|Resource Owner Password Credentials Flow] for OAuth 2.0 authorization

==Number of Concurrent Web Services API Requests==
All incoming API requests (except the requests to sign out from Acumatica ERP, which are processed immediately) are placed in an internal queue. To process these requests, the server uses the API processing cores, which execute the requests in parallel. The number of cores is no more than the maximum number of concurrent web services API requests, which is specified in the '''Maximum Number of Concurrent Web Services API Requests''' box on the '''License''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_60_40_00|License Monitoring Console] ([~/?ScreenId=SM604000|SM604000]) form.{br}

The API processing cores take the requests from the queue one by one. If the limit for the number of concurrent web services API requests has been reached (that is, if all API cores are processing the requests), the next concurrent request waits in the queue and is processed when one of the previous requests has completed. {br}

))){br}

The following diagram shows an example of how this limitation works with '''Maximum Number of Concurrent Web Services API Requests''' set to 3.[anchor|#_15c9b071-2902-4dbc-8b93-5577ce7787c3][anchor|#_57cd31f9-53f0-4d58-b844-e67c805de59e][image:UserGuide/Images/NumberOfConcurrentWebServicesAPIRequest.png|popup|Request 4 waiting in the internal queue|450px]
==Number of Web Services API Requests per Minute==
The maximum number of requests that can be processed per minute is specified in the '''Maximum Number of Web Services API Requests per Minute''' box on the '''License''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_60_40_00|License Monitoring Console] ([~/?ScreenId=SM604000|SM604000]) form. If the number of requests in a particular minute reaches 50 percent of the limit specified for the license, the subsequent requests during this minute are delayed for the following time: 60 seconds minus the number of seconds that have passed since the beginning of the current minute, divided by the remaining number of requests that can be processed in the minute (per the specified maximum). {br}

For example, suppose that in a particular license, the limit of the number of web services API requests per minute is 50. Since the beginning of the current minute, if the system has already processed 25 requests in 40 seconds and the system receives another request, this request is delayed in the internal queue for {{(60-40)/(50-25)}} seconds. After this delay, the request will be processed.[anchor|#_33a2b828-51c5-4ec5-8020-24a6f6ed7e5c]((({S:Warn}The system sends a response to the request when the request is fully processed or declined. For details about the life cycle of the requests, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_License_Restrictions_API_Users#_5e45d3c6-e814-4b08-a995-9592bd6e30fd|Life Cycle of the Requests].
))){br}

The following diagram shows an example of how this limitation works with '''Maximum Number of Web Services API Requests per Minute''' set to 50 and with 25 requests processed in the minute.[anchor|#_0110f2a7-2b9c-4eb2-91fd-3bf31ede7508][anchor|#_b460a572-385f-497f-8397-b387d3fb172d][image:UserGuide/Images/NumberOfWebServicesAPIRequestPerMinut.png|popup|Request 28 delayed in the internal queue|450px][anchor|#_5003371c-88ed-409a-b0f6-fe8864f827cf]
==Decline of the Requests==
The request will be declined only if the number of requests in the internal queue is greater than 20, or the request remains in the queue for more than 10 minutes. {br}

For example, suppose that during one second, each of 50 external applications sends a web services API request to one Acumatica ERP server. Suppose also that each request is processed for 1 second and that the maximum number of concurrent web services API requests in the license is 16. In this case, the first 16 requests will be passed to 16 API processing cores immediately. The next 20 requests will wait in the internal queue, and the last 14 requests will be declined.[anchor|#_5e45d3c6-e814-4b08-a995-9592bd6e30fd]
==Life Cycle of the Requests==
The system sends a response to the request when the request is fully processed or declined. You can view the statistics of the delayed and declined requests on the '''Statistics''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_60_40_00|License Monitoring Console] ([~/?ScreenId=SM604000|SM604000]) form.{br}

If an integrated application does not properly sign out from Acumatica ERP, this application can use all of the API sessions included in the license (that is, reach the maximum number of API users, which is described in [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_License_Restrictions_API_Users|License Restrictions for API Users]), thus preventing other integrated applications from signing in. To avoid such situations, you can limit the number of sessions for either each integration application assigned to a user type or an individual integration application. {br}

Before configuring these limits, on the '''Warnings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_60_40_00|License Monitoring Console] ([~/?ScreenId=SM604000|SM604000]) form, you can review whether any of the integrated application opens more than three sessions at a time (which is a predefined system value for this form). If the number of sessions has not been limited for an integrated application and this application opens more than three sessions at a time, a warning is generated and listed in the table on this tab. This warning can indicate that you should configure a limitation for the particular integration application or review the implementation of signing in and signing out in the application. 
==Configuration of the Limitations==
You limit the number of sessions used by each integration application on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_25_00|User Types] ([~/?ScreenId=EP202500|EP202500]) form. Also, if it is necessary to specify a different limit for a particular integration application, you can specify this limit on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) form. For details about how to limit the number of sessions in both of these ways, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__how_Limit_API_Connections|To Limit the Number of API Connections of Integrated Applications] and [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__how_Limit_API_Connections_for_Particular_App|To Limit API Connections of a Particular Application].
==Life Cycle of Sign-in Requests==
The life cycle of any type of requests (including sign-in requests) is described in [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_License_Restrictions_API_Users#_5e45d3c6-e814-4b08-a995-9592bd6e30fd|Life Cycle of the Requests]. This section describes peculiarities of the life cycle of sign-in requests. {br}

The limitations for the number of API users and the limit of the number of sessions for a particular application are taken into account when one of the API processing cores takes the sign-in request. The API processing core then processes the sign-in request as follows:[anchor|#_c413fc68-82ea-4a27-a1c7-47a86f970a36]
#Checks whether the maximum number of API users is exceeded. For details about this limit, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_License_Restrictions_API_Users|License Restrictions for API Users].
#Checks whether the limit of the number of sessions specified for this API user is exceeded.
#:If the number of sessions opened by the integrated application reaches the limit specified for this integrated application on either the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_25_00|User Types] ([~/?ScreenId=EP202500|EP202500]) form or the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) form, the integrated application cannot open any new session (that is, cannot sign in to Acumatica ERP) until it closes one of the existing sessions. The system returns an error in the response to the sign-in request.
#:If no limit is specified for the integration application on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_25_00|User Types] form or on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] form, the integration application can open no more sessions than the maximum number of API users in the license.

Also, if it is necessary to         specify a different limit for a particular integration application, you can specify this         limit on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) Users (SM201010) form. For details about         how to limit the number of sessions in both of these ways, see  To Limit the Number of API Connections of Integrated Applications and  To Limit API Connections of a Particular Application. Life Cycle of Sign-in Requests The life cycle of any type of requests (including sign-in requests) is described in  Life Cycle of the Requests. This section describes peculiarities of the life cycle of sign-in requests.  The limitations for the number of API users and the limit of the number of sessions for a         particular application are taken into account when one of the API processing cores takes the         sign-in request. The API processing core then processes the sign-in request as follows: Checks whether the maximum number of API users is exceeded. For details about this             limit, see  License Restrictions for API Users. Checks whether the limit of the number of sessions specified for this API user is               exceeded. If the number of sessions opened by the integrated application reaches the               limit specified for this integrated application on either the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP202500|EP202500]) User Types (EP202500) form or the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) Users (SM201010) form, the integrated application               cannot open any new session (that is, cannot sign in to  Acumatica ERP) until it closes one of the existing sessions. The system returns an error in the               response to the sign-in request. If no limit is specified for the integration               application on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP202500|EP202500]) User Types form or on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) Users form, the integration application can open no               more sessions than the maximum number of API users in the license.  The diagram in  Life Cycle of the Requests shows how a sign-in request is processed by an API processing core. ]]></column>

 Acumatica ERP supports the OAuth 2.0 mechanism of authorization for applications that are integrated with Acumatica ERP through application programming interfaces (APIs) and OData. When a client application of Acumatica ERP uses the OAuth 2.0 mechanism of authorization, the client application does not operate with the Acumatica ERP credentials to sign in a user to Acumatica ERP; instead, the application obtains an access token from Acumatica ERP and uses this token when it requests data from Acumatica ERP. [anchor|#_f3342589-bcdd-4dc9-803c-aeddc603f632]{br}

Depending on the OAuth 2.0 flow that the client application implements, the client application either has no information on the credentials of an Acumatica ERP user or uses this information only once to obtain the access token. The OAuth 2.0 mechanism of authorization improves the security of the Acumatica ERP data accessed by the application and simplifies the management of access rights.{br}

The client application that implements the OAuth 2.0 authorization mechanism can use one of the OAuth 2.0 authorization flows supported by Acumatica ERP, which are the following:[anchor|#_7d3c951f-582d-4c91-ad59-3af389fbc42a]

When you implement OAuth 2.0 authorization in a client application to make the application work with Acumatica ERP, you can use the authorization code flow. With this authorization flow, the client application never gets the credentials of the applicable Acumatica ERP user. After the user is authenticated in Acumatica ERP, the client application receives an authorization code, exchanges it for an access token, and then uses the access token to work with data in Acumatica ERP. When the access token expires, the client application can request a new access token by providing a refresh token. The following diagram illustrates the authorization code flow, whose steps are described in the sections of this topic.[anchor|#_57e5824f-d89d-4c68-9025-5e1fcca472f8][anchor|#_8f2aa8e5-5ed9-4db6-b4f0-696ebfbe65dc][image:UserGuide/Images/AuthorizationCodeFlow.png|popup|Authorization code flow|450px]
For details on the OAuth 2.0 authorization mechanism, see the specification at [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749]. {br}{TOC}
==Granting Permission to a Client Application==
Before an OAuth 2.0 client application can work with Acumatica ERP, you must register this application in Acumatica ERP and provide credentials to the application, as described in [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__how_Register_OAuth2_Client#_d68c1c13-bf02-4b79-988e-fbd7b1767a43|To Register a Client Application with the Authorization Code Flow]. After the registration, you have the client ID and the secret value of the client application.[anchor|#_6a3c600e-0d00-4a86-a373-bab66c44ac37]((({S:Danger}[anchor|#_16986676-fe8c-48c4-8c05-c010b59425b4]
*According to the OAuth 2.0 specification, a secure connection between an OAuth 2.0 client application and the Acumatica ERP website with a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificate is required. Therefore, you have to set up the Acumatica ERP website for HTTPS before the OAuth 2.0 client application can work with data in Acumatica ERP. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Install\how__Enable_Https|Setting Up an HTTPS Service in Web Server (IIS)].
*When you are registering the client application, you have to be logged in to the tenant whose data the client application needs to access.
)))
==Connecting to the Authorization Endpoint==
The client application connects to the authorization endpoint of Acumatica ERP by specifying the following URL with parameters:[anchor|#_997a7b99-2b00-4a32-bc32-496d1c14f870][anchor|#_0616a4d2-f88c-4472-9878-f37925f59b8f]
*'''URL'''
*:The client application can use one of the following options:[anchor|#_6249ff61-0d93-4b17-87a2-d3273fac40ff][anchor|#_27435c89-261b-42c1-9327-967147c9e845]
**If the client application supports OpenID Connect Discovery, the client application can use the discovery endpoint address, which is {{https://<Acumatica ERP instance URL>/identity/}}. In this address, {{<Acumatica ERP instance URL>}} is the URL of the Acumatica ERP instance to which the client application is going to connect. 
**:For example, for a local Acumatica ERP instance with the name ''AcumaticaDB'', the discovery endpoint address is {{https://localhost/AcumaticaDB/identity/}}. 
**:((({S:Warn}We recommend that the client application use the discovery endpoint address, which eliminates the need to change the application if the authorization or token endpoint address changes.
)))[anchor|#_46c9b3b6-7632-4e4e-b7b8-33def7e13f43]
**The client application can directly use the authorization endpoint address, which is {{https://<Acumatica ERP instance URL>/identity/connect/authorize}}. In this address, {{<Acumatica ERP instance URL>}} is the URL of the Acumatica ERP instance to which the client application is going to connect. 
**:For example, for a local Acumatica ERP instance with the name ''AcumaticaDB'', the authorization endpoint address is {{https://localhost/AcumaticaDB/identity/connect/authorize}}.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Authorization Code Flow When you implement OAuth 2.0 authorization in a client     application to make the application work with  Acumatica ERP,     you can use the authorization code flow. With this authorization flow, the client application     never gets the credentials of the applicable  Acumatica ERP     user. After the user is authenticated in  Acumatica ERP,     the client application receives an authorization code, exchanges it for an access token, and     then uses the access token to work with data in  Acumatica ERP.     When the access token expires, the client application can request a new access token by     providing a refresh token.  The following diagram illustrates the authorization code flow,    whose steps are described in the sections of this topic. Authorization code flow For details on the OAuth 2.0 authorization mechanism, see the specification at  .  Granting Permission to a Client Application Before an OAuth 2.0 client application can work with  Acumatica ERP,     you must register this application in  Acumatica ERP     and provide credentials to the application, as described in  To Register a Client Application with the Authorization Code Flow. After the registration, you have the client ID and the secret value of the client      application. According to the OAuth 2.0 specification, a secure connection between an OAuth                     2.0 client application and the  Acumatica ERP website with a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificate is required. Therefore,                     you have to set up the  Acumatica ERP website for HTTPS before the OAuth 2.0 client application can work with data                     in  Acumatica ERP. For more information, see  Setting Up an HTTPS Service in Web Server (IIS). When you are registering the client application, you have to be logged in to the                     tenant whose data the client application needs to access. Connecting to the Authorization Endpoint The client application connects to the authorization endpoint of  Acumatica ERP     by specifying the following URL with parameters: URL The client application can use one of                 the following options: If the client application supports OpenID Connect             Discovery, the client application can use the discovery endpoint address, which is                      https://< Acumatica ERP instance URL>/identity/ . In this address,  < Acumatica ERP instance URL>  is the URL of the  Acumatica ERP instance to which the client application is going to connect.  For example, for a                 local  Acumatica ERP instance with the name  AcumaticaDB , the discovery endpoint address is                      https://localhost/AcumaticaDB/identity/ .  We recommend                 that the client application use the discovery endpoint address, which eliminates the                 need to change the application if the authorization or token endpoint address                 changes. The client application can directly use the             authorization endpoint address, which is  https://< Acumatica ERP instance URL>/identity/connect/authorize . In this address,                      < Acumatica ERP instance URL>  is the URL of the  Acumatica ERP             instance to which the client application is going to connect.  For example, for a                 local  Acumatica ERP instance with the name  AcumaticaDB , the authorization endpoint address is                      https://localhost/AcumaticaDB/identity/connect/authorize . URL Parameters The client application should specify the following URL         parameters. Parameter Description response_type The type of the OAuth 2.0 flow, which must be set to  code  for the             authorization code flow. client_id The client ID that was assigned to the client             application during the registration of the application in  Acumatica ERP.             The client ID must have the format in which the ID was generated during the registration             of the application. That is, the client ID must include an auto-generated string and the             ID of the company, such as                  88358B02-A48D-A50E-F710-39C1636C30F6@MyCompany . The client             application will have access to the data of the company specified in the client ID. redirect_uri The URI in the client application to which the             response to the request should be sent. The URI must exactly match one of the values             specified for the application in the  Redirect URI  column on the                  Redirect URIs  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM303010|SM303010]) Connected Applications             (SM303010) form. scope The access scope that is requested by the client             application. The scope can be a combination of the following values, delimited by                 spaces: api : Requests access to a web             services API. If a user grants this scope to the application, the client application can             work with either or both of the following types of the web services API: contract-based             SOAP API or contract-based REST API.  If this scope is granted and the  api:concurrent_access                          scope is not granted,  Acumatica ERP manages the sessions of the application through tokens.  Acumatica ERP issues the first access token along with the session ID. If the client                         application requests a new access token by presenting a refresh token,  Acumatica ERP reuses the session ID that was issued for the first access token issued                         with the refresh token. That is, the system uses a single session for each                         access granted to the client application. For details about the license                         limitations related to the number of sessions for client applications, see                              License Restrictions for API Users. offline_access : Requests that a             refresh token be granted. If a user grants this scope to the application,  Acumatica ERP             issues to the client application a refresh token along with the access token. (For             information on issuing the access token, see  Connecting to the Token Endpoint Connecting to the Token Endpoint in this topic.) When the access token has expired, the client             application can request a new access token by sending a request to the token endpoint             and providing the refresh token. api:concurrent_access : Requests             permission for the concurrent use of multiple types of web service APIs. If a user             grants this scope to the application, the client application can access data in  Acumatica ERP             in concurrent mode. In this case,  Acumatica ERP             can maintain multiple sessions for the client application, managing session IDs through             cookies. We recommend that the client application request this scope only if concurrent             access is required for the client application. For details about the license limitations             related to the number of sessions for client applications, see  License Restrictions for API Users.

&scope=api%20offline_access Authorizing a User in  Acumatica ERP and Granting Access The authorization endpoint directs the user of the client application to the login page of  Acumatica ERP, where the user should enter the credentials to log in to a company configured in                 the  Acumatica ERP instance.  The user must log in to the company that was specified in the                          client_id  URL parameter passed to the authorization                     endpoint. (This company is selected by default on the login page.)  If the credentials are accepted by  Acumatica ERP, the system displays the consent form, where the user can confirm that the                 application has access to the requested scopes. Only the scopes that were requested                 by the application are displayed on the consent form. Receiving the Authorization Code Once the user grants access to the requested scopes,  Acumatica ERP     redirects the client application to the  redirect_uri  address that was     specified in the request, and adds the authorization code in the  code  URL     parameter.  Connecting to the Token Endpoint The client application connects to the token endpoint of  Acumatica ERP     by specifying the following URL and the following parameters in the request body: URL The client application can use one of                 the following options: If the client application supports OpenID Connect             Discovery, the client application can use the discovery endpoint address, which is                      https://< Acumatica ERP instance URL>/identity/ . In this address,  < Acumatica ERP instance URL>  is the URL of the  Acumatica ERP instance to which the client application is going to connect.  For example, for a                 local  Acumatica ERP instance with the name  AcumaticaDB , the discovery endpoint address is                      https://localhost/AcumaticaDB/identity/ .  We recommend                 that the client application use the discovery endpoint address, which eliminates the                 need to change the application if the authorization or token endpoint address                 changes. The client application can directly use the token             endpoint address, which is  https://< Acumatica ERP instance URL>/identity/connect/token . In this endpoint,  < Acumatica ERP instance URL>  is the URL of the  Acumatica ERP             instance to which the client application is going to connect.  For example, for a                 local  Acumatica ERP instance with the name  AcumaticaDB , the token endpoint address is                      https://localhost/AcumaticaDB/identity/connect/token .

Receiving the Access Token  Acumatica ERP verifies                 the provided application credentials and issues the access token, which the client                 application should provide with each data request to  Acumatica ERP. During authentication in  Acumatica ERP, if the user has granted to the client application the                      offline_access  scope,  Acumatica ERP issues the refresh token along with the access token. A successful response                 includes the following parameters in the response body. Parameter Description token_type The type of the access token, which is  Bearer . access_token The access token. expires_in The period of time during which the access token is                                     valid. refresh_token The refresh token. The parameter is returned only if the                                          offline_access  scope was granted. Requesting Data with the Access Token The client application should include the access token in the  Authorization                  header of each subsequent request to  Acumatica ERP, as shown in the following HTTP                 example. GET /AcumaticaDB/entity/Default/18.200.001/SalesOrder/SO/000001 HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Authorization: Bearer cde78a99a2dc6388eb8c7242a90cf9bc Refreshing the Access Token The access token is valid for a specific period of time, which is specified in the                 response that returns the access token. When the access token expires, the client                 application can request a new access token by providing the refresh token to the                 token endpoint. To request a new access token, the client application should have                 the following URL and the following parameters specified in the request body: URL The client application can use one of                 the following options: If the client application supports OpenID Connect             Discovery, the client application can use the discovery endpoint address, which is                      https://< Acumatica ERP instance URL>/identity/ . In this address,  < Acumatica ERP instance URL>  is the URL of the  Acumatica ERP instance to which the client application is going to connect.  For example, for a                 local  Acumatica ERP instance with the name  AcumaticaDB , the discovery endpoint address is                      https://localhost/AcumaticaDB/identity/ .  We recommend                 that the client application use the discovery endpoint address, which eliminates the                 need to change the application if the authorization or token endpoint address                 changes. The client application can directly use the token             endpoint address, which is  https://< Acumatica ERP instance URL>/identity/connect/token . In this endpoint,  < Acumatica ERP instance URL>  is the URL of the  Acumatica ERP             instance to which the client application is going to connect.  For example, for a                 local  Acumatica ERP instance with the name  AcumaticaDB , the token endpoint address is                      https://localhost/AcumaticaDB/identity/connect/token . Parameters in the Request Body You specify the following parameters in                         the request body. Parameter Description grant_type The type of the request, which must be set to                                                  refresh_token  for the request of                                             the refresh token. client_id The client ID that was assigned to the client             application during the registration of the application in  Acumatica ERP.             The client ID must have the format in which the ID was generated during the registration             of the application. That is, the client ID must include an auto-generated string and the             ID of the company, such as                  88358B02-A48D-A50E-F710-39C1636C30F6@MyCompany . The client             application will have access to the data of the company specified in the client ID. client_secret The value of the secret that was created for the             client application during the registration of the application in  Acumatica ERP. refresh_token The refresh token that the client application                                             received from the token endpoint along with the access                                             token if the user granted the                                                  offline_access  scope to the                                             client application. Receiving the New Access Token  Acumatica ERP verifies                 the provided application credentials and issues the new access token and the new                 refresh token. To request the access token once again, the client application should                 use the refresh token issued with the previous access token. A successful response                 includes the following parameters in the response body. Parameter Description token_type The type of the access token, which is  Bearer . access_token The access token. expires_in The period of time during which the access token is                                     valid. refresh_token The refresh token.  Logging Out from  Acumatica ERPTo prevent issues with licenses that limit the number of concurrent user sessions, the client                 application should directly call the logout method of the  Acumatica ERP web services API when the application finishes its work with  Acumatica ERP.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
When you implement OAuth 2.0 authorization in a client application to make the application work with Acumatica ERP, you can use the implicit flow, which is a simplified variant of the authorization code flow. {br}

With the implicit flow, the client application never gets the credentials of the applicable Acumatica ERP user. When the user is authenticated in Acumatica ERP, the client application does not receive an authorization code (as with the authorization code flow); instead, the client application directly receives an access token, and then uses the access token to work with data in Acumatica ERP. The access token is valid for a limited period of time and cannot be renewed. {br}

The following diagram illustrates the implicit flow, whose steps are described in the sections later in this topic.[anchor|#_4d9b48e7-5aa1-4f00-9511-f852eb7ab63d][anchor|#_e537377f-3ed6-4870-bde3-6d8e8a10a85b][image:UserGuide/Images/ImplicitFlow.png|popup|Implicit flow|450px]{br}

This flow can be used for clients using a scripting language (such as JavaScript) or for mobile clients. For details on the OAuth 2.0 authorization mechanism, see the specification at [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749].{br}{TOC}
==Granting Permission to a Client Application==
Before an OAuth 2.0 client application can work with Acumatica ERP, you must register this application in Acumatica ERP and provide credentials to the application, as described in [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__how_Register_OAuth2_Client#_3246c4cd-a541-4f63-b928-66b7b411e047|To Register a Client Application with the Implicit Flow]. After the registration, you have the client ID of the client application.{br}

*According to the OAuth 2.0 specification, a secure connection between an OAuth 2.0 client application and the Acumatica ERP website with a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificate is required. Therefore, you have to set up the Acumatica ERP website for HTTPS before the OAuth 2.0 client application can work with data in Acumatica ERP. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Install\how__Enable_Https|Setting Up an HTTPS Service in Web Server (IIS)].
*When you are registering the client application, you have to be logged in to the tenant whose data the client application needs to access.
)))
==Connecting to the Authorization Endpoint==
The client application connects to the authorization endpoint of Acumatica ERP by specifying the following URL and parameters:[anchor|#_71f22fdd-f05a-4ab5-b59a-a9c653857324][anchor|#_139618b0-56de-4f3c-8c8c-14c3bf04bc9b]
*'''URL'''
*:The client application can use one of the following options:[anchor|#_a48773a2-15ea-45ae-a353-90aa36d8ae1b][anchor|#_7a589e69-438b-4fbe-8013-f73a08019379]
**If the client application supports OpenID Connect Discovery, the client application can use the discovery endpoint address, which is {{https://<Acumatica ERP instance URL>/identity/}}. In this address, {{<Acumatica ERP instance URL>}} is the URL of the Acumatica ERP instance to which the client application is going to connect. 
**:For example, for a local Acumatica ERP instance with the name ''AcumaticaDB'', the discovery endpoint address is {{https://localhost/AcumaticaDB/identity/}}. 
**:((({S:Warn}We recommend that the client application use the discovery endpoint address, which eliminates the need to change the application if the authorization or token endpoint address changes.
)))[anchor|#_106407a1-f367-4630-b57c-3a6847d210d4]
**The client application can directly use the authorization endpoint address, which is {{https://<Acumatica ERP instance URL>/identity/connect/authorize}}. In this address, {{<Acumatica ERP instance URL>}} is the URL of the Acumatica ERP instance to which the client application is going to connect. 
**:For example, for a local Acumatica ERP instance with the name ''AcumaticaDB'', the authorization endpoint address is {{https://localhost/AcumaticaDB/identity/connect/authorize}}.
*'''URL Parameters'''
*:The client application should specify the following URL parameters.[anchor|#_d3e143b7-85b9-4f88-a0cb-a3d9ae7c616a]

*<tt>api:concurrent&#95;access</tt>: Requests permission for the concurrent use of multiple types of web service APIs. If a user grants this scope to the application, the client application can access data in Acumatica ERP in concurrent mode. In this case, Acumatica ERP can maintain multiple sessions for the client application, managing session IDs through cookies. We recommend that the client application request this scope only if concurrent access is required for the client application. For details about the license limitations related to the number of sessions for client applications, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_License_Restrictions_API_Users|License Restrictions for API Users].

The user must log in to the company that was specified in the                          client_id  URL parameter passed to the authorization                     endpoint. (This company is selected by default on the login page.)  If the credentials are accepted by  Acumatica ERP, the system displays the consent form, where the user can confirm that the                 application has access to the requested scopes. Only the scopes that were requested                 by the application are displayed on the consent form. Obtaining the Access Token Once the user grants access to the requested scopes,  Acumatica ERP redirects the client application to the  redirect_uri  address,                 which was specified in the request, and adds the access token in the URL parameters.                 The redirect URL includes the following URL parameters. Parameter Description token_type The type of the access token, which is  Bearer . access_token The access token. expires_in The period of time during which the access token is                                     valid. Refresh tokens are not supported by the implicit flow. Requesting Data with the Access Token The client application should include the access token in the  Authorization                  header of each subsequent request to  Acumatica ERP, as shown in the following HTTP                 example.

When you implement OAuth 2.0 authorization in a client application to make the application work with Acumatica ERP, you can use the resource owner password credentials flow. {br}

With the resource owner password credentials flow, the credentials (username and password) of the Acumatica ERP user are provided directly to the client application, which uses the credentials to obtain the access token. When the access token expires, the client application can request a new access token by providing a refresh token. {br}

The following diagram illustrates the resource owner password credentials flow, whose steps are described in the sections later in this topic.[anchor|#_4c2576fb-446c-4bee-86ac-bd995ca14bd3][anchor|#_3bbc1421-7ec9-4dfd-9602-8e4bb6520925][image:UserGuide/Images/ResourceOwnerPasswordCredentialsFlow.png|popup|Resource owner password credentials flow|450px]{br}

For details on the OAuth 2.0 authorization mechanism, see the specification at [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749]. {br}{TOC}
==Granting Permission to a Client Application==
Before an OAuth 2.0 client application can work with Acumatica ERP, you must register this application in Acumatica ERP and provide credentials to the application, as described in [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__how_Register_OAuth2_Client#_97041b21-9ffa-4771-bf36-34c0cc61a593|To Register a Client Application with the Resource Owner Password Flow]. After the registration, you have the client ID and secret value of the client application.{br}

*According to the OAuth 2.0 specification, a secure connection between an OAuth 2.0 client application and the Acumatica ERP website with a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificate is required. Therefore, you have to set up the Acumatica ERP website for HTTPS before the OAuth 2.0 client application can work with data in Acumatica ERP. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Install\how__Enable_Https|Setting Up an HTTPS Service in Web Server (IIS)].
*When you are registering the client application, you have to be logged in to the tenant whose data the client application needs to access.
)))
==Obtaining the Credentials of the Acumatica ERP User==
The client application should obtain the username and password of the applicable Acumatica ERP user, which can then be exchanged for an access token.
==Connecting to the Token Endpoint==
The client application connects to the token endpoint of Acumatica ERP by specifying the following URL and parameters in the request body:[anchor|#_bc29c8d5-7e7f-44d0-90e6-9c4846fec738][anchor|#_6c4c341b-05b7-4b6e-9de9-29548842b23c]

**If the client application supports OpenID Connect Discovery, the client application can use the discovery endpoint address, which is {{https://<Acumatica ERP instance URL>/identity/}}. In this address, {{<Acumatica ERP instance URL>}} is the URL of the Acumatica ERP instance to which the client application is going to connect. 
**:For example, for a local Acumatica ERP instance with the name ''AcumaticaDB'', the discovery endpoint address is {{https://localhost/AcumaticaDB/identity/}}. 
**:((({S:Warn}We recommend that the client application use the discovery endpoint address, which eliminates the need to change the application if the authorization or token endpoint address changes.
)))[anchor|#_8d85f525-6a10-4130-9e53-a4b6758e4261]
**The client application can directly use the token endpoint address, which is {{https://<Acumatica ERP instance URL>/identity/connect/token}}. In this endpoint, {{<Acumatica ERP instance URL>}} is the URL of the Acumatica ERP instance to which the client application is going to connect. 
**:For example, for a local Acumatica ERP instance with the name ''AcumaticaDB'', the token endpoint address is {{https://localhost/AcumaticaDB/identity/connect/token}}.

Granting Permission to a Client Application Before an OAuth 2.0 client application can work with  Acumatica ERP,     you must register this application in  Acumatica ERP     and provide credentials to the application, as described in  To Register a Client Application with the Resource Owner Password Flow. After the registration, you have the client ID and secret value of the client     application. According to the OAuth 2.0 specification, a secure connection between an OAuth                     2.0 client application and the  Acumatica ERP website with a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificate is required. Therefore,                     you have to set up the  Acumatica ERP website for HTTPS before the OAuth 2.0 client application can work with data                     in  Acumatica ERP. For more information, see  Setting Up an HTTPS Service in Web Server (IIS). When you are registering the client application, you have to be logged in to the                     tenant whose data the client application needs to access. Obtaining the Credentials of the  Acumatica ERP     User The client application should obtain the username and password of the applicable  Acumatica ERP     user, which can then be exchanged for an access token. Connecting to the Token Endpoint The client application connects to the token endpoint of  Acumatica ERP     by specifying the following URL and parameters in the request body: URL The client application can use one of                 the following options: If the client application supports OpenID Connect             Discovery, the client application can use the discovery endpoint address, which is                      https://< Acumatica ERP instance URL>/identity/ .

When the access token expires, the client                 application can request a new access token by providing the refresh token to the                 token endpoint. To request a new access token, the client application should have                 the following URL and the following parameters specified in the request body: URL The client application can use one of                 the following options: If the client application supports OpenID Connect             Discovery, the client application can use the discovery endpoint address, which is                      https://< Acumatica ERP instance URL>/identity/ . In this address,  < Acumatica ERP instance URL>  is the URL of the  Acumatica ERP instance to which the client application is going to connect.  For example, for a                 local  Acumatica ERP instance with the name  AcumaticaDB , the discovery endpoint address is                      https://localhost/AcumaticaDB/identity/ .  We recommend                 that the client application use the discovery endpoint address, which eliminates the                 need to change the application if the authorization or token endpoint address                 changes. The client application can directly use the token             endpoint address, which is  https://< Acumatica ERP instance URL>/identity/connect/token . In this endpoint,  < Acumatica ERP instance URL>  is the URL of the  Acumatica ERP             instance to which the client application is going to connect.  For example, for a                 local  Acumatica ERP instance with the name  AcumaticaDB , the token endpoint address is                      https://localhost/AcumaticaDB/identity/connect/token . Parameters in the Request Body You specify the following parameters in                         the request body. Parameter Description grant_type The type of the request, which must be set to                                                  refresh_token  for the request of                                             the refresh token. client_id The client ID that was assigned to the client             application during the registration of the application in  Acumatica ERP.             The client ID must have the format in which the ID was generated during the registration             of the application. That is, the client ID must include an auto-generated string and the             ID of the company, such as                  88358B02-A48D-A50E-F710-39C1636C30F6@MyCompany . The client             application will have access to the data of the company specified in the client ID. client_secret The value of the secret that was created for the             client application during the registration of the application in  Acumatica ERP. refresh_token The refresh token that the client application                                             received from the token endpoint along with the access                                             token if the user granted the                                                  offline_access  scope to the                                             client application. Receiving the New Access Token  Acumatica ERP verifies                 the provided application credentials and issues the new access token and the new                 refresh token. To request the access token once again, the client application should                 use the refresh token issued with the previous access token. A successful response                 includes the following parameters in the response body. Parameter Description token_type The type of the access token, which is  Bearer . access_token The access token. expires_in The period of time during which the access token is                                     valid. refresh_token The refresh token.  Logging Out from  Acumatica ERPTo prevent issues with licenses that limit the number of concurrent user sessions, the client                 application should directly call the logout method of the  Acumatica ERP web services API when the application finishes its work with  Acumatica ERP.

The contract-based web services APIs operate with business logic objects that do not depend on Acumatica ERP forms or their properties and methods. (In this context, ''contract-based'' means based on the object model the web services API provides.) Each contract of the web service is fixed and does not change based on system customization, localization, or any other changes made to Acumatica ERP.{br}

For example, suppose that the contract of the web service contains the definition of the ''CustomerID'' field, which accesses the '''Customer ID''' element on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form. If you have changed the name of the '''Customer ID''' element to '''Customer Identifier''' in a customization project, the contract of the web service remains fully functional and does not require update; also, your application requires no further modifications. You can access the '''Customer Identifier''' element on the form through the same ''CustomerID'' field.
==REST and SOAP Interfaces of the Contract-Based Web Services==[anchor|#_ace9a4a6-cdfb-4895-843f-e39bc7c750f7]
You can work with the contract-based web services through either the REST interface or the SOAP interface. {br}

To use the contract-based REST or SOAP API in your application, first of all, you should decide which endpoint to use. You can find more information on the endpoints and their contracts in [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_CB_Endpoints_and_Contracts|Endpoints and Contracts]. {br}

After that, you can use the REST API in your application. For details on the REST API, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__mng_Work_with_Contract_Based_REST|Working with the Contract-Based REST API]. For the REST API reference, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__IS_CB_REST_API_Reference|Contract-Based REST API Reference].{br}

After you have selected the endpoint, to use the contract-based SOAP API in your application, you should obtain the WSDL description of the contract of this endpoint, import the WSDL file into your development environment (as described in [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__how_CB_Configure_Application|To Configure the Client Application]), and start developing your application. You can find the description of the SOAP API methods in [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__IS_CB_API_Reference|Contract-Based SOAP API Reference]. {br}

You can find examples of how to use the contract-based SOAP and REST API in the ''I300 Web Services: Basic | Data Retrieval'', ''I310 Web Services: Advanced | Data Retrieval'', and ''I320 Web Services: Data Manipulation'' training course.

You access the contract-based REST and SOAP API through endpoints that you configure on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_70_60|Web Service Endpoints] ([~/?ScreenId=SM207060|SM207060]) form. 
==Endpoints and Contracts==
An ''endpoint'' is an entry point to the Acumatica ERP web services. For each endpoint that a web service API provides, a ''contract'' of the endpoint defines the entities, with their actions and fields, that are available through the endpoint and the methods that you can use to work with these entities. {br}

The endpoint is identified by the URL that you use to access the web services API. You can see the name and version of an endpoint in its URL. For example, the endpoint {{http://localhost/AcumaticaDB/entity/Default/18.200.001?wsdl}} has the version ''18.200.001'' and the name ''Default''. The version of an endpoint defines the list of entities, with their actions and fields you can work with through this endpoint.{br}

The contract of an endpoint is identified by contract version. The version of a contract defines the list of methods for working with entities that you can use when working with Acumatica ERP through the endpoint with this version of the contract. For the difference between the contract versions, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_Comparison_of_Contract_Versions|Comparison of Contract Versions].[anchor|#_0af2cc4a-9189-4bc3-a6b6-7c04420bef43]((({S:Warn}Contract Version 1 is not supported starting from Acumatica ERP 2018 R2.
)))
==System and Custom Endpoints==
You can use two types of endpoints to access the web services: [anchor|#ul_xtg_kl3_ss]
*'''System endpoint''': The system endpoints are precofigured in the system and have the ''Default'' name. Each of these endpoints has a predefined contract, which includes the API that is preconfigured in the system. You cannot change the contract of a system endpoint. 
*:If the API that is available in the contract of a system endpoint is sufficient for the requirements of your application, you should use the system endpoint for accessing Acumatica ERP web services. You can use the same system endpoint in future versions of Acumatica ERP. For example, if you use the system endpoint with Version 17.200.001 and Contract Version 3 to access Acumatica ERP 2017 R2, you can use the same endpoint to access future versions of Acumatica ERP. [anchor|#_6bba19c9-6bb4-479d-b258-552c96a684fb]((({S:Warn}Acumatica ERP can include endpoints preconfigured in the system that have the names other than ''Default''. The system uses these endpoints internally. We do not recommend that you use these endpoints.
)))
*'''Custom endpoint''': By default, there are no custom endpoints in the system. If the API provided by the system endpoint is not sufficient for the requirements of your application, you can create a custom endpoint. You can configure the contract of a custom endpoint by adding the needed elements of the API to the contract. 
*:If you need to use the same custom endpoint in future versions of Acumatica ERP, you should maintain it in future versions.
{br}

The following diagram provides an example of multiple endpoints configured in the system. The diagram shows two system endpoints with Contract Versions 2 and 3 and two custom endpoints with the names ''EastEndpoint'' and ''WestEndpoint''.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
The contract of an endpoint defines the following elements of the contract-based web services API:[anchor|#ul_ksn_ppj_qs]
*'''Entities''': An entity corresponds to a business logic object that you are going to work with. For example, the contract of a system endpoint includes the ''Warehouse'' entity, which represents a warehouse and holds the data related to the warehouse. This entity is associated with the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form. 
*:For a custom endpoint, if you are going to use an entity to transfer data to or from Acumatica ERP, you should associate this entity with a particular Acumatica ERP form. For example, you can create a ''Vendor'' entity, which represents a vendor. This entity is associated with the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form.
*'''Fields''': The fields of an entity correspond to the parameters of a business logic object. For example, the ''Warehouse'' entity that is available through the system endpoint has the ''Description'' and ''WarehouseID'' fields, among others. In the contract, these fields are mapped to the '''Description''' and the '''Warehouse ID''' elements of the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] form. 
*:For a custom endpoint, if you need to connect the field with a particular element on an Acumatica ERP form, you should map the field to this element. For example, if you have created the ''Vendor'' entity, which designates a vendor, you can add the field ''VendorID'' to the entity and connect this field with the '''Vendor ID''' element of the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] form. 
*'''Actions''': The actions of an entity correspond to the actions that can be applied to a business logic object. For example, the ''TransferOrder'' entity, which is available through the system endpoint, has the ''ReleaseTransferOrder'' action. This action corresponds to the '''Release''' button on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_40_00|Transfers] ([~/?ScreenId=IN304000|IN304000]) form. 
*:For a custom endpoint, if you need to use an Acumatica ERP action, you should add this action to the contract of the custom endpoint with the needed parameters. For example, suppose you want to add an action that changes the customer ID of an existing customer, you can add the action ''ChangeID'' and map it to the '''Change ID''' action, which is available on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form. The new action should have one parameter, which specifies the new ID of a customer as the '''Change ID''' action has.
{br}

When you add a new entity to a contract, you should specify the type of the entity, which can be one of the following:[anchor|#ul_z5f_zgk_ss]
*''Top-Level'': Entities of this type are the main entities of the contract. A top-level entity usually corresponds to an Acumatica ERP form. For example, the ''Warehouse'' entity of the contract of the system endpoint is a top-level entity that corresponds to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] form. 
*''Detail'': Detail entities correspond to the detail lines of a master-detail form. A detail entity exists only as a part of a top-level entity. For example, the top-level entity ''SalesOrder'' of the contract of the system endpoint contains the detail entity ''SalesOrderDetail'', which corresponds to a detail line on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, as shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#image_hxh_ppv_ts][image:UserGuide/Images/WebServiceEndpoints_DetailEntity.png|popup|Detail entity|450px]
*''Linked'': Linked entities are supplementary entities of a contract. A linked entity usually corresponds to a part of an Acumatica ERP form and is related to one top-level entity of the contract or multiple such entities. For example, the top-level entity ''Contact'' of the contract of the system endpoint contains the linked entity ''Address'', which corresponds to the '''Address''' group of fields on the '''Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) form, as shown in the following screenshot.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[API Entities, Fields, and Actions The contract of an endpoint defines the following elements of the contract-based web services     API: Entities : An entity corresponds to a business logic object that you are going to work      with. For example, the contract of a system endpoint includes the  Warehouse  entity,      which represents a warehouse and holds the data related to the warehouse. This entity is      associated with the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses (IN204000) form.  For a       custom endpoint, if you are going to use an entity to transfer data to or from  Acumatica ERP, you should associate this entity with a particular  Acumatica ERP       form. For example, you can create a  Vendor  entity, which represents a vendor. This       entity is associated with the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors (AP303000)       form. Fields : The fields of an entity correspond to the parameters of a business logic      object. For example, the  Warehouse  entity that is available through the system endpoint      has the  Description  and  WarehouseID  fields, among others. In the contract, these      fields are mapped to the  Description  and the  Warehouse       ID  elements of the Summary area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses form.  For a custom endpoint, if you need to connect the field with a particular element       on an  Acumatica ERP       form, you should map the field to this element. For example, if you have created the         Vendor  entity, which designates a vendor, you can add the field  VendorID  to the       entity and connect this field with the  Vendor ID  element of the Summary       area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors form.  Actions : The actions of an entity correspond to the actions that can be applied to a      business logic object. For example, the  TransferOrder  entity, which is available through      the system endpoint, has the  ReleaseTransferOrder  action. This action corresponds to the        Release  button on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN304000|IN304000]) Transfers (IN304000) form.  For a custom endpoint, if you need to use an  Acumatica ERP       action, you should add this action to the contract of the custom endpoint with the needed       parameters. For example, suppose you want to add an action that changes the customer ID of an       existing customer, you can add the action  ChangeID  and map it to the  Change        ID  action, which is available on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers form. The new action should have one parameter, which specifies the new ID of a customer as       the  Change ID  action has. When you add a new entity to a contract, you should specify the type of the entity, which can    be one of the following: Top-Level : Entities of this type are the main entities of the contract. A top-level      entity usually corresponds to an  Acumatica ERP      form. For example, the  Warehouse  entity of the contract of the system endpoint is a      top-level entity that corresponds to the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses form.  Detail : Detail entities correspond to the detail lines of a master-detail form. A      detail entity exists only as a part of a top-level entity. For example, the top-level entity        SalesOrder  of the contract of the system endpoint contains the detail entity        SalesOrderDetail , which corresponds to a detail line on the  Document       Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000)      form, as shown in the following screenshot. Detail entity Linked : Linked entities are supplementary entities of a contract. A linked entity      usually corresponds to a part of an  Acumatica ERP      form and is related to one top-level entity of the contract or multiple such entities. For      example, the top-level entity  Contact  of the contract of the system endpoint contains      the linked entity  Address , which corresponds to the  Address  group      of fields on the  Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) Contacts (CR302000) form, as shown in the following screenshot.

You can work with the values of the custom fields that are not included in the entity definition. [anchor|#_59f20644-5893-4693-9844-133358ec97c4]((({S:Hint}Custom fields can correspond to the following elements:[anchor|#_01fab521-d65d-4e46-90da-8db841dbedc0]
*The predefined elements on an Acumatica ERP form that are not included in the entity definition
*The elements that were added to the Acumatica ERP form in a customization project
*The user-defined fields
))){br}

To work with the needed custom field, you need to know the name of the data view that contains the corresponding custom element and the name of the field, which are described in detail below.{br}{TOC}
==Field Name and View Name==
A field name is the internal name of a particular element of an Acumatica ERP form. A view name is the name of the data view to which a particular element belongs. For example, the '''Posting Class''' element on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form has the {{PostClassID}} field name and belong to the {{ItemSettings}} data view. {br}

To find out the field name and view name, on the title bar of the form, you click '''Customization''' > '''Inspect Element''' and click the needed element on the form. In the '''Element Properties''' dialog box, which opens, you find the field name in the '''Data Field''' element and the view name in the '''View Name''' element, as shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_3cdc5ada-f62b-4fe0-a539-669b9e9bac83][anchor|#_8d3ae80a-d793-43ee-8339-9f7050adec08][image:UserGuide/Images/REST_Data_Field.png|popup|Field name and view name|450px]{br}

In the contract-based REST API, you can also find out the field name and the view name through the special URL. For details on the URL and the HTTP method, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_REST_Get_List_of_Custom_Fields|Retrieval of the Schema of Custom Fields].{br}

In the contract-based SOAP API, you can find out the field name and the view name in code by using the <tt>GetCustomFieldSchema()</tt> method. For details on the method, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_CB_GetCustomFieldSchema|GetCustomFieldSchema() Method]. 
==Field Name and View Name of a User-Defined Field==
For any user-defined field, the view name is {{Document}}. The field name is {{Attribute<AttributeID>}}, where you replace {{<AttributeID>}} with the ID of the attribute that corresponds to the user-defined field.{br}

For example, suppose that on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, you have added a user-defined field for the ''OPERATSYST'' attribute. You work with this user-defined field by using the {{Document}} view name and the {{AttributeOPERATSYST}} field name.
==Use of Custom Fields==
For details on retrieving the values of custom fields by using the contract-based REST API, see the description of the ''$custom'' parameter in [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_REST_Parameters|Parameters for Retrieving Records]. For details on specifying the values of custom fields, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_REST_Entity_Representation_in_JSON|Representation of a Record in JSON Format].{br}

For details on working with custom elements through the contract-based SOAP API, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_CB_CustomFields_2|CustomFields Property]. ]]></column>

You work with this         user-defined field by using the  Document  view name and the            AttributeOPERATSYST  field name. Use of Custom Fields For details on retrieving the values of custom fields by using the contract-based REST API,         see the description of the  $custom  parameter in  Parameters for Retrieving Records.

If the API provided by the system endpoint of Acumatica ERP is not sufficient for the requirements of your application, you can create a custom endpoint from scratch or by extending an existing endpoint.
==An Extension of an Existing Endpoint==
If you are creating an endpoint as an extension of an existing endpoint, for the API elements that were inherited from the base endpoint, you cannot edit the names and types of the entities and fields, and the names, types, and parameters of the actions. In the contract of the new endpoint, you can add new top-level entities, new fields or entities to any entity, and new actions. Then you can use both the API that you added to the contract of the endpoint and the API of the base endpoint in your application. For information on how to extend an existing endpoint, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__how_Extend_Endpoint|To Extend an Existing Endpoint]. {br}

The new endpoint that was created as an extension of an existing endpoint has the version of the contract of the base endpoint; that is, the API methods for working with entities are the same for the base endpoint and the new endpoint. See [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__IS_CB_REST_API_Reference|Contract-Based REST API Reference] and [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__IS_CB_API_Reference|Contract-Based SOAP API Reference] for the description of the API methods of the needed contract version. 
==An Endpoint Created from Scratch==
If you are creating an endpoint from scratch, you should add the needed elements of the API to the contract. Then you can use these API elements in your application. For information on how to create an endpoint from scratch, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__how_Create_Endpoint|To Create a Custom Endpoint]. {br}

The new endpoint that is created from scratch always has the latest version of the contract. For the description of the API methods for working with entities that are available in the latest version of the contract, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__IS_CB_REST_API_Reference|Contract-Based REST API Reference] and [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__IS_CB_API_Reference|Contract-Based SOAP API Reference].

You may need to create an extension of an endpoint if you want to use the entities that are defined in the contract of the existing endpoint but you also need some additional entities, fields, and actions in the contract. For example, the contract of the system endpoint with the name ''Default'' and Version ''6.00.001'' contains the <tt>Address</tt> entity, which includes the following fields: <tt>AddressLine1</tt>, <tt>AddressLine2</tt>, <tt>City</tt>, <tt>Country</tt>, <tt>PostalCode</tt>, and <tt>State</tt>. Suppose that you want to add the new {{GPSCoordinates}} field to the <tt>Address</tt> entity of the contract and use it with other API of the contract. You cannot edit the contract of the system endpoint; instead, you should create an endpoint that is based on this system endpoint, and add the new {{GPSCoordinates}} field to the <tt>Address</tt> entity of the contract of the new endpoint.{br}

This procedure describes how to create an endpoint that is based on an existing endpoint.

By using the contract-based REST API, you obtain existing records from Acumatica ERP, create new records, update, and delete them. You work with the records in Acumatica ERP by using the entities that are defined in the contract of the endpoint that you use to access the service. You pass records to and receive them from the contract-based REST API in JavaScript object notation (JSON) format. JSON is a text format for transmitting data objects that consist of key-value pairs.{br}

To represent a record in JSON format, you use the rules that are described in the following sections. You do not need to specify the values of all fields of an entity; you can specify the values of only the needed fields.{br}{TOC}
==System Fields==
You specify the value of a system field (such as <tt>ID</tt>, <tt>RowNumber</tt>, and <tt>Note</tt>) of an entity in the following format. {{{{&lt;Field name&gt; : &lt;Value&gt;
}}}}{br}

For example, if you need to specify the note ''Imported'' for an entity, you use the following string. {{{{"Note" : "Imported"
}}}}
==General Fields==
You specify the value of a general field (that is, a field that is not a system field) of an entity in the following format. {{{{&lt;Field name&gt; : {value : &lt;Value&gt;}
}}}} For example, if you need to specify ''JOHNGOOD'' as the customer ID of a customer record, you use the following string. {{{{"CustomerID" : {value : "JOHNGOOD"}
}}}}
==Linked Entities==
You specify the values of the fields of a linked entity in the following format. {{{{&lt;Field name&gt; : 
  {
    &lt;List of fields of the linked entity with values
  }
}}}} For example, if you need to specify the values of an email address and the address of a customer main contact, you use the following string.{{{{"MainContact" : 
    {
      "Email" : {value : "demo@gmail.com" },
      "Address" : 
        {
          "AddressLine1" : {value : "4030 Lake Washington Blvd NE" },
          "AddressLine2" : {value : "Suite 100" },
          "City" : {value : "Kirkland" },
          "State" : {value : "WA" },
          "PostalCode" : {value : "98033" }
        }      
    } 
}}}}
==Detail Entities==
You specify the values of the fields of a detail entity in the following format.{{{{&lt;Field name&gt; : 
  [ 
    {
      &lt;List of fields of the detail entity with the values}
    }, 
    {
      &lt;List of fields of the detail entity with the values&gt;
    }, 
    … 
  ]
}}}}For example, if you need to specify the values of two detail lines of a sales order, you use the following string.{{{{"Details" : [
  {
    "InventoryID" : {value: "AALEGO500"},
    "Quantity" : {value: 10},
    "UOM" : {value: "PIECE"},
  },
  {
    "InventoryID" : {value: "CONGRILL"},
    "Quantity" : {value: 1},
    "UOM" : {value: "PIECE"},
  }
]
}}}}
==Custom Fields==
You specify the values of the custom fields (that is, the fields that are not included in the contract of the endpoint) in the following format.[anchor|#_360203f4-d20c-42de-87e3-f32a36b3e1a8]((({S:Hint}Custom fields can correspond to the following elements:[anchor|#_e70bb9bb-2f82-4b92-9b69-0a6a800a9086]
*The predefined elements on an Acumatica ERP form that are not included in the entity definition
*The elements that were added to the Acumatica ERP form in a customization project
*The user-defined fields
))){{{{"custom" : 
  {
    &lt;View name&gt; : 
     { 
       &lt;Field name&gt; : 
         { 
           "type" : &lt;value&gt;, 
           "value" : &lt;value&gt; 
         }
     }
  }

))){br}

For example, suppose that you added the '''Personal ID''' element to the '''Main Contact''' area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form in a customization project. The <tt>Contact</tt> entity, which is available through the <tt>MainContact</tt> property of the <tt>Customer</tt> entity, contains the '''Personal ID''' custom element. This element has the {{UsrPersonalID}} field name and belongs to the {{DefContact}} data view. The type of the element depends on the contract version (in Contract Version 2, <tt>String</tt>; in Contract Version 3, <tt>CustomStringField</tt>). Therefore, to specify the value ''AB123456'' of the '''Personal ID''' custom element for the customer with ID ''JOHNGOOD'' through the REST API, you use one of the following strings depending on the contract version of the endpoint:[anchor|#_bbff609c-f5a8-4692-b6c1-4764c331ac25]

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Representation of a Record in JSON Format By using the contract-based REST API, you obtain existing records from  Acumatica ERP, create new records, update, and delete them. You work with the records in  Acumatica ERP by using the entities that are defined in the contract of the endpoint that you use to         access the service. You pass records to and receive them from the contract-based REST API in         JavaScript object notation (JSON) format. JSON is a text format for transmitting data         objects that consist of key-value pairs. To represent a record in JSON format, you use the rules that are described in the following         sections. You do not need to specify the values of all fields of an entity; you can specify         the values of only the needed fields. System Fields You specify the value of a system field (such as  ID ,            RowNumber , and  Note ) of an entity in the following         format.  <Field name> : <Value> For example, if you need to specify the note  Imported  for an entity, you use the         following string.  "Note" : "Imported" General Fields You specify the value of a general field (that is, a field that is not a system field) of         an entity in the following format.          <Field name> : {value : <Value>}  For example, if you need to         specify  JOHNGOOD  as the customer ID of a customer record, you use the following         string.  "CustomerID" : {value : "JOHNGOOD"} Linked Entities You specify the values of the fields of a linked entity in the following format.          <Field name> : 
  {
    <List of fields of the linked entity with values
  }          For example, if you need to specify the values of an email address and the address of a         customer main contact, you use the following         string. "MainContact" : 
    {
      "Email" : {value : "demo@gmail.com" },
      "Address" : 
        {
          "AddressLine1" : {value : "4030 Lake Washington Blvd NE" },
          "AddressLine2" : {value : "Suite 100" },
          "City" : {value : "Kirkland" },
          "State" : {value : "WA" },
          "PostalCode" : {value : "98033" }
        }      
    }  Detail Entities You specify the values of the fields of a detail entity in the following         format. <Field name> : 
  [ 
    {
      <List of fields of the detail entity with the values}
    }, 
    {
      <List of fields of the detail entity with the values>
    }, 
    … 
  ] For         example, if you need to specify the values of two detail lines of a sales order, you use the         following         string. "Details" : [
  {
    "InventoryID" : {value: "AALEGO500"},
    "Quantity" : {value: 10},
    "UOM" : {value: "PIECE"},
  },
  {
    "InventoryID" : {value: "CONGRILL"},
    "Quantity" : {value: 1},
    "UOM" : {value: "PIECE"},
  }
] Custom Fields You specify the values of the custom fields (that is, the fields that are not included in         the contract of the endpoint) in the following format. Custom fields can correspond to the following elements: The predefined elements on an  Acumatica ERP form that are not included in the entity definition The elements that were added to the  Acumatica ERP form in a customization project The user-defined fields "custom" : 
  {
    <View name> : 
     { 
       <Field name> : 
         { 
           "type" : <value>, 
           "value" : <value> 
         }
     }
  } You         use this block in the JSON representation of the entity (top-level, detail, or linked) that         contains this custom field.  For details on how to find out the field name and the name           of the data view, see  Custom Fields.          For example, suppose that you added the  Personal ID  element to the            Main Contact  area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000) form in a customization project. The            Contact  entity, which is available through the            MainContact  property of the  Customer  entity,         contains the  Personal ID  custom element. This element has the            UsrPersonalID  field name and belongs to the  DefContact          data view. The type of the element depends on the contract version (in Contract Version 2,            String ; in Contract Version 3,  CustomStringField ).         Therefore, to specify the value  AB123456  of the  Personal ID          custom element for the customer with ID  JOHNGOOD  through the REST API, you use one of         the following strings depending on the contract version of the endpoint: For Contract Version             3 {
  "CustomerID" : {value : "JOHNGOOD" } ,
  "MainContact" : 
    {
      "custom" : 
        {
          "DefContact" : 
            { 
              "UsrPersonalID" : 
                { 
                  "type" : "CustomStringField", 
                  "value" : "AB123456" 
                }
            }
        }
    }
} For Contract Version             2 {

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Creation of a Record When you need to create a record by using the contract-based REST API, you access the                 needed URL address with the  PUT  HTTP method and pass the record                 representation in JSON format in the request body. See the following sections for                 details on the URL, parameters, HTTP method, HTTP body, HTTP headers, and response                 format. URL  If you need to create a record in  Acumatica ERP, you use the following URL. http://<Base endpoint URL>/<Top-level entity> The URL has the following components: <Base endpoint URL>  is the URL of the contract-based                         endpoint through which you are going to work with  Acumatica ERP, which has the following format:  http://< Acumatica ERP instance URL>/entity/<Endpoint name>/<Endpoint                             version>/ .  <Top-level entity>  is the name of the entity for which                         you are going to create a record. For example, suppose that you want to create a stock item record in a local  Acumatica ERP instance with the name  AcumaticaDB  by using the system endpoint with the                 name  Default  and Version 18.200.001. You should use the following URL to                 create a record:                      http://localhost/AcumaticaDB/entity/Default/18.200.001/StockItem . Parameters You can use the following parameters when you retrieve a record from  Acumatica ERP: $expand : To specify the linked and detail entities to be                         expanded $select : To specify the fields of the entity to be returned $custom : To specify the fields that are not defined in the                         contract to be returned For detailed descriptions of the parameters, see  Parameters for Retrieving Records. HTTP Method, HTTP Body You use the  PUT  HTTP method and pass a record in JSON format in the                 request body. You can find details on how to represent a record in JSON format in                      Representation of a Record in JSON Format. See below for an example of a customer record representation in JSON                 format. {

When you need to update an existing record by using the contract-based REST API, you access the needed URL with the {{PUT}} HTTP method and pass the record representation in JSON format in the request body. See the following sections for details on the URL, parameters, HTTP method, HTTP body, HTTP headers, and response format.{br}{TOC}
==URL==
If you need to update a record in Acumatica ERP, you use the following URL.{{{{http://&lt;Base endpoint URL&gt;/&lt;Top-level entity&gt;
}}}}{br}

The URL has the following components:[anchor|#_5863ce77-8be1-44d6-9342-fb7c2c1b6025]
*{{<Base endpoint URL>}} is the URL of the contract-based endpoint through which you are going to work with Acumatica ERP, which has the following format: {{http://<Acumatica ERP instance URL>/entity/<Endpoint name>/<Endpoint version>/}}. 
*{{<Top-level entity>}} is the name of the entity for which you are going to update a record.
{br}

For example, suppose that you want to update a stock item record in a local Acumatica ERP instance with the name ''AcumaticaDB'' by using the system endpoint with the name ''Default'' and Version 18.200.001. You would use the following URL to update a record: {{http://localhost/AcumaticaDB/entity/Default/18.200.001/StockItem}}.[anchor|#_0aabf54c-3ee5-4703-9d80-711dbdd90909]
==Parameters==
You can use the following parameters when you are updating a record in Acumatica ERP:[anchor|#_33d0cea7-56e5-4c7e-a498-0b739b0429ed]
*''$filter'': To specify filtering conditions that identify the record to be updated
*''$expand'': To specify the linked and detail entities to be expanded
*''$select'': To specify the fields of the entity to be returned
*''$custom'': To specify the fields that are not defined in the contract to be returned
{br}

For detailed descriptions of the parameters, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_REST_Parameters|Parameters for Retrieving Records].
==HTTP Method, HTTP Body==
You use the {{PUT}} HTTP method and pass a record in JSON format in the request body. You can find details on how to represent a record in JSON format in [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_REST_Entity_Representation_in_JSON|Representation of a Record in JSON Format]. {br}

To make it possible for the record to be found by Acumatica ERP, you can use any of the following approaches:[anchor|#_8887242b-00d3-4bcf-a30d-f13dd7de374d]
*Specify the values of the key fields in the record representation in JSON format.
*Specify the value of the <tt>ID</tt> property in the record representation in JSON format.
*Specify the filtering conditions that identify the record in the ''$filter'' parameter of the method. For details on the parameter, see the [[#_0aabf54c-3ee5-4703-9d80-711dbdd90909|Parameters] section in this topic.
{br}

If you want to delete a detail line during update, you should specify {{true}} as the value of the <tt>delete</tt> property of the corresponding detail entity: {{"delete" : true}}. To identify the detail line to be deleted, you can specify either the values of the key fields of the detail line or the value of the <tt>ID</tt> property.
==HTTP Headers==
You can specify the following headers in the request.[anchor|#_40bf8194-174d-41e1-9ba1-dce56cf597b4]

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Update of a Record When you need to update an existing record by using the contract-based REST API, you                 access the needed URL with the  PUT  HTTP method and pass the record                 representation in JSON format in the request body. See the following sections for                 details on the URL, parameters, HTTP method, HTTP body, HTTP headers, and response                 format. URL If you need to update a record in  Acumatica ERP, you use the following                 URL. http://<Base endpoint URL>/<Top-level entity> The URL has the following components: <Base endpoint URL>  is the URL of the contract-based                         endpoint through which you are going to work with  Acumatica ERP, which has the following format:  http://< Acumatica ERP instance URL>/entity/<Endpoint name>/<Endpoint                             version>/ .  <Top-level entity>  is the name of the entity for which                         you are going to update a record. For example, suppose that you want to update a stock item record in a local  Acumatica ERP instance with the name  AcumaticaDB  by using the system endpoint with the                 name  Default  and Version 18.200.001. You would use the following URL to                 update a record:                      http://localhost/AcumaticaDB/entity/Default/18.200.001/StockItem . Parameters You can use the following parameters when you are updating a record in  Acumatica ERP: $filter : To specify filtering conditions that identify the record                         to be updated $expand : To specify the linked and detail entities to be                         expanded $select : To specify the fields of the entity to be returned $custom : To specify the fields that are not defined in the                         contract to be returned For detailed descriptions of the parameters, see  Parameters for Retrieving Records. HTTP Method, HTTP Body You use the  PUT  HTTP method and pass a record in JSON format in the                 request body. You can find details on how to represent a record in JSON format in                      Representation of a Record in JSON Format.  To make it possible for the record to be found by  Acumatica ERP, you can use any of the following approaches: Specify the values of the key fields in the record representation in JSON                         format. Specify the value of the  ID  property in the record                         representation in JSON format. Specify the filtering conditions that identify the record in the                              $filter  parameter of the method. For details on the                         parameter, see the  Parameters Parameters section in this topic. If you want to delete a detail line during update, you should specify                      true  as the value of the  delete  property of                 the corresponding detail entity:  "delete" : true . To identify the                 detail line to be deleted, you can specify either the values of the key fields of                 the detail line or the value of the  ID  property. HTTP Headers You can specify the following headers in the request. Header Description Accept Specifies the format of the response body, which can be one of                                 the following: application/json text/json Content-Type Specifies the format of the request body, which can be one of the                                     following: application/json text/json If-Match Changes the behavior of the  PUT  request, which                                 normally either creates a new record or updates an existing one. If                                 you only want to update a record, use the optional                                      If-Match  header with the  *                                  value. Response The response of a successful method call contains the updated record in JSON format                 in the response body.  Status Codes The following table lists the HTTP status codes that the system returns for a request                 that updates a record. Code Description 200 The request has been completed successfully. The response body                                 contains the updated record. 400 The data specified in the request is invalid. 401 The user is not signed in to the system. 403 The user has insufficient rights to access the                  Acumatica ERP             form that corresponds to the entity. 412 You have used the  If-Match  header with the                                      *  value, and the record does not exist. 429 The number of requests has exceeded the limit             imposed by the license (see  License Restrictions for API Users). 500 An internal server error has occurred.

To retrieve a record by the values of its key fields from Acumatica ERP by using the contract-based REST API, you access the needed URL with the {{GET}} HTTP method and specify the fields that should be returned in the parameters of the method. See the following sections for details on the URL, parameters, HTTP method, HTTP headers, and response format.{br}{TOC}
==URL ==
If you need to obtain a particular record with the known key fields, you use the following URL{{{{http://&lt;Base endpoint URL&gt;/&lt;Top-level entity&gt;/&lt;Key value 1&gt;/&lt;Key value 2&gt;
}}}}{br}

The URL has the following components:[anchor|#_d8758594-84f7-4fc8-853e-2ea4f7661992]
*{{<Base endpoint URL>}} is the URL of the contract-based endpoint through which you are going to work with Acumatica ERP, which has the following format: {{http://<Acumatica ERP instance URL>/entity/<Endpoint name>/<Endpoint version>/}}. 
*{{<Top-level entity>}} is the name of the entity for which you are going to retrieve a record. 
*{{<Key value 1>}} and {{<Key value 2>}} are the values of the key fields of the record to be retrieved. You use the number and order of key fields as they are defined on the corresponding Acumatica ERP form.
*:((({S:Warn}You can pass the key fields separated by vertical bar (''|'') instead of slash(''/'').
)))
{br}

For example, suppose that you want to retrieve the sales order with order type ''SO'' and order number ''000123'' from a local Acumatica ERP instance with the name ''AcumaticaDB'' by using the system endpoint with the name ''Default'' and Version 18.200.001. You should use the following URL to retrieve the sales order: {{http://localhost/AcumaticaDB/entity/Default/18.200.001/SalesOrder/SO/000123}}.
==Parameters==
You can use the following parameters when you retrieve a record from Acumatica ERP:[anchor|#_33d0cea7-56e5-4c7e-a498-0b739b0429ed]

))){br}{TOC}
==URL ==
If you need to obtain a particular record with the entity ID, you use the following URL.{{{{http://&lt;Base endpoint URL&gt;/&lt;Top-level entity&gt;/&lt;Entity ID&gt;
}}}}{br}

The URL has the following components:[anchor|#_236c6748-b636-462a-9fe5-b7634d359de9]
*{{<Base endpoint URL>}} is the URL of a contract-based endpoint through which you are going to work with Acumatica ERP. This URL has the following format: {{http://<Acumatica ERP instance URL>/entity/<Endpoint name>/<Endpoint version>/}}. 
*{{<Top-level entity>}} is the name of the entity for which you are going to retrieve a record. 
*{{<Entity ID>}} is the ID of the record to be retrieved.
{br}

For example, suppose that you want to retrieve the sales order with entity ID ''a6295b33-c7f6-e811-b817-00155d408001'' from a local Acumatica ERP instance with the name ''AcumaticaDB'' by using the system endpoint with the name ''Default'' and Version 18.200.001.

==C# Example==
The following code shows an example of a class that implements the retrieval of records from Acumatica ERP through the REST API.{{{{public class RestService: IDisposable
{
    private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;

    private readonly string _acumaticaBaseUrl;

    public RestService(
      string acumaticaBaseUrl, string userName, string password, 
      string company, string branch)
    {
        _acumaticaBaseUrl = acumaticaBaseUrl;
        _httpClient = new HttpClient(
            new HttpClientHandler
            {
                UseCookies = true,
                CookieContainer = new CookieContainer()
            })
        {
            BaseAddress = new Uri(acumaticaBaseUrl + 
              "/entity/Default/18.200.001/"),

            {
                Accept = {MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue.Parse("application/json")}
            }
        };
        _httpClient.PostAsJsonAsync(
          acumaticaBaseUrl + "/entity/auth/login", new
            {
                name = userName,
                password = password,
                company = company,
                branch = branch
            }).Result
            .EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
    }

    void IDisposable.Dispose()
    {
        _httpClient.PostAsync(_acumaticaBaseUrl + "/entity/auth/logout", 
          new ByteArrayContent(new byte[0])).Wait();
        _httpClient.Dispose();
    }

    public string Get(string entityName, string parameters)
    {
        var res = _httpClient.GetAsync(
          _acumaticaBaseUrl + "/entity/Default/18.200.001/"
          + entityName + "?" + parameters).Result
            .EnsureSuccessStatusCode();

        return res.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().Result;
    }
}
}}}}{br}

The following code uses the {{RestService.Get()}} method, which is defined in the previous code fragment, to retrieve the list of stock item records that have the ''Active'' status in Acumatica ERP and have been modified within the past month. The code uses the ''$expand'' parameter to retrieve the warehouse details of each record.{{{{public static void ExportStockItems()
{
    //Initialize the REST service
    RestService rs = new RestService(
            Properties.Settings.Default.AcumaticaBaseUrl,
            Properties.Settings.Default.UserName,
            Properties.Settings.Default.Password,
            Properties.Settings.Default.Company,
            Properties.Settings.Default.Branch
        );

    //Specify the parameter to filter records by status and last modified date
    string parameters1 = 
      "$filter=ItemStatus eq 'Active' and LastModified gt datetimeoffset'" + 
        WebUtility.UrlEncode(new DateTimeOffset(DateTime.Now.AddMonths(-1))
        .ToString("yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffK")) + "'";

    //Specify the parameter to obtain vendor details
    string parameters2 = "$expand=WarehouseDetails";

    //Retrieve the list of stock items
    string stockItems = rs.Get("StockItem", parameters1 + "&" + parameters2);
}
}}}}
==Usage Notes==
When multiple records are retrieved from Acumatica ERP through an endpoint with Contract Version 3, the system tries to optimize the retrieval of the records and obtain all needed records in one request to the database (instead of requesting the records one by one). If the optimization fails, the system returns an error, which specifies the entities or fields that caused the failure of the optimized request. To prevent the error from occurring, you can do any of the following:[anchor|#_4800b251-5653-45ea-b27b-35b651605d7a]
*If you do not need to retrieve the entities or fields that caused the failure, you can exclude these entities or fields from the request as follows:
**Exclude the entities from the entities specified in the ''$expand'' parameter.
**Explicitly specify the other fields to be returned (while excluding the fields that caused the failure) by using the ''$select'' parameter.
*If you need to retrieve the entities or fields that caused the failure, you can retrieve the needed records one by one either [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_REST_Get_Record_by_Key|by key fields], or [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_REST_Get_Record_by_ID|by IDs].

See the following sections for details on the URL, parameters, HTTP method, HTTP         headers, and response format. URL  If you need to retrieve the list of records that satisfies the specified conditions, you         use the following URL. http://<Base endpoint URL>/<Top-level entity> The URL has the following components: <Base endpoint URL>  is the URL of the contract-based endpoint             through which you are going to work with  Acumatica ERP, which has the following format:  http://< Acumatica ERP instance URL>/entity/<Endpoint name>/<Endpoint version>/ .  <Top-level entity>  is the name of the entity for which you are             going to retrieve the list of records. For example, suppose that you want to retrieve the list of stock item records from a local            Acumatica ERP instance with the name  AcumaticaDB  by using the system endpoint with the name            Default  and Version 18.200.001. You should use the following URL to retrieve the         list of records:            http://localhost/AcumaticaDB/entity/Default/18.200.001/StockItem . Parameters You can use the following parameters when you retrieve records from  Acumatica ERP: $filter : To specify filtering conditions on the records to be returned $skip : To specify the number of records to be skipped from the list of             returned records $top : To specify the number of records to be returned in the list $expand : To specify the linked and detail entities to be expanded $select : To specify the fields of the entity to be returned $custom : To specify the fields that are not defined in the contract to be             returned For detailed descriptions of the parameters, see  Parameters for Retrieving Records. HTTP Method You use the  GET  HTTP method to retrieve records. HTTP Headers You can specify the following header in the request. Header Description Accept Specifies the format of the response body, which can be one of the                   following: application/json text/json Response The response of a successful method call contains the retrieved records in JSON format in         the response body. For details on record representation in JSON format, see  Representation of a Record in JSON Format.  Status Codes The following table lists the HTTP status codes that the system returns for a request that         retrieves records by conditions. Code Description 200 The request has been completed successfully. The response body contains the                 list of records that satisfy the specified conditions. 401 The user is not signed in to the system. 403 The user has insufficient rights to access the                  Acumatica ERP             form that corresponds to the entity. 429 The number of requests has exceeded the limit             imposed by the license (see  License Restrictions for API Users). 500 An internal server error has occurred. HTTP Example The following request shows an example of the retrieval of  StockItem          records that are  Active  and that have been modified since the specified date. In the request example below,  < Acumatica ERP instance URL>  is the URL of the  Acumatica ERP             instance (such as  https://my.acumatica.com/MyInstance ).

For example, suppose that you want to retrieve data from the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN401000|IN401000]) Inventory Summary (IN401000) form in a local  Acumatica ERP instance with the name  AcumaticaDB  by using the system endpoint with the                 name  Default  and Version 18.200.001. You would use the following URL to                 retrieve data:                      http://localhost/AcumaticaDB/entity/Default/18.200.001/InventorySummaryInquiry . Parameter When you are retrieving data from an inquiry form, you should use the                      $expand  parameter to expand the detail entity, which contains the                 results of the inquiry. For a detailed description of the parameter, see  Parameters for Retrieving Records. HTTP Method, HTTP Body You use the  PUT  HTTP method and pass parameters of the inquiry in                 JSON format in the request body. See below for an example of the representation of                 parameters of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN401000|IN401000]) Inventory Summary inquiry form in                 JSON                 format. {
  "InventoryID" : {value : "APJAM08" } ,
  "WarehouseID" : {value : "RETAIL" }
} HTTP Headers You can specify the following headers in the request.

            .Result
            .EnsureSuccessStatusCode();

        return res.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().Result;
    }
} The following code uses the  RestService.Put()  method, which is                 defined in the previous code fragment, to retrieve the quantities of a stock item                 from the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN401000|IN401000]) Inventory Summary                 (IN401000) inquiry                 form. public static void ExportItemQty()

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
In Acumatica ERP, some records have attributes that are visible on the '''Attributes''' tab of the data entry form. For details about attributes, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Attributes|Attributes]. {br}

You may have to retrieve the records along with their attributes by using the contract-based REST API. To do this, you access the needed URL with the {{GET}} HTTP method, and in the parameters of the request, you specify the desired record fields and the fields that correspond to the needed attributes and attribute values. See the following sections for details on and examples of the URL, parameters, HTTP method, HTTP headers, and response.{br}{TOC}
==URL==
When you retrieve records from Acumatica ERP, you use the following URL.{{{{http://&lt;Base endpoint URL&gt;/&lt;Top-level entity&gt;
}}}}{br}

In this URL:{br}

[anchor|#_9bcc7b7b-b32e-4274-af94-efbd960ba824]
*{{<Base endpoint URL>}} is the URL of the contract-based endpoint through which you are going to work with Acumatica ERP, which has the following format: {{http://<Acumatica ERP instance URL>/entity/<Endpoint name>/<Endpoint version>/}}.
*{{<Top-level entity>}} is the name of the entity for which you are going to retrieve the list of records along with their attributes.
{br}

For example, suppose that you want to retrieve the list of leads along with their attributes from a local Acumatica ERP instance with the name ''AcumaticaDB'', and you want to use the system endpoint with the name ''Default'' and Version 18.200.001. You would use the following URL: ''http://localhost/AcumaticaDB/entity/Default/18.200.001/Lead''.
==Parameters==
When you retrieve records along with their attributes, you should use the following parameters:[anchor|#_87d14a90-4696-4bd3-a205-4a39558ae37c]
*''$select'': To list the desired record fields and the fields that correspond to the needed attributes and attribute values
*''$expand'': To expand the detail entity that contains the fields that correspond to the attributes and attribute values
For example, for the <tt>Lead</tt> entity, to retrieve the values of attributes of records, you need to specify <tt>Attributes/Attribute</tt> and <tt>Attributes/Value</tt> in the ''$select'' parameter, and <tt>Attributes</tt> in the ''$expand'' parameter. To learn the exact names of the fields that correspond to the attributes for a particular entity, you should review the fields of this entity on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_70_60|Web Service Endpoints] ([~/?ScreenId=SM207060|SM207060]) form or refer to the OpenAPI specification of the endpoint.{br}

You can use other parameters as well; see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_REST_Get_Records|Retrieval of Records by Conditions]. For a detailed description of the ''$select'' and ''$expand'' parameters, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_REST_Parameters|Parameters for Retrieving Records].
==HTTP Method==
You use the {{GET}} HTTP method to retrieve records along with their attributes.
==HTTP Headers==
You can specify the following header in the request.[anchor|#_40bf8194-174d-41e1-9ba1-dce56cf597b4]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="25%" ! Header

When you retrieve records from Acumatica ERP by using the contract-based REST API, you can use the URL parameters, which are described in this topic, to filter records by the specified conditions, expand particular entities, and retrieve the values of the fields that are not defined in the contract of the endpoint. {br}{TOC}
==$filter Parameter==
You use this parameter to specify the conditions that determine which records should be selected from Acumatica ERP. You use [http://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-3-0/url-conventions/|OData URI conventions] to specify the value of the parameter. The following examples illustrate the use of this parameter:[anchor|#_a568cd13-149a-4b25-9de8-4665f135a543]
*''$filter=ItemStatus eq &rsquo;Active&rsquo;'': Obtains stock item records that have the ''Active'' status in Acumatica ERP.
*''$filter=MainContact/Email eq &rsquo;demo@gmail.com&rsquo;'': Obtains a customer record that has the ''demo@gmail.com'' email address. (The <tt>Email</tt> field is defined in a linked entity, which is available through the <tt>MainContact</tt> property.)
*''$filter=ItemStatus eq &rsquo;Active&rsquo; and LastModified gt datetimeoffset&rsquo;2016-07-15T10%3A31%3A28.402%2B03%3A00&rsquo;'': Obtains stock item records that have the ''Active'' status in Acumatica ERP and have been modified later than July 15, 2016.
*:((({S:Warn}You should encode date and time values in URL format before passing them as the value of the parameter. For example, you can encode the current date and time by using the {{System.Net.WebUtility.URLEncode()}} method as follows: {{WebUtility.UrlEncode(new DateTimeOffset(DateTime.Now).ToString("yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffK"))}}.
)))
((({S:Warn}For one field, multiple conditions cannot be specified in the ''$filter'' parameter. The only exception is the'' ge X and le Y'' condition, such as ''$filter=CreatedDateTime ge DateTimeOffset&rsquo;2015-12-31T00%3A00%3A00%2B000&rsquo; and CreatedDateTime le DateTimeOffset&rsquo;2015-01-01T00%3A00%3A00%2B000&rsquo;''.
))){br}

When you specify the value of the parameter, you can use the following functions as they are defined in OData:[anchor|#_890b68e8-5888-418d-a268-f3ebfb069827]
*{{substringof}}
*{{startswith}}
*{{endswith}}
{br}

You can also use the following custom function to filter records by the values of the elements that are not defined in the contract of the endpoint: {{cf.<Type name>(f='<View name>.<Field name>')}}, where {{<Type name>}} is the type of the custom element, {{<View name>}} is the name of the data view that contains the element, and {{<Field name>}} is the name of the element. {br}

For example, suppose that, in an extension of the ''Default/18.200.001'' endpoint, you added the {{RepairItemType}} field to the top-level {{StockItem}} entity. This field corresponds to the '''Repair Item Type''' custom element added to the '''Item Defaults''' section of the '''General Setting''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. If you want to obtain all records on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form that have the value of the custom '''Repair Item Type''' element equal to ''Battery'', you would use the following parameter string: ''$filter=cf.CustomStringField(f=&rsquo;ItemSettings.UsrRepairItemType) eq &rsquo;Battery''.((({S:Warn}For details on how to find out the name of a custom element and the name of its data view, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_CB_Custom_Fields|Custom Fields]. 
)))
==$top Parameter==
You use this parameter to specify the number of records to be returned from Acumatica ERP. That is, if you specify ''N'' as the value of this parameter, the first ''N'' records will be returned from Acumatica ERP. For example, if you want to obtain only first five records from the list, you use the following parameter string: ''$top=5''.
==$skip Parameter==
You use this parameter to specify the number of records to be skipped from the list of returned records. That is, if you specify ''N'' as the value of this parameter, the first ''N'' records will be skipped from the list of returned records. For example, if you do not want to obtain the first five records from the list, you use the following parameter string: ''$skip=5''.{br}

If you use the ''$skip'' and ''$top'' parameters together, the ''$skip'' parameter is applied first.
==$expand Parameter==
You use this parameter to specify the linked and detail entities that should be expanded. By default, no linked or detail entities are expanded; that is, only fields of the top-level entity are returned. {br}

You use [http://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-3-0/url-conventions/|OData URI conventions] to specify the value of this parameter. For example, if you want to obtain the values of the warehouse detail lines of stock item records, you use the following parameter string: ''$expand=WarehouseDetails''.{br}

You explicitly specify each linked or detail entity to be expanded. For example, if you specify ''$expand=MainContact'' for the <tt>Customer</tt> entity, only the <tt>Contact</tt> linked entity of the <tt>Customer</tt> entity is expanded, but the <tt>Address</tt> linked entity within <tt>MainContact</tt> is not. To expand the <tt>Address</tt> entity, you should explicitly specify the <tt>Address</tt> entity to be expanded: ''$expand=MainContact/Address''.
==$select Parameter==
You use this parameter to specify the fields of the entity to be returned from Acumatica ERP. By default, all fields of the entity are returned. {br}

You use [http://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-3-0/url-conventions/|OData URI conventions] to specify the value of this parameter. For example, if you want to obtain only the order types and order numbers of sales orders, you use the following parameter string: ''$select=OrderType,OrderNbr''.
==$custom Parameter==
You use this parameter to specify the fields that are not defined in the contract of the endpoint to be returned from Acumatica ERP. That is, you can use this parameter to obtain the values of the predefined elements on an Acumatica ERP form that are not included in the entity definition, the values of user-defined fields, and the values of elements that were added to the Acumatica ERP form in a customization project. {br}

You use one of the following formats to specify the element whose value should be returned: [anchor|#_a371e29a-e911-44f0-872d-64c7daf5e287]
*If a top-level entity contains the custom field that corresponds to the element: {{<View name>.<Field name>}}, where you replace {{<View name>}} with the name of the data view that contains the element and {{<Field name>}} with the internal name of the element. 
*:For example, suppose that in an extension of the ''Default/18.200.001'' endpoint, you added the {{RepairItemType}} field to the top-level {{StockItem}} entity. This field corresponds to the '''Repair Item Type''' custom element added to the '''Item Defaults''' section of the '''General Setting''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. If you want to obtain the value of this element, you use the following parameter string: ''$custom=ItemSettings.UsrRepairItemType''. 
*If a linked or detail entity contains the custom field that corresponds to the element: {{<Entity name>/<View name>.<Field name>}}, where you replace {{<Entity name>}} with the name of the linked or detail entity that contains the field, {{<View name>}} with the name of the data view that contains the element, and {{<Field name>}} with the internal name of the element. 
*:For example, suppose that in an extension of the ''Default/18.200.001'' endpoint, you added the {{RepairItemType}} field to the {{SalesOrderDetail}} detail entity. This field corresponds to the '''Repair Item Type''' custom column added to the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. If you want to obtain the value of this element, you use the following parameter string: ''$custom=Details/Transactions.UsrRepairItemType''. 
*:((({S:Warn}If you want to obtain the value of a custom field of a linked or detail entity, in addition to specifying the ''$custom'' parameter, you have to specify this entity in the ''$expand'' parameter.
)))
*If the element is a user-defined field: {{Document.Attribute<AttributeID>}}, where you replace {{<AttributeID>}} with the ID of the attribute that corresponds to the user-defined field. 
*:For example, suppose that on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, you have added a user-defined field for the ''OPERATSYST'' attribute. If you want to obtain the value of this user-defined field, you use the following parameter string: ''$custom=Document.AttributeOPERATSYST''. 
*:For details about user-defined fields, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_User_Defined_Fields|User-Defined Fields].
{br}

If you want to obtain the values of multiple custom elements, you specify the custom elements to be returned, separated by commas. For details on how to find out the field name and the name of the data view, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_CB_Custom_Fields|Custom Fields].

In the contract-based REST API, you can delete the record by the values of its key fields or by its session identifier. To delete a record from Acumatica ERP, you access the needed URL address with the {{DELETE}} HTTP method. See the following sections for details on the possible URL, parameters, HTTP method, and response format.((({S:Warn}If you need to delete a detail line of a record, you should use the {{PUT}} HTTP method, as described in [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_REST_Update_Record|Update of a Record].
))){br}{TOC}
==URL for Removing by Key Fields==
If you need to delete a record with known key fields, you use the following URL.{{{{http://&lt;Base endpoint URL&gt;/&lt;Top-level entity&gt;/&lt;Key value 1&gt;/&lt;Key value 2&gt;
}}}}{br}

The URL has the following components:[anchor|#_512346f8-62c3-494a-a87a-63acc2479927]
*{{<Base endpoint URL>}} is the URL of the contract-based endpoint through which you are going to work with Acumatica ERP, which has the following format: {{http://<Acumatica ERP instance URL>/entity/<Endpoint name>/<Endpoint version>/}}. 
*{{<Top-level entity>}} is the name of the entity for which you are going to delete a record. 
*{{<Key value 1>}} and {{<Key value 2>}} are the values of the key fields of the record to be deleted. You use the number and order of key fields as they are defined on the corresponding Acumatica ERP form. 
*:((({S:Warn}You can pass the key fields separated by vertical bar (''|'') instead of slash(''/'').
)))
{br}

For example, suppose that you want to delete the sales order with order type ''SO'' and order number ''000123'' from a local Acumatica ERP instance with the name ''AcumaticaDB'' by using the system endpoint with the name ''Default'' and Version 18.200.001. You should use the following URL to delete the sales order: {{http://localhost/AcumaticaDB/entity/Default/18.200.001/SalesOrder/SO/000123}}.
==URL for Removing by ID==
If you need to delete a record with a known entity ID, you use the following URL. For details about entity IDs, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_REST_Get_Record_by_ID|Retrieval of a Record by ID].{{{{http://&lt;Base endpoint URL&gt;/&lt;Top-level entity&gt;/&lt;Entity ID&gt;
}}}}{br}

You replace {{<Base endpoint URL>}} with the URL of the contract-based endpoint through which you are going to work with Acumatica ERP, which has the following format: {{http://<Acumatica ERP instance URL>/entity/<Endpoint name>/<Endpoint version>/}}. You replace {{<Top-level entity>}} with the name of the entity for which you are going to retrieve the list of records. You replace {{<Entity ID>}} with the entity ID (which is the GUID that you can obtain from the <tt>ID</tt> property of an entity returned from Acumatica ERP).{br}

For example, suppose that you want to delete the sales order with entity ID ''03efa858-2351-4bd5-ae06-3d9fb3b3c1e6'' from a local Acumatica ERP instance with the name ''AcumaticaDB'' by using the system endpoint with the name ''Default'' and Version 18.200.001. You should use the following URL to delete the sales order: {{http://localhost/AcumaticaDB/entity/Default/18.200.001/SalesOrder/03efa858-2351-4bd5-ae06-3d9fb3b3c1e6}}.
==Parameters==
You use no parameters when deleting a record.
==HTTP Method==
You use the {{DELETE}} HTTP method to retrieve records. You pass no content in the request body.
==Response==
The response of a successful method call is ''204 No Content''.
==Status Codes==
The following table lists the HTTP status codes that the system returns for a request that removes the record by the values of its key fields or by its entity ID.[anchor|#_970da984-282e-41b1-b56c-841acaa6b024]

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Removal of a Record In the contract-based REST API, you can delete the record by the values of its key                 fields or by its session identifier. To delete a record from  Acumatica ERP, you access the needed URL address with the  DELETE  HTTP method.                 See the following sections for details on the possible URL, parameters, HTTP method,                 and response format. If you need to delete a detail line of a record, you                     should use the  PUT  HTTP method, as described in  Update of a Record. URL for Removing by Key Fields If you need to delete a record with known key fields, you use the following                 URL. http://<Base endpoint URL>/<Top-level entity>/<Key value 1>/<Key value 2> The URL has the following components: <Base endpoint URL>  is the URL of the contract-based                         endpoint through which you are going to work with  Acumatica ERP, which has the following format:  http://< Acumatica ERP instance URL>/entity/<Endpoint name>/<Endpoint                             version>/ .  <Top-level entity>  is the name of the entity for which                         you are going to delete a record.  <Key value 1>  and  <Key value 2>  are                         the values of the key fields of the record to be deleted. You use the number                         and order of key fields as they are defined on the corresponding  Acumatica ERP form.  You can pass the key fields separated by vertical             bar ( | ) instead of slash( / ). For example, suppose that you want to delete the sales order with order type                      SO  and order number  000123  from a local  Acumatica ERP instance with the name  AcumaticaDB  by using the system endpoint with the                 name  Default  and Version 18.200.001. You should use the following URL to delete                 the sales order:                      http://localhost/AcumaticaDB/entity/Default/18.200.001/SalesOrder/SO/000123 . URL for Removing by ID If you need to delete a record with a known entity ID, you use the following URL. For                 details about entity IDs, see  Retrieval of a Record by ID. http://<Base endpoint URL>/<Top-level entity>/<Entity ID> You replace  <Base endpoint URL>  with the URL of the                 contract-based endpoint through which you are going to work with  Acumatica ERP, which has the following format:  http://< Acumatica ERP instance URL>/entity/<Endpoint name>/<Endpoint version>/ . You                 replace  <Top-level entity>  with the name of the entity for which                 you are going to retrieve the list of records. You replace  <Entity                     ID>  with the entity ID (which is the GUID that you can obtain from the                      ID  property of an entity returned from  Acumatica ERP). For example, suppose that you want to delete the sales order with entity ID                      03efa858-2351-4bd5-ae06-3d9fb3b3c1e6  from a local  Acumatica ERP instance with the name  AcumaticaDB  by using the system endpoint with the                 name  Default  and Version 18.200.001. You should use the following URL to                 delete the sales order:                      http://localhost/AcumaticaDB/entity/Default/18.200.001/SalesOrder/03efa858-2351-4bd5-ae06-3d9fb3b3c1e6 . Parameters You use no parameters when deleting a record. HTTP Method You use the  DELETE  HTTP method to retrieve records. You pass no content in                 the request body. Response The response of a successful method call is  204 No Content . Status Codes The following table lists the HTTP status codes that the system returns for a request                 that removes the record by the values of its key fields or by its entity ID. Code Description 204 The request has been completed successfully. The record is                                 removed. 401 The user is not signed in to the system. 403 The user has insufficient rights to access the                  Acumatica ERP             form that corresponds to the entity. 429 The number of requests has exceeded the limit             imposed by the license (see  License Restrictions for API Users). 500 An internal server error has occurred. HTTP Example The following request shows an example of the removal of the  COCONUTS  stock                 item by the value of the key field. In the request example below,  < Acumatica ERP instance URL>  is the URL of the  Acumatica ERP             instance (such as  https://my.acumatica.com/MyInstance ). You can omit the instance             name in the URL (such as  https://my.acumatica.com ) if the instance is installed             in the root of the website. DELETE /COCONUTS HTTP/1.1

To perform an action by using the contract-based REST API, you access the needed URL address with the {{POST}} HTTP method and pass the record representation in JSON format and parameters of the action in the request body. See the following sections for details on the URL, parameters, HTTP method, HTTP body, HTTP headers, and response format.{br}{TOC}
==URL ==
If you need to perform an action on an Acumatica ERP form, you use the following URL.{{{{http://&lt;Base endpoint URL&gt;/&lt;Top-level entity&gt;/&lt;Action name&gt;
}}}}
The URL has the following components:[anchor|#_a50c9b64-4037-453a-b9dd-7e7d0be24cdb]
*{{<Base endpoint URL>}} is the URL of the contract-based endpoint through which you are going to work with Acumatica ERP, which has the following format: {{http://<Acumatica ERP instance URL>/entity/<Endpoint name>/<Endpoint version>/}}. 
*{{<Top-level entity>}} is the name of the entity for which you are going to perform an action. 
*{{<Action name>}} is the name of the action that you are going to perform.
{br}

For example, suppose that you want to confirm a shipment in a local Acumatica ERP instance with the name ''AcumaticaDB'' by using the system endpoint with the name ''Default'' and Version 18.200.001. You should use the following URL to confirm a shipment: {{http://localhost/AcumaticaDB/entity/Default/18.200.001/Shipment/ConfirmShipment}}.
==Parameters==
You use no parameters when performing an action.
==HTTP Method, HTTP Body==
You use the {{POST}} HTTP method and pass the record to which the action should be applied and the parameters of the action in the request body in JSON format as follows. {{{{{
  "entity" : &lt;record in JSON format&gt;,
  "parameters" : &lt;parameters in JSON format&gt;
}
}}}}You can find details on how to represent a record in JSON format in [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_REST_Entity_Representation_in_JSON|Representation of a Record in JSON Format].

When you need to attach a file to a record by using the contract-based REST API, you access the needed URL address with the {{PUT}} HTTP method and pass the file in the request body. See the following sections for details on the URL, parameters, HTTP method, HTTP header, and response format.{br}{TOC}
==URL ==
If you need to attach a file to a record in Acumatica ERP, you use the following URL.{{{{http://&lt;Base endpoint URL&gt;/&lt;Top-level entity&gt;/&lt;Key value 1&gt;/&lt;Key value 2&gt;/files/&lt;File name&gt;
}}}}
The URL has the following components:[anchor|#_47986599-c001-4f82-b373-342fbda3667a]
*{{<Base endpoint URL>}} is the URL of the contract-based endpoint through which you are going to work with Acumatica ERP, which has the following format: {{http://<Acumatica ERP instance URL>/entity/<Endpoint name>/<Endpoint version>/}}. 
*{{<Top-level entity>}} is the name of the entity to which you are going to attach a file. 
*{{<Key value 1>}} and {{<Key value 2>}} are the values of the key fields of the record to which you are going to attach a file. You use the number and order of key fields as they are defined on the corresponding Acumatica ERP form.
*:((({S:Warn}You can pass the key fields separated by vertical bar (''|'') instead of slash(''/'').
)))
*{{<File name>}} is the name of the file that you are going to attach with the extension.
{br}

For example, suppose that you want to attach the <tt>Sample.jpg</tt> file to the stock item record with inventory ID ''AALEGO500'' in a local Acumatica ERP instance with name ''AcumaticaDB'' by using the system endpoint with the name ''Default'' and Version 18.200.001. You should use the following URL to attach the file: {{http://localhost/AcumaticaDB/entity/Default/18.200.001/StockItem/AALEGO500/files/Sample.jpg}}.
==Parameters==
You use no parameters when you attach a file to a record.
==HTTP Method==

To retrieve a file that is attached to a record from Acumatica ERP by using the contract-based REST API, you access the URL address of the file with the {{GET}} HTTP method. See the following sections for details on the URL, parameters, HTTP method, HTTP header, and response format.{br}{TOC}
==URL==
If you need to obtain a file attached to a record, you use the following URL.{{{{http://&lt;Base endpoint URL&gt;/files/&lt;File identifier&gt;
}}}}{br}

The URL has the following components:[anchor|#_470d7d85-7972-4a4b-8fef-179e0eaf41b6]
*{{<Base endpoint URL>}} is the URL of the contract-based endpoint through which you are going to work with Acumatica ERP, which has the following format: {{http://<Acumatica ERP instance URL>/entity/<Endpoint name>/<Endpoint version>/}}. 
*{{<File identifier>}} is the internal identifier of the file in the system. 
{br}

To get this URL for a particular file attached to a record, you should obtain the record from Acumatica ERP and, in the returned JSON representation of the record, find the value of the <tt>href</tt> property of the needed file in the <tt>files</tt> array. For information on how to retrieve a record from Acumatica ERP, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_REST_Get_Record_by_Key|Retrieval of a Record by Key Fields] and [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_REST_Get_Record_by_ID|Retrieval of a Record by ID].{br}

For example, suppose that you retrieved the stock item record that contains the following <tt>files</tt> array from a local Acumatica ERP instance with the name ''AcumaticaDB''. {{{{{
  ...,
  "files":[
    {
      "id":"9be45eb7-f97d-400b-96a5-1c4cf82faa96",

    }
  ]
}
}}}}You should use the following URL to retrieve the <tt>T2MCRO.jpg</tt> file attached to the stock item record: {{http://localhost/AcumaticaDB/entity/Default/18.200.001/files/9be45eb7-f97d-400b-96a5-1c4cf82faa96}}.
==Parameters==
You use no parameters when retrieving a file.
==HTTP Method==
You use the {{GET}} HTTP method to retrieve a file.
==HTTP Headers==
You can specify the following header in the request.[anchor|#_40bf8194-174d-41e1-9ba1-dce56cf597b4]

*The user-defined fields
))){br}{TOC}
==URL==
If you need to obtain the schema of custom fields of an entity, you use the following URL.{{{{http://&lt;Base endpoint URL&gt;/&lt;Top-level entity&gt;/$adHocSchema
}}}}{br}

The URL includes the following components:[anchor|#_c37a5a4f-e82c-4f31-8055-6c8018e82d45]
*{{<Base endpoint URL>}} is the URL of the contract-based endpoint through which you are going to work with Acumatica ERP, which has the following format: {{http://<Acumatica ERP instance URL>/entity/<Endpoint name>/<Endpoint version>/}}. 
*{{<Top-level entity>}} is the name of the entity for which you are going to retrieve the schema of custom fields.
{br}

For example, suppose that you want to obtain the schema of custom fields of a stock item entity from a local Acumatica ERP instance with the name ''AcumaticaDB'' by using the system endpoint with the name ''Default'' and Version 18.200.001. You would use the following URL to retrieve the schema: {{http://localhost/AcumaticaDB/entity/Default/18.200.001/StockItem/$adHocSchema}}.
==Parameters==
You use no parameters when retrieving the schema of custom fields of an entity.
==HTTP Method==
You use the {{GET}} HTTP method to retrieve the schema of custom fields.

For some text boxes on Acumatica ERP forms, users can type values in multiple languages if multiple locales are configured in Acumatica ERP. For example, if your Acumatica ERP instance has English and French locales activated and multilingual user input configured, you can specify the value of the '''Description''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form in English and French. For the list of elements that support multiple languages, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__CON_Boxes_MultiLanguage|Boxes that Have Multi-Language Support]. For details on how to turn on multilingual user input, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__CON_Locales_and_Languages#section_lqy_4c2_jw|Enabling Multilingual User Input].
==Specifying Localized Values of a Multi-Language Field==
When you need to specify localized values of a text box by using the contract-based REST API, you specify the value of the field that corresponds to the box as a string in JSON format with the localized values. In this string, you use the two-letter ISO code of the language with which the value should be associated.{br}

In the example that is mentioned at the beginning of the topic, if you need to specify values in English and French in the '''Description''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form, you specify the value of the <tt>Description</tt> field of the <tt>StockItem</tt> entity in the following format: {{[{en:English description},{fr:French description}]}}. See below for an example of a stock item record with localized <tt>Description</tt> field values in JSON format. For details on how to pass the record to the service, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_REST_Create_Record|Creation of a Record] and [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_REST_Update_Record|Update of a Record].{{{{{
  "InventoryID" : {value : "BASESERV" } ,
  "Description" : {value : "[{en:Item},{fr:Pièce}]" } 
}
}}}}[anchor|#_db77e582-68d4-463d-99a5-210dd5a7eda1]((({S:Warn}In the JSON-formatted string, you should specify the actual values of the field in all languages that are configured for multilingual user input. If you specify the values of the field in particular languages, the values of the field in other languages configured for multilingual user input become empty. For example, suppose that in your instance of Acumatica ERP, multi-language fields can have values in English and French. If you pass the value of a field in the following format {{[{en:English description}]}}, the French value of the field becomes empty.
)))
If you specify the value of a multi-language field as plain text, this text is saved as the value of the corresponding box in the current language of Acumatica ERP (that is, the language that you specified when you logged in to Acumatica ERP). For details on how to specify the language on login through the contract-based REST API, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_REST_Login|Sign-In to the Service].
==Retrieving Localized Values of a Multi-Language Field==
If you need to retrieve localized values of a text box that supports multiple input languages, you retrieve the value a special custom field that contains all localized values of the text box and has the ''Translations'' suffix in its field name. {br}

To find out the field name and the view name of the needed custom field with localized values, you find out the field name and the view name of the multi-language text box and append ''Translations'' to the field name. (For details on how to find out the field name and the view name of an element on the form, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_CB_Custom_Fields|Custom Fields].) For example, the multi-language '''Description''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form has the ''Descr'' field name and the ''Item'' view name; therefore, the custom field that contains the localized descriptions of a stock item has the ''DescrTranslations'' field name and the ''Item'' view name. {br}

You obtain the value of the needed custom field by using the ''$custom'' parameter. For example, suppose that you need to obtain the localized values of the '''Description''' element of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form. In this case, you should use the following parameter string in the request URL: ''$custom=Item.DescrTranslations''. For details on how to retrieve a record, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_REST_Get_Record_by_Key|Retrieval of a Record by Key Fields] and [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_REST_Get_Records|Retrieval of Records by Conditions].{br}

The returned value of a <tt>Translations</tt> custom field is a string in JSON format with the available localized values of the field. The language to which the value belongs is identified by the two-letter ISO code of the language. For example, suppose that the '''Description''' element of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form has the value ''Item'' in English and ''Pièce'' in French. In this case, the value of the <tt>DescrTranslations</tt> custom field, which corresponds to the '''Description''' element, is the following string: {{[{en:Item},{fr:Pièce}]}}.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Multi-Language Fields For some text boxes on  Acumatica ERP forms, users can type values in multiple languages if multiple locales are                 configured in  Acumatica ERP. For example, if your  Acumatica ERP instance has English and French locales activated and multilingual user input                 configured, you can specify the value of the  Description  box                 on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items                 (IN202500) form in English and French. For the list of elements that support                 multiple languages, see  Boxes that Have Multi-Language Support. For details on how to turn on multilingual user input, see  Enabling Multilingual User Input. Specifying Localized Values of a Multi-Language Field When you need to specify localized values of a text box by using the contract-based REST API,     you specify the value of the field that corresponds to the box as a string in JSON format with     the localized values. In this string, you use the two-letter ISO code of the language with which     the value should be associated. In the example that is mentioned at the beginning of the topic, if you need to specify values     in English and French in the  Description  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form, you specify the value of     the  Description  field of the  StockItem  entity in the     following format:  [{en:English description},{fr:French description}] . See below     for an example of a stock item record with localized  Description  field values     in JSON format. For details on how to pass the record to the service, see  Creation of a Record and  Update of a Record. {
  "InventoryID" : {value : "BASESERV" } ,
  "Description" : {value : "[{en:Item},{fr:Pièce}]" } 
} In the JSON-formatted string, you should specify             the actual values of the field in all languages that are configured for multilingual             user input. If you specify the values of the field in particular languages, the values             of the field in other languages configured for multilingual user input become empty. For             example, suppose that in your instance of  Acumatica ERP,             multi-language fields can have values in English and French. If you pass the value of a             field in the following format  [{en:English description}] , the French             value of the field becomes empty. If you specify the value of a multi-language field as plain text, this text is saved as the     value of the corresponding box in the current language of  Acumatica ERP     (that is, the language that you specified when you logged in to  Acumatica ERP).     For details on how to specify the language on login through the contract-based REST API, see       Sign-In to the Service. Retrieving Localized Values of a Multi-Language Field If you need to retrieve localized values of a text box that supports multiple input languages,     you retrieve the value a special custom field that contains all localized values of the text box     and has the  Translations  suffix in its field name.  To find out the field name and the view name of the needed custom field with localized values,     you find out the field name and the view name of the multi-language text box and append       Translations  to the field name. (For details on how to find out the field name and the     view name of an element on the form, see  Custom Fields.) For example, the     multi-language  Description  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form has the  Descr  field     name and the  Item  view name; therefore, the custom field that contains the localized     descriptions of a stock item has the  DescrTranslations  field name and the  Item      view name.  You obtain the value of the needed custom field by using the  $custom  parameter. For     example, suppose that you need to obtain the localized values of the       Description  element of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form. In this case, you should     use the following parameter string in the request URL:      $custom=Item.DescrTranslations . For details on how to retrieve a record, see  Retrieval of a Record by Key Fields and  Retrieval of Records by Conditions. The returned value of a  Translations  custom field is a string in JSON     format with the available localized values of the field. The language to which the value belongs     is identified by the two-letter ISO code of the language. For example, suppose that the       Description  element of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form has the value  Item      in English and  Pièce  in French. In this case, the value of the       DescrTranslations  custom field, which corresponds to the       Description  element, is the following string:       [{en:Item},{fr:Pièce}] . ]]></column>

For some text boxes on Acumatica ERP forms, users can type values in multiple languages if multiple locales are configured in Acumatica ERP. For example, if your Acumatica ERP instance has English and French locales activated and multilingual user input configured, you can specify the value of the '''Description''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form in English and French. For the list of elements that support multiple languages, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__CON_Boxes_MultiLanguage|Boxes that Have Multi-Language Support]. For details on how to turn on multilingual user input, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__CON_Locales_and_Languages#section_lqy_4c2_jw|Enabling Multilingual User Input].
==Specifying Localized Values of a Multi-Language Field==
When you need to specify localized values of a text box by using the contract-based SOAP API, you specify the value of the field that corresponds to the box as a string in JSON format with the localized values. In this string, you use the two-letter ISO code of the language with which the value should be associated.{br}

In the example that is mentioned at the beginning of the topic, if you need to specify values in English and French in the '''Description''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form, you specify the value of the <tt>Description</tt> field of the <tt>StockItem</tt> entity in the following format: {{[{en:English description},{fr:French description}]}}, as shown in the following code fragment.<source lang="csharp">public static void CreateStockItem(DefaultSoapClient soapClient)

If you specify the value of a multi-language field as plain text, this text is saved as the value of the corresponding box in the current language of Acumatica ERP (that is, the language that you specified when you logged in to Acumatica ERP). For details on how to specify the language on login through the contract-based SOAP API, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_CB_Login|Login() Method].
==Retrieving Localized Values of a Multi-Language Field==
If you need to retrieve localized values of a text box that supports multiple input languages, you retrieve the value of a special custom field that contains all localized values of the text box and has the ''Translations'' suffix in its field name. {br}

To find out the field name and the view name of the needed custom field with localized values, you find out the field name and the view name of the multi-language text box and append ''Translations'' to the field name. (For details on how to find out the field name and the view name of an element on the form, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_CB_Custom_Fields|Custom Fields].) For example, the multi-language '''Description''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form has the ''Descr'' field name and the ''Item'' view name; therefore, the custom field that contains the localized descriptions of a stock item has the ''DescrTranslations'' field name and the ''Item'' view name. {br}

The following code shows how to retrieve the localized values of the '''Description''' element of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form. (The code below uses Contract Version 2.){{{{public static void ExportStockItem(DefaultSoapClient soapClient)
{
    StockItem stockItem = new StockItem
    {
        InventoryID = new StringValue { Value = "BASESERV" },
        //Specify the localized values to be returned
        CustomFields = new[]
        {
          new CustomStringField
          {
            fieldName = "DescrTranslations",
            viewName = "Item",
            Value = new StringReturn(),
          }
        }
    };
    //Retrieve the stock item record
    StockItem stockItemToRetrieve = (StockItem)client.Get(stockItem);
}
}}}}{br}

The returned value of a <tt>Translations</tt> custom field is a string in JSON format with the available localized values of the field. The language to which the value belongs is identified by the two-letter ISO code of the language. For example, suppose that the '''Description''' element of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form has the value ''Item'' in English and ''Pièce'' in French. In this case, the value of the <tt>DescrTranslations</tt> custom field, which corresponds to the '''Description''' element, is the following string: {{[{en:Item},{fr:Pièce}]}}.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[To Configure the Client Application In this topic, you will learn how to import the WSDL description of the  Acumatica ERP web services into a Visual Studio project.  The procedure below is described based on an example of the creation of a console                 project with the  MyBIIntegration  name that uses the  Default  endpoint                 of the  18.200.001  version. You can create another type of Visual Studio                 project with another name and use any other endpoint in this procedure. The instructions in this topic have been created for Visual Studio 2019. Importing the WSDL File into a Visual Studio Project To configure the client application, do the following: Open Visual Studio, and create a new Visual C# console application with the                MyBIIntegration  name.  To create a console application, click  File New Project  on the main menu of Visual Studio. In the  Create a new                 project  dialog box, which appears, select the  Console App (.Net                 Framework)  C# template and click  Next . In the                  Configure your new project  dialog box, specify the name and               location of the solution, select the  .NET Framework 4.8  framework version, and               click  Create . The MyBIIntegration application that you               have created contains the  Program.cs  file with the                  Program  class. Add to the project a reference to the  Acumatica ERP             web service as follows:  On the main menu of Visual Studio, click  Project Add Service Reference .  In the  Address  box of the  Add Service                   Reference  dialog box, which opens, specify the URL of the                    Default  endpoint of the  18.200.001  version (see Item 1 in the                 following screenshot).  To copy the URL of the service, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM207060|SM207060]) Web Service Endpoints (SM207060) form, select  Default  in                   the  Endpoint Name  box and  18.200.001  in the                      Endpoint Version  box, click  View Endpoint Service WSDL  on the form toolbar, and copy the URL from the address line in the                   browser for the page that opens. In this example, the URL is                      http://localhost/MyStoreInstance/entity/Default/18.200.001?wsdl . Click  Go  (Item 2) to make Visual Studio connect to the web                   service. If your  Acumatica ERP website uses a self-signed certificate, Visual Studio displays security alert                   windows with warnings on the certificate. Click  Yes  in                   these windows to proceed. In the  Namespace  box, type  Default                  (3). This name will be used as a namespace for the web service classes generated by                 Visual Studio based on the WSDL description of the service. Click  OK  (4) to close the dialog box and add to the project                 the reference to the specified service. Add Service Reference dialog box Visual Studio adds to the project the  Default  service reference in                   the  Connected Services  project folder, as shown in the                   following screenshot. Double-click the  Default  service reference to open                   the Object Browser and view the list of objects and methods available through the                     service.

The screen-based web services API is a part of Acumatica ERP integration services, which provides integration with external data sources and third-party systems by using a SOAP interface. {br}

External applications and systems that use the Acumatica ERP web services API can access the data managed by Acumatica ERP and the business functionality of Acumatica ERP. For example, you can integrate Acumatica ERP with eCommerce or an online store system, so that an external system pushes all information about customers, sales orders, and payments to Acumatica ERP, and Acumatica ERP provides information on the availability of stock items and processes all incoming data. {br}

The screen-based web services API works with Acumatica ERP forms. That is, it provides API objects and methods for working with elements on Acumatica ERP forms. {br}

To upload data to and from Acumatica ERP by using the screen-based web services API, you define the sequence of commands for the system to work with elements on an Acumatica ERP form. This sequence of commands reflects the sequence of actions to be executed for a data record as if the record is being manipulated by a user through an Acumatica ERP form. That is, when you enter data into the system manually, you perform a sequence of actions. You open the needed data entry form and start entering data. As you add a new record, you use the UI elements one by one—you type text, select values from combo boxes, clear or select check boxes, and click buttons. In the sequence of commands for the web services, you compose exactly the same sequence of actions by specifying a command for each user action on the form. For more information on the commands you can use, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__mng_Screen-Based_API_Commands|Working with Commands of the Screen-Based SOAP API].((({S:Warn}This sequence of commands is similar to the sequence of commands you configure when you create import and export scenarios.

))){br}

To use screen-based web services API in your application, you should generate the WSDL file of the web service, as described in [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__how_Generate_SB_WSDL|To Generate the WSDL File of the Web Services], and import this file to your development project as described in [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__how_Import_SB_WSDL_To_Development_Environment|To Import the WSDL File Into the Development Environment].

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[The main object, which provides access to all other objects and methods of the Acumatica ERP web services API, is a <tt>Screen</tt> object. By using the methods of a <tt>Screen</tt> object, you can log in to Acumatica ERP and retrieve, insert, update, and delete data. You can also use the methods to perform any actions that are exposed by Acumatica ERP forms available through the web service. {br}{TOC}
==Screen Object==
After you have logged in to Acumatica ERP by using the web services API, you can access data on Acumatica ERP forms available through the web service. The <tt>Screen</tt> class provides the same set of API methods for working with all Acumatica ERP forms available through the service. You can find out which form a method accesses by noting the prefix in the name of the method, which is the form ID. For example, the <tt>Export()</tt> method that you use to export data from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form is <tt>IN202500Export()</tt>.
==Content Object==
To get the description of the structure (schema) of a form, you should use the <tt>GetSchema()</tt> method of the <tt>Screen</tt> object. This method is specific for each Acumatica ERP form, and you should use the method with the ID of the needed form in the prefix of the method name. The method returns the schema of the form as the corresponding <tt>Content</tt> object, which is specific for each form. For example, to get the schema of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form, you should call the <tt>IN202500GetSchema()</tt> method of the <tt>Screen</tt> object. You will receive the result as a <tt>IN202500Content</tt> object, as the following code shows.<source lang="csharp">Screen context = new Screen();
...
IN202500Content stockItemsSchema = context.IN202500GetSchema();</source>
==Command Object==
By using subobjects of a <tt>Content</tt> object, you configure the sequence of commands that should be executed during data import, data export, or data processing through the web service. You configure the sequence of commands inside an array of objects of the <tt>Command</tt> type. When you are reflecting the selection of an element on a form in the sequence of commands, you have to select the object of the Acumatica ERP form whose element you want to access. The objects that are available inside a <tt>Content</tt> object have names that are similar to the names of the UI elements that you see on the form and have the ID of the form as a prefix. {br}

For example, to be able to select the '''Item Class''' element, which is located in the '''Item Defaults''' group on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form (shown in the following screenshot), you would select the <tt>GeneralSettingsItemDefaults</tt> property of the <tt>IN202500Content</tt> object. This property provides access to the <tt>IN202500GeneralSettingsItemDefaults</tt> object, which includes the <tt>ItemClass</tt> property. {br}

Each element on an Acumatica ERP form (such as a text box, combo box, or table column) is associated with a particular web services API class and is available through corresponding property of this class. The property has a similar name to that of the corresponding box on the form, such as <tt>ItemClass</tt>, as the following screenshot shows.[anchor|#fig_rgx_j5c_xs][anchor|#image_x31_w5c_xs][image:UserGuide/Images/WS_Objects.png|popup|API object on an Acumatica ERP form |450px]{br}

The following code shows an example of configuring a list of commands for the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form inside an array of <tt>Command</tt> objects. <source lang="csharp">//stockItemsSchema is a IN202500Content object
var commands = new Command[]
{
    stockItemsSchema.StockItemSummary.ServiceCommands.EveryInventoryID,
    stockItemsSchema.StockItemSummary.InventoryID,
    stockItemsSchema.StockItemSummary.Description,
    stockItemsSchema.GeneralSettingsItemDefaults.ItemClass,
    stockItemsSchema.GeneralSettingsUnitOfMeasureBaseUnit.BaseUnit
};</source>{br}

For more information on the commands, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__mng_Screen-Based_API_Commands|Working with Commands of the Screen-Based SOAP API].
==Actions Object==
To insert an action to a sequence of commands, such as clicking a button, you use the corresponding property of the special API object <tt>Actions</tt> (which has a prefix with the ID of the form in the name). The <tt>Actions</tt> object is available through the <tt>Actions</tt> property of the <tt>Content</tt> object that corresponds to the form. The properties of the <tt>Actions</tt> object have names that are similar to the names of corresponding buttons on the form, such as <tt>Delete</tt>.{br}

You can view the classes available through the web services API by using Object Browser in Visual Studio.

API object on an  Acumatica ERP       form  The following code shows an example of configuring a list of commands for the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form inside an array of  Command      objects.      //stockItemsSchema is a IN202500Content object
var commands = new Command[]
{
    stockItemsSchema.StockItemSummary.ServiceCommands.EveryInventoryID,
    stockItemsSchema.StockItemSummary.InventoryID,
    stockItemsSchema.StockItemSummary.Description,
    stockItemsSchema.GeneralSettingsItemDefaults.ItemClass,
    stockItemsSchema.GeneralSettingsUnitOfMeasureBaseUnit.BaseUnit
}; For more information on the commands, see  Working with Commands of the Screen-Based SOAP API. Actions Object To insert an action to a sequence of commands, such as clicking a button, you use the     corresponding property of the special API object  Actions  (which has a prefix     with the ID of the form in the name). The  Actions  object is available through     the  Actions  property of the  Content  object that     corresponds to the form. The properties of the  Actions  object have names that     are similar to the names of corresponding buttons on the form, such as      Delete . You can view the classes available through the web services API by using Object Browser in     Visual Studio. ]]></column>

Because of the connection of the screen-based SOAP API with Acumatica ERP forms, the applications that are developed based on this API are sensitive to the UI changes in the system. That is, any changes made to the UI after the application is created require the application to be updated and recompiled. If you want your application to not depend on the UI changes in the system, you should use the screen-based API wrapper, which is described in this topic.{br}{TOC}
==How a Client Application Based on the Screen-Based API Works==
A client application that uses the screen-based web services API includes the WSDL description of the service, which contains the API elements that the application can use to work with the service. The API elements have names that are similar to the names of the elements in the UI of Acumatica ERP. For example, the '''Customer ID''' element of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form corresponds to the <tt>Customer.CustomerSummary.CustomerID</tt> property. {br}

When the application calls the <tt>Screen.GetSchema()</tt> method, it retrieves from Acumatica ERP the schema of an Acumatica ERP form. The schema of the form is a <tt>Content</tt> object, which defines the correspondence between the API elements and the internal data fields that are used for operations with data by Acumatica ERP. If something has been changed in the schema of an Acumatica ERP form, the <tt>Content</tt> object that is returned by the <tt>Screen.GetSchema()</tt> method contains a different correspondence between the API elements and internal data fields than the correspondence for which the application is compiled, and the application fails. {br}

For example, suppose that a client application requests the customer ID by the <tt>Customer.CustomerSummary.CustomerID</tt> property. Suppose also that in an update of Acumatica ERP, the '''Customer ID''' element of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form was renamed to '''Customer''', and therefore it should be requested by using the <tt>Customer.CustomerSummary.Customer</tt> property from the API. The client application requests the customer ID by using the <tt>Customer.CustomerSummary.CustomerID</tt> property and fails.
==What the Screen-Based API Wrapper Is==
The screen-based API wrapper is a special wrapper designed to prevent the UI changes in the system from causing application failure. The wrapper works with any changes in the schema of an Acumatica ERP form. That is, the wrapper makes the application work regardless of the changes in the names of UI elements and the changes in the internal names of data fields and objects. {br}

The wrapper is distributed as the <tt>PX.Soap.dll</tt> file, which is installed automatically during Acumatica ERP installation. You can find the <tt>PX.Soap.dll</tt> file in the <tt>ScreenBasedAPIWrapper</tt> folder of your Acumatica ERP installation folder. {br}

The <tt>PX.Soap</tt> library, which the wrapper provides, includes the <tt>Helper.GetSchema()</tt> method, which you should use instead of the <tt>Screen.GetSchema()</tt> method of the screen-based web services API. For information on how to use the screen-based API wrapper, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__how_Prevent_Breaking_Changes|To Use the Screen-Based API Wrapper].
==How the Screen-Based API Wrapper Works==
When the client application is executed for the first time and requests the schema of an Acumatica ERP form by using the <tt>Helper.GetSchema()</tt> method, the wrapper requests the schema from the Acumatica ERP screen-based web service by using the <tt>Screen.GetSchema()</tt> method of the screen-based API. The web service interacts with the Acumatica ERP import and export engine and returns the current schema of the form. The wrapper saves the schema in an XML file and returns the schema to the client application as a <tt>Content</tt> object. The client application uses this schema to work with Acumatica ERP. ((({S:Warn}Instead of the <tt>Helper.GetSchema()</tt> method you can use the <tt>Helper.ReuseStoredSchema()</tt> method to upload a schema that was saved earlier by the wrapper. 
))){br}

The following diagram illustrates the way the screen-based API wrapper works during the first execution of a client application.[anchor|#_a77c6a21-ef3d-46b4-b955-2961b0275eba][anchor|#_d94497cf-2175-4cf2-a244-a1afaa8cc805][image:UserGuide/Images/Screen_Based_API_Wrapper_1.png|popup|First execution of an application|450px]{br}

When the client application is executed for the second time and all subsequent times and it requests the schema of an Acumatica ERP form by using the <tt>Helper.GetSchema()</tt> method, the wrapper retrieves the XML schema that is saved locally and submits this schema to the Acumatica ERP screen-based web service by using the <tt>Screen.SetSchema()</tt> method of the screen-based API. The web service interacts with the Acumatica ERP import and export engine, which replaces the current schema of the form that is stored on the server with the one that was saved locally. The wrapper returns the schema that was saved locally to the client application. The client application uses the local schema to work with Acumatica ERP. ((({S:Warn}The schema that is submitted to Acumatica ERP by using the screen-based API wrapper is used on the server during the current session and is discarded after the end of the session.
))){br}

The following diagram illustrates the way the screen-based API wrapper works during the second execution and all subsequent executions of a client application.[anchor|#_8c988a29-792d-4ae4-9634-c8ef390997e6][anchor|#_1a5379ec-31ad-4080-b224-33e58b02a647][image:UserGuide/Images/Screen_Based_API_Wrapper_2.png|popup|Subsequent executions of the application|450px]{br}

((({S:Warn}You should distribute the XML file with the schema along with your client application. If the wrapper has not found the XML file, it requests the new schema.
The name of the XML file with the schema contains a hash code that depends on the WSDL description. If you update the WSDL description in your application, the wrapper works in the same way as it did during the first execution of the application and creates a new XML file with the schema.

The WSDL description of the Acumatica ERP screen-based web services API contains the descriptions of the API objects and methods that you can use to access Acumatica ERP forms.{br}

Because of the connection of the API with Acumatica ERP forms, each generated WSDL description of this API reflects the current state of the system. That is, the WSDL description does not include any changes made to the system after the WSDL file was generated, and each time you change the system, you should regenerate the WSDL description and update your application accordingly. ((({S:Warn}You can prevent breaking changes in your application and omit regeneration of the WSDL description for each change in the system by using the screen-based API wrapper. For details on how to use the wrapper, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__how_Prevent_Breaking_Changes|To Use the Screen-Based API Wrapper].
))){br}

For example, suppose that you generated a WSDL description of the web service that contains the definition of the {{CustomerID}} property, which corresponds to the '''Customer ID''' element on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form. Further, suppose that you changed the name of the '''Customer ID''' element to '''Customer Identifier''' in a customization project. To access the '''Customer Identifier''' element on the form through the screen-based web services API, you need to regenerate the WSDL description so that it contains the definition of the {{CustomerIdentifier}} property that corresponds to the '''Customer Identifier''' element, and update your application accordingly.{br}

You can generate the WSDL file of an Acumatica ERP web service in one of the following ways.
==To Generate a WSDL File for One Acumatica ERP Form==
If your application needs to work with only one Acumatica ERP form, you can generate the web service that provides access to only this form. {br}

To generate a WSDL file for a form, on the title bar of this form, click '''Tools''' > '''Web Service''' in the UI. This opens the page that contains the description of the web service, with the following URL: {{http(s)://<ApplicationPath>/Soap/<FormID>.asmx}}. In this URL, {{<ApplicationPath>}} is replaced with the actual URL of your application, and {{<FormID>}} is replaced with the ID of the form. For example, suppose that you generated a web service for the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form of the ''WebServiceAPITest'' application, which is accessed under a secure connection and is running on a local computer. The URL of this service is {{https://localhost/WebServiceAPITest/Soap/AR303000.asmx}}.
==To Generate a WSDL File for Multiple Acumatica ERP Forms==
If your application needs to work with multiple Acumatica ERP forms, you can generate one web service that provides access to all needed forms.{br}

To generate a WSDL file for multiple forms, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_70_40|Web Services] ([~/?ScreenId=SM207040|SM207040]) form, you should do the following:[anchor|#ul_nz5_j1s_vs]
#Type the ID of the web service in the '''Service ID''' box of the Summary area of the form. This ID will be used in the URL of the generated service.
#Select the Acumatica ERP forms that your application needs to use on the left pane of the form, and click '''Add to Grid''' for each form.
#Select the types of integration these forms should provide (which can include importing data, exporting data, and submitting data) by selecting the appropriate check boxes (any combination of '''Import''', '''Export''', or '''Submit''') for corresponding rows on the right pane of the form. 
#Click '''Generate'''.
{br}

((({S:Warn}The modules that expose the selected forms should be properly configured and the forms should open in a web browser. If a form could not be opened in a web browser, the web service definition will not be generated for this form.
)))After the web service is generated, you can view the WSDL description by clicking '''View Generated''' on the form toolbar. This opens the page that contains the description of the web service with the following URL: {{http(s)://<ApplicationPath>/Soap/<ServiceID>.asmx}}. In this URL, {{<ApplicationPath>}} is replaced with the actual URL of your application, and {{<ServiceID>}} is replaced with the ID of the service that you specified in the '''Service ID''' box when configuring the service. For example, suppose that you generated a web service for multiple forms with the <tt>MYSTORE</tt> service ID for the ''WebServiceAPITest'' application, which is accessed under a secure connection and is running on a local computer. The URL of this service is {{https://localhost/WebServiceAPITest/Soap/MYSTORE.asmx}}.]]></column>

If necessary, see the documentation of your development                 environment to find out the correct way of building the proxy classes based on the                 WSDL definition. The procedure below is described based on an example of the creation of a console                 project with the  MyBIIntegrationSBAPI  name that uses the                      MYBIINTEGRATION  web service. You can create another type of Visual Studio                 project with another name and use any other web service define on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM207040|SM207040]) Web Services (SM207040) form in this procedure. In this topic, you will find instructions on how to implement the proxy classes by                 using Visual Studio 2019. Importing the WSDL File into a Visual Studio Project To import the WSDL description into your development environment, proceed as follows: Open Visual Studio, and create a new Visual C# console application with the                              MyBIIntegrationSBAPI  name and the  .NET Framework 4.8                          target framework. To create a console application, click  File New Project  on the main menu of Visual Studio. In the                                  Create a new project  dialog box, which                             appears, select the  Console App (.Net Framework)  C# template and                             click  Next . In the  Configure your new                                 project  dialog box, specify the name and location of the                             solution, select the  .NET Framework 4.8  framework version, and                             click  Create . The MyBIIntegration                             application that you have created contains the                                  Program.cs  file with the                                  Program  class. Add to the project a reference to the  Acumatica ERP web service as follows:  On the main menu of Visual Studio, click  Project Add Service Reference .  In the  Add Service Reference  dialog box, which appears, click  Advanced .  In the  Service Reference Settings  dialog box, which appears, click  Add Web Reference .  In the  URL  box of the  Add Web Reference  dialog                                 box, which appears, specify the URL of the  MYBIINTEGRATION                                  web service (see item 1 in the following screenshot).

The screen-based SOAP API depends on the user interface of Acumatica ERP forms.

You configure the sequence of commands that should be executed during data import, data export, or data processing through the web service by using an array of objects of the <tt>Command</tt> type.{br}

As you specify this sequence of commands, when you need to reflect obtaining the value of an element on a form, you should use a <tt>Field</tt> object. To specify the element whose value you need to obtain, you can do one of the following:[anchor|#ul_v5w_jg4_15]
*Select the needed <tt>Field</tt> object from the subobjects of the <tt>Field</tt> type of a <tt>Content</tt> object that corresponds to the needed Acumatica ERP form
*Create an object of the <tt>Field</tt> type and specify its properties
Both of these ways are described in detail in the following sections of this topic.
==Selection of the Fields Available in a Content Object==
If you want to obtain the value of an element on an Acumatica ERP form, you can select the needed <tt>Field</tt> object from the subobjects of the <tt>Field</tt> type of the <tt>Content</tt> object that corresponds to the form. For example, if you want to export the values of the '''Inventory ID''' and '''Description''' elements on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, you can use the following code.<source lang="csharp">//stockItemsSchema is an IN202500Content object
var commands = new Command[]
{
   ...
   <b>stockItemsSchema.StockItemSummary.InventoryID,
   stockItemsSchema.StockItemSummary.Description,<b>
   ...
};</source>
==Field Object Creation==
You can retrieve the values of not only the fields that are available on the Acumatica ERP form, but also the data fields of the data access classes (DACs) underlying the form. Some of these data fields are not available directly through the elements of the form. That is, you cannot select the needed <tt>Field</tt> object among the subobjects of the <tt>Content</tt> object. {br}

If you want to retrieve the value of an element that is not available on the form, you can create a <tt>Field</tt> object and specify its properties so that it specifies the needed data field of the DAC. You should specify the name of the object that corresponds to the needed DAC as the <tt>ObjectName</tt> and type the name of the data field in <tt>FieldName</tt>. The following code illustrates the creation of a <tt>Field</tt> object for the {{LastModifiedDateTime}} data field (which specifies the date and time when a record was modified) that is available through the DAC underlying the <tt>StockItemSummary</tt> object of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form.((({S:Warn}To find the names of the data fields that belong to DACs, you should read the applicable Acumatica ERP code. You can find the source code of Acumatica ERP on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_45_70|Source Code] ([~/?ScreenId=SM204570|SM204570]) form or in &lt;ApplicationFolder&gt;\App_Data\CodeRepository\PX.Objects\, where &lt;ApplicationFolder&gt; is replaced with the path to the folder of the Acumatica ERP application instance.

Each record in the system is identified by the values of the key elements on the applicable Acumatica ERP form. For example, a record on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form is identified by the value of the '''Inventory ID''' key element. Key elements are available through the Summary object of a form. You can use the key element or elements of the form to select all records of the form for export. The other way to specify a group of records for export is to use the elements of the Summary area of the form in custom filters. Both ways of selecting records are described in detail below.
==Export of All Records from a Form==
If you want to export every record from an Acumatica ERP form, in the array of <tt>Command</tt> objects that you pass to the <tt>Export()</tt> method, you should insert the service command of the <tt>EveryValue</tt> type for the corresponding key element on the form. The <tt>EveryValue</tt> service command is available through the <tt>ServiceCommands</tt> subobject of the Summary object of the <tt>Content</tt> object that corresponds to the form. This service command specifies that every record of the specific type should be processed during export. {br}

For example, if you want to export all stock item records available in the system, you should insert the <tt>EveryInventoryID</tt> service command, as the following code shows.<source lang="csharp">//stockItemsSchema is an IN202500Content object
var commands = new Command[]
{
   stockItemsSchema.StockItemSummary.ServiceCommands.EveryInventoryID,
   ...
};</source>
==Export of a Group of Records from a Form==You can filter the data available in the Acumatica ERP database to select the records for export. For example, you can configure the system to export only the records that have a particular status. 
To define a filter for the data being exported, you should create an array of <tt>Filter</tt> objects and add the needed filters to it. To define a filter, you should specify: [anchor|#ul_wc2_3pp_xs]
*The UI element whose value should be used for filtering (in the <tt>Field</tt> property of the <tt>Filter</tt> object).
*The value or values with which the value of the element should be compared (in the <tt>Value</tt> property or <tt>Value</tt> and <tt>Value2</tt> properties of the <tt>Filter</tt> object).
*The condition of comparison (in the <tt>Condition</tt> property of the <tt>Filter</tt> object).
If you define multiple filters in the array, you should also specify the logical operator (either {{And}} or {{Or}}) that defines how to apply these filters. If filters are passed to an <tt>Export()</tt> method, during export, the system selects only the records that conform to the specified condition (or conditions) and exports only these records. {br}

For example, suppose that you want to export only the stock item records that have the ''Active'' status. In this case, you can specify the filtering condition that the '''Item Status''' element should be equal to ''Active'', as the following code shows. During export, the system processes the records that match the filtering conditions and exports only the records with the ''Active'' status.<source lang="csharp">var filters = new Filter[]
{
    new Filter
    {
         Field = stockItemsSchema.StockItemSummary.ItemStatus,
         Condition = FilterCondition.Equals,
         Value = "Active",
    }
};</source>{br}

For filtering records, you can use either the data fields of the Summary object of the form from which you are exporting data, or the data fields of the data access class (DAC) underlying the Summary object. (In Acumatica Framework, this DAC is called the main DAC of the primary data view.) If a data field of the DAC is not available directly through the elements of the Summary object, you cannot select the needed <tt>Field</tt> object among the subobjects of a <tt>Content</tt> object, as the previous code example shows for the <tt>ItemStatus</tt> data field. Instead, you should create a new <tt>Field</tt> object and specify its properties as follows: Specify the name of the Summary object as <tt>ObjectName</tt> (that is, the object name that corresponds to the object to which the key data field belongs), and type the name of the data field as <tt>FieldName</tt> in the code directly. {br}

The following example shows filtering by the {{LastModifiedDateTime}} data field (which specifies the date and time when a record was modified) that is available through the DAC underlying the <tt>StockItemSummary</tt> object of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form. <source lang="csharp">new Filter
{
    Field = new Field 
    {
         ObjectName = stockItemsSchema.StockItemSummary.InventoryID.ObjectName,
         FieldName = "LastModifiedDateTime" 
    },
    Condition = FilterCondition.Greater,
    Value = DateTime.Now.AddMonths(-1).ToLongDateString()
}</source>]]></column>

The value or values with which the value of the element should be compared (in the                Value  property or  Value  and                Value2  properties of the  Filter  object). The condition of comparison (in the  Condition  property of the                Filter  object).

    {
         Field = stockItemsSchema.StockItemSummary.ItemStatus,
         Condition = FilterCondition.Equals,
         Value = "Active",
    }
}; For         filtering records, you can use either the data fields of the Summary object of the form from         which you are exporting data, or the data fields of the data access class (DAC) underlying         the Summary object. (In  Acumatica Framework,         this DAC is called the main DAC of the primary data view.) If a data field of the DAC is not         available directly through the elements of the Summary object, you cannot select the needed            Field  object among the subobjects of a  Content          object, as the previous code example shows for the  ItemStatus  data field.         Instead, you should create a new  Field  object and specify its properties         as follows: Specify the name of the Summary object as  ObjectName  (that         is, the object name that corresponds to the object to which the key data field belongs), and         type the name of the data field as  FieldName  in the code directly.          The following example shows filtering by the  LastModifiedDateTime          data field (which specifies the date and time when a record was modified) that is available         through the DAC underlying the  StockItemSummary  object of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form.          new Filter

*Add detail lines by using a pop-up panel. For example, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form, you can use the '''Add Sales Order''' pop-up panel, which is opened when you click '''Add Order''' on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab.

==Pop-Up Dialog Boxes==
When you update specific fields on some forms under certain circumstances, the system displays pop-up dialog boxes where you need to respond to a question (by clicking a button) in order to proceed. For example, when you update the '''Customer Class''' value on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form for an existing customer, the system displays a '''Warning''' dialog box with the text ''Please confirm if you want to update current customer settings with the customer class defaults. Otherwise, original settings will be preserved.'' and the '''Yes''' and '''No''' buttons. You should click '''Yes''' to proceed with changing the customer class. {br}

When you are specifying the sequence of commands in an array of <tt>Command</tt> objects for a processing method and you need to specify an answer to a question that would appear in a pop-up dialog box if the data was being entered manually, you should create a <tt>Value</tt> command and set its properties as follows:[anchor|#ul_z3g_nb4_ht]
*In the <tt>Value</tt> property, specify the answer that you select in the dialog box during manual entry of a record.

==Pop-Up Forms==
When you click specific buttons on some forms, the system opens a pop-up window with another Acumatica ERP form where you can specify or edit the values of elements as needed. For example, if you click '''Add Contact''' on the '''Contacts''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form, the system displays the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) form. ((({S:Warn}Do not confuse a situation when the system opens a pop-up window that contains an Acumatica ERP form with a situation when the system opens a pop-up panel (where you can specify needed settings but no Acumatica ERP form is shown). A pop-up window that contains a form has an address line in the browser where you can see the ID of the form. A pop-up panel looks like a dialog box and does not have an address line.
)))
When you are specifying a sequence of commands in an array of <tt>Command</tt> objects for a processing method and you need to reflect the setting of values of elements of a pop-up form in these commands, you should perform the following steps:[anchor|#ol_kjw_jp1_3t]
#Call an action that invokes a pop-up form as follows:
##By using the <tt>GetSchema()</tt> method of the {{PX.Soap.Helper}} class, get the <tt>Content</tt> object that corresponds to the form that invokes a pop-up form.
##Specify the command that invokes a pop-up form in the sequence of commands by using the corresponding <tt>Action</tt> command.
##Submit this sequence of commands to the form that invokes the pop-up form by using the corresponding <tt>Submit()</tt> method.
#Specify the values on the pop-up form as follows:
##By using the <tt>GetSchema()</tt> method of the {{PX.Soap.Helper}} class, get the <tt>Content</tt> object that corresponds to the form that appears as a pop-up.
##Specify the list of commands that specifies the values of needed elements of the pop-up form.
##Add the <tt>Save</tt> action to the list of commands.
##Submit this sequence of commands to the pop-up form by using the corresponding <tt>Submit()</tt> method.

Pop-Up Dialog Boxes When you update specific fields on some forms under certain circumstances, the system                 displays pop-up dialog boxes where you need to respond to a question (by clicking a                 button) in order to proceed. For example, when you update the  Customer                     Class  value on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000)                 form for an existing customer, the system displays a  Warning                  dialog box with the text  Please confirm if you want to update current customer                     settings with the customer class defaults. Otherwise, original settings will be                     preserved.  and the  Yes  and  No                  buttons.

In the  LinkedCommand  property, use a                              DialogAnswer  service command, which is available                         through the  ServiceCommands  subobject of an object that                         invokes the appearance of the pop-up dialog box.

Do not confuse a situation when the system opens a pop-up window that contains an                      Acumatica ERP form with a situation when the system opens a pop-up panel (where you can specify                 needed settings but no  Acumatica ERP form is shown). A pop-up window that contains a form has an address line in the                 browser where you can see the ID of the form.

The system uses the key element or elements on a form to find records that belong to different documents. For example, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form, there are two key elements: '''Type''' and '''Reference Nbr'''. {br}

If you know the values of the key element or elements of the needed record, you can select this record for update by specifying the key values in the sequence of commands that you pass to the processing method of the web services API. In the sequence of commands, you should first specify key element or elements to identify the record that you are going to update. After you have specified the values of key element or elements, you should specify the values of other elements in the order in which you would specify them on the form.{br}

If you do not know the values of the key element or elements of the needed record, you can update records in the system by searching for them using their unique field values that you know. For example, you can identify customers by email addresses or phone numbers. To search for a record, you have to imitate the use of a column of a '''Select''' dialog box, declare a custom key, or declare a custom field in the sequence of commands that you pass to a processing method. In this topic, you will find a detailed description of the <tt>Filter</tt> service command, which imitates the use of a selector column. You can find a description of two other approaches in [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_SB_Commands_Key|Commands for Record Searching: Key Command] and [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_SB_Commands_!FieldName|Commands for Record Searching: Custom Field]. 
==Filter Service Command==
Selector columns on an Acumatica ERP form appear when a user clicks the Magnifier icon of the key element of the form to bring up the '''Select''' dialog box. Service commands for selector columns have the <tt>Filter</tt> prefix in their names. For example, to search for a customer record, you can use the <tt>FilterCity</tt>, <tt>FilterCountry</tt>, <tt>FilterEmail</tt>, and <tt>FilterPhone1</tt> service commands.{br}

To use a column of a '''Select''' dialog box for a search, you have to do the following: [anchor|#ol_hwz_z5r_ht]
#Create a <tt>Field</tt> object, and initialize its properties with the values of the properties of the key field.
#Concatenate the <tt>FieldName</tt> property of this object (which is now equal to the value of the <tt>FieldName</tt> property of the key field) with {{!}} and the <tt>FieldName</tt> property of the needed <tt>Filter</tt> service command.
#In the <tt>Value</tt> command in the array of <tt>Command</tt> objects, set the <tt>Value</tt> property to the value that should be used for the search and the <tt>LinkedCommand</tt> property to the created <tt>Field</tt> object.
{br}

For example, the following code searches for a customer record by email address.<source lang="csharp">//custSchema is an AR303000Content object
Field customerIDSelector = custSchema.CustomerSummary.CustomerID;
customerIDSelector.FieldName += "!" + 
        custSchema.CustomerSummary.ServiceCommands.FilterEmail.FieldName;

var commands = new Command[]
{
    new Value 
    {
        Value = "demo@gmail.com", 
        LinkedCommand = customerIDSelector 
    },
    ...
};</source>{br}

((({S:Warn}If you need to get the value of the field that was used for a search as a result of the processing, you should assign an initial <tt>FieldName</tt> to the field before getting the value. For example, the following code shows how to get the value of the Customer ID element after you have modified the corresponding field for the search.<source lang="csharp">//custSchema is an AR303000Content object
//Save the initial field name of the CustomerID field
string initialCustomerIDFieldName = 
custSchema.CustomerSummary.CustomerID.FieldName;

//Configure the command that searches for a customer record 
//by using the FilterEmail service command

customerIDSelector.FieldName += "!" +

var commands = new Command[]
{ 
    //Search for the needed customer record
    new Value 
    {
         Value = customerMainContactEmail, 
         LinkedCommand = customerIDSelector 
    },

    //Do the needed modifications and save changes on the form
    ...
};

//context is a Screen object

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Commands for Record Searching: Filter Service Command The system uses the key element or elements on a form to find records that belong to different         documents. For example, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form, there         are two key elements:  Type  and  Reference Nbr .  If you know the values of the key element or elements of the needed record, you can select         this record for update by specifying the key values in the sequence of commands that you         pass to the processing method of the web services API. In the sequence of commands, you         should first specify key element or elements to identify the record that you are going to         update. After you have specified the values of key element or elements, you should specify         the values of other elements in the order in which you would specify them on the form. If you do not know the values of the key element or elements of the needed record, you can         update records in the system by searching for them using their unique field values that you         know. For example, you can identify customers by email addresses or phone numbers. To search         for a record, you have to imitate the use of a column of a  Select          dialog box, declare a custom key, or declare a custom field in the sequence of commands that         you pass to a processing method. In this topic, you will find a detailed description of the            Filter  service command, which imitates the use of a selector column.         You can find a description of two other approaches in  Commands for Record Searching: Key Command and  Commands for Record Searching: Custom Field.  Filter Service Command Selector columns on an  Acumatica ERP form appear when a user clicks the Magnifier icon of the key element of the form to bring         up the  Select  dialog box. Service commands for selector columns have         the  Filter  prefix in their names. For example, to search for a customer         record, you can use the  FilterCity ,  FilterCountry ,            FilterEmail , and  FilterPhone1  service commands. To use a column of a  Select  dialog box for a search, you have to do the         following:  Create a  Field  object, and initialize its properties with the             values of the properties of the key field. Concatenate the  FieldName  property of this object (which is now             equal to the value of the  FieldName  property of the key field) with                !  and the  FieldName  property of the needed                Filter  service command. In the  Value  command in the array of  Command              objects, set the  Value  property to the value that should be used for             the search and the  LinkedCommand  property to the created                Field  object. For example, the following code searches for a customer record by email         address. //custSchema is an AR303000Content object
Field customerIDSelector = custSchema.CustomerSummary.CustomerID;
customerIDSelector.FieldName += "!" + 
        custSchema.CustomerSummary.ServiceCommands.FilterEmail.FieldName;

var commands = new Command[]
{
    new Value 
    {
        Value = "demo@gmail.com", 
        LinkedCommand = customerIDSelector 
    },
    ...
}; If you need to get the value of the field that was used for a search as a result of           the processing, you should assign an initial  FieldName  to the field           before getting the value. For example, the following code shows how to get the value of           the Customer ID element after you have modified the corresponding field for the           search. //custSchema is an AR303000Content object
//Save the initial field name of the CustomerID field
string initialCustomerIDFieldName = 
custSchema.CustomerSummary.CustomerID.FieldName;

//Configure the command that searches for a customer record 
//by using the FilterEmail service command
Field customerIDSelector = custSchema.CustomerSummary.CustomerID;
customerIDSelector.FieldName += "!" +
custSchema.CustomerSummary.ServiceCommands.FilterEmail.FieldName;

//Configure the list of commands
var commands = new Command[]
{ 
    //Search for the needed customer record
    new Value 
    {
         Value = customerMainContactEmail, 
         LinkedCommand = customerIDSelector 
    },

    //Do the needed modifications and save changes on the form
    ...
};

//context is a Screen object
//Submit commands to the form
context.AR303000Submit(commands);

//Assign an initial field name to the CustomerID field
custSchema.CustomerSummary.CustomerID.FieldName = initialCustomerIDFieldName;

//Get the customer ID

//Submit commands to the form

To search for a record, you have to imitate the use of a column of a '''Select''' dialog box, declare a custom key, or declare a custom field in the sequence of commands that you pass to a processing method. In this topic, you will find a detailed description of the use of the <tt>Key</tt> command, which you use to declare a custom key. You can find descriptions of two other approaches in [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_SB_Commands_Filter|Commands for Record Searching: Filter Service Command] and [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_SB_Commands_!FieldName|Commands for Record Searching: Custom Field].
==Key Command==
If you specify the value of key elements on an Acumatica ERP form, the system does not change the current record in the system; instead, it searches for the record, which is identified by the values of the key elements, and selects this record. By using custom keys, you can make some elements on an Acumatica ERP form work as key elements.{br}

You can specify custom keys to search for a record or a detail line. You can use the fields of the summary object and the detail objects, but not the fields that belong to other objects, as custom key fields. For example, you can find the needed customer record in the system by using the <tt>CustomerName</tt> field of the <tt>AR303000CustomerSummary</tt> object of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form as the custom key, but you cannot find the record by using the <tt>Email</tt> field of the <tt>AR303000GeneralInfoMainContact</tt> object as the custom key.{br}

To specify a custom key, you have to define the key by using the <tt>Key</tt> command as follows:[anchor|#ol_r3y_m1s_jt]
#Create a <tt>Key</tt> command by using the operator {{new}}.
#To specify the element that should be used as a custom key, set the <tt>ObjectName</tt> and <tt>FieldName</tt> properties of the created <tt>Key</tt> command to the values of the <tt>ObjectName</tt> and <tt>FieldName</tt> properties of the field corresponding to the element.
#To specify the value of the custom key, set the <tt>Value</tt> property of the created <tt>Key</tt> command to the needed value in the format <tt>=&rsquo;&lt;Key value&gt;&rsquo;</tt>, where you should replace <tt>&lt;Key value&gt;</tt> with the needed value of the key.
Below is an example of the <tt>Key</tt> command that declares the '''Warehouse''' column as the custom key on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form.<source lang="csharp">new Key

For example, you can find the needed customer record in the         system by using the  CustomerName  field of the            AR303000CustomerSummary  object of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000) form as the         custom key, but you cannot find the record by using the  Email  field of         the  AR303000GeneralInfoMainContact  object as the custom key. To specify a custom key, you have to define the key by using the  Key          command as follows: Create a  Key  command by using the operator              new . To specify the element that should be used as a custom key, set the                ObjectName  and  FieldName  properties of the             created  Key  command to the values of the                ObjectName  and  FieldName  properties of the field             corresponding to the element. To specify the value of the custom key, set the  Value  property of             the created  Key  command to the needed value in the format                ='<Key value>' , where you should replace  <Key               value>  with the needed value of the key.

==Custom Field==
 Acumatica ERP does not include {{Filter}} service commands for all selector columns that are available on Acumatica ERP forms. To use the needed selector column for record searching, you can create a custom field as follows:{br}

[anchor|#ol_hwz_z5r_ht]
#Initialize the properties of a <tt>Field</tt> object with the values of the properties of the key field.
#Concatenate the <tt>FieldName</tt> property of this object (which is now equal to the value of the <tt>FieldName</tt> property of the key field) with {{!}} and the internal name of the selector column that you are going to use for the search. The internal name of the selector column is equal to the value of the <tt>FieldName</tt> property of the corresponding element on the form.

There are two types of elements on an Acumatica ERP form: elements with a commit, and elements without a commit. A commit is an action initiated by the form that, when triggered, sends the data to the server. On the server, the commit causes all data on the form to be updated, including the insertion of default values and the recalculation of the values of elements on the form.{br}

A commit is a costly operation that causes the browser to make requests to the server and takes server time. As such, a commit is invoked for only a limited number of elements: mainly the key elements and the elements the other elements depend on. {br}

In a Visual Studio project, if you specify the value of an element for which the system performs a commit by using a <tt>Value</tt> command, the <tt>Commit</tt> property of the <tt>LinkedCommand</tt> property (which specifies this element) is automatically set to {{true}}. You can check the value of the {{Commit}} property when you are debugging an application if you insert a breakpoint in the code after an array of commands has been configured. In the following screenshot, you can see that for the command that sets the value of the '''Customer ID''' element on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form, the <tt>Commit</tt> property of the <tt>LinkedCommand</tt> is set to {{true}}.

If the <tt>Commit</tt> property is {{false}}, the element is filled in with data but no update of the form is invoked. If the <tt>Commit</tt> property is {{true}}, after the element is filled in, the commit is invoked on the server and the form is updated. {br}

For example, when you select a customer class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form, the system assigns values to the elements related to customer class settings, such as '''Statement Cycle ID''' and '''Country'''. When you configure a sequence of commands for setting the values of elements on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form, for elements such as '''Customer''', the system automatically sets the <tt>Commit</tt> property of <tt>LinkedCommand</tt> to {{true}}.{br}

In most cases, when you compose the sequence of commands, you can use the values of the <tt>Commit</tt> property that are set by default. However, you may need to force the system to invoke a commit to the server—for example, when you need to commit the value of the field before entering another field value. In such cases, you should set the <tt>Commit</tt> property to {{true}} for the command or action. ]]></column>

For example, to obtain the file attached to a warehouse detail line of a             stock item on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items             form, you use the  Attachment  service command of the                IN202500WarehouseDetails  object.

For some text boxes on Acumatica ERP forms, users can type values in multiple languages if multiple locales are configured in Acumatica ERP. For example, if your Acumatica ERP instance has English and French locales activated and multilingual user input configured, you can specify the value of the '''Description''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form in English and French. For the list of elements that support multiple languages, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__CON_Boxes_MultiLanguage|Boxes that Have Multi-Language Support]. For details on how to turn on multilingual user input, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__CON_Locales_and_Languages#section_lqy_4c2_jw|Enabling Multilingual User Input].
==Specifying Localized Values of a Multi-Language Field==
When you need to specify localized values of a text box by using the screen-based SOAP API, you specify the value of the field that corresponds to the box as a string in JSON format with the localized values. In this string, you use the two-letter ISO code of the language with which the value should be associated.{br}

In the example that is mentioned at the beginning of the topic, if you need to specify values in English and French in the '''Description''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form, you specify the value of the <tt>Description</tt> field of the <tt>StockItem</tt> entity in the following format: {{[{en:English description},{fr:French description}]}}, as shown in the following code fragment.<source lang="csharp">//stockItemSchema is an IN202500Content object
new Value 
{
    Value = "[{en:Item},{fr:Pièce}]", 
    LinkedCommand = stockItemSchema.StockItemSummary.Description 
}</source>[anchor|#_fd8468a2-125a-45ed-89d7-6e13ca75446f]((({S:Warn}In the JSON-formatted string, you should specify the actual values of the field in all languages that are configured for multilingual user input. If you specify the values of the field in particular languages, the values of the field in other languages configured for multilingual user input become empty. For example, suppose that in your instance of Acumatica ERP, multi-language fields can have values in English and French. If you pass the value of a field in the following format {{[{en:English description}]}}, the French value of the field becomes empty.
)))
If you specify the value of a multi-language field as plain text, this text is saved as the value of the corresponding box in the current language of Acumatica ERP (that is, either the default language of the instance or the language that you have specified by using the <tt>SetLocaleName()</tt> method). For details on how to specify the locale through the screen-based SOAP API, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_SB_SetLocaleName|SetLocaleName() Method].
==Retrieving Localized Values of a Multi-Language Field==
If you need to retrieve localized values of a text box that supports multiple input languages, you retrieve the value of an internal field that contains all localized values of the text box and has the ''Translations'' suffix in its field name. {br}

To specify the field name and the object name of the needed internal field with localized values, you specify the field name and the object name of the multi-language text box and append ''Translations'' to the field name. For example, the following code shows the command that you should use to retrieve the localized values of the '''Description''' element of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form. {{{{//stockItemSchema is an IN202500Content object
new Field
{
    ObjectName = stockItemsSchema.StockItemSummary.Description.ObjectName,
    FieldName = stockItemsSchema.StockItemSummary.Description.FieldName + 
      "Translations"
}
}}}}
The returned value of a <tt>Translations</tt> field is a string in JSON format with the available localized values of the field. The language to which the value belongs is identified by the two-letter ISO code of the language. For example, suppose that the '''Description''' element of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form has the value ''Item'' in English and ''Pièce'' in French. In this case, the value of the <tt>DescrTranslations</tt> field, which corresponds to the '''Description''' element, is the following string: {{[{en:Item},{fr:Pièce}]}}.

 Acumatica ERP provides push notifications that make it possible for the external applications to track the changes in the data in Acumatica ERP. That is, you can configure Acumatica ERP to send notifications to a destination (such as an HTTP address) when specific data changes in Acumatica ERP. The external application can receive these notifications and process the information on the data changes, if necessary. With push notifications, the external application doesn&rsquo;t need to continually poll for the data to find out whether there are any changes in this data, which helps improve the performance of the external application.{br}

In this chapter, you can find information on how to configure Acumatica ERP to send push notifications.

))){br}

To work with Acumatica ERP push notifications, you need to configure the following items:[anchor|#_513cde08-9528-4cae-b2dd-2d1ae2bf7a50]
*The data query that defines the data changes for which Acumatica ERP should send notifications
*The destination to which Acumatica ERP should send notifications
*The way the external application processes the notifications
*The definition of the push notification in Acumatica ERP, which specifies the data query and the notification destination
{br}

The following diagram illustrates the sending of a push notification. In the diagram, rectangles with a red border indicate the items that you need to configure to receive push notifications when changes occur.[anchor|#_f4031980-8b47-4a79-b093-7dd4decf1709][anchor|#_d388d6c4-5767-4b93-8579-41279e837454][image:UserGuide/Images/PushNotifications.png|popup|Sending a push notification|450px]{br}{TOC}
==Data Query==
The data query can be defined by either a generic inquiry or a built-in definition (which is a data query defined in code). For details on generic inquiries, see [HelpRoot_ReportingTools\SM__MNG_Managing_Generic_Inquiry|Managing Generic Inquiries]. For information on how to create a built-in definition, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\CC__how_Push_Create_Built-In_Definition|To Create a Built-In Definition]. You can define multiple queries for one notification destination.{br}

The data query should adhere to the recommendations described in [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_Push_Requirements_to_Query|Recommendations for the Data Queries]. 
==Notification Destination==
The following predefined notification destinations are provided: webhook (HTTP address), message queue, or SignalR hub. For more information on the predefined notification destinations, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_Push_Notification_Destinations|Push Notification Destinations]. You can also create your own destination type, as described in [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\CC__how_Push_Create_Custom_Destination_Type|To Create a Custom Destination Type].
==Processing of the Notifications in the External Application==
The external application can process the notifications and extract the information about the data changes. Acumatica ERP sends notifications to notification destinations in JSON format. For details on the format of the notifications, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_Push_Notification_Format|Push Notification Format]. If your application watches notifications in the SignalR hub, you need to connect to the hub, as described in [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\CC__how_Push_Connect_to_SignalR_Hub|To Connect to the SignalR Hub]. 
==Definition of the Push Notification ==
In the definition of the push notification on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_00|Push Notifications] ([~/?ScreenId=SM302000|SM302000]) form, you specify the notification destination and the data queries for which the notifications should be sent.

When you configure a push notification on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_00|Push Notifications] ([~/?ScreenId=SM302000|SM302000]) form of Acumatica ERP, you select the type of the notification destinations, which can be any of the predefined types described in this topic. You can also create your own destination type, as described in [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\CC__how_Push_Create_Custom_Destination_Type|To Create a Custom Destination Type] in the Acumatica Framework Developer Guide.{br}{TOC}
==Webhook==
A webhook is an HTTP address to which Acumatica ERP sends HTTP {{POST}} requests with notification information. For this destination type, you specify a valid HTTP address (such as {{http://localhost:80/main.aspx?pushqueue}}) in the '''Address''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_00|Push Notifications] ([~/?ScreenId=SM302000|SM302000]) form. For security reasons, you can specify a header of the HTTP request in the '''Header Name''' and '''Header Value''' boxes.[anchor|#_8c7b08d2-88c5-43cb-b582-3a97c8d74eca]((({S:Warn}Do not specify the {{Accept}} and {{Content-Type}} headers for the request. The values of these headers are specified automatically by the system.
))){br}

If Acumatica ERP cannot send notifications to the HTTP address, Acumatica ERP logs information on the failed notifications and displays these notifications on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_50_20_00|Process Push Notifications] ([~/?ScreenId=SM502000|SM502000]) form. You can resend the failed notifications for two days, after which the notifications are removed from the Acumatica ERP database. For details on how to resend notifications, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__how_Process_Failed_Notifications|To Process Failed Notifications]. 
==Message Queue==
The message queue is a local or remote private Microsoft message queue. You specify the address of the message queue (such as {{MyComputer\private$\TestQueueForPushNotificatons}}) in the '''Address''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_00|Push Notifications] ([~/?ScreenId=SM302000|SM302000]) form. For information on how to configure a private Microsoft message queue, see the Microsoft documentation. {br}

The message queue is the most reliable destination type protected from network failures. However, if Acumatica ERP cannot send notifications to the message queue for some reason, Acumatica ERP logs information about the failed notifications and displays these notifications on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_50_20_00|Process Push Notifications] ([~/?ScreenId=SM502000|SM502000]) form. You can resend the failed notifications for two days, after which the notifications are removed from the Acumatica ERP database. For information on how to resend notifications, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__how_Process_Failed_Notifications|To Process Failed Notifications]. 
==SignalR Hub==
The SignalR hub is the destination type implemented in Acumatica ERP by using the ASP.NET SignalR library. The address of this destination type is {{PushNotificationsHub}}, which is filled in automatically in the '''Address''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_00|Push Notifications] form. This destination type can be used if you can expose neither an HTTP address (webhook) nor a message queue to receive push notifications. If Acumatica ERP is configured to send notifications to the SignalR hub, the external application can connect to Acumatica ERP through websoket or a long-polling mechanism and receive notifications through this connection. If multiple external applications are connected to the SignalR hub, they receive notifications simultaneously. For information on how to connect your application to the SignalR hub of Acumatica ERP, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\CC__how_Push_Connect_to_SignalR_Hub|To Connect to the SignalR Hub] in the Acumatica Framework Developer Guide.{br}

The SignalR hub destination type is not reliable: If the connection fails or there are no clients connected to the SignalR hub when a notification comes, this notification will not be sent and it cannot be resent later.]]></column>

You can also create your own destination type, as described in  To Create a Custom Destination Type in the  Acumatica Framework     Developer Guide. Webhook A webhook is an HTTP address to which  Acumatica ERP     sends HTTP  POST  requests with notification information. For this destination     type, you specify a valid HTTP address (such as       http://localhost:80/main.aspx?pushqueue ) in the  Address      box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM302000|SM302000]) Push Notifications (SM302000) form. For security reasons, you can     specify a header of the HTTP request in the  Header Name  and       Header Value  boxes. Do not specify the  Accept  and                  Content-Type  headers for the request. The values of these headers             are specified automatically by the system. If  Acumatica ERP     cannot send notifications to the HTTP address,  Acumatica ERP     logs information on the failed notifications and displays these notifications on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM502000|SM502000]) Process Push Notifications (SM502000) form. You can     resend the failed notifications for two days, after which the notifications are removed from the       Acumatica ERP database.

))){br}

You need to define the data query or data queries for which Acumatica ERP should send notifications on data changes. Each data query can be defined by either a generic inquiry or a built-in definition. For details on generic inquiries, see [HelpRoot_ReportingTools\SM__MNG_Managing_Generic_Inquiry|Managing Generic Inquiries]. For information on how to create a built-in definition, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\CC__how_Push_Create_Built-In_Definition|To Create a Built-In Definition] in the Acumatica Framework Development Guide. For details on defining the data queries, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_Push_Requirements_to_Query|Recommendations for the Data Queries]. {br}

You should also identify the notification destination that your external application will scan, which can be one of the following: webhook (HTTP address), message queue, or SignalR hub. For more information on the notification destinations, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_Push_Notification_Destinations|Push Notification Destinations].

In Acumatica ERP or an Acumatica Framework-based application, you can configure push notifications for a query that is defined as a class in the source code of the application—that is, for a built-in definition of the query. The built-in definition can be implemented in a project of your Acumatica ERP extension library, in a ''Code'' item of an Acumatica ERP customization project, or in a project of your Acumatica Framework-based application. (For the differences between the use of extension libraries and ''Code'' items in a customization project, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Customization\CG_Platform_TO_Code_ExtLib_vsCode|Extension Library (DLL) Versus Code in a Customization Project] in the Customization Guide.) {br}

To create a built-in definition, follow the instructions in this topic. For more information on the push notifications, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__mng_Push_Notificatons|Configuring Push Notifications] in the Integration Development Guide.

#In the class that implements the <tt>IPushNotificationSender</tt> interface, implement the following methods and properties of the interface:
#*The <tt>Address</tt> property, which is the address to which the system should send notifications. A user specifies the value of this property in the '''Address''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_00|Push Notifications] ([~/?ScreenId=SM302000|SM302000]) form. The property uses the following syntax.<source lang="csharp">string Address { get; }</source>
#*The <tt>Name</tt> property, which is the name of the notification destination. A user specifies the value of this property in the '''Destination Name''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_00|Push Notifications] ([~/?ScreenId=SM302000|SM302000]) form. Use the following syntax for the property.<source lang="csharp">string Name { get; }</source>
#*The <tt>Send</tt> method, which sends a notification synchronously and uses as the parameters the notification to be sent and a cancellation token. The method uses the following syntax.<source lang="csharp">void Send(
  NotificationResultWrapper results, 
  CancellationToken cancellationToken

#*The <tt>TypeDescription</tt> property, which is a {{string}} label of the destination type. A user selects the value of this property in the '''Destination Type''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_00|Push Notifications] ([~/?ScreenId=SM302000|SM302000]) form.

A webhook helps you to integrate external applications that provide data in their own format and need to submit this data to Acumatica ERP. For example, HubSpot collects data about email clicks and can export this data in a specific format to a particular URL.

Suppose you need to register employee time activities. For that purpose, you plan to use the Toggl app, which is used to track employees’ time. To send data about tracked time periods from Toggl to Acumatica ERP, you need to create a webhook. The following example shows how to implement time tracking in Acumatica ERP by using Toggl.{br}{TOC}
==Step 1: Preparing Toggl==
First, you need to prepare the external application, which in this case is Toggl. Do the following:[anchor|#_767ee87d-375d-44fa-925a-3dc8701cac92]
#On ''toggl.com'', sign up for an account, and sign in to that account.
#Create a time entry, which you will use later to test the connection. In the entry, specify the entry description. Otherwise, you may get the ''500 Internal Server Error'' during testing.
#On the Toggl website, open your profile page, and copy the API token, which is located at the bottom of the page.

==Step 2: Creating an Implementation Class==
To create an implementation class, do the following:[anchor|#_c46c4c89-03fe-4cc6-9e52-ebe0f3e36460]
#In Visual Studio, create a new project called ''TestWebhook'' based on the ''Class Library (.NET Framework)'' template.
#In the project, create a new class with the following code.{{{{namespace TestWebhook
{
  public class ToggleWebhookHandler : IWebhookHandler
  {
    public async Task&lt;System.Web.Http.IHttpActionResult&gt; ProcessRequestAsync(
      HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {            
      using (var scope = GetAdminScope())
      {
        var graph = PXGraph.CreateInstance&lt;TimeEntry&gt;();
        var timeEntry = await request.Content.ReadAsAsync&lt;dynamic&gt;(cancellationToken);
        int duration = timeEntry.duration;
        var ownerId = 2892;
        DateTimeOffset date = timeEntry.at;
        string summary = timeEntry.description;
        string project = timeEntry.project?.name ?? "X";
        var ta = graph.Items.Insert(new PMTimeActivity() { Date = date.LocalDateTime, 
          TimeSpent = duration, OwnerID = new Guid("B5344897-037E-4D58-B5C3-1BDFD0F47BF9"), 
          Summary = summary });
        graph.Items.Cache.SetValueExt&lt;PMTimeActivity.projectID&gt;(ta, project);
        graph.Items.Cache.SetValueExt(ta, "NoteText", "Created from Toggle");
        graph.Actions.PressSave();
      }
      return new OkResult(request);
    }
    private IDisposable GetAdminScope()
    {
      var userName = "admin";
      if (PXDatabase.Companies.Length &gt; 0)
      {
        var company = PXAccess.GetCompanyName();
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(company))
        {
          company = PXDatabase.Companies[0];
        }
        userName = userName + "@" + company;
      }
      return new PXLoginScope(userName);
    }
  }
}
}}}}
#:In the code above, you are implementing the <tt>ProcessRequestAsync</tt> method of the <tt>IWebhookHandler</tt> interface. Inside the method, you are creating an instance of the <tt>TimeEntry</tt> graph, parsing the contents of the request, inserting the parsed data in the cache, and saving your changes to the database. 
#:For more information on working with graphs, refer to [HelpRoot_Dev_Platform\BL__mng|Implementing Business Logic].
#Add references to the <tt>PX.Data</tt>, <tt>PX.Objects</tt>, and <tt>PX.Common</tt> assemblies located in the <tt>Bin</tt> folder of your Acumatica ERP instance.
#Add the following <tt>using</tt> directives.{{{{using System;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.Web.Http.Results;
using PX.Data;
using PX.Data.Webhooks;
using PX.Objects.CR;
using PX.Objects.PM;
}}}}
#Build the project.

==Step 3: Preparing the Webhook==
To prepare the webhook, do the following:[anchor|#_8bdd0ff0-78e6-4b6d-bd2a-92da3f889b2d]
#Copy the <tt>TestWebhook.dll</tt> file of the class library that you created in the previous step to the <tt>Bin</tt> folder of your Acumatica ERP instance.
#In Acumatica ERP, open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_40_00|Webhooks] ([~/?ScreenId=SM304000|SM304000]) form.
#In the '''Webhook Name''' box, enter the name of the webhook: <tt>TestWebhook</tt>.
#In the '''Implementation Class''' box, start typing the name of the class: <tt>ToggleWebhookHandler</tt>. The system will suggest the name of the class based on the added DLL. Select the suggested name: ''TestWebhook.ToggleWebhookHandler''.
#On the page toolbar, click '''Save'''.
#:In the '''URL''' box, the generated URL appears. An example of this URL is shown below.{{{{http://localhost/PhoneRepairShop/Webhooks/
  Company/3d5c2d34-26ed-48bf-9879-cd7f52163c0a
}}}}
#:If {{localhost}} is inserted in the URL, replace it with your computer address so that the webhook is accessible from outside your computer.

==Step 4: Saving the Webhook to a Customization Project==
To simplify deploying a created webhook in another environment, you can add the created webhook to a customization project by doing the following:[anchor|#_813340e7-4e67-4f23-95bf-d571159e6935]
#Open a customization project in the Customization Project Editor. For details, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Customization\CG_GL_Project_Opening|To Open a Project]. For details on creating a project, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Customization\CG_GL_Projects_Starting_Creating|To Create a New Project]
#In the navigation pane, click '''Webhooks'''.
#On the Webhooks page, which opens, click '''Add New Record'''.
#In the '''Add Webhooks''' dialog box, which opens, select the ''TestWebhook'' row, and click '''OK'''.
#Add the <tt>TestWebhook.dll</tt> file as a file item: 
##In the navigation pane, click '''Files'''.
##On the Custom Files page toolbar, click '''Add New Record'''.
##In the '''Add Files''' dialog box, which opens, select the <tt>Bin\TestWebhook.dll</tt> file.
##Click '''Save'''.
##:The dialog box is closed, and the file appears on the Custom Files page.

To deploy this webhook in a different environment, you can import and publish this customization project instead of adding the DLL file and registering file on the Webhooks form. For details, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Customization\CG_GL_Projects|Managing Customization Projects] and [HelpRoot_Dev_Customization\CG_GL_Items_Webhook_SaveCustomItem|To Add a Webhook to a Project].
==Step 5: Configuring the External Application==
In general, you should configure your external application by specifying the URL generated after the webhook registration in the external application.{br}

However, in this case, the Toggl application cannot interact using HTTP, so you should use the Zapier application to help connect the Toggl application and Acumatica ERP. To configure the Zapier application, do the following:[anchor|#_490a405e-dcd1-4c90-ad19-6457044e8e07]
#On ''zapier.com'', sign up for an account, and sign in to that account.
#Create a new zap based on the following template: ''zapier.com/app/editor/template/90071''.
#:((({S:Warn}If a template is not available, create a new zap which connects the Toggle app with Acumatica ERP.
)))
#:In the new zap, specify the Toggl account you created in Step 1.
#In the '''Customize Time Entry''' section of a new zap, click the '''Test and Review''' button. Make sure the test time entry you created in Step 1 is displayed.
#In the '''Customize Post''' section, add the URL you generated in Step 3.
#:Make sure the connection is valid.
#Turn on the created zap.

==Step 6: Testing the Webhook==
To test the webhook you have created, do the following:[anchor|#_1e5a8b78-93d7-4779-ab6e-bfac6e75bc85]
#On the Toggl website, create a time entry and specify its description.
#:The information about the time entry is sent to Acumatica ERP via Zapier.
#:((({S:Warn}You can specify a particular project to which the time activity will be registered. To do that, you need to specify the project name in Toggl and have a default task for this project specified on the '''Tasks''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form.
)))
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_40_00|Webhooks] ([~/?ScreenId=SM304000|SM304000]) form. On the '''Request History''' tab, you will see the ''POST'' request sent from Toggl.
#To view the body of the request, in the table, select the request, and on the table toolbar, click '''Show Request Details'''.
#:The request should contain the body in JSON format with the time entry details.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Webhook Configuration Example Suppose you need to register employee time activities. For that purpose, you plan to use the         Toggl app, which is used to track employees’ time. To send data about tracked time periods         from Toggl to  Acumatica ERP, you need to create a webhook. The following example shows how to implement time tracking         in  Acumatica ERP by using Toggl. Step 1: Preparing Toggl First, you need to prepare the external application, which in this case is Toggl. Do the         following: On  toggl.com , sign up for an account, and sign in to that account. Create a time entry, which you will use later to test the connection. In the entry, specify           the entry description. Otherwise, you may get the  500 Internal Server Error  during           testing. On the Toggl website, open your profile page, and copy the API token, which is located at           the bottom of the page. Step 2: Creating an Implementation Class To create an implementation class, do the following: In Visual Studio, create a new project called  TestWebhook  based on the  Class             Library (.NET Framework)  template. In the project, create a new class with the following             code. namespace TestWebhook
{
  public class ToggleWebhookHandler : IWebhookHandler
  {
    public async Task<System.Web.Http.IHttpActionResult> ProcessRequestAsync(
      HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {            
      using (var scope = GetAdminScope())
      {
        var graph = PXGraph.CreateInstance<TimeEntry>();
        var timeEntry = await request.Content.ReadAsAsync<dynamic>(cancellationToken);
        int duration = timeEntry.duration;
        var ownerId = 2892;
        DateTimeOffset date = timeEntry.at;
        string summary = timeEntry.description;
        string project = timeEntry.project?.name ?? "X";
        var ta = graph.Items.Insert(new PMTimeActivity() { Date = date.LocalDateTime, 
          TimeSpent = duration, OwnerID = new Guid("B5344897-037E-4D58-B5C3-1BDFD0F47BF9"), 
          Summary = summary });
        graph.Items.Cache.SetValueExt<PMTimeActivity.projectID>(ta, project);
        graph.Items.Cache.SetValueExt(ta, "NoteText", "Created from Toggle");
        graph.Actions.PressSave();
      }
      return new OkResult(request);
    }
    private IDisposable GetAdminScope()
    {
      var userName = "admin";
      if (PXDatabase.Companies.Length > 0)
      {
        var company = PXAccess.GetCompanyName();
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(company))
        {
          company = PXDatabase.Companies[0];
        }
        userName = userName + "@" + company;
      }
      return new PXLoginScope(userName);
    }
  }
} In             the code above, you are implementing the  ProcessRequestAsync  method             of the  IWebhookHandler  interface. Inside the method, you are creating             an instance of the  TimeEntry  graph, parsing the contents of the             request, inserting the parsed data in the cache, and saving your changes to the             database.  For more information on working with graphs, refer to  Implementing Business Logic. Add references to the  PX.Data ,  PX.Objects , and              PX.Common  assemblies located in the  Bin  folder           of your  Acumatica ERP instance. Add the following  using       directives. using System;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.Web.Http.Results;
using PX.Data;
using PX.Data.Webhooks;
using PX.Objects.CR;
using PX.Objects.PM; Build the project. Step 3: Preparing the Webhook To prepare the webhook, do the following: Copy the  TestWebhook.dll  file of the class library that you created in      the previous step to the  Bin  folder of your  Acumatica ERP      instance. In  Acumatica ERP,      open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM304000|SM304000]) Webhooks (SM304000) form. In the  Webhook Name  box, enter the name of the webhook:        TestWebhook . In the  Implementation Class  box, start typing the name of the class:        ToggleWebhookHandler . The system will suggest the name of the class      based on the added DLL. Select the suggested name:       TestWebhook.ToggleWebhookHandler . On the page toolbar, click  Save . In the  URL              box, the generated URL appears.  An example of this URL is shown             below. http://localhost/PhoneRepairShop/Webhooks/
  Company/3d5c2d34-26ed-48bf-9879-cd7f52163c0a If                localhost  is inserted in the URL, replace it with your computer             address so that the webhook is accessible from outside your computer. Step 4: Saving the Webhook to a Customization Project To simplify deploying a created webhook in another environment, you can add the created     webhook to a customization project by doing the following: Open a customization project in the  Customization Project Editor.      For details, see  To Open a Project. For      details on creating a project, see  To Create a New ProjectIn the navigation pane, click  Webhooks . On the Webhooks page, which opens, click  Add New Record . In the  Add Webhooks  dialog box, which opens, select the              TestWebhook  row, and click  OK . Add the  TestWebhook.dll  file as a file item:  In the navigation pane, click  Files . On the Custom Files page toolbar, click  Add New Record . In the  Add Files  dialog box, which opens, select the                  Bin\TestWebhook.dll  file. Click  Save . The dialog box is closed, and the file appears                 on the Custom Files page. To deploy this webhook in a different environment, you can import and publish this     customization project instead of adding the DLL file and registering file on the Webhooks form.     For details, see  Managing Customization Projects and  To Add a Webhook to a Project. Step 5: Configuring the External Application In general, you should configure your external application by specifying the URL generated     after the webhook registration in the external application. However, in this case, the Toggl application cannot interact using HTTP, so you should use the         Zapier application to help connect the Toggl application and  Acumatica ERP. To configure the Zapier application, do the following: On  zapier.com , sign up for an account, and sign in to that account. Create a new zap based on the following template:              zapier.com/app/editor/template/90071 . If a template is not available, create             a new zap which connects the Toggle app with  Acumatica ERP. In the new zap, specify the Toggl account you created in Step 1. In the  Customize Time Entry  section of a new zap, click the              Test and Review  button. Make sure the test time entry you created           in Step 1 is displayed. In the  Customize Post  section, add the URL you generated in Step             3. Make sure the connection is valid. Turn on the created zap. Step 6: Testing the Webhook To test the webhook you have created, do the following: On the Toggl website, create a time entry and specify its description. The information             about the time entry is sent to  Acumatica ERP via Zapier. You can specify a particular project to which the time activity             will be registered. To do that, you need to specify the project name in Toggl and have a             default task for this project specified on the  Tasks  tab of the                 ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM304000|SM304000]) Webhooks (SM304000) form. On the  Request             History  tab, you will see the  POST  request sent from Toggl. To view the body of the request, in the table, select the request, and on the table toolbar,           click  Show Request Details . The request should contain the body             in JSON format with the time entry details. ]]></column>

You can create a Visual Studio project and use the REST schema contained in the Acumatica ERP<tt>swagger.json</tt> files for interaction with Acumatica ERP. You import a REST schema to a Visual Studio solution in two stages:[anchor|#_24f99141-4633-4d2c-9bf7-8ddeea2b700b]
#You generate Visual Studio packages from a REST schema.
#You include the generated Visual Studio packages in your Visual Studio solution.
{br}

The following sections provide instructions on these stages, as well as an example of the use of the imported REST schema.
==To Generate Visual Studio Packages from a REST Schema==[anchor|#_40e99f80-d6d8-4e55-a33b-0d6354a10540]
#Obtain the <tt>swagger.json</tt> file you need.
#Open the website [https://editor.swagger.io].
#Insert the contents of the <tt>swagger.json</tt> file into the website&rsquo;s edit box.
#:The website suggests that you convert the JSON contents to YAML format.
#Click '''OK''' to agree to the suggestion or '''Cancel''' to leave the contents in JSON format; neither of these actions affects the result of parsing the file.
#:The website engine parses the REST schema contained in the <tt>swagger.json</tt> file and create the visual representation of the REST schema.
#On the '''Generate Client''' menu, invoke the '''csharp''' command.
#:The <tt>csharp-client-generated.zip</tt> archive is downloaded to your computer. The archive contains the ''IO.Swagger'' Visual Studio solution, two Visual C# projects (''IO.Swagger'' and ''IO.Swagger.Test''), and other files.
#Extract the <tt>csharp-client-generated.zip</tt> archive.
#Make sure that the <tt>IO.Swagger</tt> solution can be built.
((({S:Warn}To compile the ''IO.Swagger'' and ''IO.Swagger.Test'' projects, you may have to explicitly specify the path to the <tt>RestSharp.dll</tt> library. In addition, you may get compilation errors related to the misuse of the {{override}} keyword and the absence of the {{BaseValidate}} method. To fix these errors, remove the misused {{override}} keyword and the entire command that contains the nonexistent {{BaseValidate}} method.
)))
==To Add the Generated Projects to a Visual Studio Solution==[anchor|#_9d3dcd1f-d113-4031-a277-d64d4644d982]
#In Visual Studio, create a C# project.
#In your project, add a reference to the <tt>Newtonsoft.Json</tt> library as follows:
##In Solution Explorer, right-click your project.
##Click '''Manage NuGet Packages'''.
##Select the '''Browse''' tab.
##Search for the <tt>Newtonsoft.Json</tt> library, and install it.
#In the folders containing the unpacked contents from the <tt>csharp-client-generated.zip</tt> archives, rename the ''IO.Swagger'' projects and the {{IO.Swagger}} namespaces to avoid the name conflict.
#:You do not have to add the <tt>IO.Swagger.Test</tt> projects to the solution of your C# project.
#Add the former ''IO.Swagger'' projects to the solution of your C# project.
#In your project, add a reference to the <tt>RestSharp.dll</tt> library that is used by either of the added projects.
#Add your code that uses the REST API to your project.

==Example of the Use of the Imported REST Schema==
Following is an example of the use of the projects that are generated from <tt>swagger.json</tt> files. One <tt>swagger.json</tt> file is related to an Acumatica ERP instance, and another <tt>swagger.json</tt> file is related to the endpoint with the name ''Default'' and Version 18.200.001. The namespace of the instance REST API is renamed to {{Instance_Api}}, and the namespace of the endpoint REST API is renamed to {{Default_18_Api}}. In the example, sign-in occurs, all available sales orders are retrieved, and then sign-out is performed.{{{{using Default_18_Api.Api;

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[To Import a REST Schema to a Visual Studio Solution You can create a Visual Studio project and use the REST schema contained in the  Acumatica ERPswagger.json  files for interaction with  Acumatica ERP. You import a REST schema to a Visual Studio solution in two stages: You generate Visual Studio packages from a REST schema. You include the generated Visual Studio packages in your Visual Studio                         solution. The following sections provide instructions on these stages, as well as an example of                 the use of the imported REST schema. To Generate Visual Studio Packages from a REST Schema Obtain the  swagger.json  file you need. Open the website  . Insert the contents of the  swagger.json  file into the                     website's edit box. The website suggests that you convert the JSON contents to                         YAML format. Click  OK  to agree to the suggestion or                          Cancel  to leave the contents in JSON format; neither                     of these actions affects the result of parsing the file. The website engine                         parses the REST schema contained in the  swagger.json                          file and create the visual representation of the REST schema. On the  Generate Client  menu, invoke the                          csharp  command. The                              csharp-client-generated.zip  archive is downloaded                         to your computer. The archive contains the  IO.Swagger  Visual Studio                         solution, two Visual C# projects ( IO.Swagger  and                              IO.Swagger.Test ), and other files. Extract the  csharp-client-generated.zip  archive. Make sure that the  IO.Swagger  solution can be built. To compile the  IO.Swagger  and  IO.Swagger.Test  projects, you may have                 to explicitly specify the path to the  RestSharp.dll  library. In                 addition, you may get compilation errors related to the misuse of the                      override  keyword and the absence of the                      BaseValidate  method. To fix these errors, remove the misused                      override  keyword and the entire command that contains the                 nonexistent  BaseValidate  method. To Add the Generated Projects to a Visual Studio Solution In Visual Studio, create a C# project. In your project, add a reference to the                          Newtonsoft.Json                      library as follows: In Solution Explorer, right-click your project. Click  Manage NuGet Packages . Select the  Browse  tab. Search for the  Newtonsoft.Json  library, and install                             it. In the folders containing the unpacked contents from the                          csharp-client-generated.zip  archives, rename the                          IO.Swagger  projects and the  IO.Swagger  namespaces to                     avoid the name conflict. You do not have to add the                              IO.Swagger.Test  projects to the solution of your C#                         project. Add                      the                     former  IO.Swagger  projects                      to the solution of your C# project. In your project, add a reference to the  RestSharp.dll                      library that is used                     by                      either of the added projects . Add your code that uses the REST API to your project. Example of the Use of the Imported REST Schema Following is an example of the use of the projects that are generated from                      swagger.json  files. One  swagger.json                  file is related to an  Acumatica ERP instance, and another  swagger.json  file is related to the                 endpoint with the name  Default  and Version 18.200.001. The namespace of the                 instance REST API is renamed to  Instance_Api , and the namespace of                 the endpoint REST API is renamed to  Default_18_Api . In the example,                 sign-in occurs, all available sales orders are retrieved, and then sign-out is                 performed. using Default_18_Api.Api;

==Usage Notes==
When the Acumatica ERP web services receive a {{Put}} request that contains an entity with at least one <tt>Search</tt> object, Acumatica ERP tries to search for a record by using the specified search value or values, and does one of the following:[anchor|#_e815a241-0d49-4f74-9609-89fd034437b9]
*If the record that satisfies the specified conditions has been found, Acumatica ERP updates the fields of the record that are specified by using the <tt>Value</tt> objects. 
*If no record has been found that satisfies the specified conditions, a new record is inserted. Note that the values that were specified with the <tt>Search</tt> objects are inserted into the created record in the same way as the values specified with the <tt>Value</tt> objects are inserted.
*If multiple records have been found, Acumatica ERP returns an error.

For the key fields of a record that are passed in the {{Put}} request as <tt>Value</tt> objects, the service converts the corresponding <tt>Value</tt> objects to <tt>Search</tt> objects. {br}

When the Acumatica ERP web services receive a {{Put}} request that contains only <tt>Value</tt>, <tt>Return</tt>, and <tt>Skip</tt> objects without key fields specified, Acumatica ERP adds a new record with the specified values.{br}

The workflow of a {{Put}} request is illustrated in the following diagram.[anchor|#_2bdb29e8-386b-4a8d-9d39-aec9f3367319][anchor|#_047562d2-115b-4158-bd69-728cf6c4f91c][image:UserGuide/Images/PutWorkflow.png|popup|<tt>Put()</tt> workflow|450px]]]></column>
			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Put() Method You use the  Put()  method to create or modify a record on a data entry         form of  Acumatica ERP. For example, by using the  Put()  method, you can create a customer         record on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000) form. You also use this method to retrieve data from an inquiry form. For example, by using the            Put()  method, you can retrieve data from the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN401000|IN401000]) Inventory Summary (IN401000) form. Syntax public Entity Put(Entity entity) Parameter entity : The entity that specifies the values of the fields of the created record,           or the entity that specifies the record that should be modified and the values of the           fields that should be modified in this record.  If you use this method to create or             modify a record on a data entry form, the entity must specify only one record in  Acumatica ERP. If the entity specifies more than one record or no records, an error is returned             during the execution of the method. Return Value The method returns the  Entity  object that corresponds to the created or         modified record. Example 1: Creating a Record The following example creates a customer record with the specified field values in  Acumatica ERP. //Specify the values of a new customer record
Customer customerToBeCreated = new Customer
{
  CustomerID = new StringValue { Value = "JOHNGOOD" },
  CustomerName = new StringValue { Value = John Good" },

      PostalCode = new StringValue { Value = "98033" }
    }
  }
};

//Create a customer record with the specified values
Customer newCustomer = (Customer) soapClient.Put(customerToBeCreated); Example 2: Updating a Record The following example searches for the needed customer record in  Acumatica ERP by the email address and updates the record with the specified customer class         value. //Select the needed customer record and 
//specify the values that should be updated
var customerToBeUpdated = new Customer

};

//Update the customer record with the specified values
var updCustomer = (Customer)soapClient.Put(customerToBeUpdated); Example 3: Retrieving Data from an Inquiry Form The following example retrieves the values of all elements available for a stock item from         the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN401000|IN401000]) Inventory Summary (IN401000) inquiry         form. //Filter details by warehouse

  ...
} Usage Notes When the  Acumatica ERP web services receive a  Put  request that contains an entity with at least         one  Search  object,  Acumatica ERP tries to search for a record by using the specified search value or values, and does one         of the following: If the record that satisfies the specified conditions has been found,  Acumatica ERP updates the fields of the record that are specified by using the                Value  objects.  If no record has been found that satisfies the specified conditions, a new record is             inserted. Note that the values that were specified with the  Search              objects are inserted into the created record in the same way as the values specified             with the  Value  objects are inserted. If multiple records have been found,  Acumatica ERP returns an error. For the key fields of a record that are passed in the  Put  request as            Value  objects, the service converts the corresponding            Value  objects to  Search  objects.  When the  Acumatica ERP web services receive a  Put  request that contains only            Value ,  Return , and  Skip  objects         without key fields specified,  Acumatica ERP adds a new record with the specified values.

*The predefined elements on an Acumatica ERP form that are not included in the entity definition
*The elements that were added to the Acumatica ERP form in a customization project
*The user-defined fields
{br}

Through the <tt>CustomFields</tt> property, you work with an array of <tt>CustomField</tt> objects. This property is exposed by the <tt>Entity</tt> class—that is, all entities of the web services API expose this property. {br}

To get or set the value of an element that is not included in the entity definition, you should use the <tt>CustomFields</tt> property of the entity that contains this element. To work with the needed element in the <tt>CustomFields</tt> array, you specify the values of the <tt>fieldName</tt> and <tt>viewName</tt> properties of the <tt>CustomField</tt> object of the needed type. In the <tt>viewName</tt> property, you specify the name of the data view that contains the element, and in the <tt>fieldName</tt> property, you specify the internal name of the element. For details on how to find out the field name and the name of the data view, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_CB_Custom_Fields|Custom Fields]. {br}

For example, suppose that you added the '''Personal ID''' element to the '''Main Contact''' area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form in a customization project. To work with this customization element through the web services API, you should use the <tt>CustomFields</tt> property of the <tt>Contact</tt> entity, which is available through the <tt>MainContact</tt> property of the <tt>Customer</tt> entity. The '''Personal ID''' customization element has the {{String}} type and has the {{UsrPersonalID}} field name and belongs to the {{DefContact}} data view. Therefore, to access this element, you should set the <tt>fieldName</tt> property of the <tt>CustomStringField</tt> object to {{UsrPersonalID}}, and the <tt>viewName</tt> property of the <tt>CustomStringField</tt> object to {{DefContact}}.{br}{TOC}
==Syntax==<source lang="csharp">public CustomField[] CustomFields { set; get; }</source>
==Example==
Suppose that you added the '''Personal ID Type''', '''Personal ID''', and '''Credit Record Verified''' elements to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form in a customization project, as shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_d91ebd5b-d6e5-4da3-a3a0-31453a1ba72d][anchor|#_07ed0b2a-599e-410e-b363-ff14f7645a04][image:UserGuide/Images/CB_CustomFields.png|popup|Custom elements|450px]{br}

The following code shows how to specify the values of these custom elements through the web services API. <source lang="csharp">//Specify the values of a new customer record
Customer customerToBeCreated = new Customer
{
  CustomerID = new StringValue { Value = "TEDSMITH" },
  CustomerName = new StringValue { Value = "Ted Smith" },
  //Specify the values of the custom fields

        fieldName = "UsrPersonalIDType", 
        viewName = "DefContact", 
        Value = new StringValue { Value = "Passport" }

        viewName = "DefContact", 
        Value = new BooleanValue { Value = true }
      }
    }
  }
};

//Create a customer record with the specified values
Customer newCustomer = (Customer)soapClient.Put(customerToBeCreated);</source>
==Usage Notes==To work with elements of an object that was added in a customization project or with a custom Acumatica ERP form, you have to create a custom endpoint for the needed form. You can create a custom endpoint on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_70_60|Web Service Endpoints] ([~/?ScreenId=SM207060|SM207060]) form.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[CustomFields Property By using the  CustomFields  property, you can view and edit the values of         the elements that are not included in the entity definition. That is, custom fields can         correspond to the following elements: The predefined elements on an  Acumatica ERP form that are not included in the entity definition The elements that were added to the  Acumatica ERP form in a customization project The user-defined fields Through the  CustomFields  property, you work with an array of            CustomField  objects. This property is exposed by the            Entity  class—that is, all entities of the web services API expose         this property.  To get or set the value of an element that is not included in the entity definition, you         should use the  CustomFields  property of the entity that contains this         element. To work with the needed element in the  CustomFields  array, you         specify the values of the  fieldName  and  viewName          properties of the  CustomField  object of the needed type. In the            viewName  property, you specify the name of the data view that contains         the element, and in the  fieldName  property, you specify the internal name         of the element. For details on how to find out the field name and the name of the data view,         see  Custom Fields.  For example, suppose that you added the  Personal ID  element to the            Main Contact  area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000) form in a customization project. To work with this         customization element through the web services API, you should use the            CustomFields  property of the  Contact  entity, which         is available through the  MainContact  property of the            Customer  entity. The  Personal ID  customization         element has the  String  type and has the  UsrPersonalID          field name and belongs to the  DefContact  data view. Therefore, to access         this element, you should set the  fieldName  property of the            CustomStringField  object to  UsrPersonalID , and the            viewName  property of the  CustomStringField  object to            DefContact . Syntax public CustomField[] CustomFields { set; get; } Example Suppose that you added the  Personal ID Type ,  Personal           ID , and  Credit Record Verified  elements to the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers form in a customization project, as shown in the         following screenshot. Custom elements The following code shows how to specify the values of these custom elements through the web         services API.          //Specify the values of a new customer record
Customer customerToBeCreated = new Customer
{
  CustomerID = new StringValue { Value = "TEDSMITH" },
  CustomerName = new StringValue { Value = "Ted Smith" },
  //Specify the values of the custom fields

  MainContact = new Contact
  {
    CustomFields = new[]
    {
      new CustomStringField
      {
        fieldName = "UsrPersonalIDType", 
        viewName = "DefContact", 
        Value = new StringValue { Value = "Passport" }
      },
      new CustomStringField
      {
        fieldName = "UsrPersonalID", 
        viewName = "DefContact", 
        Value = new StringValue { Value = customerPersonalID }
      },
      new CustomBooleanField
      {
        fieldName = "UsrCreditRecordVerified", 
        viewName = "DefContact", 
        Value = new BooleanValue { Value = true }
      }
    }
  }
};

//Create a customer record with the specified values
Customer newCustomer = (Customer)soapClient.Put(customerToBeCreated); Usage Notes To work with elements of an object that was added in a       customization project or with a custom  Acumatica ERP form, you have to create a custom endpoint for the needed form. You can create a custom       endpoint on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM207060|SM207060]) Web Service Endpoints (SM207060) form. For details       on creation of a custom endpoint, see  To Create a Custom Endpoint and  To Extend an Existing Endpoint. ]]></column>

You use the <tt>Login()</tt> method to make the client application sign in to Acumatica ERP.{br}{TOC}
==Syntax==<source lang="csharp">public LoginResult Login(string name, string password)</source>
==Parameters==[anchor|#_465e64c7-dd80-4e25-a3ce-fec8361517bf]
*<tt>name</tt>: The username that the application should use to sign in to Acumatica ERP, such as {{"admin"}}. 
*:To sign in to a specific Acumatica ERP tenant, specify the <tt>name</tt> parameter as follows: {{UserName@TenantName}}, where you should specify the username instead of {{UserName}} and the tenant name instead of {{TenantName}}. For example, if you sign in to the tenant with the name ''Dollar'' as the user with the name ''admin'', you should specify the parameter as {{admin@Dollar}}. You can view the name that should be used for the tenant in the '''Login Name''' box of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_20|Tenants] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203520|SM203520]) form.
*:To sign in to a certain branch in the tenant, specify the parameter as follows: {{UserName@TenantName:BranchName}}, where you should specify the username instead of {{UserName}}, the tenant name instead of {{TenantName}}, and the branch ID instead of {{BranchName}}. You can view the ID of the branch in the '''Branch ID''' box of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_20_00|Branches] ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) form. For example, if you sign in to the ''East'' branch of the ''Dollar'' tenant as the user with the name ''admin'', you should specify the parameter as {{admin@Dollar:East}}. 
*<tt>password</tt>: The password for the username, such as {{"123"}}.

==Return Value==
The method returns the <tt>LoginResult</tt> object, which contains the description of errors that occurred during signing in, if any.
==Example==
The following code signs in to Acumatica ERP by using the parameters that are specified in the application settings.{{{{Screen context = new Screen();
context.CookieContainer = new System.Net.CookieContainer();
context.Url = "https://localhost/WebServiceAPITest/Soap/MYSTORE.asmx";
context.Login("admin@MyTenant:MYSTORE", "123");
}}}}
==Usage Notes==
Before you sign in to Acumatica ERP by using the <tt>Login()</tt> method, do the following:[anchor|#ol_jkk_hz3_ws]
#Initialize the <tt>CookieContainer</tt> property of the object with a new {{System.Net.CookieContainer()}}. The <tt>CookieContainer</tt> property is a standard property of an object of the {{HttpWebClientProtocol}} system type. (The <tt>Screen</tt> class is derived from the {{HttpWebClientProtocol}} class.) This property is used to maintain the session state for a client. 
#Specify the URL of the web service in the <tt>URL</tt> property of the object. This is the same URL that you specify when you add a web reference to the Acumatica ERP web service. You can change the URL of the service dynamically in your application if you need to switch between multiple Acumatica ERP web services.
{br}

For each call of the <tt>Login()</tt> method, you must call the <tt>Logout()</tt> method after you finish your work with Acumatica ERP to close the session. Therefore, when you are working with the web services API, we recommend that you use the pattern that is shown in the following code.<source lang="csharp">using 
(
  //Connect to the web services and log in to Acumatica ERP
  Screen context = new Screen();
  ...
)
{
  try
  {
    //Import, export, or submit data
    ...
  }
  finally
  {
    //Log out from Acumatica ERP
    context.Logout();
  }
}</source>{br}

You should take into account Acumatica ERP license API limits when using the <tt>Login()</tt> method. For details, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_License_Restrictions_API_Users|License Restrictions for API Users].]]></column>

==Parameters==
[anchor|#ul_qbr_q2r_xs]
*<tt>commands</tt>: In this parameter, you specify the UI elements of the Acumatica ERP form whose values you need to export. In the array of commands that you pass to the <tt>commands</tt> parameter, you can also use the <tt>EveryValue</tt> service command, which makes the system export all records of the specific type.
*<tt>filters</tt>: In this parameter, you specify any restrictions on the data to be exported. For example, you can configure the system to export only the records that have a particular status. 
*<tt>topCount</tt>: In this parameter, you can restrict the number of records to be exported. If this parameter is set to 0, the system exports all records that are specified by the <tt>commands</tt> and <tt>filters</tt> parameters of the <tt>Export()</tt> method.
*<tt>includeHeaders</tt>: In this parameter, you specify whether the result of the export should include column headers. If this parameter is set to {{true}}, the result of the export includes the names of exported elements in the first row of the exported data.
*<tt>breakOnError</tt>: In this parameter, you specify whether the system should stop the export if an error occurs during this process. If this parameter is set to {{true}}, the system stops exporting data when the first error occurs during the export.

==Return Value==
The result of the data export is a two-dimensional string array, which represents the exported data in a table format. Thus, if an exported record contains detail lines, the values of the detail lines are translated to multiple rows of this table. The number of rows is equal to the number of detail lines of the source record. The table rows that belong to one record have the same values of the elements of the summary area specified. {br}

For example, suppose that on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form, an invoice has three detail lines. If you export this invoice with detail lines, the data prepared for export will include three records for this invoice—one record for each detail line. These records will include identical values of the elements in the summary area of the invoice, such as the type and reference number, and different values of the detail line elements. ]]></column>

)))Through the contract-based REST and SOAP APIs, external systems can create pro forma invoices and send them by email. For details about pro forma invoices, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__con_Draft_Invoice_Workflow|Pro Forma Invoices].{br}

For a pro forma to be created from the project, the project must have <tt>Customer</tt>, <tt>BillingRule</tt>, <tt>BillingPeriod</tt>, and <tt>NextBillingDate</tt> specified, and must have the ''Active'' status. Because of data validation in the project, <tt>NextBillingDate</tt> cannot be specified for a project with the ''On Hold'' status, and you cannot change the customer in a project with the ''Active'' status. Therefore, these settings can be specified only in multiple API calls, as shown in the code examples below.{br}{TOC}
==User Scenario==
A project manager of the company through an external system needs to create a pro forma invoice in Acumatica ERP and send it to the client by email.
==Preliminary Steps==
A <tt>ProFormaInvoice</tt> entity cannot be created by using the {{PUT}} HTTP method; it can be created only through the invocation of the <tt>RunProjectBilling</tt> action of the <tt>Project</tt> entity. Because email settings are not mapped to any fields of the <tt>Project</tt> entity, you have to prepare a project template with the specified email settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_00|Project Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) form and then use this template for the creation of the project through the API. The project template can also contain preconfigured project tasks, as is the case with the template used in this example. For details about project templates, see [HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Templates_GeneralInfo|Project Templates and Common Tasks: General Info].
==Testing of the Examples==[anchor|#_bfac22b9-c087-4e93-97a9-cab88118cdc6]
To test the code below, you configure your client application and the Acumatica ERP instance to be used as follows:[anchor|#_a334905f-7a5a-4a57-a7de-f3bb11c9a76f]
*Deploy a new Acumatica ERP instance with the ''U100'' dataset. For details on deploying an instance, see [HelpRoot_Install\Installing_ERP_Instance|To Deploy an Acumatica ERP Instance] in the Installation Guide.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, make sure the ''Projects'' feature is enabled.
*To sign in to the instance in the client application, use the tenant name (which you specified when you created the instance) and the ''HEADOFFICE'' branch.

==Examples of REST API Requests==You can use the following sequence of examples of HTTP requests to create a pro forma invoice and send it by email through the contract-based REST API: [anchor|#_fa687174-3dc2-4415-a154-471a29a84f60]((({S:Warn}In the request examples below, {{<Acumatica ERP instance URL>}} is the URL of the Acumatica ERP instance (such as {{https://my.acumatica.com/MyInstance}}). You can omit the instance name in the URL (such as {{https://my.acumatica.com}}) if the instance is installed in the root of the website.

Through the contract-based REST and SOAP APIs, external systems can create,                 modify, and remove account groups.  The  AccountGroup  entity supports the creation, retrieval, update,                 and removal of the entity itself; however, you cannot modify the list of accounts of                 a particular account group by using the  AccountGroup  entity.                 Instead, you have to use the  AccountGroup  property in the                      Account  entity. You can use the                      DefaultAccountID  property of the                      AccountGroup  entity in order to specify the default account                 for the group.  The removal of the default account from the group does not                     cause the  DefaultAccountID  property to be updated                     automatically. If you remove the default account from the group, you have to                     update the  DefaultAccountID  property. User Scenario Through an external system, a project manager of a company needs to add and modify                 account groups in  Acumatica ERP to set up  Acumatica ERP for project accounting.

)))Through the contract-based REST and SOAP APIs, external systems can run project billing for one project as well as for multiple projects. This example shows how to run project billing for multiple projects in Acumatica ERP from an external system.

)))Through the contract-based REST and SOAP APIs, external systems can import to Acumatica ERP general ledger transactions with project codes that do not produce project transactions. {br}

To create a general ledger transaction with a project code that does not produce a project transaction, you set the <tt>IsNonPM</tt> field of the <tt>JournalTransaction</tt> entity to {{true}}. {br}{TOC}
==User Scenario==
A construction company builds an integrated solution of Acumatica ERP with an external payroll system. The external payroll system calculates payoffs, including benefits, additions, deductions, and taxes. Once a week, the construction company needs to import general ledger transactions with project information from this payroll system to Acumatica ERP, where they are verified and released. The construction company doesn&rsquo;t want to update the project subledger in Acumatica ERP with the information from general ledger transactions (for example, if the standard labor costs have already been posted to the project subledger from time entries).
==Testing of the Examples==[anchor|#_8b469800-4bec-4f13-b732-dd2cf6c729a4]
To test the code below, you configure your client application and the Acumatica ERP instance to be used as follows:[anchor|#_7e2bd698-4c0d-42c2-8bce-b3d191e5e75b]
*Deploy a new Acumatica ERP instance with the ''U100'' dataset. For details on deploying an instance, see [HelpRoot_Install\Installing_ERP_Instance|To Deploy an Acumatica ERP Instance] in the Installation Guide.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, make sure the ''Projects'' feature is enabled.
*To sign in to the instance in the client application, use the tenant name (which you specified when you created the instance) and the ''HEADOFFICE'' branch.

==Examples of REST API Requests==
You can use the following request example to create a general ledger transaction through the contract-based REST API.[anchor|#_7aeb6dbc-e814-476f-974c-383adda926ff]((({S:Warn}In the request example below, {{<Acumatica ERP instance URL>}} is the URL of the Acumatica ERP instance (such as ''https://my.acumatica.com/MyInstance'').

Through the contract-based REST and SOAP APIs, external systems can create cases in                      Acumatica ERP and link them to another case defined in  Acumatica ERP. For details about the relations between cases, see  Case Processing. To create a case and establish its relation with another case, you need to specify                 the case ID of the related case by using the  CaseID  field of the                      RelatedCases  detail entity of the  Case                      entity. The  ParentCaseID  field of the                          RelatedCases  detail entity of the  Case                      entity is never returned by the system and cannot be used for assignment of                     values.

)))A point-of-sale (POS) system can create and process direct sales invoices—that is, invoices for which neither a sales order nor a shipment has been created. The POS system creates a direct sales invoice and a payment, applies this payment to the invoice, and releases the invoice.
==User Scenario==
A customer comes to the store, picks up a number of items (including a motherboard, which is a serialized item), and receives a consulting service from a store consultant. The customer would like to buy the items and pay for the service. In the POS system, one invoice is created for this operation.
==Code Example==
You can use the code below to create a payment and a sales invoice, which includes lines for serialized stock items, not-serialized stock items, and non-stock items. [anchor|#_b17b1adb-51a5-4f97-812f-ffb4efa862e0]{br}

To test this code example, configure your client application and an Acumatica ERP instance as follows:[anchor|#_87ccb565-094e-493d-a471-003bdbfcce17]
*Deploy a new Acumatica ERP instance with the ''SalesDemo'' dataset inserted. For details on deploying an instance, see [HelpRoot_Install\Installing_ERP_Instance|To Deploy an Acumatica ERP Instance] in the Installation Guide.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, enable the ''Advanced SO Invoices'' feature.
*In the client application, add a service reference to the ''POS/17.200.01'' endpoint, which is an extension of the ''Default/17.200.001'' endpoint. For details on how to add a service reference, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__how_CB_Configure_Application|To Configure the Client Application] in this guide.
*To sign in to the instance in the client application, use the company name (which you specified when you created the instance) and the ''HQ'' branch.

)))
==User Scenario==A customer comes to the store and picks up a motherboard (which is a serialized item) and a patch cord from store shelves. The customer would like to buy these items and to return the previously purchased computer mouse. In a POS system, one invoice is created for the whole operation. The customer pays the difference between the sale and the return.
==Code Example==
You can use the code below to create a sales invoice that includes lines for serialized stock items, not-serialized stock items, and return lines for previously sold items. [anchor|#_ed4179bb-94de-44a6-a9fd-bfc4d46e12fb]{br}

To test this code example, configure your client application and an Acumatica ERP instance as follows:[anchor|#_3b24c398-1572-4cd6-bb98-0d8470eadd34]
*Deploy a new Acumatica ERP instance with the ''SalesDemo'' dataset inserted. For details on deploying an instance, see [HelpRoot_Install\Installing_ERP_Instance|To Deploy an Acumatica ERP Instance] in the Installation Guide.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, enable the ''Advanced SO Invoices'' feature.
*In the client application, add a service reference to the ''POS/17.200.01'' endpoint, which is an extension of the ''Default/17.200.001'' endpoint. For details on how to add a service reference, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__how_CB_Configure_Application|To Configure the Client Application] in this guide.
*To sign in to the instance in the client application, use the company name (which you specified when you created the instance) and the ''HQ'' branch.

)))A point-of-sale (POS) system can create and process credit memos with positive lines (for the returned items) and negative lines (for the purchased items). (A credit memo is created instead of a direct sales invoice if the payment amount of the returned items is greater than the payment amount of the newly purchased items.) The POS system creates a credit memo, links the invoice that contains the returned lines to the credit memo, and releases the credit memo. 
==User Scenario==
A customer comes to the store and picks up a motherboard (which is a serialized item) and a patch cord from the store shelves. The customer would like to buy these items and to return the previously purchased notebook computer. The price of the returned item is greater than the price of the purchased items. In a POS system, one invoice is created for the whole operation. The customer is given the difference between the return and the sale.
==Code Example==
You can use the code below to create a credit memo with positive and negative lines.[anchor|#_83c96f5b-49e2-4d42-bab4-3be3a1b442e3]{br}

To test this code example, configure your client application and an Acumatica ERP instance as follows:[anchor|#_62c63055-09f1-4392-a219-318c61947697]
*Deploy a new Acumatica ERP instance with the ''SalesDemo'' dataset inserted. For details on deploying an instance, see [HelpRoot_Install\Installing_ERP_Instance|To Deploy an Acumatica ERP Instance] in the Installation Guide.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, enable the ''Advanced SO Invoices'' feature.
*In the client application, add a service reference to the ''POS/17.200.01'' endpoint, which is an extension of the ''Default/17.200.001'' endpoint. For details on how to add a service reference, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__how_CB_Configure_Application|To Configure the Client Application] in this guide.
*To sign in to the instance in the client application, use the company name (which you specified when you created the instance) and the ''HQ'' branch.
((({S:Warn}You can use the data of the invoice created in [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_Return_of_Direct_Sales_Along_with_Sale|Entry of a Direct Sales Invoice Along with a Return] for the returned lines for previously sold items.

)))
==User Scenario==
A customer comes to the Canadian store and picks up a patch cord from store shelves. The customer would like to buy the item, return the previously purchased computer mouse, and pay for the service in United States dollars. In a POS system, one invoice is created for this operation. The customer pays the difference between the sale and return.
==Code Example==
You can use the code below to create a sales invoice for a direct sale in a currency that is different from the customer&rsquo;s default currency.[anchor|#_6d844ba3-1f94-4d8d-9bc2-06f764f592d3]{br}

To test this code example, configure your client application and an Acumatica ERP instance as follows:[anchor|#_66419e12-894e-4566-bcdd-8e5bd1a5a6d9]
*Deploy a new Acumatica ERP instance with the ''SalesDemo'' dataset inserted. For details on deploying an instance, see [HelpRoot_Install\Installing_ERP_Instance|To Deploy an Acumatica ERP Instance] in the Installation Guide.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, enable the ''Advanced SO Invoices'' feature.
*In the client application, add a service reference to the ''POS/17.200.01'' endpoint, which is an extension of the ''Default/17.200.001'' endpoint. For details on how to add a service reference, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__how_CB_Configure_Application|To Configure the Client Application] in this guide.
*To sign in to the instance in the client application, use the company name (which you specified when you created the instance) and the ''HQ'' branch.

Either type of line can include information about newly bought items or returned items. {br}

To process these invoices, the POS system performs the following steps:[anchor|#_0323653c-3320-4bda-856c-41abdde0e167]
#For the returned items that are linked to a sales order and shipment, creates a new sales order of ''RM'' type (a generic authorized return).

You can find an example showing how to create and apply a payment in [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_Entering_Direct_Sales_Invoice|Entry of a Direct Sales Invoice].
)))
==User Scenario==
In the online shop, a customer buys a computer mouse, but then the customer decides to return the mouse. In the online shop, the customer creates an order that includes both the returned item and a motherboard, then the customer decides to get the motherboard and to return the mouse in the store. The customer comes to the store and picks up a patch cord from the store shelves. Thus, the customer would like to buy the patch cord, to return the mouse, and to pay for the previously ordered motherboard. In a POS system, one invoice is created for the whole operation. 
==Code Example==
You can use the code below to create a direct sales invoice that combines a shipped order and a return.[anchor|#_469a3446-471d-4f66-9d85-bcfdbd9af3f8]{br}

To test this code example, configure your client application and an Acumatica ERP instance as follows:[anchor|#_9ed3f6d5-fd6a-4715-8529-6ed4533ff949]
*Deploy a new Acumatica ERP instance with the ''SalesDemo'' dataset inserted. For details on deploying an instance, see [HelpRoot_Install\Installing_ERP_Instance|To Deploy an Acumatica ERP Instance] in the Installation Guide.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, enable the ''Advanced SO Invoices'' feature.
*In the client application, add a service reference to the ''POS/17.200.01'' endpoint, which is an extension of the ''Default/17.200.001'' endpoint. For details on how to add a service reference, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__how_CB_Configure_Application|To Configure the Client Application] in this guide.
*To sign in to the instance in the client application, use the company name (which you specified when you created the instance) and the ''HQ'' branch.
((({S:Warn}You can insert in the code the data of the direct sales invoice created in [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_Entering_Direct_Sales_in_Non-Customer_Currency|Entry of a Direct Sales Invoice in a Non-Default Currency] for the return lines for previously sold items.

[anchor|#_eb1bcba7-3f4d-4efd-a342-0a5ac1b656bd]((({S:Warn}This example has been tested for Acumatica ERP 2018 R1 and may require code modifications for other versions of Acumatica ERP.
)))A point-of-sale (POS) system can create and process sales invoices that contain both lines that have not been linked to any sales order or shipment and lines for which a sales order has been created and a shipment has not been created. Either type of line can include information about newly bought items or returned items. {br}

To process these invoices, the POS system performs the following steps:[anchor|#_6047c0fb-c53a-4a33-8fd8-674971443467]
#Creates a new sales order of the ''RM'' type (a generic authorized return) with the new items and returned items. 
#Creates a payment.
#Creates a Sales Orders (SO) invoice and adds detail lines for both the items from the sales order and the new items.
#Applies the payment to the invoice.
#Releases the invoice. As a result of this operation, the sales order gets the ''Completed'' status in Acumatica ERP. The SO invoice is added to the '''Shipments''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form and is treated by the system as a shipment (that is, the invoice updates shipped quantity in the sales order lines and updates inventory).
#:((({S:Warn}The sales order can be not completed if it was closed by the SO invoice partially (that is, if some lines of the sales order are not shipped or invoiced). 
)))

==User Scenario==
A customer comes to the store and through a self-service terminal creates a sales order to buy a computer and to return a computer mouse that the customer previously purchased in the store. Then the customer picks up a patch cord from the store shelves. The customer would like to buy the computer (specified in the created sales order) and the patch cord and to return the mouse (specified in the sales order). In a POS system, one invoice is created for the whole operation. 
==Code Example==
You can use the code below to create a direct sales invoice and include in it the items that were previously ordered but not shipped.[anchor|#_2263cbcc-3074-473b-9e65-366de1c64646]{br}

To test this code example, configure your client application and an Acumatica ERP instance as follows:[anchor|#_ae71be32-e3a8-46b8-92af-ad46a88a36b5]
*Deploy a new Acumatica ERP instance with the ''SalesDemo'' dataset inserted. For details on deploying an instance, see [HelpRoot_Install\Installing_ERP_Instance|To Deploy an Acumatica ERP Instance] in the Installation Guide.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, enable the ''Advanced SO Invoices'' feature.
*In the client application, add a service reference to the ''POS/17.200.01'' endpoint, which is an extension of the ''Default/17.200.001'' endpoint. For details on how to add a service reference, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__how_CB_Configure_Application|To Configure the Client Application] in this guide.
*To sign in to the instance in the client application, use the company name (which you specified when you created the instance) and the ''HQ'' branch.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Entry of a Direct Sales Invoice for an Unshipped Sales Order This example has been tested for  Acumatica ERP             2018 R1 and may require code modifications for other versions of  Acumatica ERP. A point-of-sale (POS) system can create and process sales invoices that contain                 both lines that have not been linked to any sales order or shipment and lines for                 which a sales order has been created and a shipment has not been created. Either                 type of line can include information about newly bought items or returned items.  To process these invoices, the POS system performs the following steps: Creates a new sales order of the  RM  type (a generic authorized                         return) with the new items and returned items.  Creates a payment. Creates a Sales Orders (SO) invoice and adds detail lines for both the items                         from the sales order and the new items. Applies the payment to the invoice. Releases the invoice. As a result of this operation, the sales order gets                         the  Completed  status in  Acumatica ERP. The SO invoice is added to the  Shipments  tab of                         the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders                         (SO301000) form and is treated by the system as a shipment (that is, the                         invoice updates shipped quantity in the sales order lines and updates                             inventory). The sales order can be not completed if it was closed                             by the SO invoice partially (that is, if some lines of the sales order                             are not shipped or invoiced).  User Scenario A customer comes to the store and through a self-service terminal creates a sales order to buy                 a computer and to return a computer mouse that the customer previously purchased in                 the store. Then the customer picks up a patch cord from the store shelves. The                 customer would like to buy the computer (specified in the created sales order) and                 the patch cord and to return the mouse (specified in the sales order). In a POS                 system, one invoice is created for the whole operation.  Code Example You can use the code below to create a direct sales invoice and include in it the items that                 were previously ordered but not shipped. To test this code example, configure your client             application and an  Acumatica ERP             instance as follows: Deploy a new  Acumatica ERP instance with the  SalesDemo  dataset inserted. For details on deploying                     an instance, see  To Deploy an Acumatica ERP Instance in the Installation Guide. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features                     (CS100000) form, enable the  Advanced SO Invoices  feature. In the client application, add a service reference to the  POS/17.200.01                      endpoint, which is an extension of the  Default/17.200.001  endpoint. For                     details on how to add a service reference, see  To Configure the Client Application in this                     guide. To sign in to the instance in the client application, use the company name                     (which you specified when you created the instance) and the  HQ                      branch. using System;

[anchor|#_19351b13-b947-47ee-860e-05511cead0fd]((({S:Warn}This example has been tested for Acumatica ERP 2018 R1 and may require code modifications for other versions of Acumatica ERP.
)))A point-of-sale (POS) system can create and process a sales invoice that contains both of the following: lines that have not been linked to any sales order or shipment, and lines for which a sales order has been created and a shipment has been created (but the shipment does not include all items of the sales order). {br}

To process an invoice of this type, the POS system performs the following steps:[anchor|#_0cf0752a-942e-44ca-8998-e8a60e885b4d]
#Creates a new sales order of the ''SO'' type with multiple items. 
#Creates a payment.
#Creates a Sales Orders invoice and adds detail lines for some (but not all) items from the sales order and the new items.
#Applies the payment to the invoice.
#Releases the invoice. At this moment, not all lines of the sales order are shipped. The sales order has the ''Open'' status in Acumatica ERP. On the '''Shipments''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, for the sales order lines added to the invoice, a dummy shipment is created with the link to the invoice. 
#Creates the second payment.
#Applies the second payment to the sales order.
#Creates a shipment or multiple shipments for the remaining (not shipped) lines of the sales order and confirms each shipment.
#Creates a Sales Orders invoice for each shipment and releases each invoice. As a result of the release of the invoice or invoices the sales order gets the ''Completed'' status in Acumatica ERP.
#:((({S:Warn}The sales order can be not completed if it was closed by the SO invoice partially (that is, if some lines of the sales order are not shipped or invoiced). 
)))

==User Scenario==A customer comes to the store and through a self-service terminal creates a sales order to buy a computer and a computer mouse. Then the customer picks up a patch cord from the store shelves. The customer would like to buy the mouse (from the sales order) and the grabbed patch cord, and to have the computer shipped to the customer&rsquo;s home. In a POS system, one invoice is created for the purchase in the store and another invoice is created for the computer to be shipped. 
==Code Example==
You can use the code below to create a direct sales invoice and include in it the previously ordered items that aren&rsquo;t yet shipped, and to configure the shipment and the invoice for the shipment.[anchor|#_ead1d951-ca79-49e9-bc5b-8f9c7540a8f7]{br}

To test this code example, configure your client application and an Acumatica ERP instance as follows:[anchor|#_ac4ed42b-9e0e-49ad-b023-46ea049faab7]
*Deploy a new Acumatica ERP instance with the ''SalesDemo'' dataset inserted. For details on deploying an instance, see [HelpRoot_Install\Installing_ERP_Instance|To Deploy an Acumatica ERP Instance] in the Installation Guide.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, enable the ''Advanced SO Invoices'' feature.
*In the client application, add a service reference to the ''POS/17.200.01'' endpoint, which is an extension of the ''Default/17.200.001'' endpoint. For details on how to add a service reference, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__how_CB_Configure_Application|To Configure the Client Application] in this guide.
*To sign in to the instance in the client application, use the company name (which you specified when you created the instance) and the ''HQ'' branch.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Entry of a Direct Sales Invoice for a Partially Shipped Sales Order This example has been tested for  Acumatica ERP             2018 R1 and may require code modifications for other versions of  Acumatica ERP. A point-of-sale (POS) system can create and process a sales invoice that contains                 both of the following: lines that have not been linked to any sales order or                 shipment, and lines for which a sales order has been created and a shipment has been                 created (but the shipment does not include all items of the sales order).  To process an invoice of this type, the POS system performs the following steps: Creates a new sales order of the  SO  type with multiple items.  Creates a payment. Creates a Sales Orders invoice and adds detail lines for some (but not all)                         items from the sales order and the new items. Applies the payment to the invoice. Releases the invoice. At this moment, not all lines of the sales order are                         shipped. The sales order has the  Open  status in  Acumatica ERP. On the  Shipments  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders                         (SO301000) form, for the sales order lines added to the invoice, a dummy                         shipment is created with the link to the invoice.  Creates the second payment. Applies the second payment to the sales order. Creates a shipment or multiple shipments for the remaining (not shipped)                         lines of the sales order and confirms each shipment. Creates a Sales Orders invoice for each shipment and releases each invoice.                         As a result of the release of the invoice or invoices the sales order gets                         the  Completed  status in  Acumatica ERP. The sales order can be not completed if it was closed by the SO                             invoice partially (that is, if some lines of the sales order are not                             shipped or invoiced).  User Scenario A customer comes to the store and through a self-service             terminal creates a sales order to buy a computer and a computer mouse. Then the customer             picks up a patch cord from the store shelves. The customer would like to buy the mouse             (from the sales order) and the grabbed patch cord, and to have the computer shipped to             the customer's home. In a POS system, one invoice is created for the purchase in the             store and another invoice is created for the computer to be shipped.  Code Example You can use the code below to create a direct sales invoice and include in it the previously                 ordered items that aren't yet shipped, and to configure the shipment and the invoice                 for the shipment. To test this code example, configure your client             application and an  Acumatica ERP             instance as follows: Deploy a new  Acumatica ERP instance with the  SalesDemo  dataset inserted. For details on deploying                     an instance, see  To Deploy an Acumatica ERP Instance in the Installation Guide. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features                     (CS100000) form, enable the  Advanced SO Invoices  feature. In the client application, add a service reference to the  POS/17.200.01                      endpoint, which is an extension of the  Default/17.200.001  endpoint. For                     details on how to add a service reference, see  To Configure the Client Application in this                     guide. To sign in to the instance in the client application, use the company name                     (which you specified when you created the instance) and the  HQ                      branch. using System;

[anchor|#_3f304787-601e-4576-88c0-895511d74466]((({S:Warn}This example has been tested for Acumatica ERP 2018 R1 and may require code modifications for other versions of Acumatica ERP.
)))A point-of-sale (POS) system can create and process credit memos that contain both lines that have been linked to a sales order of the ''RM'' type (a generic authorized return) and lines that have not been linked to any sales order. The POS system creates a sales order of the ''RM'' type, creates a credit memo, adds to the credit memo the lines from the sales order and other lines, and releases the credit memo. 
==User Scenario==
In the online shop, a customer creates a sales order to buy a computer mouse and to return a computer that the customer previously bought in the store; the customer then decides to perform these operations in the store. After that, the customer decides to also return the patch cord (also bought in the store) and goes to the store. In the POS system, one invoice is created for the whole operation. The customer is given the difference between the return and sale.
==Code Example==
You can use the code below to create a credit memo with some lines linked to a sales order and other lines not linked to any sales order.[anchor|#_6895445b-976e-47b2-b392-2f4d392e84c5]{br}

To test this code example, configure your client application and an Acumatica ERP instance as follows:[anchor|#_36787c8c-ddbd-41bc-87c6-513a10f67c0c]
*Deploy a new Acumatica ERP instance with the ''SalesDemo'' dataset inserted. For details on deploying an instance, see [HelpRoot_Install\Installing_ERP_Instance|To Deploy an Acumatica ERP Instance] in the Installation Guide.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, enable the ''Advanced SO Invoices'' feature.
*In the client application, add a service reference to the ''POS/17.200.01'' endpoint, which is an extension of the ''Default/17.200.001'' endpoint. For details on how to add a service reference, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__how_CB_Configure_Application|To Configure the Client Application] in this guide.
*To sign in to the instance in the client application, use the company name (which you specified when you created the instance) and the ''HQ'' branch.
