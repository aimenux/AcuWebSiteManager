In Acumatica ERP, you do not need to change your business processes to fit the customer relationship management (CRM) solution. Instead, you can easily customize the solution to fit your company&rsquo;s changing needs and business environment. The Customer Management module helps your company more effectively handle the following areas: 
*Collaboration of teams working with leads during different stages of their conversion to customers
*Management of marketing campaigns, which you use to reach customers and prospective customers in measurable ways
*Customer service, with cases (customer requests, problems, or inquiries) created and assigned automatically
{br}{TOC}
==Flexible Classification of Records==
In Acumatica ERP, you can easily categorize leads, contact, opportunities, business accounts, marketing campaigns, and cases into different classes and gather different sets of additional information about items of different classes. For each class, you can create a set of attributes. For each attribute, you can define its type (check box, text box, or combo box) and specify the possible values, if applicable. When a user selects a class for the new lead or case, the attributes assigned to this class appear on the data entry form as additional elements that can be used for data entry. For details, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CR__con_Classification_of_Business_Accounts|Classes and Attributes in CRM].
==Automatic Assignment of Records==
Your company can set up automatic distribution of leads, contacts, business accounts, opportunities, and cases among employees by using configurable assignment rules based on particular properties of the records, including the values of attributes. For details, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CR__con_Assignment_Rules_for_Cases_and_Leads|Configuring Assignment Rules]
==Opportunity Estimation==
The accuracy of your sales revenue estimation depends on how correctly salespeople identify opportunity stages and what the probability is of closing the sale at each stage. To reliably evaluate the opportunities that are currently available, you can adjust probabilities for stages based on your organization&rsquo;s statistics. Total sales are estimated as the sum of the opportunity amounts (each of which is weighted by the probability). For details, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CR__MNG_Opportunities|Managing Opportunities].
==Campaign Management==
 Acumatica ERP provides tools that you can use to effectively plan and manage marketing campaigns, so that you can reach your prospects and customers as needed. Acumatica ERP gives you the ability to maintain marketing lists and send bulk email. With the out-of-the-box feature of incoming mail processing, the system tracks and keeps a complete history of communication for an in-depth analysis of campaigns. For details, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CR__MNG_Lists_and_Campaigns|Managing Marketing Lists and Campaigns]. 
==Service and Support Automation==
With Acumatica ERP, customer service and support can be configured to fit your company&rsquo;s precise specifications. For instance, whether you customer service is oriented toward successful sales or post-sales interactions (or both approaches), you can configure Acumatica ERP accordingly.{br}

In Acumatica ERP, cases can be created in two ways: automatically, when the system processes the incoming mail; and manually, when users enter service requests received from customers as cases. You can set up notifications to be sent to the responsible parties when new cases are created. New cases should be assigned, either automatically or manually, to the users who will process and resolve them. You can create tasks, events, and activities to resolve cases, and you can establish case severity levels and priorities that dictate the workflow. Integration with financial modules ensures that cases are billed properly, and that invoices are generated and sent to customers. For more information, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CR__MNG_Cases|Managing Cases].
==Activity Tracking ==
In Acumatica ERP, you can register all the activities, tasks, and emails related to your work. You can manage the set of activity types you want to use by editing or deleting existing types and defining new ones. You can configure a dashboard as a virtual &ldquo;to-do&ldquo; list that will display the tasks and events that you create when working with leads or processing cases. Also, the lists of tasks and events are available from any form; the links to them are located in the Info area of the main toolbar. To help you work effectively, for each lead, opportunity, or case, the system displays the date of the last activity. For details, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CR__con_Managing_Your_Tasks__Events__and_Activities|Managing Tasks, Events, and Activities].
==Availability of Information==
By knowing customer information and history, your company&rsquo;s employees can communicate more effectively. On most data entry forms, all related information—for instance, previous invoices with their amounts, all items purchased, and other details—is available on the '''Relations''' tab.
==Redesigned Forms and Smart Guessing==
To facilitate data entry, the system fills in default values for as many form elements as possible. You can work more efficiently, thanks to redesigned forms with more frequently used elements on top of the form and with most used tabs moved to the left.
==Other Features and Options==
By using the facilities of the Customer Management functional area, you can also do the following: 
*Create templates for each type of email you might use for communicating with leads, contacts, campaign members, marketing list subscribers, or other employees. Templates may contain some fixed text and placeholders—special links to record values, which you use to personalize the emails.
*Create and maintain your own library of marketing materials and product information that can be stored in wikis and templates and used for mass mailings.
*Adjust opportunity stages and probabilities according to the statistics gathered in your company.
*Share your calendar, showing free and busy days (with activities specified), with other employees and with leads or contacts. 
*Use real-time data on dashboards to efficiently close more sales.
*Process lead, contact, and customer records in bulk, including updating records and finding and merging duplicates.

*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_25_00|Campaign Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR202500|CR202500])

==Use of Attributes==
For each class, you can define a list of attributes to gather class-specific information about the records that belong to that class.{br}

The [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_00|Cases] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306000|CR306000]), and [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_20_00|Marketing Campaigns] ([~/?ScreenId=CR202000|CR202000]) forms have tabs reserved for attributes. If you select a class when creating a new record, the attributes of that class appear on the respective tab of the entry form.((({S:Hint}To keep classification meaningful, you should always enter proper values for attributes, both for those marked as required and for optional ones.
)))
If you specify values for the attributes of a business account and then convert the business account to a customer or vendor account, the resulting account retains these attributes. If the customer or vendor class to which the resulting account belongs also has attributes specified, these attributes are added to the list of attributes of the resulting account.{br}

You can use attributes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_50_15|Approval Maps] ([~/?ScreenId=EP205015|EP205015]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_50_10|Assignment Maps] ([~/?ScreenId=EP205010|EP205010]) forms to specify the criteria for assigning records to the appropriate owners.{br}

For more information about the use of attributes in Acumatica ERP, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Attributes|Attributes].
==Example of Lead Classes and Attributes==
Consider an example that uses classes and attributes for leads. ((({S:Hint}Attributes and classes are used similarly for leads, contacts, opportunities, business accounts, cases, and marketing campaigns.
)))
Imagine that you sell two products, one for resale by retailers and the other for direct corporate use. You handle many leads and would like to divide them into groups based on whether they are related to a retail store or to a corporation. You can create two classes for these leads: [anchor|#_2e586e63-b4a3-4346-8f0c-80098ecb69e4]
*One class, called ''Retail'', for leads associated with retail stores of various sizes: This class might contain an attribute called '''Size''' with the values ''Small'', ''Midsize'', and ''Big'' corresponding to the store size, as well as other attributes to give you additional information about these stores.
*Another class, called ''Corporate'', for leads associated with organizations that are final consumers: Because some organizations may be tax-exempt, you might define an attribute called '''Tax Status''' with two possible values, ''Tax-exempt'' and ''Taxable''. Another attribute, '''Company Type''', might have such values as ''Corporation'', ''Hospital'', ''University'', and ''School''.

When you enter a new lead on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form, you should select a lead class on the '''CRM Info''' tab. Once the class is selected, its attributes appear on the '''Attributes''' tab. After that you can enter specific attribute values for the lead.

 Acumatica ERP gives you the ability to distribute the workload among employees. You can use assignment maps to assign records, such as leads or cases, to the appropriate users. This topic describes the general rules that you can follow when creating assignment maps.{br}

In Acumatica ERP, it&rsquo;s easy to base assignment rules on company policies because records can be distributed among workgroups or individual employees in an almost unlimited number of ways, based on the properties and attributes of the records being distributed. For example, leads can be distributed by location: leads with postal codes starting with ''94'' can go to Workgroup 1, leads with postal codes starting with ''95'' can go to Workgroup 2, and so on. As another example, distribution of cases based on geographical territories can be determined by phone area codes. Records can also be distributed alphabetically or by another condition, or they can be distributed by multiple criteria, based on the values of properties and attributes of the record. {br}

You create the maps for automatic assignment of records by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_50_10|Assignment Maps] ([~/?ScreenId=EP205010|EP205010]) form. If you want to use workgroups in an assignment map, before you start creating the map, make sure that all workgroups involved in the processing of the records are represented on the company tree. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_40_61|Company Tree] ([~/?ScreenId=EP204061|EP204061]) form, add the required workgroups and specify their members and default owners. For more information on the company tree, see [HelpRoot_Organization\EP__con_Company_Organizational_Chart|Company Tree and Workgroups]. {br}{TOC}
==Assignment Rules==
An assignment map may include any number of rules, which are executed sequentially. A rule in an assignment map includes conditions and actions to be performed if the conditions are met.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_50_10|Assignment Maps] form, in the '''Rules''' pane, you create a list of rules. For each rule, you specify conditions for executing the rule. If a condition or rule is no longer required in an assignment map, you can temporarily deactivate it by clearing the '''Active''' check box in the settings of that condition or rule on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_50_10|Assignment Maps] form. A deactivated rule is marked with the '''(Inactive)''' prefix in the '''Rules''' pane.
==Assignment Conditions==
To use record properties and attributes in assignment conditions in the '''Conditions''' pane on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_50_10|Assignment Maps] form, you select the appropriate entities (types of records) first.{br}

Conditions, which are specified for each rule, are based on the values of the properties and attributes of the records. The properties are specified on the data entry form used to create the record. For the classes that are used to group the records, particular attributes can be configured; users can specify the attribute values for the individual records (such as leads) on the data entry form used to create the records.{br}

If your company&rsquo;s policies require that all records of a particular type (such as cases) should be distributed, then before you start creating an assignment map, you should draw a diagram for your conditions to ensure that they are complete. Consider the previous example of assignment rules based on the first two digits of the postal code: If you expect most leads to have postal codes starting with ''94'' and ''95'', do not forget to add a rule for distributing leads whose postal codes start with numbers other than ''94'' or ''95''. {br}

Rules should divide records of a particular type into non-intersecting sets. If rules allowed the same records to be assigned to two or more groups, all assignments would be performed in the workgroup or individual employee that is mentioned higher in the list of rules, and the records would never reach the second workgroup or employee. 
==Rule Application==
Once the assignment maps are created, you can select the default maps for cases, leads, contacts, business accounts, and opportunities by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_10_10_00|Customer Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CR101000|CR101000]) form. These maps are used during the mass assignment processes that you can perform through the following forms:[anchor|#ul_jqc_hgw_q3]
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_50_30_10|Assign Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR503010|CR503010])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_50_30_11|Assign Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR503011|CR503011])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_50_33_10|Assign Business Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR503310|CR503310])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_50_31_10|Assign Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR503110|CR503110])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_50_32_10|Assign Cases] ([~/?ScreenId=CR503210|CR503210])

Once a record is assigned to a workgroup, the default owner of the group is assigned as the owner of the item. If no owner is specified for the group, the record is considered to be assigned to the workgroup. Members of the same workgroup can view records assigned to the group or to an employee from the group.{br}

 You can change the owner of the record manually by using the entry form for that record.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
A lead is a potential customer, a person or a company, that expresses an interest in the products the organization offers. Assigned employees contact and process leads. Acumatica ERP provides flexible tools that can be used by sales teams for effective lead management; these tools can be adjusted to any lead qualification procedure that is used in your organization.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
From reading the topics in this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Create new leads
*Qualify a lead
*Convert a lead to an opportunity

==Applicable Scenarios==
A lead is created in Acumatica ERP and then reviewed, rated, and qualified by a marketing manager or automatically. After that, a sales manager may accept the lead as a sales opportunity, return the lead to the marketing team for nurturing, or disqualify it and exclude it from further marketing and sales activities.
==Ways of Creating Leads in Acumatica ERP==
In Acumatica ERP, you can register leads in any of the following ways:[anchor|#_198b3605-08f7-4d82-965b-08a3fa711784]
*By manually entering a lead on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form. For step-by-step instructions on registering a lead manually, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CR__HOW_To_Create_a_Lead|To Create a Lead].
*By creating a lead from Acumatica add-in for Outlook based on the details of the selected email recipient or sender. For detailed instructions, see [HelpRoot_Integration\OU__how_To_Create_Lead|To Create a Lead by Using the Acumatica Add-In].
*By using import scenarios to import lists of leads on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_36|Import by Scenario] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206036|SM206036]) form. For instructions on how to import such a list by using a previously configured import scenario, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CR__HOW_To_Import_Leads|To Import Leads by Using an Import Scenario].
*By enabling integration with web services on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_70_40|Web Services] ([~/?ScreenId=SM207040|SM207040]) form for automatic import of leads
*By activating the functionality of incoming mail processing on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_02|System Email Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=SM204002|SM204002]) form for automatic creation of leads based on sender information

==Contact Information==
On the '''Contact Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form, you can specify the name, contact information, and address of the lead. Also, this tab holds information about the lead's consent to the processing of personal data if the ''GDPR Compliance Tools'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. (For details about GDPR compliance tools, see [HelpRoot_Administration\GD__MNG_Handling_Personal_Data|Handling Personal Data].){br}

If the '''Override''' check box on the '''Contact Info''' tab is cleared, the contact information of the lead is synchronized with the contact information of the related contact, business account, and opportunity on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]), and [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) forms. If the check box is selected, the contact information for the selected lead on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] form can differ from the contact information of the related record on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts], [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts], and [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] forms, as well as from the contact information of the leads related to this lead. The synchronization or overriding of settings applies to all the settings on the '''Contact Info''' tab.
==Related Entities==
In Acumatica ERP, multiple leads may be linked to one business account or contact. On the '''Leads''' tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) and the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) forms, you can see all the leads linked to a business account or contact, respectively.{br}

A lead that is being nurtured by a marketing team may receive marketing newsletters and other mailings. By using the '''Marketing Lists''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form, you can see all marketing lists the lead is subscribed on. For more information about marketing lists, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CR__con_Marketing_Lists|Marketing Lists].{br}

On the '''Campaigns''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] form, you can view a list of all marketing campaigns where the lead is included as a member. For details about campaigns in Acumatica ERP, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CR__con_Campaigns|Marketing Campaigns].{br}

The '''Opportunities''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] form includes all opportunities linked to the lead. For detailed information about opportunities, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CR__MNG_Opportunities|Managing Opportunities].{br}

On the '''Activities''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] form, you can work with all the activities related to the lead, including current, completed, and planned activities. For details, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CR__con_Managing_Your_Tasks__Events__and_Activities|Managing Tasks, Events, and Activities].
==Lead States==
As a lead is being processed by marketing and sales teams, it progresses through various states, each of which is represented by a status displayed in the '''Status''' box in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form. The '''Status''' box is non-editable. Transitions between lead states can be performed through actions on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] form.{br}

In Acumatica ERP, a lead may be assigned one of the following statuses:[anchor|#_1ca7576a-94aa-4557-8028-1759086504dd]
*''New'': The lead has been created but no work has been done on it yet.
*''Open'': The lead is being qualified by a marketing team.
*''Sales-Ready:'' The lead has been qualified by a marketing team as showing more interest in the organization&rsquo;s products than other leads.
*''Sales-Accepted'': The lead has been initially reviewed and accepted by the lead qualification team and it is ready to meet with the sales team for further qualification.
*''Converted:'' The lead has been qualified and converted to an opportunity. For a lead with this status, most of the boxes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] form are read-only; you can only edit the value in the '''Description''' box in the Summary area.
*''Disqualified'': The lead is showing no interest in the organization&rsquo;s products or is not reachable (for example, the contact information is not valid). This status may also be used for duplicate leads. For more information about finding duplicates among CRM records in Acumatica ERP, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CR__con_Duplicate_Validation|Validating Records for Duplicates].

If a lead has the ''New'', ''Open'', ''Sales-Ready'', or ''Sales-Accepted'' status, the '''Active''' check box on the '''CRM Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] form is selected by default to indicate that the lead can be nurtured by a marketing team. The system clears the check box if the lead has the ''Converted'' or ''Disqualified'' status.{br}

You can use the following actions to transition a lead between states:[anchor|#_178c2cae-d421-4ab0-add0-a63207964f06]
*'''Open''': Opens the '''Details''' dialog box, where you select the reason for opening the lead and confirm the action. The status of the lead will be changed for ''Open''. The action is available when the status of the lead record is ''New'', ''Sales-Ready'', ''Sales-Accepted'', ''Converted'', or ''Disqualified''.
*'''Qualify''': Opens the '''Details''' dialog box, where you select the reason for qualifying the lead and confirm the action. The status of the lead will be changed for ''Sales-Ready''. The action is available when the status of the lead record is ''New'' or ''Open''.
*'''Accept''': Opens the '''Details''' dialog box, where you select the reason for accepting the lead and confirm the action. The status of the lead will be changed for ''Sales-Accepted''. The action is available when the status of the lead is ''New'', ''Open'', or ''Sales-Ready''.
*'''Disqualify''': Opens the '''Details''' dialog box, where you select the reason for disqualifying the lead and confirm the action. The status of the lead will be changed for ''Disqualified''. The action is available, if the status of the lead record is ''New'', ''Open'', ''Sales-Ready'', or ''Sales-Accepted''.
*'''Convert to Opportunity''': Opens the '''New opportunity''' dialog box, where you can enter initial data that is required to create an opportunity. By using that dialog box, you can create a new contact and business account for the lead, if needed, or review existing ones. The action is available, if the status of the lead record is ''New'', ''Open'', ''Sales-Ready'', or ''Sales-Accepted''.

A system administrator can configure notifications related to lead states. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Notifications_About_Changes|Notifications About Changes on Data Entry Forms].

Lead nurturing is the process of working with leads that are not yet ready to buy. Acumatica ERP provides tools that enable you to nurture leads more effectively, and as a result, to increase lead conversion to opportunities.{br}

When working with leads, you can register all your activities in the system to save all information you get. For each lead, you can create tasks and activities and schedule events. You can configure a dashboard to show the list of your current tasks and events.{br}

By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_40_40|Event and Task Categories] ([~/?ScreenId=EP204040|EP204040]) form, you can create a list of event and task categories and provide a color code for each category.{br}

You can filter leads by specific properties and add them to mailing lists and campaigns so that you can send personalized emails by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_80_00|Mass Emails] ([~/?ScreenId=CR308000|CR308000]) form. {br}

As leads progress through different statuses, Acumatica ERP lets you easily access all related information, which is available on '''Relations''' tabs on each form included in the lead management workflow. Also, at every change of the lead status, you can use the '''Reason''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form to specify the reason for that change.{br}

Review lead records periodically to find leads that were not qualified as opportunities or for some reason have proved to be of no value to your company. Such records can be disqualified; as a result, their status will be changed to ''Disqualified''. To update leads in bulk, use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_50_30_20|Update Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR503020|CR503020]) form.

When the owner of a lead decides that the lead can be considered a qualified opportunity, the owner can convert the open lead to an opportunity and create a related contact and business account, if needed. Multiple leads may be related to the same company; in this case, one customer account can be created with multiple associated contacts.{br}

==Other Settings That Affect the Workflow==
You can affect the workflow of lead processing by specifying additional settings as follows:[anchor|#_292d108d-a4ef-488d-af04-617f2b1b266a]
*To be able to import leads from external sources, you need a properly configured import scenario that you can use with the particular type of source file. For different files, you have to use different import scenarios. For information about import scenarios, see [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__mng_Configuring_Import_Scenarios|Configuring Import Scenarios].
*For automatic assignment of leads to responsible employees, you need to have a lead assignment map configured. For details about assignment maps, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CR__con_Assignment_Rules_for_Cases_and_Leads|Configuring Assignment Rules].
*If you want email notifications to be sent to responsible employees when a lead is assigned to an employee or when a lead changes its status, you need to enable the ''Change Notifications'' feature on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, configure a system email account, and set up necessary notifications. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\EM__con_Configuring_Email_Accounts|Configuring Email Accounts] and [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Notifications_About_Changes|Notifications About Changes on Data Entry Forms]

==Testing of Settings==

You may find it convenient to break the process of lead creation into two stages. During the first stage, you quickly create a lead record, entering the minimum data that is sufficient for meaningful statistical reports. During the second stage, which is optional, you can edit the lead record and provide the most complete information about the lead.
==To Enter Required Data for a New Lead==[anchor|#_47fcfda7-fa11-49a3-8ba5-ca86f3bee259]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] (CR3010PL) form. 
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record'''.
#In the Summary area, in the '''Source''' box, select the lead source.
#On the '''Contact Info''' tab, do the following:
##In the '''Contact''' section, specify the available details about the contact.
##In the '''Address''' section, in the '''Country''' box, select the country of the lead.
#On the '''CRM Info''' tab, in the '''Lead Class''' box, select the class with which the lead record will be associated.
#Navigate to the '''Attributes''' tab and specify values for any required attributes.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

As a result, a lead record is created. Its status is set to ''New'', and it is not yet assigned to any owner.
==To Edit the Lead Record==[anchor|#ol_pkt_f4y_1n]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] (CR3010PL) form, select the lead that you want to edit.
#In the Summary area of the form, in the '''Lead ID''' box, select the lead record you want to edit.
#On the '''Contact Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form, which opens, fill in the remaining boxes for which you have data.
#Optional: In the '''Workgroup''' box on the '''CRM Info''' tab, select a workgroup.
#In the Summary area of the form, in the '''Owner''' box, select the employee to whom the record will be assigned for processing. If you have specified a workgroup, you can select the owner only from its members
#On the '''Attributes''' tab, specify any missing or updated values for the attributes.

 Acumatica ERP provides broad capabilities for managing your activities, including tasks and events. You can create new activities, cancel or complete activities, copy old activities to new ones, and attach files or notes to activities. {br}{TOC}
==Information about Your Tasks and Events==
In Acumatica ERP, you can configure specific dashboards that will allow you to view all your tasks and events. {br}

You can view and create tasks by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_40_40_00|Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=EP404000|EP404000]) form. {br}

 To view events you created and events you are attending, use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_40_41_00|Events] ([~/?ScreenId=EP404100|EP404100]) form. If you are an attendee to an event, not all controls will be available to you on the this form; for example, you cannot cancel or reschedule the event. 
==Finding Information About Activities==
You can track activities (including tasks and events) and view their history. You can create activities for specific entities by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_00|Cases] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306000|CR306000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_40_00|Marketing Lists] ([~/?ScreenId=CR204000|CR204000]), and [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_20_00|Marketing Campaigns] ([~/?ScreenId=CR202000|CR202000]) data entry forms. When sending an email to a customer about a particular case, you can add information about activities related to this case. Activities associated with the specific entity being viewed are shown on the '''Activities''' tab of the form. ((({S:Hint}You can hide an event, task, or other activity from external users by selecting the '''Internal''' check box on '''Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_30|Event] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306030|CR306030]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_20|Task] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306020|CR306020]), or [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_10|Activity] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306010|CR306010]) form.
)))
==Working With the Activities Tab==
By using the '''Activities''' tabs on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads], [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts], [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts], [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities], [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_00|Cases], [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_40_00|Marketing Lists], and [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_20_00|Marketing Campaigns] data entry forms, you can create activities and associate them with the particular entity. The [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) forms also include '''Activities''' tabs; on these tabs, you can view only activities associated with the project or task. {br}

All activities (including current, completed, and not-yet-started ones) related to the selected entity—that is, the lead, contact, business account, opportunity, case, marketing list, marketing campaign, project, or project task you are viewing—are listed on the '''Activities''' tab. You can view the details of the task, event, or activity by clicking the value in the '''Subject''' box, which is a link to the corresponding task, event, or activity. {br}

 Generally, the list of activities or tasks is presented in a tabular format. The column with the unlabeled header contains icons that indicate the type of the activity in each row. The following icons are used: [anchor|#ul_egv_q14_qk]
*[image:UserGuide/Images/Managing_Your_Tasks__Events__and_Activities_ask.png] is used for the ''Task'' activity type.
*[image:UserGuide/Images/Managing_Your_Tasks__Events__and_Activities_alendar.png] is used for the ''Event'' activity type.
*[image:UserGuide/Images/Managing_Your_Tasks__Events__and_Activities_mail.png] is used for the ''Email'' activity type.
*Custom icons for activities of other types can be used if they are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_10_20_00|Activity Types] ([~/?ScreenId=CR102000|CR102000]) form.

The table has a number of columns with icons as column headings. {br}

You can use the icons in the table rows in the following ways: 
*To attach a file to an activity, click the Attach File icon ([image:UserGuide/Images/Managing_Your_Tasks__Events__and_Activities_lip.png]) in the row related to the activity, and the '''Upload File''' dialog box appears. (For detailed instructions on using this dialog box, see [HelpRoot_Interface\Attaching_Files_to_Record_Details|To Attach a File to a Record Detail].) Once you have attached a file, the File Attached icon([image:UserGuide/Images/Managing_Your_Tasks__Events__and_Activities_ttachFile.png]) is instead displayed.
*To add a note to the activity, click the Attach Note icon ([image:UserGuide/Images/Managing_Your_Tasks__Events__and_Activities_heet.png]) in the row related to the activity. The '''Enter Record Note''' dialog box appears; for instructions on how to use this dialog box, see [HelpRoot_Interface\Attaching_Notes_to_Record_Details|To Attach a Note to a Record Detail]. Once you have attached a note, the Note Attached ([image:UserGuide/Images/Managing_Your_Tasks__Events__and_Activities_oteAttached.png]) icon is instead shown in the row. To read the note, click the icon.
*In the column with the Check Mark icon ([image:UserGuide/Images/Managing_Your_Tasks__Events__and_Activities_ick.png]) in the column header, note the green check mark if it appears. This check mark indicates that the related activity has been completed.
*Notice the column with the Exclamation Mark icon ([image:UserGuide/Images/Managing_Your_Tasks__Events__and_Activities_xclamation_sign.png]) in the column header. The icon in this row indicates the priority of the activity: 
**If the exclamation mark ([image:UserGuide/Images/Managing_Your_Tasks__Events__and_Activities_!.png]) appears, the priority level is high.
**If the blue arrow ([image:UserGuide/Images/Managing_Your_Tasks__Events__and_Activities_ow_priority.png]) is displayed, the priority level is low.
**If the column is empty, the priority level is normal.
*Note the column with the Reminder icon ([image:UserGuide/Images/Managing_Your_Tasks__Events__and_Activities_ell.png]) in the column header, which indicates whether a reminder was configured for the activity. If this column is empty for a particular row, a reminder was not set for the activity. If a white bell ([image:UserGuide/Images/Managing_Your_Tasks__Events__and_Activities_white_bell.png]) is displayed in this column, a reminder was configured for the activity.

The number of records that your company maintains can be quite large, and some of these records are probably duplicates. The probability of duplicates significantly increases each time that you add a large batch of new records—for example, when you import a newly purchased list of leads.{br}

In Acumatica ERP, you can validate records for duplicates. The validation process consists of the following steps:[anchor|#ul_dz5_ybn_pm]
*Leads are validated against other leads, contacts, and business accounts.
*Contacts are validated against leads, other contacts, and business accounts.
*Business accounts are validated against other business accounts.

 Before you can start searching for duplicates, you have to take the following preparatory steps, some of which are described in more detail below:[anchor|#ol_awq_cfn_pm]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, enable the ''Lead/Contact Duplicate Validation'' feature.

{br}{TOC}
==Setting Up Duplicate Validation==
Default validation rules are defined for each record type on the '''Duplicate Validation Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_10_10_00|Customer Management Preferences] form. Consider carefully which settings you need to adjust and why; you may lose important data if you use unbalanced values.{br}

In the '''Matching Fields''' column, you can specify all the elements whose values you want to be compared during the verification process. For each, the score weight should be specified. The score weight indicates the share that the element contributes to the validation score if values match. The total validation score of a pair of compared records is calculated as the sum of the weights of the elements whose values match.{br}

In the Summary area, you can specify the threshold values. The system will compare the validation score against these thresholds to determine whether the compared records are possible duplicates.Duplicate validation processing—such as validating leads and contacts, validating accounts, and calculating grams—is handled in a parallel mode and may be a time-consuming process. You can speed up duplicate validation of records by adding the following key to the <tt>web.config</tt> file located in the website folder:{{{{&lt;add key="ParallelProcessingDisabled" value="True" /&gt;
}}}}
==Calculating Grams==
After you have set up duplicate validation, navigate to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_50_34_00|Calculate Grams] form and process all the records that you want to validate for duplicates.{br}

Grams are used for the calculation of validation scores. You cannot use the duplicate validation feature if you have not calculated grams for all records of the type that you want to validate.{br}

You may need to recalculate grams in the following cases:[anchor|#ul_jyz_1dj_vm]
*Validation rules have been changed on the '''Duplicate Validation Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_10_10_00|Customer Management Preferences] form.
*A batch of new leads have been imported into Acumatica ERP.

Grams are calculated automatically for each new record on entry if validation of new records has been enabled on the '''Duplicate Validation Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_10_10_00|Customer Management Preferences] form.((({S:Warn}If contact information has been updated for a record, grams are reset for the related entities that share this information in the following manner:[anchor|#_2dde5d40-e5ef-41b6-895c-030a886d9d34]
*If contact information has been updated for a lead, grams are reset for other leads that are linked to the same contact, as well as for the linked business account.
*If contact information has been updated for a contact or business account, grams are reset for all leads linked to that contact or business account.

You may need to manually run the recalculation of grams for the records whose grams have been reset.
)))
==Validating Records for Duplicates==
There are two ways that the validation process can be performed:[anchor|#ul_fmc_pdj_vm]
*By validating individual records
*By validating records in batches

You can validate individual records by manually executing the '''Check for Duplicates''' action, which is available in the '''Actions''' menu on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]), and [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) data entry forms. Also, new records can be validated on entry if the corresponding settings have been specified on the '''Duplicate Validation Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_10_10_00|Customer Management Preferences] form. (In this case, grams are calculated for each new record on entry so that you do not have to manually run the gram recalculation process.){br}

To validate records in batches, you can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_50_34_10|Validate Leads and Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR503410|CR503410]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_50_34_20|Validate Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR503420|CR503420]) forms. On these forms, you can validate either new records only (that is, the records with the ''New'' status) or all listed records (which may be a time-consuming process if a very large number of records are involved).{br}

If you validate all records, once you click '''Process All''', the system starts processing records one by one, first marking each record as ''Not Validated'' (which is identical to marking it as new) because the system cannot validate records when they have other statuses. As a result of validation, which may take a long time depending on the total number of listed records, each record is marked as either ''Validated'' or ''Possible Duplicate''. If you interrupt the process, you will not be able to resume it; each time you click '''Process All''', the processing starts anew for all listed records.{br}

If possible duplicates have been found for a record, the '''Duplicates''' tab appears on the corresponding data entry form: [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads], [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts], or [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts]. On this tab, you can merge duplicates into one record by using the merge wizard. After you have resolved conflicts between the matching fields and merged the records, the duplicates are closed.

You may need to recalculate grams in the following cases: Validation rules have been changed on the  Duplicate Validation       Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR101000|CR101000]) Customer Management Preferences form. A batch of new leads have been imported into  Acumatica ERP. Grams are calculated automatically for each new record on entry if validation of new         records has been enabled on the  Duplicate Validation Settings  tab of         the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR101000|CR101000]) Customer Management Preferences form. If contact information has been updated for a record, grams are reset         for the related entities that share this information in the following manner: If contact information has been updated for a lead, grams are reset for other leads             that are linked to the same contact, as well as for the linked business account. If contact information has been updated for a contact or business account, grams are             reset for all leads linked to that contact or business account. You may need to manually run the recalculation of grams for the records whose grams           have been reset. Validating Records for Duplicates There are two ways that the validation process can be performed: By validating individual records By validating records in batches You can validate individual records by manually executing the  Check for Duplicates      action, which is available in the  Actions  menu on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads     (CR301000),   ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) Contacts (CR302000), and   ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) Business Accounts (CR303000) data entry forms. Also, new records can be validated on entry if the     corresponding settings have been specified on the  Duplicate Validation      Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR101000|CR101000]) Customer Management Preferences form. (In this case, grams are     calculated for each new record on entry so that you do not have to manually run the gram     recalculation process.) To validate records in batches, you can use the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR503410|CR503410]) Validate Leads and Contacts (CR503410)     and   ([~/?ScreenId=CR503420|CR503420]) Validate Accounts (CR503420) forms. On these forms, you can validate either     new records only (that is, the records with the  New  status) or all listed records (which     may be a time-consuming process if a very large number of records are involved). If you validate all records, once you click  Process All , the system     starts processing records one by one, first marking each record as  Not Validated  (which     is identical to marking it as new) because the system cannot validate records when they have     other statuses. As a result of validation, which may take a long time depending on the total     number of listed records, each record is marked as either  Validated  or  Possible      Duplicate . If you interrupt the process, you will not be able to resume it; each time you     click  Process All , the processing starts anew for all listed records. If possible duplicates have been found for a record, the  Duplicates  tab     appears on the corresponding data entry form:   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads,   ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) Contacts, or   ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) Business Accounts. On this tab, you can merge     duplicates into one record by using the merge wizard. After you have resolved conflicts between     the matching fields and merged the records, the duplicates are closed.

==To Specify Duplicate Validation Settings==[anchor|#ol_adb_jhz_ym]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_10_10_00|Customer Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CR101000|CR101000]) form. 
#Click the '''Duplicate Validation Settings''' tab.
#On the '''Lead and Contacts Validation Rules''', '''Lead and Account Validation Rules''', and '''Account Validation Rules''' tabs, specify the rules according to which the validation score will be calculated for each validated record as follows:
##Click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar to add a new rule.
##In the '''Matching Field''' column, select the name of the field whose values will be matched across all validated records.
##In the '''Score Weight''' column, specify the share that will be contributed to the validation score if there are matching values for this field. (As a result of the validation process, records whose matching fields contain similar values are rendered possible duplicates; the score weights of their matching fields are added together, and the total equals the validation score.)
##In the '''Transaction Rule''' column, select which transformation rule can be applied to the values in this field.
##Repeat the four previous substeps for each additional rule you want to add to this tab.
#In the Summary area of the '''Duplicate Validation Settings''' tab, specify values in the '''Lead and Contact Validation Score Threshold''', '''Account Validation Score Threshold''', and '''Lead and Account Validation Score Threshold''' boxes.
#:((({S:Warn}Make sure that each threshold value does not exceed the total of the score weights specified on the corresponding validation rules tab.
)))
#Specify a value in the '''Close Leads with no Activities with Score Higher Than''' box. Leads that have no associated activities and whose validation score exceeds this value will automatically be closed as duplicates.
#Optional: If you want new records to be validated for duplicates when they are manually entered on data entry forms, select the '''Validate Leads and Contacts for Duplicates on Entry''' or '''Validate Accounts for Duplicates on Entry''' check box (or both check boxes).
#Optional: If you want the system to discard upon verification the contacts that have non-unique email addresses, select the '''Require Unique Email Address on Contact Validation''' check box. We recommend that you enable this setting if you have configured integration with HubSpot or import large numbers of contacts from any external source.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

The integration of Acumatica ERP with HubSpot gives you the ability to synchronize data between the two systems. You synchronize data by using integration scenarios. For information on how to prepare these integration scenarios, see [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__mng_Configuring_Import_Scenarios|Configuring Import Scenarios] and [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__mng_Configuring_Export_Scenarios|Configuring Export Scenarios].
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#_03d66f00-8327-439d-bee6-cc5296903032]
*Configure the ''HubSpot Enhanced Provider'' data provider
*Configure the ''HubSpot'' data provider
*Synchronize different entities between the systems
*Configure automation schedules that will run synchronization processes
*Resolve synchronization issues

==Data Providers==
When creating or modifying an integration scenario, you need to specify an appropriate data provider. For the synchronization of data between Acumatica ERP and HubSpot, you can use one of the following built-in data providers: [anchor|#_f45695c8-cb2f-4601-af6e-bb421b26ef30]
*''HubSpot'': This data provider is based on a specific built-in provider type: ''HubSpot Provider''. By using this data provider, you can export leads from Acumatica ERP to HubSpot for nurturing and then import the leads back to Acumatica ERP for further processing.
*:For details about how to configure the ''HubSpot'' data provider, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CR__HOW_To_Configure_HubSpot_Provider|Integration with Hubspot: To Configure the HubSpot Data Provider].
*''HubSpot Enhanced Provider'': This data provider is based on the ''HubSpot Enhanced'' provider type, which supports both the use of the OAuth protocol and the HubSpot API key for authorization in HubSpot. By using this data provider, you can synchronize contacts, leads, business accounts, and marketing lists between the two systems. 
*:For more information about the ''HubSpot Enhanced Provider'' data provider, see [HelpRoot_CRM\config_HubSpot_Enhanced_Provider|Integration with HubSpot: Enhanced HubSpot Data Provider].

==Configuration Flow of Data Synchronization Between Acumatica ERP and HubSpot==
To configure synchronization of data between Acumatica ERP and HubSpot by using the ''HubSpot Enhanced Provider'' data provider, you should do the following:[anchor|#_223fcbbb-50f8-4e37-842f-0b46c2b9f99f]
#Configure the ''HubSpot Enhanced Provider'' data provider on the '''Parameters''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_15|Data Providers] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206015|SM206015]) form so that it connects to HubSpot. For instructions, see [HelpRoot_CRM\config_HubSpot_Implem_Activity_EnhancedProvider|Integration with HubSpot: To Configure the HubSpot Enhanced Data Provider].
#Prepare integration scenarios that use the ''HubSpot Enhanced Provider'' data provider for the entity types whose data need to be synchronized between the systems, and start the synchronization processes.
#:For details, see [HelpRoot_CRM\config_HubSpot_Implem_Activity_Sync_Leads|Integration with HubSpot: To Synchronize Leads], [HelpRoot_CRM\config_HubSpot_Implem_Activity_Sync_Contacts|Integration with HubSpot: To Synchronize Contacts], [HelpRoot_CRM\config_HubSpot_Implem_Activity_Sync_Accounts|Integration with HubSpot: To Synchronize Accounts], and [HelpRoot_CRM\config_HubSpot_Implem_Activity_Sync_Marketing_Lists|Integration with HubSpot: To Synchronize Marketing List].
#Configure automation schedules that will run the needed import and export scenarios at the specified time intervals, as described in [HelpRoot_CRM\config_HubSpot_Implem_Activity_Schedule_Sync|Integration with HubSpot: To Schedule Synchronization Processes].

==HubSpot Integration Limitations==
The solution for the synchronization of data between Acumatica ERP and HubSpot has the following limitations:[anchor|#_bf8b27de-f658-4421-bd9f-62cd14e4b5d2]
*Only one instance of HubSpot may be synchronized with an Acumatica ERP instance.
*If multiple data providers use the ''HubSpot Enhanced'' provider type, an error will occur when a user attempts to use any of them.

The Acumatica ERP and HubSpot systems process data changes differently depending on in which system the changes have been made. In this topic, you will read about the data flow between the Acumatica ERP and HubSpot.
==Data Changes Made in Acumatica ERP==
After you make a change to a record in Acumatica ERP (for example, deleting a contact), Acumatica ERP queries HubSpot via the REST API and checks whether the matching entity in HubSpot has been modified. (The import and export scenarios in Acumatica ERP define the matching rules for records.){br}

If the matching record in HubSpot has not been modified or does not exist, Acumatica ERP updates it or creates a new record in HubSpot. If the matching record has been changed in HubSpot, Acumatica ERP checks which of the systems is the master system and uses the master system&rsquo;s data to update the corresponding record in the other system. The master system is defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\HS_20_50_20|HubSpot Sync] ([~/?ScreenId=HS205020|HS205020]) form.{br}

In the diagram below, you can see the process of synchronizing the data changes that were made in Acumatica ERP with the data in HubSpot. [anchor|#_fece74ba-fa01-4c49-9c11-71a6b537e3c2][anchor|#_04f0722b-cedd-46e4-9410-fbafa11528ec][image:UserGuide/Images/CRM_HubSpot_Acumatica_to_HubSpot_Flow.png|popup|The data flow of changes made in Acumatica ERP|450px]
==Data Changes Made in HubSpot==
After you make a change to a record in HubSpot, the system triggers a webhook notification if the webhook notifications have been configured. (A HubSpot administrator needs to configure webhook notifications for a HubSpot object event in advance.) If the webhook notifications have not been configured, Acumatica ERP can get information on the changes in HubSpot by periodically polling it via REST API. (The polling interval setting is located in the ''HubSpot Enhanced Provider'' data provider settings in Acumatica ERP.){br}

When Acumatica ERP receives a notification about the change, the system checks if any change has been made to the matching record in Acumatica ERP. If no change has been made or no matching record exists, Acumatica ERP updates the record or creates a new one. If the record has been changed in both systems, Acumatica ERP checks which system is the master system and uses the master system data to update the corresponding record in the other system.{br}

Otherwise, you may end up in a situation in which one contact in HubSpot synchronizes to both a lead and a contact in Acumatica ERP. {br}

The appropriate source restriction and field mapping settings of lead and contact import and export scenarios define whether a HubSpot contact synchronizes to a lead or a contact in Acumatica ERP.
==Example of Integration Scenario Settings==
 Acumatica ERP contains preconfigured integration scenarios to which the ''Lead Status'' custom field has been added. This field can be used to distinguish leads and contacts. If the Lead Status of the record is ''Converted'', the record is a contact. Otherwise it is a lead.{br}

The following settings have been preconfigured for ''HubSpot Enhanced Provider'' data provider:[anchor|#_d14253c9-4537-47dc-ab17-eb7e785132fa]
#On the '''Source Restriction''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) form, for the ''Import Contacts From Hubspot'' import scenario, the following settings have been specified:
#*'''Active''': Selected
#*'''Field Name''': ''Lead Status''
#* '''Condition''': ''Equals''
#* '''Value''': ''CONNECTED''
#:These settings specify that only HubSpot contacts that have the ''Connected'' lead status are imported as contacts.
#For the ''Import Leads From Hubspot'' import scenario, the following settings have been specified:
#*'''Active''': Selected
#*'''Field Name''': ''Lead Status''
#* '''Condition''': ''Does Not Equal''
#* '''Value''': ''CONNECTED''
#:These settings specify that only HubSpot contacts that do not have the ''Connected'' lead status are imported as leads.
#On the '''Source Restriction''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_70_25|Export Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM207025|SM207025]) form, for the ''Export Leads to HubSpot Realtime'' export scenario, the following settings have been specified:
#*'''Active''': Selected
#*'''Source Object''': ''Lead Summary''
#* '''Field Name''': ''Status''
#* '''Condition''': ''Does Not Equal''
#* '''Value''': ''Converted''
#:These settings specify that converted leads are not exported as leads because they are exported as contacts.
#On the '''Mapping''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_70_25|Export Scenarios] form, for the ''Export Contacts to HubSpot Realtime'' export scenario, the following settings have been specified:
#*'''Active''': Selected
#*'''Source Object''': ''Contact Summary''
#* '''Field/Action Name''': ''=&rsquo;CONNECTED&rsquo;''
#* '''Target Field/Value''': ''Lead Status (hs&#95;lead&#95;status)''
#:These settings specify that during the export of contacts from Acumatica ERP, the lead status of the HubSpot contacts is set to ''Connected''.

Similarly, you can configure other integration scenarios that you plan to use for HubSpot integration.]]></column>

In Acumatica ERP, an opportunity represents a potential sale to a new or existing customer. If you have a contact who is interested in your quote and displays an intention to buy as soon as possible, the contact can be regarded as a qualified opportunity. For this contact, you can immediately create an opportunity by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) form.{br}{TOC}
==Specifying Contact Information==
As a rule, when you create an opportunity, you specify the relevant contact information for it. In Acumatica ERP, you can do this by selecting an existing business account or contact record in the '''Business Account''' or '''Contact''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] form. If no such record exists in the system, you can create a new business account or contact on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) form, respectively, and then associate it with the opportunity. For a faster option, you can instead enter basic contact information on the fly by using the '''Contact Info''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] form.{br}

If you select a business account or contact in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] form, the contact information is copied to the '''Contact Info''' tab from the account or contact settings. This information is displayed as read-only by default, but it can be modified once you select the '''Override''' check box on this tab.((({S:Warn}If you modify the contact or address details for a contact or business account by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] form, the changes will not be reflected on the information displayed on the '''Contact Info''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] form.
)))
==Creating New Contacts and Business Accounts==
If you have specified basic contact information on the fly by using the '''Contact Info''' tab, you can create a regular contact record based on this information by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Create Contact''' on the form toolbar. The system automatically associates the created contact with the opportunity.{br}

To be able to further process the opportunity, you need to specify a business account. You can create a new business account by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Create Account''' on the form toolbar. If you select the '''Link Contact to Account''' check box in the '''New Account''' dialog box (which opens), the contact record associated with the opportunity will also be associated with the new business account.
==Creating Sales Orders, Invoices, and Emails==
The system uses the contact information specified on the '''Contact Info''' tab when it generates new documents—such as sales orders, invoices, or emails—related to the opportunity. For a sales order created from the opportunity, the billing settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form are populated based on this information. Similarly, the financial settings specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form for an invoice created from the opportunity are based on the contact information of the opportunity. If you create an email activity by using the '''Activities''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] form, the email address specified on the '''Contact Info''' tab (if any) is populated in the '''To''' box of the created email.
==Preserving Opportunity-Related Contact Information==
If you select a different business account or contact for the opportunity, the system will ask you whether you want to replace the contact information specified on the '''Contact Info''' tab with the new information. You can preserve the previously specified information; in this case, the '''Override''' check box will become selected on the '''Contact Info''' tab to indicate that this information differs from that of the contact or business account selected in the Summary area.
==Validating Addresses==
If the ''Address Validation Integration'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form and an address validation provider is configured on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_30_00|Address Validation Providers] ([~/?ScreenId=CS103000|CS103000]) form, you can use the '''Validate Addresses''' menu command on the '''Actions''' menu on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] form. When you click this menu command, the addresses specified for the document are validated through integration with a specialized third-party software or service.{br}

If the specified address has been validated, the '''Validated''' check box on the '''Contact Info''' tab is selected. This check box appears only if the ''Address Validation Integration'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form.

An opportunity, when processed by a salesperson, progresses through various stages. At any particular stage, there is a certain probability, however low, that the sale can be successfully closed. This enables you to estimate future sales revenue at any time. The accuracy of revenue estimation heavily depends on the correct identification of the opportunity stage and on the accuracy of the related probability.{br}

An administrator uses the '''Stages''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_90_00|Opportunity Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR209000|CR209000]) form to set up opportunity stages and their probabilities. The full list of opportunity stages is shared by all opportunity classes. When setting up a particular opportunity class, an administrator selects the '''Active''' check box for the opportunity stages that need to be included in this class and clears for the opportunity stages that are not intended for this class. If the check box is cleared for a stage that has been used in any opportunity of the class, this stage becomes excluded from the list of available stages for opportunities of the class (but it still will be shown in reports). For each opportunity class, at least one stage should be active.{br}

The system offers a predefined list of opportunity stages, which includes the following options:[anchor|#ul_bjj_2px_nz]
*''Prospect'': The contact associated with the opportunity is a known prospect but it is not clear whether they are interested in the offered products or services.
*''Nurture'': Information about the prospect&rsquo;s interest in products and services is being collected.
*''Qualification'': The prospect&rsquo;s interest in purchasing particular products or services is being determined.
*''Development'': The prospect&rsquo;s requirements, budget, and time frame are being clarified.
*''Solution'': A solution is under development.
*''Proof'': A concept is ready and pending approval.
*''Negotiation'': A proposal has been prepared or a contract is ready to be signed.
*''Won'': The deal has been successfully closed.

To reflect a sales process established in the company, an administrator can modify the list by adding new stages or by removing unnecessary ones, which will affect all existing opportunity classes. For each new stage, an identifier, name, probability percentage, and sort order should be specified.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Opportunity Stages and Probabilities An opportunity, when processed by a salesperson, progresses through various stages. At any     particular stage, there is a certain probability, however low, that the sale can be successfully     closed. This enables you to estimate future sales revenue at any time. The accuracy of revenue     estimation heavily depends on the correct identification of the opportunity stage and on the     accuracy of the related probability. An administrator uses the  Stages  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR209000|CR209000]) Opportunity Classes (CR209000) form to set up opportunity stages and their     probabilities. The full list of opportunity stages is shared by all opportunity classes. When     setting up a particular opportunity class, an administrator selects the  Active  check box     for the opportunity stages that need to be included in this class and clears for the opportunity     stages that are not intended for this class. If the check box is cleared for a stage that has     been used in any opportunity of the class, this stage becomes excluded from the list of     available stages for opportunities of the class (but it still will be shown in reports). For     each opportunity class, at least one stage should be active. The system offers a predefined list of opportunity stages, which includes the following     options: Prospect : The contact associated with the opportunity is a known prospect but it is      not clear whether they are interested in the offered products or services. Nurture : Information about the prospect's interest in products and services is being      collected. Qualification : The prospect's interest in purchasing particular products or services      is being determined. Development : The prospect's requirements, budget, and time frame are being      clarified. Solution : A solution is under development. Proof : A concept is ready and pending approval. Negotiation : A proposal has been prepared or a contract is ready to be signed. Won : The deal has been successfully closed. To reflect a sales process established in the company, an administrator can modify the list by     adding new stages or by removing unnecessary ones, which will affect all existing opportunity     classes. For each new stage, an identifier, name, probability percentage, and sort order should     be specified.  ([~/?ScreenId=CR101000|CR101000])  ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) ]]></column>

In Acumatica ERP, a sales quote represents a formal offer made to a particular customer based on an opportunity; the sales quote includes a list of products offered at specific prices. For one opportunity, users can create any number of quotes, each of which can be printed or emailed to the specified customer for review. When the customer accepts the offer, the user can create a sales order and then an invoice based on the quote.{br}

Sales quote functionality becomes available in the system if the ''Sales Quotes'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}{TOC}
==Creation of Sales Quotes==
A user can start creating a sales quote in any of the following ways:[anchor|#ul_mvv_xgq_ncb]
*By clicking '''Create Quote''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) form
*By clicking '''Create Quote''' on the table toolbar of the '''Quotes''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] form
*By clicking '''Add New Record''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_45_00|Sales Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304500|CR304500]) form
*By selecting an existing quote and then invoking the '''Copy Quote''' action, which is available on the '''Quotes''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] form and on the '''Actions''' menu on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_45_00|Sales Quotes] form; in this case, a copy of the selected quote is created

==Primary Quotes==
If one quote or multiple quotes are created for an opportunity, one of the quotes must be marked as the primary quote, which a user can do either during the creation of a quote or by applying the '''Mark as Primary''' action to a selected quote.{br}

An opportunity uses the primary quote as the source of the following settings: the list of products, the currency and the currency rate, the location, the contact information, and the tax and discount details. If a user marks a different quote as the primary quote for the opportunity, these settings are changed in the opportunity to those of the new primary quote.
==Sales Quote Activities==
On the '''Activities''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_45_00|Sales Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304500|CR304500]) form, a user can create activities associated with the selected quote. On the '''Activities''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) form, activities related to the selected opportunity are listed along with activities related to all quotes associated with the opportunity.
==Statuses of a Sales Quote==
A quote can have one of the following statuses:[anchor|#ul_sxv_xgq_ncb]
*''Draft'': The quote is being prepared and its details can be edited.
*''Prepared'': The quote is ready to be sent to the customer. The quote gets this status after it has been submitted or, if approval is required for quotes, after it has been approved.
*''Sent'': The quote has been emailed to the customer.
*''Pending Approval'': The quote is pending approval within the company.
*''Rejected'': The quote has been rejected by an approver within the company.

==Approval of Sales Quotes==
Approval of quotes can be set up in the system if the ''Approval Workflow'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

Quotes require approval if an approval map for quotes has been specified in the '''Approval Map''' box in the '''Quote Approval Settings''' section on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_10_10_00|Customer Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CR101000|CR101000]) form.{br}

A quote that is pending approval cannot be modified. An assigned approver can approve or reject the quote by using the standard '''Approve''' and '''Reject''' actions available on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_45_00|Sales Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304500|CR304500]) form and on the table toolbar of the '''Quotes''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) form. After a quote has been approved, it can be sent to the customer.
==Emailing of a Sales Quote==
A user can send a submitted and, if approval of quotes is set up in the system, approved quote to a customer for review by selecting the quote and then invoking the '''Send Quote''' action, which is available on the '''Quotes''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) form and on the '''Actions''' menu on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_45_00|Sales Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304500|CR304500]) form. In this case, an email activity is created, the quote is attached to the email activity in the form of a report, and the status of the quote changes to ''Sent''. {br}

The email is generated automatically in accordance with the mailing settings specified in the Customer Management module, which can be configured as follows:[anchor|#ol_ey5_g2w_hdb]
#On the '''Mailing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_10_10_00|Customer Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CR101000|CR101000]), all mailings that may be used in the module are listed.

On this form, only a mailing that is listed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_10_10_00|Customer Management Preferences] form can be selected. If the selected mailing is not listed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_80_00|Business Account Classes] form for the class of the customer account, the '''Overridden''' check box is selected for this mailing to indicate that the default setting has been modified.

For each mailing, the following settings may be specified:[anchor|#ul_ncf_bfw_hdb]
*The email address from which the mailing will be sent; if none is specified, the system will use the default system email account
*A notification template based on which the email body will be generated
*A report that will be attached to the email and the format of the attachment
*A list of recipients

When your company is nurturing confirmed contacts that are not yet ready to buy any of the currently offered services or products but might be interested in future offers (or might become more interested over time), you may want to send these contacts newsletters and promotional emails and run marketing campaigns. Also, maintaining marketing lists may help your company to promote new products and services to existing customers.{br}

The purpose of these marketing campaigns and other mailings is to encourage repeat sales or to stimulate feedback from contacts and boost their transition to real sales opportunities.{br}

In Acumatica ERP, you can create and maintain any number of marketing lists. You can send mass emails composed from scratch or you can use previously defined templates; running a marketing campaign may also involve sending mass emails to particular mailing lists.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
A marketing list is a list of contacts that might share particular characteristics. In Acumatica ERP, you can create as many marketing lists as you need. Based on a marketing list, you can create mailing lists for mass-mailing newsletters, special offers, or other periodically sent information. Maintaining marketing lists is an effective way to advertise products and services.{br}

You can view existing marketing lists and create new ones by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_40_00|Marketing Lists] ([~/?ScreenId=CR204000|CR204000]) form. On the '''List Members''' tab of this form, you can view the members of a particular marketing list.{br}

Each marketing list can be configured to be either dynamic or static.{br}{TOC}
==Dynamic Marketing Lists==
A dynamic marketing list is formed automatically according to a set of solid rules. To mark a marketing list as dynamic, you need to select the '''Dynamic List''' check box on the '''Configuration Options''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_40_00|Marketing Lists] ([~/?ScreenId=CR204000|CR204000]) form. To define the rules according to which the list will be automatically formed and updated, you can do one of the following on the same tab:[anchor|#ul_n1r_q4m_l1b]
*Leave the '''Generic Inquiry''' box empty, and on the '''Selection Criteria''' tab, specify necessary filter conditions to select list members from all leads, contacts, and employees that exist in the system.
*Specify in the '''Generic Inquiry''' box a generic inquiry form that lists contact records; then, in the '''Shared Filter to Apply''' box, you can select a shared filter that is available for the specified inquiry form.

The rules will be applied to the existing or newly added records, and the records that match the specified criteria will be automatically included in the list.
==Static Marketing Lists==
A static marketing list is formed manually. To configure a static marketing list, you need to clear the '''Dynamic List''' check box on the '''Configuration Options''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_40_00|Marketing Lists] ([~/?ScreenId=CR204000|CR204000]) form and then include particular records in the marketing list by doing one of the following:[anchor|#ul_er5_btr_l1b]
*Clicking '''Add Row''' on the toolbar of the '''List Members''' tab of the form. Then you should add the needed data for the contact in the row. This step may be repeated as needed.
*Using the '''Add Members''' dialog box, which opens if you click '''Add New Members''' on the toolbar of the '''List Members''' tab of the form. In this dialog box, you can select list members from a specific data source, which can be either a different marketing list or a generic inquiry form that lists contact records. You can select a shared filter that is available for the specified inquiry form to be able to select members from only relevant records.
*Clicking '''Load Records from File''' on the '''List Members''' tab of the form to upload an Excel file with a list of contacts.
*Clicking '''Add Row''' on the toolbar of the '''Marketing Lists''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]), or [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) form. Then you should add the needed data for the marketing list in the row. You can repeat this step as needed.

==Member Subscription==
On some occasions, you might need to temporarily unsubscribe a particular contact from a marketing list. If this is the case, you do not have to remove the contact from the list of members; instead, you should do any of the following:[anchor|#ul_yhs_gyw_y1b]
*Clear the check box in the '''Subscribed''' column for the particular contact on the '''List Members''' tab of the ''Marketing Lists'' form populated with the details of the marketing list
*Clearing the check box in the '''Subscribed''' column for the particular marketing list on the '''Marketing Lists''' tab of the ''Leads'', ''Contacts'', or ''Business Accounts'' form populated with the details of the list member

To turn the member&rsquo;s subscription back on, you should select the previously cleared check box.
==Mass Emails==
If you want to send information to all members of a marketing list by email, you can prepare a mass email and send it by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_80_00|Mass Emails] ([~/?ScreenId=CR308000|CR308000]) form. A mass email can be sent to any of the following:[anchor|#ul_inv_lbm_t1b]
*The members of one mailing list or multiple mailing lists
*Particular leads, contacts, business accounts, and employees
*The members of a selected marketing campaign

In Acumatica ERP, before you launch a marketing campaign, you should do the following preparatory work, which is described in more detail in the sections below:[anchor|#ul_os2_gkt_l1b]
*Define campaign classes to set up the types of campaigns your company uses; each campaign class may have a list of attributes that may be used for detailed reporting.
*Prepare a list of campaign members.
*Create a campaign and specify necessary properties, such as the planned budget and the return you expect to receive as a result of the campaign. This information may be useful when you analyze campaign results.
{br}{TOC}
==Campaign Classes==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_25_00|Campaign Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR202500|CR202500]) form, you should define campaign classes. Each campaign class designates a particular type of campaign your company uses, such as indoor or outdoor advertising, telemarketing activities, web seminars, marketing events, or mass emails.{br}

A campaign class has a brief description and may include a list of attributes that you specify for the class to gather class-specific information about campaigns. When a user selects this campaign class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_20_00|Marketing Campaigns] ([~/?ScreenId=CR202000|CR202000]) form, these attributes are listed on the '''Attributes''' tab, and the user enters the values of these attributes.{br}

At any time, you can change the campaign class for an existing campaign. If the new campaign class includes any of the attributes included in the previous campaign class, the values of these attributes that were previously specified for the campaign are preserved and all other attributes from the previous campaign class are removed from the '''Attributes''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_20_00|Marketing Campaigns] form.{br}

For more information about how you can use classes and attributes, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CR__con_Classification_of_Business_Accounts|Classes and Attributes in CRM].
==Campaign Members==
You can add leads, contacts, business accounts, and employees to a list of campaign members in any of the following ways:[anchor|#ul_rqp_q5b_p1b]
*By clicking '''Add Row''' on the toolbar of the '''Members''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_20_00|Marketing Campaigns] ([~/?ScreenId=CR202000|CR202000]) form. In the row, you then add the needed data for the record. This step may be repeated as needed. You can use this step as a quick way of adding specific contacts to a list of campaign members.
*By using the '''Add Members''' dialog box, which opens if you click '''Add New Members''' on the toolbar of the '''Members''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_20_00|Marketing Campaigns] form. In this dialog box, you can select list members from a specific data source, which can be either a marketing list or a generic inquiry form that lists contact records. You can select a shared filter that is available for the specified inquiry form to be able to select members from only relevant records.
*By clicking '''Load Records from File''' on the '''Members''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_20_00|Marketing Campaigns] form and uploading an Excel file with a list of contacts.
*By clicking '''Add Row''' on the toolbar of the '''Campaigns''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]), or [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) form. Then you should add the needed data for the marketing campaign in the row. This step is repeated as needed.

On the '''Members''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_20_00|Marketing Campaigns] form, you can use the '''Add Opportunity''' button or the relevant command under the '''Add Activity''' menu on the table toolbar to create an opportunity or an activity, respectively, associated with a particular lead, contact, or business account listed in the table. Such an opportunity or activity will contain a reference to the marketing campaign, which may help you evaluate the effectiveness of the marketing campaign. See [HelpRoot_CRM\CR__con_Campaign_Statistics|Campaign Statistics] for more details on statistical information about marketing campaigns.
==Campaign Properties==
When you create a marketing campaign on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_20_00|Marketing Campaigns] ([~/?ScreenId=CR202000|CR202000]) form, you need to specify the following required properties of the campaign:[anchor|#ul_bcw_smc_p1b]
*A brief descriptive name
*The current stage, which can be ''Planning'' if you are entering a new campaign that hasn&rsquo;t yet been launched or ''Execution'' if you are entering a campaign that is already in progress
*The start date

Another property, a campaign identifier, is assigned automatically in accordance with the numbering sequence defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_10_10_00|Customer Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CR101000|CR101000]) form.{br}

Also, you may want to specify the following optional properties, which you may later find useful for the analysis of campaign efficiency:[anchor|#ul_s2q_gwg_r1b]
*The end date
*The promotional code to be used for identifying the campaign on the customer side
*The expected number of customer responses to the campaign
*The planned budget allocated for the campaign
*The expected return

In Acumatica ERP, as a marketing campaign progresses through stages, you can associate various activities with it, create related leads and opportunities, link sales and purchase documents to the campaign, and associate the campaign with projects.{br}{TOC}
==Activities==
When you execute a marketing campaign, you can send personalized emails to campaign members by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_80_00|Mass Emails] ([~/?ScreenId=CR308000|CR308000]) form or you can perform various marketing activities targeted at a specific audience and then associate these activities with particular marketing campaigns or campaign members.{br}

On the '''Activities''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_20_00|Marketing Campaigns] ([~/?ScreenId=CR202000|CR202000]) form, you can review a complete list of activities associated with the campaign. By using the toolbar buttons on this tab, you can create new activities that are unrelated to any particular campaign member. {br}

To create an activity associated with a particular campaign member, you need to select this campaign member on the '''Members''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_20_00|Marketing Campaigns] form and then select the appropriate command on the '''Add Activity''' menu. For instance, you can select the '''Add Phone Call''' menu command to create a phone call activity associated with a member of a telemarketing campaign who has been contacted by a telemarketing employee.
==Leads and Opportunities==
If a lead or opportunity has been created as a result of marketing activities related to a particular campaign, you can associate this lead or opportunity with the campaign in any of the following ways:[anchor|#ul_ppd_fdj_p1b]
*By clicking '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar of the '''Generated Leads''' or '''Opportunities''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_20_00|Marketing Campaigns] ([~/?ScreenId=CR202000|CR202000]) form and then creating a lead or opportunity record on the entry form that opens
*By specifying the campaign in the '''Source Campaign''' box on the '''Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) form

A qualified lead can be converted to an opportunity, which inherits the lead&rsquo;s relationship with the marketing campaign. All leads and opportunities associated with the campaign are listed on the '''Generated Leads''' and '''Opportunities''' tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_20_00|Marketing Campaigns] form. The total numbers of leads and opportunities are displayed in the '''Leads Generated''' and '''Opportunities''' boxes on the '''Campaign Details''' tab of the same form.{br}

For details about campaign statistics, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CR__con_Campaign_Statistics|Campaign Statistics].[anchor|#section_mdr_xjj_kdb]
==Expense Accounting==
If the ''Project Accounting'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can use the project accounting functionality to track expenses and revenue related to a marketing campaign. The system can regard a marketing campaign as a project and use the project budget tracking mechanism for tracking the campaign budget. For more information about project budgets, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__con_Budget_Tracking|Project Budgets].{br}

To be able to track campaign expenses, you need to create a specific project and, optionally, a project task dedicated to campaign expense accounting. Also, proper billing and allocation rules should be configured for the project.{br}

A project can be associated with a marketing campaign through the '''Project Accounting Integration''' section on the '''Campaign Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_20_00|Marketing Campaigns] ([~/?ScreenId=CR202000|CR202000]) form. If needed, multiple campaigns may be associated with a single project.{br}

All the campaign-related activities, the opportunities that resulted from this campaign, and the resulting sales orders and invoices also can be associated with the previously defined project. These associations allow for accurate calculation of all expenses and revenue generated by the campaign.

Mass emailing is one of the most successful tools used in marketing campaigns by many businesses. In Acumatica ERP, you can prepare a mass email and send it to the intended audience (that is, to selected contacts, mailing list members, or campaign members) by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_80_00|Mass Emails] ([~/?ScreenId=CR308000|CR308000]) form. You can set up a mass email to be sent to all members of a particular marketing campaign or to only those members who have not previously been sent emails as part of the campaign. {br}

To personalize emails, you can insert the recipient’s data into the text of the email by using placeholders. {br}

Before sending a mass email, you can test it by sending a preview email to one of your email accounts.
==Sending Mass Emails==
If you have specified a large number of recipients, sending a mass email may require significant time. When you click '''Send''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_80_00|Mass Emails] ([~/?ScreenId=CR308000|CR308000]) form, emails are only generated but not sent. You can initialize the actual process of sending emails by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_50_70_10|Send and Receive Email] ([~/?ScreenId=SM507010|SM507010]) form, or it can be scheduled to be performed at the required frequency. See [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Scheduled_Processing|Scheduled Processing] for information about scheduled processes.
==Processing Replies==
To process replies to mass email, you can use the built-in automatic processing of incoming emails without additional configuration. As part of this processing, the system forwards incoming emails to employees in accordance with the tracked email history. Also, depending on your business, you can configure the system to create cases, leads, or activities associated with the existing leads or contacts and assign them to specific employees. You can adjust this processing to your business needs by using various settings on the '''Incoming Mail Processing''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_02|System Email Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=SM204002|SM204002]) form. For more details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\EM__con_Mail_Processing|Incoming Mail Processing].

The person recording a new case uses the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_00|Cases] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306000|CR306000]) form, which holds a wide variety of information related to each case, such as the following: [anchor|#ul_ekl_g23_vm]
*Basic information: This information includes the customer, the contact, the case class, the status of the case, the subject and description of the case, and the date the case is reported.
*Ownership details: The case can be assigned to both a workgroup and an individual owner within the group.
*Contract or default contract: Contract cases require specifying the contract on entry, and standalone cases require specification of the customer and the customer&rsquo;s case class, which determines the default contract.
*Timing information: The person working on the case can enter an estimate of the time to be spent on the case. Actual hours spent (broken down into work hours, overtime hours, billable work hours, and billable overtime hours) can be recorded later.
*Severity and priority: The severity assigned to the case may also relate to a time requirement—the reaction time and service level agreements defined by the case class. Generally, priorities are used to escalate the processing of the cases. If you assign a color code to each priority level, the cases will be displayed on the user dashboard highlighted according to their priorities.
*Related cases and relations: A case might have other related cases. It might also have employees and customers assigned who take part in making decisions concerning the case.

As a rule, each case will go through multiple stages, which might include the following: [anchor|#ul_lyb_k23_vm]
*Case creation by users responsible for case entry.
*Assignment (either manually or through assignment rules) to a specific workgroup and a user within it.
*Creation, by the user to whom the case is assigned, of tasks, events, and other activities that the user or others must complete.
*Approval of the case&rsquo;s resolution through the company&rsquo;s internal processes, if applicable.
*Escalation of the case if it is overdue. Escalation makes the case visible to workgroups higher in the company tree.
*Release of the case activities, the case itself, or both.
*Billing of the cases or contracts. Standalone cases are billed once they&rsquo;re released, while contract cases are billed in bulk once it&rsquo;s time to issue an invoice for the contract.
*Closing of the case, which occurs after it is billed.

To change the status of a case, you click the corresponding action button on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_00|Cases] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306000|CR306000]) form; the system opens the '''Details''' dialog box so you can provide the details to be used for the change. A case status reflects where the case is within its processing cycle. If users consistently and appropriately use statuses, you can get meaningful statistics on cases when you generate performance reports and inquiries. {br}

Out of the box, the following statuses are available for a case:[anchor|#ul_vyb_k23_vm]
*''New'': The case is new. A case with this status can have the ''Unassigned'' or ''Opened on Portal'' value in the '''Reason''' box.
*''Open'': The case is open. A case with this status can have the following values in the '''Reason''' box: ''In Process'', ''Updated'', ''In Escalation'', or ''Pending Closure''.
*''Pending Customer'': The case waits for feedback from customer. A case with this status can have the following values in the '''Reason''' box: ''More Info Requested'', ''Waiting Confirmation'', or ''Pending Closure''.
*''Closed'': The case is finally closed. A case with this status can have the following values in the '''Reason''' box: ''Resolved'', ''Rejected'', ''Canceled'', ''Abandoned'', or ''Duplicate''.

==Billing==
Cases are billed in accordance with the specific contract or the default contract associated with the case class. Activities can be billable or not billable; this should be specified for the case class using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_60_00|Case Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR206000|CR206000]) form. {br}

See [HelpRoot_CRM\CR__con_Case_Billing|Case Billing] for more details. 
==Related Cases==
A case may be related to other cases. For example, a case might be set so it cannot be resolved until another case, known as a &ldquo;blocker&ldquo; case, is resolved. Note, though, that the relations between cases are intended only for informational purposes and are not enforced on the system level.{br}

On the '''Related Cases''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_00|Cases] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306000|CR306000]) form you can specify the relations between cases. There are four types of relations between cases:[anchor|#ul_yyb_k23_vm]
*'''Blocks''': The case blocks the current case. In other words, the current case cannot be closed before the related blocker case.
*'''Depends On''': The case depends on the current case. In other words, the current case depends on the case and can, but may not, be closed before closing the case.
*'''Related''': There is a &ldquo;peer&ldquo; relation between the case with this relation and the current case.
*'''Duplicate Of''': The current case is a replica of the case with this relation.

In Acumatica ERP, users involved in case processing can create and track billable activities of various types, such as phone calls, emails, and notes. Then customers can be billed for the time that employees spent on case processing, based on the released activities associated with the case. Note that activities that are also associated with project tasks may have to be approved before they can be released.{br}{TOC}
==Case Billing Settings==
Whether and how a case should be billed depends on the settings of the case class that this case belongs to. Case classes are configured on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_60_00|Case Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR206000|CR206000]) form.{br}

 In Acumatica ERP, only cases marked as billable can be billed. (A case is billable if the '''Billable''' check box is selected for it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_00|Cases] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306000|CR306000]) form.) You can configure a case class so that all newly created cases of this class are marked as billable by default. {br}

 Acumatica ERP supports two modes of case billing: ''per case'' and ''per activity''. You can select the appropriate mode for a specific case class in the '''Billing Mode''' drop-down list, which is available only if the ''Time Reporting on Activity'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form (if the feature is disabled, the ''per case'' billing mode is automatically assigned to every new case class). Also, for a case class, you can specify specific labor items that will be used as sources of General Ledger accounts to be used for transactions; for details, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__con_Labor_Items|Non-Stock Item: Labor Items].{br}

For a case whose class has the ''per case'' billing mode:[anchor|#ul_l4p_4k4_jm]
*You can bill only if the case is closed. If any activity related to the case has not been completed yet (and approved, if approval is required), you cannot release the case.
*You can release such cases for billing either one at a time from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_00|Cases] form or in batches from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_50_70_00|Release Cases] ([~/?ScreenId=CR507000|CR507000]) form.
*The invoice total includes the total number of billable hours that have been reported for the activities associated with this case. However, you can manually override this number on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_00|Cases] form (if the ''Time Reporting on Activity'' feature is disabled, this is the only way you can report time spent on a case); in this case, the customer is billed based on the time that you specify.

*The case cannot be marked as billable, and it cannot be released for billing. You can release only related activities from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_70_20|Release Time Activities] ([~/?ScreenId=EP507020|EP507020]) form. See the sections below for more information on billable activities. 
*The case should always be associated with a contract so that related activities can be billed according to the costs defined by this contract.

==Billable Case Activities==
A case is usually billed on the basis of activities that are associated with this case and marked as billable. If there are any tasks or events associated with the case, then the activities related to these tasks and events are billed as activities related to the case.{br}

Activities must be completed and approved (if required) before they can be released. For each billable activity, its owner should register the time spent on it and specify the billable time.
==Case Activity Billing==
Each activity should be assigned to an owner—that is, an employee who will take all necessary actions to complete the activity. You can release a completed and approved (if required) activity for billing in one of the following ways:[anchor|#ul_opd_fv4_jm]
*By releasing a time card on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_50_10|Release Time Cards] ([~/?ScreenId=EP505010|EP505010]) form if the owner of the activity uses time cards.
*By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_70_20|Release Time Activities] ([~/?ScreenId=EP507020|EP507020]) form.
*By releasing the related case if it is billed on a ''per-case'' basis.

When a contract-related case is released for billing, the contract usage data is updated. You can view the resulting data on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CT_30_30_00|Contract Usage] ([~/?ScreenId=CT303000|CT303000]) form. For more information on how contract-related cases are billed, see [HelpRoot_ContractManagement\AR__con_Contract_Billing|Contract Billing].{br}

To view the invoices that were generated during direct billing, use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form. {br}

Also, a project transaction may be created during direct billing if any of the case activities is associated with a project. (Alternatively, the same project transaction may be generated during the release of the time card that includes the case activity, if the time card is released before the case is billed. For details about time card release, see [HelpRoot_Organization\EP__con_Time_Sheet_Processing|Time Cards].) Such project transactions can be used for tracking the project costs. (For more information about project cost tracking, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__con_Budget_Tracking|Project Budgets].){br}

You can also view the data on the resulting customer transactions by using the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\AR_65_20_00|Customer History] ([~/?ScreenId=AR652000|AR652000]) report.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Case Billing In  Acumatica ERP, users involved in case processing can create and track billable activities of 				various types, such as phone calls, emails, and notes. Then customers can be billed 				for the time that employees spent on case processing, based on the released 				activities associated with the case. Note that activities that are also associated 				with project tasks may have to be approved before they can be released. Case Billing Settings Whether and how a case should be billed depends on the settings of the case class 				that this case belongs to. Case classes are configured on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR206000|CR206000]) Case Classes (CR206000) form.  In  Acumatica ERP, only cases marked as billable can be billed. (A case is billable if the 					 Billable  check box is selected for it on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR306000|CR306000]) Cases (CR306000) form.) You can configure a 				case class so that all newly created cases of this class are marked as billable by 				default.   Acumatica ERP supports two modes of case billing:  per case  and  per activity . You 				can select the appropriate mode for a specific case class in the  Billing Mode  				drop-down list, which is available only if the  Time Reporting on Activity  				feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form (if the 				feature is disabled, the  per case  billing mode is automatically assigned to 				every new case class). Also, for a case class, you can specify specific labor items 				that will be used as sources of General Ledger accounts to be used for transactions; 				for details, see  Non-Stock Item: Labor Items. For a case whose class has the  per case  billing mode: You can bill only if the case is closed. If any activity related to the case has 					not been completed yet (and approved, if approval is required), you cannot 					release the case. You can release such cases for billing either one at a time from the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR306000|CR306000]) Cases form or in batches from the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR507000|CR507000]) Release Cases (CR507000) form. The invoice total includes the total number of billable hours that have been 					reported for the activities associated with this case. However, you can manually 					override this number on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR306000|CR306000]) Cases form (if the  Time 						Reporting on Activity  feature is disabled, this is the only way you can 					report time spent on a case); in this case, the customer is billed based on the 					time that you specify. If the case is associated with a contract, you can enable case counting in the 						 Case Billing Settings  section 						( Summary  tab) on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CT202000|CT202000]) Contract Templates 					(CT202000) form. With case counting, you can bill your customer only for the 					number of cases associated with the contract. The billable hours reported for 					the case will also be billed. You can use direct billing, which means that the customer associated with the 					case is invoiced directly without any contract involved.

By using the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP507020|EP507020]) Release Time Activities (EP507020) form. By releasing the related case if it is billed on a  per-case  basis.

The steps below describe how to create a billable activity associated with a lead record; for other types of records, the procedure is the same other than the form you navigate to in Step 1. 
==Before You Proceed==
The ''Time Reporting on Activity'' feature must be enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form; otherwise, you will not be able to track time spent on an activity and bill the customer based on this time.{br}

You should also make sure that appropriate activity types and earning types are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_10_20_00|Activity Types] ([~/?ScreenId=CR102000|CR102000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_10_20_00|Earning Types] ([~/?ScreenId=EP102000|EP102000]) forms, respectively.{br}

Finally, if you want to associate activities with certain projects and project tasks, make sure that the ''Project Accounting'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form; if the feature is disabled, the system will use the non-project code by default, and you will skip Steps 15 and 16 of the procedure.

The ''Leads BI (CR3010BI)'' inquiry form, based on the ''Leads BI'' generic inquiry, displays lead acquisition and lead processing metrics that marketing managers and sales representatives can use, as described in the following sections.
==Reviewing the Efficiency of Lead Generation Channels==
You can find the information about your team&rsquo;s new leads added to the system over a period of time and about the existing leads on the '''Lead Analysis''' tab of the ''Leads BI (CR3010BI)'' inquiry form. The '''Lead Analysis''' tab contains a pivot table that provides an overview of the lead generation pipeline, including the following details:[anchor|#_fa7eba7f-38c4-4774-9dfb-e70989b8ddb5]
*The number of leads that have been acquired over a period of time
*The sources of the leads
*The number of leads in the pipeline
*The statuses of the leads
*The owners of the leads

With this information, you can monitor your team&rsquo;s operational efficiency, view the top leads by country, source, or marketing campaign, and distribute the workload across your team more efficiently.
==Monitoring Outgoing Activities with Leads Over a Period of Time==
You can find the information about your team&rsquo;s outgoing activities with leads over a period of time on the '''Lead Activity Analysis''' tab of the ''Leads BI (CR3010BI)'' inquiry form. The '''Lead Activity Analysis''' tab contains a pivot table that provides the following details:[anchor|#_5586bdc2-2a70-4227-bb57-a9c37f56bc03]
*The last period of outgoing activity
*The owners of the leads
*The dates of the last outgoing activities
*The statuses of the leads
*The source marketing campaigns

The system calculates the values, showing lead processing metrics, that are displayed in the '''Last Activity Aging''' column on the '''Lead Activity Analysis''' tab:[anchor|#_5ced6675-4beb-475b-b3d6-9074cd11ed11]
