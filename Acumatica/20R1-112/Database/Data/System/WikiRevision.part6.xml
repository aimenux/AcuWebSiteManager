 Acumatica ERP provides a solution to automate basic warehouse operations, such as the picking, packaging, receiving, putting away, transferring, and counting of items. This functionality and the related forms become available if the ''Warehouse Management'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

In this topic, you will read about the automation of warehouse operations in Acumatica ERP and in the Acumatica mobile app.{br}{TOC}
==Supported Warehouse Operations==
You can automate the following warehouse operations by using a barcode scanner or a mobile device with barcode scanning support:[anchor|#ul_wdj_x5j_ygb]
*Picking and packing the items for a particular shipment
*Processing picking of shipments in a wave
*Processing picking of shipments in a batch
*Receiving items based on a purchase receipt defined in the system and putting away the received items to storage locations
*Issuing items from a warehouse
*Transferring items within a warehouse
*Receiving items in a warehouse
*Counting items within the physical inventory

You can configure the workflow for each group of related operations to correspond to the business processes of your organization. For example, for shipping items, you can configure the workflow so that users can use only Pick mode, Pack mode, or Ship mode, or they can use these modes in any combination. As another example, for receiving items with a purchase order, you can configure the workflow so that users can use either Receive mode or Put Away mode, or they can use both modes in one workflow.
==Special Commands for Scanning==
When you work in any of the modes, you can use special commands to quickly switch to another mode or to perform an action in the current mode. You can scan a barcode of the command or type the command in the '''Scan''' box of a processing form. For the list of commands, see [HelpRoot_WMS\WMS_Commands_List|Working Modes and Supported Commands].[anchor|#section_fy2_pbm_zgb]
==Working Modes==
The forms you use for automated warehouse operations, and the corresponding screens you use in the Acumatica mobile app, provide both ''working modes'' and ''service modes''. Working modes are modes that correspond to key operations you perform while using the form. {br}

Some forms that support the automation of warehouse operations, such as [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]), have multiple working modes. Each mode of a form, which corresponds to the operation you are currently performing, shows different content and supports a different set of actions. Other forms, such as [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_40_20|Scan and Transfer] ([~/?ScreenId=IN304020|IN304020]), have only one working mode, so that you can perform only a particular operation by using this form.{br}

While you are performing warehouse operations, you can change the working mode on the current form or navigate from the current form to another form by entering special commands (or by scanning special barcodes) starting with @. On the forms related to automated warehouse operations, you type the command or barcode into the '''Scan''' box and press Enter. For example, if you enter <tt>@pack</tt> in the '''Scan''' box or scan it, the system navigates to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) form (or the corresponding screen in the mobile app) in Pack mode. When you change the mode of a form, the system keeps the current document selected. For example, if you have entered the shipment number in Pick mode and have entered the command (or have scanned the barcode) to switch to Pack mode, the system keeps the current shipment selected.
==Service Modes==
Service modes are modes that correspond to secondary operations you may perform, such as removing document lines. On each form related to automated warehouse operations, you can activate any of the following service modes:[anchor|#ul_w3x_t2f_zgb]
*Quantity Editing: In this mode, you can change the quantity of the item in the selected line. You activate the mode by scanning the <tt>&#42;qty</tt> barcode or by clicking '''Set Qty''' on the form toolbar.
*Remove: In this mode, you can remove the selected document line or a specific quantity of the inventory item from the current document. You activate the mode by scanning the <tt>&#42;remove</tt> barcode or by clicking '''Remove''' on the form toolbar.

==Support of Automatic and Manual Packaging==
If the ''Automatic Packaging'' feature is disabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, while you are performing picking and packing operations on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) form, you specify the packaging options for the order manually.{br}

If the ''Automatic Packaging'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form, when you process a shipment in Pick mode, all boxes in the shipment are selected and confirmed, and the box weight is specified automatically. If a single box was automatically specified for a shipment while you picked the items, then in Pack mode, the system automatically specifies the packaging details and confirms the box. Shipments for which multiple boxes were assigned cannot be packed automatically; you have to manually specify the packaging details and confirm the boxes. For a description of the picking and packing processes, see [HelpRoot_WMS\WMS_Pick_Pack_GeneralInfo|Picking and Packing Operations: General Information] and [HelpRoot_WMS\WMS_Pack_GeneralInfo|Packing Operations: General Information].]]></column>

Working Modes The forms you use for automated warehouse operations, and the corresponding screens you use         in the  Acumatica  mobile app, provide both  working modes  and            service modes . Working modes are modes that correspond to key operations you         perform while using the form.  Some forms that support the automation of warehouse operations, such as   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) Pick, Pack, and Ship (SO302020), have multiple working modes. Each mode         of a form, which corresponds to the operation you are currently performing, shows different         content and supports a different set of actions. Other forms, such as   ([~/?ScreenId=IN304020|IN304020]) Scan and Transfer (IN304020), have only one working mode, so that you can perform         only a particular operation by using this form. While you are performing warehouse operations, you can change the working mode on the         current form or navigate from the current form to another form by entering special commands         (or by scanning special barcodes) starting with @. On the forms related to automated         warehouse operations, you type the command or barcode into the  Scan          box and press Enter. For example, if you enter  @pack  in the            Scan  box or scan it, the system navigates to the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) Pick, Pack, and Ship (SO302020) form (or the corresponding screen in the         mobile app) in Pack mode. When you change the mode of a form, the system keeps the current         document selected. For example, if you have entered the shipment number in Pick mode and         have entered the command (or have scanned the barcode) to switch to Pack mode, the system         keeps the current shipment selected. Service Modes Service modes are modes that correspond to secondary operations you may perform, such as         removing document lines. On each form related to automated warehouse operations, you can         activate any of the following service modes: Quantity Editing: In this mode, you can change the quantity of the item in the selected           line. You activate the mode by scanning the  *qty  barcode or by           clicking  Set Qty  on the form toolbar. Remove: In this mode, you can remove the selected document line or a specific quantity           of the inventory item from the current document. You activate the mode by scanning the              *remove  barcode or by clicking  Remove  on           the form toolbar. Support of Automatic and Manual Packaging If the  Automatic Packaging  feature is disabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, while you are performing picking and packing operations on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) Pick, Pack, and Ship (SO302020) form, you specify the packaging options for the order         manually. If the  Automatic Packaging  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features         form, when you process a shipment in Pick mode, all boxes in the shipment are selected and         confirmed, and the box weight is specified automatically. If a single box was automatically         specified for a shipment while you picked the items, then in Pack mode, the system         automatically specifies the packaging details and confirms the box. Shipments for which         multiple boxes were assigned cannot be packed automatically; you have to manually specify         the packaging details and confirm the boxes.

In this topic, you will read about the workflow for the automated transfer of inventory items in Acumatica ERP. The workflow in this topic is based on the assumption that your system has the recommended configuration described in [HelpRoot_WMS\WMS_Scan_and_Transfer_Implem_Checklist|Processing of Transfers: Implementation Checklist].{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to process single-step transfers of items between warehouse locations by using the functionality of automated warehouse operations. In particular, you will do the following:[anchor|#_c2ffc5a6-2368-4dcd-9e7a-36bfbe90f1fd]
*Enable the needed system features
*Learn the recommended settings that you can specify to make the system fit your business requirements
*Process a transfer of items between locations of the same warehouse in automated mode

==Applicable Scenarios==
You process single-step transfers when you need to move items from one location to another location within the same warehouse or between locations of different warehouses that are assigned to the same building by using a barcode scanner or a mobile device with a scanning option and to track this movement in the system.
==Workflow for the Automated Scanning and Transferring of Items==
The automated processing of transferring inventory items involves the steps shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#image_ywm_md4_zgb][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_WMS_Scan_Transfer.png|popup|400px]
To transfer items (and use Scan and Transfer mode), you perform the following steps:[anchor|#ol_j4r_xf4_xgb]
#''Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_40_20|Scan and Transfer] ([~/?ScreenId=IN304020|IN304020]) form''.
#:You open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_40_20|Scan and Transfer] form (or the corresponding screen in the Acumatica mobile app) to start processing a transfer.
#''Scan the origin location barcode''.
#:You scan the barcode of the origin location (that is, the location where the item to be transferred is currently being stored).
#Optional: ''Scan the origin warehouse barcode''.
#:If the location whose identifier you scanned in the previous step is assigned to multiple warehouses, you scan the origin warehouse barcode. The system inserts the warehouse ID in the '''Warehouse''' box.
#''Scan the destination location barcode''.
#:You scan the barcode of the destination location (that is, the location to which you are transferring items).
#Optional: ''Scan the destination warehouse barcode''.
#:If the location whose identifier you scanned in the previous step is assigned to multiple warehouses, you scan the destination warehouse barcode. The system inserts the warehouse ID in the '''To Warehouse''' box. ((({S:Warn}If the destination warehouse differs from the origin warehouse and the warehouses are assigned to different buildings (or the building is not specified in the settings of either of the warehouses), the system displays an error message, and the transfer cannot be performed.
)))
#''Scan the item barcode''.
#:You scan the barcode of the item to be transferred.
#Optional: ''Scan the item quantity''.
#:To change the transferred quantity in the line that is currently being processed, you switch to Quantity Editing mode by scanning or entering the <tt>&#42;qty</tt> barcode or by clicking '''Set Qty''' on the form toolbar; you then manually enter the quantity in the base unit of measure.
#Optional: ''Scan the barcode of the next item to be transferred between the selected locations''.
#:If another item must be transferred between the currently selected locations, you scan the barcode of the next item (return to Step 6) and repeat the process for the next item.
#Optional: ''Scan the barcode of the next origin location''.
#:If items must be transferred between another locations, you scan the barcode of the next origin location (return to Step 2) and repeat the process.
#''Release the inventory transfer''.
#:When you have finished issuing items, you scan the barcode of the <tt>&#42;release&#42;transfer</tt> command or click '''Release''' on the form toolbar. The system releases the inventory transfer.

Workflow for the Automated Scanning and Transferring of Items The automated processing of transferring inventory items involves the steps shown in the         following diagram. To transfer items (and use Scan and Transfer mode), you perform the following steps: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN304020|IN304020]) Scan and Transfer (IN304020) form . You open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN304020|IN304020]) Scan and Transfer form (or the corresponding screen in the  Acumatica  mobile app) to start processing a transfer. Scan the origin location barcode . You scan the barcode of the origin location             (that is, the location where the item to be transferred is currently being           stored). Optional:  Scan the origin warehouse barcode . If the location whose identifier             you scanned in the previous step is assigned to multiple warehouses, you scan the origin             warehouse barcode. The system inserts the warehouse ID in the                Warehouse  box. Scan the destination location barcode . You scan the barcode of the destination             location (that is, the location to which you are transferring items). Optional:  Scan the destination warehouse barcode . If the location whose             identifier you scanned in the previous step is assigned to multiple warehouses, you scan             the destination warehouse barcode. The system inserts the warehouse ID in the                To Warehouse  box.  If the destination warehouse differs               from the origin warehouse and the warehouses are assigned to different buildings (or               the building is not specified in the settings of either of the warehouses), the system               displays an error message, and the transfer cannot be performed. Scan the item barcode . You scan the barcode of the item to be           transferred. Optional:  Scan the item quantity . To change the transferred quantity in the             line that is currently being processed, you switch to Quantity Editing mode by scanning             or entering the  *qty  barcode or by clicking  Set               Qty  on the form toolbar; you then manually enter the quantity in the base             unit of measure. Optional:  Scan the barcode of the next item to be transferred between the selected             locations . If another item must be transferred between the currently selected             locations, you scan the barcode of the next item (return to Step 6) and repeat the             process for the next item. Optional:  Scan the barcode of the next origin location . If items must be             transferred between another locations, you scan the barcode of the next origin location             (return to Step 2) and repeat the process. Release the inventory transfer . When you have finished issuing items, you scan             the barcode of the  *release*transfer  command or click                Release  on the form toolbar.

)))
==Story==
Suppose that you, as a warehouse worker of the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company, have a task to transfer all jam jars from one location of the wholesale warehouse to another, which will clear the origin location for a new batch of jam.{br}

You will prepare the single-step transfer to reflect the movement of jam jars between the warehouse locations.
==Configuration Overview==
In the ''U100'' dataset, the following features have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, where they are in the ''Inventory and Order Management'' group of features:[anchor|#ul_wqn_zy2_3fb]
*''Multiple Warehouse Locations''
* ''Warehouse Management''
* ''Inventory Operations''

The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in the system:[anchor|#ul_ghb_r2d_pfb]
*A warehouse on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form: ''WHOLESALE''.
*The following warehouse locations on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] form: ''L3R3S1'', ''L2R3S1'', and ''WRITEOFF''.
*The following stock items on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form: ''APJAM96'', ''ORJAM96'', and ''LEMJAM96''. For each stock item, barcodes have been specified on the '''Cross-Reference''' tab of the form.

==Process Overview==
In this activity, as you process transferring items between warehouses by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_40_20|Scan and Transfer] ([~/?ScreenId=IN304020|IN304020]) form, you will enter barcodes of the origin and destination locations, the items, and their quantities. You will also remove the entire or partial quantity of items from the document, and scan barcodes of other origin and destination locations and items to be moved between these locations. When all items that must be transferred have been added to the document, you will release the transfer.[anchor|#_57da945e-8606-4b74-a1af-b4f536ef96ff]((({S:Warn}In any working mode, you enter a command or barcode by typing it in the '''Scan''' box and pressing Enter. In production systems, you will scan the appropriate barcodes rather than manually entering them.
)))
==System Preparation==
Before you start processing transfers between warehouse locations, you need to launch the Acumatica ERP website and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded. To sign in as a warehouse worker, use the ''perkins'' login and the ''123'' password.
==Step 1: Creating a Transfer==
Suppose that the ''L3R3S1'' location contains one 96-ounce jar of apple jam, one 96-ounce jar of lemon jam, and two 96-ounce jars of orange jam. To create a single-step transfer that will register the movement of these items from the ''L3R3S1'' location to the ''L2R3S1'' location of the ''WHOLESALE'' warehouse, do the following:[anchor|#_4f35f2a1-2af2-4ad8-b372-f43b83cfeda4]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_90_10|Storage Summary] ([~/?ScreenId=IN409010|IN409010]) form, specify ''WHOLESALE'' as the '''Warehouse ID''' and ''L3R3S1'' as the '''Storage ID'''. In the table, notice that the location contains one jar of ''APJAM96'', one jar of ''LEMJAM96'', and two jars of ''ORJAM96''.
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_40_20|Scan and Transfer] ([~/?ScreenId=IN304020|IN304020]) form.
#In the '''Scan''' box of the Summary area, enter<tt>L3R3S1</tt> as the origin location. 
#Enter <tt>L2R3S1</tt> as the destination location.
#Enter <tt>AJ96</tt> as the first item to be transferred. The system adds a line with one unit of the item to the table on the '''Transfer''' tab.
#Enter <tt>LJ96</tt> as the next item to be transferred. The system adds a line with one unit of the item to the table on the '''Transfer''' tab.
#Enter <tt>OJ96</tt> as the last item to be transferred. The system adds a line with one unit of the item to the table on the '''Transfer''' tab.
#Set the quantity of the last entered item to <tt>2</tt> as follows:
##On the form toolbar, click '''Set Qty'''. The system prompts you to enter the item quantity.
##In the '''Scan''' box, enter <tt>2</tt>.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''. The system creates the transfer with the data you have entered. (Notice that it has inserted the transfer number in the '''Reference Nbr.''' box of the Summary area.)

You have created the inventory transfer for moving ''APJAM96'', ''LEMJAM96'', and ''ORJAM96'' between the ''L3R3S1'' and ''L2R3S1'' locations.
==Step 2: Removing Items from the Transfer==
Suppose that while you were moving jars of ''ORJAM96'' between the locations, you noticed that the lid of one of the jars had been dented. The warehouse manager asked you to move this jar to the warehouse location for items to be written off (indicated as ''WRITEOFF'' in the system). To remove one jar of orange jam from the inventory transfer, do the following:[anchor|#_00af4e49-d6ab-4cdc-bb9a-0bc2877aa3e5]
#While you are still viewing the transfer on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_40_20|Scan and Transfer] ([~/?ScreenId=IN304020|IN304020]) form, on the form toolbar, click '''Remove''' to switch to Remove mode.
#In the '''Scan''' box, enter <tt>L3R3S1</tt> as the origin location.
#Enter <tt>L2R3S1</tt> as the destination location.
#Enter <tt>OJ96</tt> as the item to be removed from the transfer. On the '''Transfer''' tab, the system decreases the value of the '''Quantity''' column in the line with the ''ORJAM96'' item by 1.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

You have removed one unit of the ''ORJAM96'' item from the transfer. Now you need to add another line to the transfer to reflect the movement of the jar to the ''WRITEOFF'' location.
==Step 3: Adding Items to Be Transferred Between Other Locations==
To add to the same transfer the line that reflects the movement of one jar of ''ORJAM96'' from the ''L3R3S1'' location to the ''WRITEOFF'' location, do the following:[anchor|#_afc0655f-ea1d-49ae-a518-5798d7df994e]
#While you are still viewing the transfer on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_40_20|Scan and Transfer] ([~/?ScreenId=IN304020|IN304020]) form, in the '''Scan''' box, enter <tt>L3R3S1</tt> as the origin location.
#Enter <tt>WRITEOFF</tt> as the destination location.
#Enter <tt>OJ96</tt> to indicate the item to be transferred. The system adds the line with one unit of the item to the table on the '''Transfer''' tab.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

You have added another line to the transfer.
==Step 4: Reviewing and Releasing the Transfer==
Now that you have added all required items to the transfer, you can release the transfer. Do the following:[anchor|#_65cd3ccf-8511-4a70-8560-70330cb14c5c]
#While you are still viewing the transfer on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_40_20|Scan and Transfer] ([~/?ScreenId=IN304020|IN304020]) form, review the lines that have been added to the table on the '''Transfer''' tab. They should have the settings indicated in the following table.
#:{| class="checklist" | width="100%"

#On the form toolbar, click '''Release'''. The system releases the transfer.
#Click the Edit button next to the '''Reference Nbr.''' box, and on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_40_00|Transfers] ([~/?ScreenId=IN304000|IN304000]) form that opens, review the inventory transfer transaction. Make sure it includes the needed lines and is assigned the ''Released'' status, as shown in the screenshot below.[anchor|#_c473aaaa-6633-46c4-8669-72c9d4285b9b][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_WMS_Scan_and_Transfer.png|popup|Inventory transfer transaction|450px]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_90_10|Storage Summary] ([~/?ScreenId=IN409010|IN409010]) form, make sure ''WHOLESALE'' is specified as the '''Warehouse ID''' and ''L3R3S1'' is specified as the '''Storage ID'''. Review the table which must contain no lines which indicates that you have successfully moved all items from the location.

The following activity is based on the                  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system settings             have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the activity             and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100  dataset             to its initial state.

For each                     stock item, barcodes have been specified on the                          Cross-Reference  tab of the form. Process Overview In this activity, as you process transferring items between warehouses by using the                       ([~/?ScreenId=IN304020|IN304020]) Scan and Transfer (IN304020) form, you will enter barcodes of the                 origin and destination locations, the items, and their quantities. You will also                 remove the entire or partial quantity of items from the document, and scan barcodes                 of other origin and destination locations and items to be moved between these                 locations. When all items that must be transferred have been added to the document,                 you will release the transfer. In any working mode, you enter a command or barcode             by typing it in the  Scan  box and pressing Enter. In production             systems, you will scan the appropriate barcodes rather than manually entering             them. System Preparation Before you start processing transfers between warehouse locations, you need to launch                 the  Acumatica ERP website and sign in to a company with the  U100  dataset preloaded. To sign                 in as a warehouse worker, use the  perkins  login and the  123                  password. Step 1: Creating a Transfer Suppose that the  L3R3S1  location contains one                  96-ounce                  jar of                  apple                 jam , one                  96-ounce                  jar                 of  lemon                 jam , and two                  96-ounce                  jars of                  orange                 jam . To create a single-step transfer that will register the                 movement of these items from the  L3R3S1  location to the  L2R3S1                  location of the  WHOLESALE  warehouse, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN409010|IN409010]) Storage Summary (IN409010) form, specify  WHOLESALE                      as the  Warehouse ID  and  L3R3S1  as the                          Storage ID . In the table, notice that the location                     contains one jar of  APJAM96 , one jar of  LEMJAM96 , and two jars of                          ORJAM96 . Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN304020|IN304020]) Scan and Transfer (IN304020) form. In the  Scan  box of the Summary area,  enter L3R3S1  as the origin location.  Enter  L2R3S1  as the destination location. Enter  AJ96  as the first item to be transferred. The                     system adds a line with one unit of the item to the table on the                          Transfer  tab. Enter  LJ96  as the next item to be transferred. The system                     adds a line with one unit of the item to the table on the                          Transfer  tab. Enter  OJ96  as the last item to be transferred. The system                     adds a line with one unit of the item to the table on the                          Transfer  tab. Set the quantity of the                      last entered                      item to                          2                      as follows: On the form toolbar, click  Set Qty . The system                             prompts you to enter the item quantity. In the  Scan  box, enter                              2 . On the form toolbar, click  Save . The system creates the                     transfer with the data you have entered. (Notice that it has inserted the                     transfer number in the  Reference Nbr.  box of the Summary                     area.) You have created the inventory transfer for moving  APJAM96 ,  LEMJAM96 ,                 and  ORJAM96  between the  L3R3S1  and  L2R3S1  locations. Step 2: Removing Items from the Transfer Suppose that while you were moving jars of  ORJAM96  between the locations, you                 noticed that the lid of one of the jars had been dented. The warehouse manager asked                 you to move this jar to the warehouse location for items to be written off                 (indicated as  WRITEOFF  in the system). To remove one jar of                  orange                 jam  from the inventory transfer, do the following: While you are                      still                     viewing the transfer  on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN304020|IN304020]) Scan and Transfer                     (IN304020) form, on the form toolbar, click  Remove  to                     switch to Remove mode. In the  Scan  box, enter  L3R3S1  as                     the origin location. Enter  L2R3S1  as the destination location. Enter  OJ96  as the item to be removed from the transfer.                     On the  Transfer  tab, the system decreases the value of                     the  Quantity  column in the line with the  ORJAM96                      item by 1. On the form toolbar, click  Save . You have removed one unit of the  ORJAM96  item from the transfer. Now you need                 to add another line to the transfer to reflect the movement of the jar to the                      WRITEOFF  location. Step 3: Adding Items to Be Transferred Between Other Locations To add to the same transfer the line that reflects the movement of one jar of                      ORJAM96  from the  L3R3S1  location to the  WRITEOFF  location,                 do the following: While you are still viewing the transfer on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN304020|IN304020]) Scan and Transfer                     (IN304020) form, in the  Scan  box, enter                          L3R3S1  as the origin location. Enter  WRITEOFF  as the destination location. Enter  OJ96  to indicate the item to be transferred. The                     system adds the line with one unit of the item to the table on the                          Transfer  tab. On the form toolbar, click  Save . You have added another line to the transfer. Step 4: Reviewing and Releasing the Transfer Now that you have added all required items to the transfer, you can release the                 transfer. Do the following: While you are still viewing the transfer on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN304020|IN304020]) Scan and Transfer                     (IN304020) form, review the lines that have been added to the table on the                          Transfer  tab.

The automated processing of counting inventory items involves the steps shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#fig_iwh_zzn_zgb][anchor|#image_jwh_zzn_zgb][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_WMS_Scan_Count.png|popup|400px]
To count inventory items (and use Scan and Count mode), you perform the following steps:[anchor|#ol_cz1_5pn_xgb]
#''Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_20|Scan and Count] ([~/?ScreenId=IN305020|IN305020]) form''.
#:You open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_20|Scan and Count] form (or the corresponding screen in the Acumatica mobile app) to start the counting process.
#''Scan the document number''
#:To start the automated counting, you scan the reference number of the physical inventory document. The lines of the scanned document are shown in the table. The reference number of the document selected for processing is displayed in the '''Reference Nbr.''' box.
#''Scan the location barcode''.
#:You scan the barcode of the location where the items to be counted are stored. All items that you scan after scanning the location barcode will be assigned to this location.
#''Scan the item barcode''.
#:When you scan the barcode of the item, the system changes the status of the line for this item to ''Entered''. 
#Optional: ''Scan the item quantity''.
#:To change the counted quantity in the line that is currently being processed, you switch to Quantity Editing mode by scanning or entering the <tt>&#42;qty</tt> barcode or by clicking '''Set Qty''' on the form toolbar; you then manually enter the quantity in the UOM coded in the scanned item barcode.
#Optional: ''Scan the barcode of the next item in the same location''.
#:If you have more items to count in the same location, you scan the barcode of the next item (return to Step 4) and repeat the process for the item.
#Optional: ''Scan the barcode of the next location''.
#:If items in another location must be counted, you return to scanning the warehouse location (return to Step 3) and repeat the process for the items in this location.
#''Confirm the counted quantities''.

)))
==Story==
Suppose that you are a warehouse worker and you are assigned to perform a physical inventory count by entering barcodes of the stock items and locations. You will count the quantities of orange jam in particular warehouse locations added to the physical inventory document, which your manager has provided to you.
==Configuration Overview==
In the ''U100'' dataset, the following features have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, where they are in the ''Inventory and Order Management'' group of features:[anchor|#ul_wqn_zy2_3fb]
*''Multiple Warehouse Locations''
* ''Advanced Physical Count''
* ''Warehouse Management''
* ''Inventory Operations''

The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in the system:[anchor|#ul_ghb_r2d_pfb]
*A warehouse on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form: ''WHOLESALE''.
*The following warehouse locations on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] form: ''L1R3S1'', ''L1R3S2'', and ''L1R3S3''.
*The following stock items on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form: ''ORJAM08'', ''ORJAM32'', and ''ORJAM96''. For each stock item, barcodes have been specified on the '''Cross-Reference''' tab of the form.
*A physical inventory type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_89_00|Physical Inventory Types] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) form: ''ORJCNT''.

Also, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_40_00|Prepare Physical Count] ([~/?ScreenId=IN504000|IN504000]) form, the physical inventory document has been created, and it has the ''Counting in Progress'' status.
==Process Overview==
In this activity, as you count stock items during a physical inventory, you will use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_20|Scan and Count] ([~/?ScreenId=IN305020|IN305020]) form. You will scan the barcode of the physical inventory document and then scan a location barcode and the barcodes of each item you find in this location. You will correct the quantities of items and add extra lines for items that you find in a location. When you have counted all items in all locations added to the physical inventory document, you will confirm the document.[anchor|#_b810890d-8e24-46e3-8537-c8df32202a97]((({S:Warn}In any working mode, you enter a command or barcode by typing it in the '''Scan''' box and pressing Enter. In production systems, you will scan the appropriate barcodes rather than manually entering them.
)))
==System Preparation==
Before you start counting stock items, you need to launch the Acumatica ERP website and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded. To sign in as a warehouse worker, use the ''perkins'' login and the ''123'' password.
==Step 1: Entering the Counted Quantities of Items==
Suppose that you are starting to count orange jam in the locations listed in the physical inventory document. Do the following to enter the counted quantities in the system:[anchor|#_413e6468-bd51-440b-9ae6-03bd068f0e58]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_20|Scan and Count] ([~/?ScreenId=IN305020|IN305020]) form.
#In the '''Scan''' box, enter <tt>000001</tt> (which is the reference number of the physical inventory count). Notice that the list of items that you will count is displayed on the '''Count''' tab.
#Enter <tt>L1R3S1</tt> as the first location in which you are performing counting. 
#:Suppose that in this location, you find two boxes of orange jam in 8-ounce jars.
#Enter <tt>OJ08B</tt>, which is the barcode for a box of 10 jars of orange jam in 8-ounce jars. The system adds 10 units of the ''ORJAM08'' item to the row that corresponds to this item.
#Enter <tt>OJ08B</tt> again to add the second box. The system adds another 10 units to the first line, so the quantity is ''20''.
#:You have finished counting items in the ''L1R3S1'' location and can start counting items in the next location.
#Enter <tt>L1R3S2</tt>.
#:Suppose that in this location, you find three boxes of orange jam in 32-ounce jars.
#Enter <tt>OJ32B</tt>, which is the barcode for a box of 10 jars of orange jam in 32-ounce jars. The system adds 10 units of the ''ORJAM32'' item to the row that corresponds to this item.
#To enter two more boxes, do the following to set the quantity:
##On the form toolbar, click '''Set Qty'''.
##In the '''Scan''' box, enter <tt>3</tt>.
##:On the '''Count''' tab, the system changes the quantity of the ''ORJAM32'' item in the second line to ''30''.
#:You have finished counting items in the ''L1R3S2'' location and can start counting items in the next location.
#Enter <tt>L1R3S3</tt>.
#:Suppose that in this location, you find one box of orange jam in 96-ounce jars.
#Enter <tt>OJ96B</tt>, which is the barcode for a box of 10 jars of orange jam in 96-ounce jars. The system adds 10 units of the ''ORJAM96'' item to the row that corresponds to this item.
#:You have finished counting items in the ''L1R3S3'' location, which was the last location in your physical inventory document.

==Step 2: Correcting Quantities in the Physical Inventory Document==
Suppose that you have realized that you entered an extra box of ''ORJAM32'' item in the ''L1R3S2'' location by mistake (suppose, for instance, that you had intended to set the quantity of the boxes to 2 instead of 3), and now you need to correct the quantity in the document. Do the following:[anchor|#_4ddacac0-ef39-4238-9e12-3bb1581964d0]
#While you are still viewing the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_20|Scan and Count] ([~/?ScreenId=IN305020|IN305020]) form with the ''000001'' physical inventory document opened, on the form toolbar, click '''Remove''' to switch to Remove mode.
#Enter <tt>L1R3S2</tt>.
#Enter <tt>OJ32B</tt>. The system removes 10 units of the ''ORJAM32'' item from the row that corresponds to the item.

You have corrected the quantity of the ''ORJAM32'' item in the ''L1R3S2'' location.
==Step 3: Adding Extra Lines to the Physical Inventory Document==
Suppose that in the ''L1R3S3'' location, you have found one jar of the ''ORJAM08'' item, which is not in the physical inventory document. To add this item to the document, do the following:[anchor|#_e90e4125-9b03-4f3e-86b5-38f2f8330b98]
#While you are still viewing the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_20|Scan and Count] ([~/?ScreenId=IN305020|IN305020]) form with the ''000001'' physical inventory document opened, enter <tt>L1R3S3</tt>.
#Enter <tt>OJ08</tt>, which is the barcode of one 8-ounce jar of orange jam. The system adds a new row to the table with the ''L1R3S3'' location and one unit of the ''ORJAM08'' item.

You have added the extra item to the physical inventory document. Now you will review the counted quantities and confirm the entered data.

The following activity is based on the                  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system settings             have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the activity             and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100  dataset             to its initial state. Story Suppose that you are a warehouse worker and you are assigned to perform a physical                 inventory count by entering barcodes of the stock items and locations. You will                 count the quantities of orange jam in particular warehouse locations added to the                 physical inventory document, which your manager has provided to you. Configuration Overview In the  U100  dataset, the following features have been enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, where they are in the                      Inventory and Order Management  group of features: Multiple Warehouse Locations Advanced Physical Count Warehouse Management Inventory Operations The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in                 the system: A warehouse on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses (IN204000) form:                          WHOLESALE . The following warehouse locations on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses form:  L1R3S1 ,  L1R3S2 ,                     and  L1R3S3 . The following stock items on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items                     (IN202500) form:  ORJAM08 ,  ORJAM32 , and  ORJAM96 . For each                     stock item, barcodes have been specified on the                          Cross-Reference  tab of the form. A physical inventory type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) Physical Inventory Types (IN208900)                     form:  ORJCNT . Also, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN504000|IN504000]) Prepare Physical Count (IN504000) form, the physical inventory                 document has been created, and it has the  Counting in Progress  status. Process Overview In this activity, as you count stock items during a physical inventory, you will use                 the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305020|IN305020]) Scan and Count  (IN305020) form. You will scan the barcode of                 the physical inventory document and then scan a location barcode and the barcodes of                 each item you find in this location. You will correct the quantities of items and                 add extra lines for items that you find in a location. When you have counted all                 items in all locations added to the physical inventory document, you will confirm                 the document. In any working mode, you enter a command or barcode             by typing it in the  Scan  box and pressing Enter. In production             systems, you will scan the appropriate barcodes rather than manually entering             them. System Preparation Before you start counting stock items, you need to launch the  Acumatica ERP website and sign in to a company with the  U100  dataset preloaded. To sign                 in as a warehouse worker, use the  perkins  login and the  123                  password. Step 1: Entering the Counted Quantities of Items Suppose that you are starting to count orange jam in the locations listed in the                 physical inventory document. Do the following to enter the counted quantities in the                 system: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305020|IN305020]) Scan and Count (IN305020) form. In the  Scan  box, enter  000001                      (which is the reference number of the physical inventory count). Notice that the                     list of items that you                      will                      count is displayed on the  Count  tab. Enter  L1R3S1  as the first location                      in which you                     are performing counting .  Suppose that in this location, you                         find two boxes of orange jam in 8-ounce jars. Enter  OJ08B , which is the barcode for a box of 10 jars of                     orange jam in 8-ounce jars. The system adds 10 units of the  ORJAM08  item                     to the row that corresponds to this item. Enter  OJ08B  again to add the second box. The system adds                     another 10 units to the first line, so the quantity is  20 . You have                         finished counting items in the  L1R3S1  location and can start counting                         items in the next location. Enter  L1R3S2 . Suppose that in this location, you find                         three boxes of orange jam in 32-ounce jars. Enter  OJ32B , which is the barcode for a box of 10 jars of                     orange jam in 32-ounce jars. The system adds 10 units of the  ORJAM32  item                     to the row that corresponds to this item. To enter two more boxes, do the following to set the quantity: On the form toolbar, click  Set Qty . In the  Scan  box, enter                                  3 . On the  Count  tab,                                 the system changes the quantity of the  ORJAM32  item in the                                 second line to  30 . You have finished counting items in the  L1R3S2  location and can                         start counting items in the next location. Enter  L1R3S3 . Suppose that in this location, you find                         one box of orange jam in 96-ounce jars. Enter  OJ96B , which is the barcode for a box of 10 jars of                     orange jam in 96-ounce jars. The system adds 10 units of the  ORJAM96  item                     to the row that corresponds to this item. You have finished counting items in                         the  L1R3S3  location, which was the last location in your physical                         inventory document. Step 2: Correcting Quantities in the Physical Inventory Document Suppose that you have realized that you entered an extra box of  ORJAM32  item                 in the  L1R3S2  location by mistake (suppose, for instance, that you had                 intended to set the quantity of the boxes to 2 instead of 3), and now you need to                 correct the quantity in the document. Do the following: While you are still viewing the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305020|IN305020]) Scan and Count (IN305020) form                     with the  000001  physical inventory document opened, on the form toolbar,                     click  Remove  to switch to Remove mode. Enter  L1R3S2 . Enter  OJ32B . The system removes 10 units of the                          ORJAM32  item from the row that corresponds to the item. You have corrected the quantity of the  ORJAM32  item in the  L1R3S2                  location. Step 3: Adding Extra Lines to the Physical Inventory Document Suppose that in the  L1R3S3  location, you have found one jar of the                      ORJAM08  item, which is not in the physical inventory document. To add                 this item to the document, do the following: While you are still viewing the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305020|IN305020]) Scan and Count (IN305020) form                     with the  000001  physical inventory document opened, enter                          L1R3S3 . Enter  OJ08 , which is the barcode of one 8-ounce jar of                     orange jam. The system adds a new row to the table with the  L1R3S3                      location and                      one unit of                      the  ORJAM08  item. You have added the extra item to the physical inventory document. Now you will review                 the counted quantities and confirm the entered data. Step 4: Reviewing the Quantities and Confirming the Entered Data To                  review the quantities and confirm the entered                 data ,                 do  the following: While you are still viewing the  000001  physical inventory document on the                           ([~/?ScreenId=IN305020|IN305020]) Scan and Count (IN305020) form, review the lines in the                     table on the  Count  tab. They should have the settings                     indicated in the following table. Line Nbr. Location Inventory ID Physical Quantity 1 L1R3S1 ORJAM08 20 2 L1R3S2 ORJAM32 20 3 L1R3S3 ORJAM96 10 4 L1R3S3 ORJAM08 1 On the form toolbar, click  Confirm  to confirm the entered                     data. The system confirms the data and clears the physical inventory document                     number. The form is ready for a new count. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305010|IN305010]) Physical Inventory Count (IN305000) form, open the physical                     inventory document for which you have performed count. In the                          Physical Quantity  column, make sure all counted                     quantities are shown (see the screenshot                         below).

==Story==
Suppose that you are a warehouse worker and you are assigned to perform a physical inventory count by scanning the barcodes of stock items and locations with your mobile device, by using the Acumatica mobile app. You will count the quantities of orange jam in particular warehouse locations added to the physical inventory document, which your manager has provided to you.
==Configuration Overview==
In the ''U100'' dataset, the following features have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, where they are in the ''Inventory and Order Management'' group of features:[anchor|#ul_wqn_zy2_3fb]
*''Multiple Warehouse Locations''
* ''Advanced Physical Count''
* ''Warehouse Management''
* ''Inventory Operations''

The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in the system:[anchor|#ul_ghb_r2d_pfb]
*A warehouse on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form: ''WHOLESALE''.
*The following warehouse locations on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] form: ''L1R3S1'', ''L1R3S2'', and ''L1R3S3''.

*A physical inventory type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_89_00|Physical Inventory Types] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) form: ''ORJCNT''.

Also, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_40_00|Prepare Physical Count] ([~/?ScreenId=IN504000|IN504000]) form, the physical inventory document you will use has been created, which has the ''Counting in Progress'' status.
==Process Overview==
In this activity, as you count stock items within physical inventory by using the Scan and Count screen of the Acumatica mobile app, you will scan the barcode of the physical inventory document and then scan the location barcode and the barcodes of each item you find in this location. You will correct the quantities of items and add extra lines for items that you find in a location. When you have counted all items in all locations added to the physical inventory document, you will confirm the document.
==System Preparation==
Before you start counting stock items, you need to perform the following instructions:[anchor|#_afaee9e6-d24e-43fc-ac22-ee63abf7a31b]
#Make sure that you have installed the Acumatica mobile app on your mobile device.
#Launch the app.
#Enter the URL and optional name of the Acumatica ERP instance with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded (for example, ''https://your.acumatica.site.com''), and tap '''Next'''.
#Enter the credentials of the user account you will use in this activity: the ''perkins'' login and the ''123'' password.
#Tap '''Sign In''' to enter the site.

==Step 1: Entering the Counted Quantities of Items==
Suppose that you are starting to count orange jam in the locations listed in the physical inventory document. In the Acumatica mobile app on your mobile device, do the following to enter the counted quantities in the system:[anchor|#_b1d961b4-3ab7-4ce6-bc11-ba3cd31031f3]
#On the main menu of the mobile app, tap the '''Warehouse Management''' > '''Scan and Count''' tile to view the Scan and Count screen.
#Scan the <tt>000001</tt> barcode (which is the reference number of the physical inventory document).Notice that the number is displayed in the '''Reference Nbr.''' box on the top pane of the screen.
#At the bottom of the screen, tap '''Review''' to view the list of items that you should count; return to the Scan and Count screen.
#Scan the <tt>L1R3S1</tt> location barcode.
#:Suppose that in this physical location, you find two boxes of orange jam in 8-ounce jars, and two boxes and two units of orange jam in 32-ounce jars.
#Scan the <tt>OJ08B</tt> item barcode twice to add two boxes of the ''ORJAM08'' item to the document.
#Scan the <tt>OJ32B</tt> item barcode twice to add two boxes of the ''ORJAM32'' item to the document.
#Scan the <tt>OJ32</tt> item barcode two times to add two units of the ''ORJAM32'' item to the document.
#:You have completed the entry of item quantities in the ''L1R3S1'' location and can start entering quantities in the next location.
#Scan the <tt>L1R3S2</tt> location barcode.
#:Suppose that in this location, you find three boxes of orange jam in 32-ounce jars and two jam jars.
#Scan the <tt>OJ32B</tt> item barcode three times to add three boxes of the ''ORJAM32'' item to the document.
#Scan the <tt>OJ32</tt> item barcode two times to add two units of the ''ORJAM32'' item to the document.
#:You have finished entering item quantities in the ''L1R3S2'' location and can start entering quantities in the next location.
#Scan the <tt>L1R3S3</tt> location barcode.
#:Suppose that in this location, you find one box of orange jam in 96-ounce jars.
#Scan the <tt>OJ96B</tt> item barcode to add one box of the ''ORJAM96'' item to the document.
#:You have finished entering item quantities in the ''L1R3S3'' location, which was the last location in your physical inventory document.

==Step 2: Correcting the Quantities in the Physical Inventory Document==
Suppose that you have realized that you scanned one box of the ''ORJAM32'' item in the ''L1R3S2'' location twice by mistake, and now you need to correct the quantity in the document. Do the following in the mobile app:[anchor|#_574cd561-7d2a-4763-85fe-67b9ceeb80ae]
#While you are still viewing the Scan and Count screen with the ''000001'' physical inventory document opened, scan the <tt>L1R3S2</tt> location barcode.
#At the bottom of the screen, tap '''Remove''' to switch to Remove mode.
#Scan the <tt>OJ32B</tt> item barcode. The system removes one box of the ''ORJAM32'' item from the document.

You have corrected the quantity of the ''ORJAM32'' item in the ''L1R3S2'' location.
==Step 3: Adding an Extra Line to the Physical Inventory Document==
Suppose that in the ''L1R3S3'' location, you have found one jar of the ''ORJAM08'' item, which is not in the physical inventory document. To add this item to the document, do the following in the Acumatica mobile app:[anchor|#_2690c7b0-0156-4d2a-9c9e-59c1462f1bf6]
#While you are still viewing the Scan and Count screen with the ''000001'' physical inventory document opened, scan the <tt>L1R3S3</tt> location barcode.
#Scan the <tt>OJ08</tt> item barcode. The system adds a new row for the ''L1R3S3'' location and the ''ORJAM08'' item to the document.

You have added the extra item to the physical inventory document. Now you will review the counted quantities and confirm the entered data.
==Step 4: Reviewing the Quantities and Confirming the Entered Data==
Now that you have entered the quantities of the counted items in the physical inventory document, you will review the quantities and confirm the entered data. Do the following in the Acumatica mobile app:[anchor|#_aff74221-30e4-4417-aaf7-f0d62a89cdb0]
#While you are still viewing the ''000001'' physical inventory document on the Scan and Count screen, tap '''Review''', and make sure that the settings shown on the screen correspond to the settings in the following table.

The following stock items on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items                     (IN202500) form:  ORJAM08 ,  ORJAM32 , and  ORJAM96 . For each                     stock item, barcodes have been specified on the                          Cross-Reference  tab of the form. A physical inventory type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) Physical Inventory Types (IN208900)                     form:  ORJCNT . Also, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN504000|IN504000]) Prepare Physical Count (IN504000) form, the physical inventory                 document you will use has been created, which has the  Counting in Progress                  status. Process Overview In this activity, as you count stock items within physical inventory by using the                 Scan and Count screen of the  Acumatica  mobile app, you will scan                 the barcode of the physical inventory document and then scan the location barcode                 and the barcodes of each item you find in this location. You will correct the                 quantities of items and add extra lines for items that you find in a location. When                 you have counted all items in all locations added to the physical inventory                 document, you will confirm the document. System Preparation Before you start counting stock items, you need to perform the following                 instructions: Make sure that you have installed the  Acumatica  mobile app on                     your mobile device. Launch the app. Enter the URL and optional name of the  Acumatica ERP instance with the  U100  dataset preloaded (for example,                          https://your.acumatica.site.com ), and tap                      Next . Enter the credentials of the user account you will use in this activity: the                          perkins  login and the  123  password. Tap  Sign In  to enter the site. Step 1: Entering the Counted Quantities of Items Suppose that you are starting to count orange jam in the locations listed in the                 physical inventory document. In the  Acumatica  mobile app on your                 mobile device, do the following to enter the counted quantities in the system: On the main menu of the mobile app, tap the  Warehouse Management Scan and Count  tile to view the Scan and Count screen. Scan the                              000001                          barcode (which is the reference number of the physical inventory                         document).Notice that the number is displayed in the  Reference                             Nbr.  box on the top pane of the screen. At the bottom of the screen, tap  Review  to view the                         list of items that you should count; return to the Scan and Count                         screen. Scan the                              L1R3S1                          location barcode. Suppose that in this physical location, you find two                             boxes of orange jam in 8-ounce jars, and two boxes and two units of                             orange jam in 32-ounce jars. Scan the                              OJ08B                          item barcode twice to add two boxes of the  ORJAM08  item to the                         document. Scan the                              OJ32B                          item barcode twice to add two boxes of the  ORJAM32  item to the                         document. Scan the                              OJ32                          item barcode two times to add two units of the  ORJAM32  item to the                             document. You have completed the entry of item quantities in the                                  L1R3S1  location and can start entering quantities in the next                             location. Scan the                              L1R3S2                          location barcode. Suppose that in this location, you find three boxes of                             orange jam in 32-ounce jars and two jam jars. Scan the                              OJ32B                          item barcode three times to add three boxes of the  ORJAM32  item to                         the document. Scan the                              OJ32                          item barcode two times to add two units of the  ORJAM32  item to the                             document. You have finished entering item quantities in the                                  L1R3S2  location and can start entering quantities in the next                             location. Scan the                              L1R3S3                          location barcode. Suppose that in this location, you find one box of                             orange jam in 96-ounce jars. Scan the                              OJ96B                          item barcode to add one box of the  ORJAM96  item to the                             document. You have finished entering item quantities in the                                  L1R3S3  location, which was the last location in your physical                             inventory document. Step 2: Correcting the Quantities in the Physical Inventory Document Suppose that you have realized that you scanned one box of the  ORJAM32  item in                 the  L1R3S2  location twice by mistake, and now you need to correct the                 quantity in the document. Do the following in the mobile app: While you are still viewing the Scan and Count screen with the  000001                      physical inventory document opened, scan the                          L1R3S2                      location barcode. At the bottom of the screen, tap  Remove  to switch to                     Remove mode. Scan the                          OJ32B                      item barcode. The system removes one box of the  ORJAM32  item from the                     document. You have corrected the quantity of the  ORJAM32  item in the  L1R3S2                  location. Step 3: Adding an Extra Line to the Physical Inventory Document Suppose that in the  L1R3S3  location, you have found one jar of the                      ORJAM08  item, which is not in the physical inventory document. To add                 this item to the document, do the following in the  Acumatica                  mobile app: While you are still viewing the Scan and Count screen with the  000001                      physical inventory document opened, scan the                          L1R3S3                      location barcode. Scan the                          OJ08                      item barcode. The system adds a new row for the  L1R3S3  location and the                          ORJAM08  item to the document. You have added the extra item to the physical inventory document. Now you will review                 the counted quantities and confirm the entered data. Step 4: Reviewing the Quantities and Confirming the Entered Data Now that you have entered the quantities of the counted items in the physical                 inventory document, you will review the quantities and confirm the entered data. Do                 the following in the  Acumatica  mobile app: While you are still viewing the  000001  physical inventory document on the                     Scan and Count screen, tap  Review , and make sure that the                     settings shown on the screen correspond to the settings in the following                         table. Location Inventory ID Physical Quantity Line 1, Rack 3, Shelf 1 ( L1R3S1 ) ORJAM08 20 Line 1, Rack 3, Shelf 1 ( L1R3S1 ) ORJAM32 22 Line 1, Rack 3, Shelf 2 ( L1R3S2 ) ORJAM32 22 Line 1, Rack 3, Shelf 3 ( L1R3S3 ) ORJAM96 10 Line 1, Rack 3, Shelf 3 ( L1R3S3 ) ORJAM08 1 In the top right corner of the screen, tap  More Confirm  to confirm the entered data. The system confirms the data and                     clears the physical inventory document number. The form is ready for a new                     count. You have successfully counted orange jam in the warehouse locations and entered data                 in the system. ]]></column>

If you are using another dataset, or if any system settings have been changed in ''U100'', these changes can affect the workflow of the activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the ''U100'' dataset to its initial state.
)))
==Story==
Suppose that you, as a warehouse worker of the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company, have a task to inspect the jars of apple jam to find out if they are of appropriate quantity and to write off jars with any defects. If you find any jars with defects, you need to remove them from the location and process an inventory issue to record this removal in the system.
==Configuration Overview==
In the ''U100'' dataset, the following features have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, where they are in the ''Inventory and Order Management'' group of features:[anchor|#ul_wqn_zy2_3fb]
*''Multiple Warehouse Locations''
* ''Warehouse Management''
* ''Inventory Operations''

The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in the system:[anchor|#ul_ghb_r2d_pfb]
*A warehouse on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form: ''WHOLESALE''.
*The following warehouse locations on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] form: ''L2R3S1'', ''L2R3S3'' and ''L3R3S3''.
*The following stock items on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form: ''APJAM08'' and ''APJAM96''. For these stock items, the barcodes have been specified on the '''Cross-Reference''' tab of the form.

==Process Overview==
In this activity, as you issue stock items by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_20|Scan and Issue] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302020|IN302020]) form, you will scan the barcode of the location where the items are stored and then scan the barcode of each item to be issued. When you have entered all items in all locations that should be issued, you will release the issue.[anchor|#_7a94149e-0a0a-44bb-97d2-ccbe4ac02a51]((({S:Warn}In any working mode, you enter a command or barcode by typing it in the '''Scan''' box and pressing Enter. In production systems, you will scan the appropriate barcodes rather than manually entering them.
)))
==System Preparation==
Before you start issuing stock items, you need to launch the Acumatica ERP website and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded. To sign in as a warehouse worker, use the ''perkins'' login and the ''123'' password.
==Step 1: Creating an Inventory Issue==
Suppose that you have found the following damaged jars of apple jam while inspecting them: three units of apple jam in 8-ounce jars in the ''L2R3S1'' location, four units of apple jam in 96-ounce jars in the ''L2R3S3'' location, and two units of apple jam in 96-ounce jars in the ''L3R3S3'' location. To create an issue with these items, do the following:[anchor|#_4f108c09-af4b-45fb-8ec0-571cb736dbf1]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_20|Scan and Issue] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302020|IN302020]) form.
#In the '''Scan''' box, enter <tt>L2R3S1</tt>, which is the barcode of the location where you have found the damaged apple jam in 8-ounce jars.
#Enter <tt>AJ08</tt>, which is the barcode that corresponds to one unit of apple jam in an 8-ounce jar. The system adds 1 unit of the ''APJAM08'' item to the table on the '''Issue''' tab.
#Set the quantity of the item to <tt>3</tt>, the number of damaged 8-ounce jars you found, as follows:
##On the form toolbar, click '''Set Qty'''. The system prompts you to enter the item quantity.
##In the '''Scan''' box, enter <tt>3</tt>.
#Enter <tt>L2R3S3</tt>, which is the barcode of the location where the damaged apple jam in 96-ounce jars is stored.
#Enter <tt>AJ96</tt>, which is the barcode that corresponds to one unit of apple jam in a 96-ounce jar. The system adds 1 unit of the ''APJAM96'' item to the table on the '''Issue''' tab.
#Set the quantity of the item to <tt>4</tt>, the number of damaged 96-ounce jars you found.
#Enter <tt>L3R3S3</tt>, which is the barcode of the location where the damaged apple jam in 96-ounce jars is stored.
#Enter <tt>AJ96</tt>, which is the barcode that corresponds to one unit of apple jam in a 96-ounce jar. The system adds 1 unit of the ''APJAM96'' item to the table on the '''Issue''' tab.
#Set the quantity of the item to <tt>2</tt>, the number of damaged 96-ounce jars you found.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''. The system saves your changes and creates the inventory issue, whose reference number you can view in the '''Reference Nbr.''' box of the Summary area.

You have added the required items to the issue. Now you will review the issue and release it.
==Step 2: Reviewing and Releasing the Issue==
To review and release the issue, do the following:[anchor|#_fd36aaae-1f65-4e66-8050-dc8a3f21a6a2]
#While you are still viewing the inventory issue on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_20|Scan and Issue] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302020|IN302020]) form, review the lines that have been added to the table on the '''Issue''' tab. They should have the settings indicated in the following table.
#:{| class="checklist" | width="100%"

The following activity is based on the                  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system settings             have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the activity             and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100  dataset             to its initial state. Story Suppose that you, as a warehouse worker of the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company,                 have a task to inspect the jars of apple jam to find out if they are of appropriate                 quantity and to write off jars with any defects. If you find any jars with defects,                 you need to remove them from the location and process an inventory issue to record                 this removal in the system. Configuration Overview In the  U100  dataset, the following features have been enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, where they are in the                      Inventory and Order Management  group of features: Multiple Warehouse Locations Warehouse Management Inventory Operations The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in                 the system: A warehouse on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses (IN204000) form:                          WHOLESALE . The following warehouse locations on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses form:  L2R3S1 ,  L2R3S3                      and  L3R3S3 . The following stock items on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items                     (IN202500) form:  APJAM08  and  APJAM96 . For these stock items, the                     barcodes have been specified on the  Cross-Reference  tab                     of the form. Process Overview In this activity, as you issue stock items by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302020|IN302020]) Scan and Issue (IN302020) form, you will scan the barcode of the location where the items are                 stored and then scan the barcode of each item to be issued. When you have entered                 all items in all locations that should be issued, you will release the issue. In any working mode, you enter a command or barcode             by typing it in the  Scan  box and pressing Enter. In production             systems, you will scan the appropriate barcodes rather than manually entering             them. System Preparation Before you start issuing stock items, you need to launch the  Acumatica ERP website and sign in to a company with the  U100  dataset preloaded. To sign                 in as a warehouse worker, use the  perkins  login and the  123                  password. Step 1: Creating an Inventory Issue Suppose that you have found the following damaged jars of apple jam while inspecting                 them: three units of apple jam in 8-ounce jars in the  L2R3S1  location, four                 units of apple jam in 96-ounce jars in the  L2R3S3  location, and two units of                 apple jam in 96-ounce jars in the  L3R3S3  location. To create an issue with                 these items, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302020|IN302020]) Scan and Issue (IN302020) form. In the  Scan  box, enter  L2R3S1 ,                     which is the barcode of the location where you have found the damaged apple jam                     in 8-ounce jars. Enter  AJ08 , which is the barcode that corresponds to one                     unit of apple jam in an 8-ounce jar. The system adds 1 unit of the                          APJAM08  item to the table on the  Issue                      tab. Set the quantity of the item to  3 , the number of damaged                     8-ounce jars you found, as follows: On the form toolbar, click  Set Qty . The system                             prompts you to enter the item quantity. In the  Scan  box, enter                              3 . Enter  L2R3S3 , which is the barcode of the location where                     the damaged apple jam in 96-ounce jars is stored. Enter  AJ96 , which is the barcode that corresponds to one                     unit of apple jam in a 96-ounce jar. The system adds 1 unit of the                          APJAM96  item to the table on the  Issue                      tab. Set the quantity of the item to  4 , the number of damaged                     96-ounce jars you found. Enter  L3R3S3 , which is the barcode of the location where                     the damaged apple jam in 96-ounce jars is stored. Enter  AJ96 , which is the barcode that corresponds to one                     unit of apple jam in a 96-ounce jar. The system adds 1 unit of the                          APJAM96  item to the table on the  Issue                      tab. Set the quantity of the item to  2 , the number of damaged                     96-ounce jars you found. On the form toolbar, click  Save . The system saves your                     changes and creates the inventory issue, whose                      reference                     number  you can view in the  Reference                         Nbr.  box of the Summary area. You have added the required items to the issue. Now you will review the issue and                 release it. Step 2: Reviewing and Releasing the Issue To review and release the issue, do the following: While you are still viewing the inventory issue on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302020|IN302020]) Scan and Issue (IN302020) form, review the lines that have been                     added to the table on the  Issue  tab. They should have the                     settings indicated in the following table. Inventory ID Location Quantity UOM APJAM08 L2R3S1 3 PIECE APJAM96 L2R3S3 4 PIECE APJAM96 L3R3S3 2 PIECE On the form toolbar, click  Release  to release the                     inventory issue.

In this topic, you will read about the workflow for the automated receipt of inventory items in Acumatica ERP. The workflow in this topic is based on the assumption that your system has the recommended configuration described in [HelpRoot_WMS\WMS_Scan_and_Receive_Implem_Checklist|Processing of Inventory Receipts: Implementation Checklist].{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to process inventory receipts of items from warehouse locations by using the functionality of automated warehouse operations. In particular, you will do the following:[anchor|#_eb120144-0cfa-4afd-bf9d-616234e0d386]
*Enable the needed system features
*Learn the recommended settings that you can specify to make the system fit your business requirements
*Process a receipt of items to a warehouse in automated mode

==Applicable Scenario==
You can use automated processing of inventory receipts when you need to move items to a warehouse location and, in your organization, all items and locations have barcodes and warehouse workers are equipped with barcode scanners or mobile devices with a scanning option.
==Workflow for the Automated Receiving of Items==
The automated processing of receiving inventory items involves the actions shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#_e50b2fc2-f475-4775-81cf-bbe4f48dc2e4][anchor|#image_ohm_3d4_zgb][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_WMS_Scan_Receive.png|popup|410px]
To receive items by using a barcode scanner or a mobile device with a scanning option, you perform the following steps:[anchor|#ol_cz1_5pn_xgb]
#''Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_20|Scan and Receive] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301020|IN301020]) form''.
#:You open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_20|Scan and Receive] form (or the corresponding screen in the Acumatica mobile app).
#''Scan the location barcode''.
#:You scan the barcode of the warehouse location, where the items are to be received.
#Optional: ''Scan the warehouse barcode''.
#:If the location whose identifier you scanned in the previous step is assigned to multiple warehouses, you scan the warehouse barcode. The system inserts the warehouse ID in the '''Warehouse''' box.
#''Scan the item barcode''.
#:You scan the barcode of the item being received.
#Optional: ''Scan the item quantity''.
#:To change the received quantity in the line that is currently being processed, you switch to Quantity Editing mode by scanning or entering the <tt>&#42;qty</tt> barcode or by clicking '''Set Qty''' on the form toolbar; you then manually enter the quantity in the UOM coded in the scanned item barcode.
#Optional: ''Scan the barcode of the next item to be received''.
#:If more items need to be received in the currently selected location, you scan the barcode of the next item barcode (that is, return to Step 4), and repeat the process for the item.
#Optional: ''Scan the barcode of the next location''.
#:If items must be received in another warehouse location, you scan the barcode of this location (that is, return to Step 2) and repeat the process for this location.
#''Release the inventory receipt''.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Processing of Inventory Receipts: General Information If the  Inventory Operations  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, you can perform the automated receipt of inventory items to a particular         warehouse location by using a barcode scanner or a mobile device with a scanning option. In this topic, you will read about the workflow for the automated receipt of inventory         items in  Acumatica ERP. The workflow in this topic is based on the assumption that your system has the         recommended configuration described in  Processing of Inventory Receipts: Implementation Checklist. Learning Objectives In this chapter, you will learn how to process inventory receipts of items from warehouse         locations by using the functionality of automated warehouse operations. In particular, you         will do the following: Enable the needed system features Learn the recommended settings that you can specify to make the system fit your business           requirements Process a receipt of items to a warehouse in automated mode Applicable Scenario You can use automated processing of inventory receipts when you need to move items to a         warehouse location and, in your organization, all items and locations have barcodes and         warehouse workers are equipped with barcode scanners or mobile devices with a scanning         option. Workflow for the Automated Receiving of Items The automated processing of receiving inventory items involves the actions shown in the         following diagram. To receive items by using a barcode scanner or a mobile device with a scanning option, you         perform the following steps: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN301020|IN301020]) Scan and Receive (IN301020) form . You open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN301020|IN301020]) Scan and Receive form (or the corresponding screen in the  Acumatica  mobile app). Scan the location barcode . You scan the barcode of the warehouse location,             where the items are to be received. Optional:  Scan the warehouse barcode . If the location whose identifier you             scanned in the previous step is assigned to multiple warehouses, you scan the warehouse             barcode. The system inserts the warehouse ID in the  Warehouse              box. Scan the item barcode . You scan the barcode of the item being           received. Optional:  Scan the item quantity . To change the received quantity in the line             that is currently being processed, you switch to Quantity Editing mode by scanning or             entering the  *qty  barcode or by clicking  Set               Qty  on the form toolbar; you then manually enter the quantity in the UOM             coded in the scanned item barcode. Optional:  Scan the barcode of the next item to be received . If more items need             to be received in the currently selected location, you scan the barcode of the next item             barcode (that is, return to Step 4), and repeat the process for the item. Optional:  Scan the barcode of the next location . If items must be received in             another warehouse location, you scan the barcode of this location (that is, return to             Step 2) and repeat the process for this location. Release the inventory receipt . When you have finished receiving items, you scan             the  *release*receipt  command or click                Release  on the form toolbar. The system releases the inventory             receipt. ]]></column>

)))
==Story==
Suppose that you, as a warehouse worker of the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company, have a task to put apple, orange, and lemon jam, which you recently have received from production, to appropriate warehouse locations and process an inventory receipt to register this operation in the system.{br}

Suppose that you have received the following jam, which you will move to appropriate locations: three boxes of apple jam in 8-ounce jars and four boxes of orange jam in 8-ounce jars (you will put these boxes to the ''L2R3S1'' location); two boxes of apple jam in 96-ounce jars, three boxes of orange jam in 96-ounce jars, and one box of lemon jam in 96-ounce jars (you will put these boxes to the ''L2R3S3'' location).
==Configuration Overview==
In the ''U100'' dataset, the following features have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, where they are in the ''Inventory and Order Management'' group of features:[anchor|#ul_wqn_zy2_3fb]
*''Multiple Warehouse Locations''
* ''Warehouse Management''
* ''Inventory Operations''

The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in the system:[anchor|#ul_ghb_r2d_pfb]
*A warehouse on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form: ''WHOLESALE''.
*The following warehouse locations on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] form: ''L2R3S1'' and ''L2R3S3''.
*The following stock items on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form: ''APJAM08'', ''ORJAM08'', ''APJAM96'', ''ORJAM96'', and ''LEMJAM96''. For these stock items, the barcodes have been specified on the '''Cross-Reference''' tab of the form.

==Process Overview==
In this activity, as you register receiving of stock items by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_20|Scan and Receive] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301020|IN301020]) form, you will scan the barcode of the location where the items must be stored and then scan the barcode of each item to be issued. When you have entered all items in all locations that should be issued, you will release the issue.[anchor|#_24b117cf-283b-4cd8-8803-1e5805c76cbb]((({S:Warn}In any working mode, you enter a command or barcode by typing it in the '''Scan''' box and pressing Enter. In production systems, you will scan the appropriate barcodes rather than manually entering them.
)))
==System Preparation==
Before you start receiving stock items, you need to launch the Acumatica ERP website and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded. To sign in as a warehouse worker, use the ''perkins'' login and the ''123'' password.
==Step 1: Creating an Inventory Receipt==
To create an inventory receipt with the received jam, do the following:[anchor|#_97d2f975-3917-4981-a045-624b0dbcfd18]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_20|Scan and Receive] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301020|IN301020]) form.
#In the '''Scan''' box, enter <tt>L2R3S1</tt>, which is the barcode of the location where you put apple and orange jam in 8-ounce jars.
#Enter <tt>AJ08B</tt>, which is the barcode that corresponds to one box of ten 8-ounce jars of apple jam. The system adds 1 box of the ''APJAM08'' item to the table on the '''Receive''' tab.
#Set the quantity of the item to <tt>3</tt>, the number of received boxes of apple jam in 8-ounce jars, as follows:
##On the form toolbar, click '''Set Qty'''. The system prompts you to enter the item quantity.
##In the '''Scan''' box, enter <tt>3</tt>.
#Enter <tt>OJ08B</tt>, which is the barcode that corresponds to one box of ten 8-ounce jars of orange jam. The system adds 1 box of the ''ORJAM08'' item to the table on the '''Receive''' tab.
#Set the quantity of the item to <tt>4</tt>.
#Enter <tt>L2R3S3</tt>, which is the barcode of the location where you put apple, orange, and lemon jam in 96-ounce jars.
#Enter <tt>AJ96B</tt>, which is the barcode that corresponds to one box of ten 96-ounce jars of apple jam. The system adds 1 box of the ''APJAM96'' item to the table on the '''Receive''' tab.
#Enter <tt>AJ96B</tt> one more time to add second unit to the current line.
#Enter <tt>OJ96B</tt>, which is the barcode that corresponds to one box of ten 96-ounce jars of orange jam. The system adds 1 box of the ''ORJAM96'' item to the table on the '''Receive''' tab.
#Set the quantity of the item to <tt>3</tt>.
#Enter <tt>LJ96B</tt>, which is the barcode that corresponds to one box of ten 96-ounce jars of lemon jam. The system adds 1 box of the ''LEMJAM96'' item to the table on the '''Receive''' tab.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''. The system saves your changes and creates the inventory receipt, whose reference number you can view in the '''Reference Nbr.''' box of the Summary area.

You have added the required items to the receipt. Now you will review the receipt and release it.
==Step 2: Releasing and Reviewing the Receipt==
To release and review the receipt, do the following:[anchor|#_59973944-b0b9-4f01-9fa8-7c4ae95d2722]
#While you are still viewing the inventory receipt on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_20|Scan and Receive] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301020|IN301020]) form, review the lines that have been added to the table on the '''Receive''' tab. They should have the settings indicated in the following table.

The following activity is based on the                  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system settings             have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the activity             and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100  dataset             to its initial state. Story Suppose that you, as a warehouse worker of the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company,                 have a task to put apple, orange, and lemon jam, which you recently have received                 from production, to appropriate warehouse locations and process an inventory receipt                 to register this operation in the system. Suppose that you have received the following jam, which you will move to appropriate                 locations: three boxes of apple jam in 8-ounce jars and four boxes of orange jam in                 8-ounce jars (you will put these boxes to the  L2R3S1  location); two boxes of                 apple jam in 96-ounce jars, three boxes of orange jam in 96-ounce jars, and one box                 of lemon jam in 96-ounce jars (you will put these boxes to the  L2R3S3                  location). Configuration Overview In the  U100  dataset, the following features have been enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, where they are in the                      Inventory and Order Management  group of features: Multiple Warehouse Locations Warehouse Management Inventory Operations The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in                 the system: A warehouse on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses (IN204000) form:                          WHOLESALE . The following warehouse locations on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses form:  L2R3S1  and                      L2R3S3 .

For these stock items, the barcodes have been specified on                     the  Cross-Reference  tab of the form. Process Overview In this activity, as you register receiving of stock items by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN301020|IN301020]) Scan and Receive (IN301020) form, you will scan the barcode of the                 location where the items must be stored and then scan the barcode of each item to be                 issued. When you have entered all items in all locations that should be issued, you                 will release the issue. In any working mode, you enter a command or barcode             by typing it in the  Scan  box and pressing Enter. In production             systems, you will scan the appropriate barcodes rather than manually entering             them. System Preparation Before you start receiving stock items, you need to launch the  Acumatica ERP website and sign in to a company with the  U100  dataset preloaded. To sign                 in as a warehouse worker, use the  perkins  login and the  123                  password. Step 1: Creating an Inventory Receipt To create an inventory receipt with the received jam, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN301020|IN301020]) Scan and Receive (IN301020) form. In the  Scan  box, enter  L2R3S1 ,                     which is the barcode of the location where you put apple and orange jam in                     8-ounce jars. Enter  AJ08B , which is the barcode that corresponds to one                     box of ten 8-ounce jars of apple jam. The system adds 1 box of the                          APJAM08  item to the table on the  Receive                      tab. Set the quantity of the item to  3 , the number of received                     boxes of apple jam in 8-ounce jars, as follows: On the form toolbar, click  Set Qty . The system                             prompts you to enter the item quantity. In the  Scan  box, enter                              3 . Enter  OJ08B , which is the barcode that corresponds to one                     box of ten 8-ounce jars of orange jam. The system adds 1 box of the                          ORJAM08  item to the table on the  Receive                      tab. Set the quantity of the item to  4 .

In everyday work of warehouse workers, there could be a need to find some items in the system or get information about items stored in a particular location (storage). If the ''Inventory Operations'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, in Acumatica ERP, you can search for items by scanning barcodes of items and locations by using a barcode scanner or a mobile device with a scanning option, as described in this topic.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to search for information about stock items by scanning an item barcode and for the list of items stored in a particular location by scanning a location barcode with a barcode scanner or a mobile device with a scanning option.
==Applicable Scenarios==
You can use automated lookup if your organization uses barcode scanners or mobile devices with a scanning option to perform warehouse operations and all stock items and locations in warehouses are barcoded. You can look up for items and locations in any of the following cases:[anchor|#_041f3b02-ee49-45b6-b8b5-1d92771d0833]
*In a warehouse, you find a stock item that is not in a location and you would like to find an appropriate location for the item.
*You would like to view the list of stock items stored in a particular warehouse location as it is registered in the system. 

==Item Lookup==
As you perform any of the warehouse operations, you may need to search for items. For example, you might find a box that is not in a location and want to find out what is in the box and where the box should be placed. To get information about a particular item by scanning the item barcode, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_20|Item Lookup] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202520|IN202520]) form.{br}

On this form, you can find information about the location where the item is stored, the quantity of items in the location or locations, and other information about the item (such as item class and base units of measure).{br}

In the following diagram, you can find the general process of item lookup.[anchor|#_bd7d0783-a856-4800-92e4-2c08e8f4f112][anchor|#_9fcac630-234e-42ad-a3ae-813a3c368e15][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_WMS_Item_Lookup.png|popup|450px]
==Location Lookup==
If you want to view the list of items in a specific location, you can scan the barcode of the location when the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_90_20|Storage Lookup] ([~/?ScreenId=IN409020|IN409020]) form is opened on your mobile device. On this form, you can see the list of items and their quantities stored in the location.{br}

==Story==
Suppose that you are a warehouse worker in the wholesale warehouse of the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company. When you walk around the warehouse you find items and boxes that have been inappropriately placed on the floor or on tables. Your work task is to find out what are these items and where they should be stored, so that you can move the items to the appropriate storage.
==Configuration Overview==
In the ''U100'' dataset, the following features have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, where they are in the ''Inventory and Order Management'' group of features:[anchor|#ul_wqn_zy2_3fb]
*''Multiple Warehouse Locations''
* ''Warehouse Management''
* ''Inventory Operations''

The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in the system:[anchor|#ul_ghb_r2d_pfb]
*A warehouse on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form: ''WHOLESALE''
*The following warehouse locations on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] form: ''MAIN'', ''L1R3S2'', ''L2R3S2'', and ''L3R3S2''
*A stock item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form: ''APJAM08''. For this stock item, barcodes have been specified on the '''Cross-Reference''' tab of the form.

==Process Overview==
In this activity, you will look up an item by scanning the item barcode on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_20|Item Lookup] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202520|IN202520]) form, you will scan the item barcode and view information about the item, such as the location and availability.{br}

You will also search for a list of the items stored in a particular location by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_90_20|Storage Lookup] ([~/?ScreenId=IN409020|IN409020]) form, where you will scan the location barcode and view the list of items, with the on-hand quantity for each item.[anchor|#_5d0fdfda-a563-4c45-a566-58e30ca6861e]((({S:Warn}In any working mode, you enter a command or barcode by typing it in the '''Scan''' box and pressing Enter. In production systems, you will scan the appropriate barcodes rather than manually entering them.
)))
==System Preparation==
Before you start looking up items, launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded. To sign in as a warehouse worker, use the ''perkins'' login and the ''123'' password.
==Step 1: Looking Up an Item by Scanning the Item Barcode==
Suppose that as you are walking through the warehouse, you notice a box on the floor near some shelves; the box has 10 apple jars, each 32 ounces. You do not see other warehouse workers nearby, so you decide to find out what this box contains and where it should be placed. Do the following:[anchor|#_53c676a3-13bc-4316-9d3d-c1d6d76de2bd]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_20|Item Lookup] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202520|IN202520]) form.
#In the '''Scan''' box, enter <tt>AJ32B</tt>, which is the barcode affixed to the box you found. Notice that ''APJAM32'' item (for which this barcode is specified in the item settings) is shown in the '''Inventory ID''' box.
#In the table on the '''Item''' tab, notice that the item is stored in the following locations: ''MAIN'', ''L1R3S2'', ''L2R3S2'', and ''L3R3S2'', as shown in the following screenshot. [anchor|#_01ce5400-c263-4289-9b5b-8b81d88c0682][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_WMS_Item_and_Storage_Lookup.png|popup|Reviewing the locations with apple jam|450px]
#:You know the box did not come from the ''MAIN'' location because it is a receiving location, and you first need to make sure that the box was not taken from any of the racks with sorted items. Because you know that the box you found contains 10 jars, this box could have been taken from the ''L1R3S2'' or ''L3R3S2'' locations. (The ''L2R3S2'' location contains only 8 jars of this item, so the box definitely is not from this shelf.)

Now you need to find out if the ''L1R3S2'' or ''L3R3S2'' locations contain less jam than the quantity that is recorded in the system.
==Step 2: Looking Up Items Stored in a Location==
Suppose that you have counted the quantities of boxes and jars of the ''APJ32B'' item on the ''L1R3S2'' and ''L3R3S2'' shelves. You have found out that the ''L1R3S2'' shelf contains one box of 10 jars and 3 single jars; the ''L3R3S2'' contains one box of 10 jars and 6 single jars. To find out if the ''L1R3S2'' or ''L3R3S2'' location contain less jam than the quantity that is recorded in the system, do the following:[anchor|#_8cea706b-dd82-4b8d-97b4-a2331d5cf699]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_90_20|Storage Lookup] ([~/?ScreenId=IN409020|IN409020]) form.
#In the '''Scan''' box, enter <tt>L1R3S2</tt>.
#In the table on the '''Storage''' tab, you can see that the on-hand quantity of the ''APJAM32'' item is ''13'', which corresponds to one box of 10 jars and 3 separate jars. All the specified items are on the shelf, so the box you have found is not from this shelf.
#In the '''Scan''' box, enter <tt>L3R3S2</tt>.
#In the table on the '''Storage''' tab, you can see that the on-hand quantity of the ''APJAM32'' item is ''26'', which corresponds to two boxes of 10 jars each and 6 separate jars. You have found only one box on this shelf, so the box you have found should be placed on this shelf.

Process Overview In this activity, you will look up an item by scanning the item barcode on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202520|IN202520]) Item Lookup (IN409020) form, you will scan the item barcode and                 view information about the item, such as the location and availability. You will also search for a list of the items stored in a particular location by using                 the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN409020|IN409020]) Storage Lookup (IN409020) form, where you will scan the                 location barcode and view the list of items, with the on-hand quantity for each                 item. In any working mode, you enter a command or barcode             by typing it in the  Scan  box and pressing Enter. In production             systems, you will scan the appropriate barcodes rather than manually entering             them. System Preparation Before you start looking up items, launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the  U100  dataset preloaded. To sign                 in as a warehouse worker, use the  perkins  login and the  123                  password. Step 1: Looking Up an Item by Scanning the Item Barcode Suppose that as you are walking through the warehouse, you notice a box on the floor                 near some shelves; the box has 10 apple jars, each 32 ounces. You do not see other                 warehouse workers nearby, so you decide to find out what this box contains and where                 it should be placed. Do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202520|IN202520]) Item Lookup (IN202520) form. In the  Scan  box, enter  AJ32B ,                     which is the barcode affixed to the box you                     found.  Notice                     that  APJAM32  item (for which this barcode is specified in the item                     settings) is shown in the  Inventory ID                      box. In the table on the  Item  tab, notice that the item is                     stored in the following locations:  MAIN ,  L1R3S2 ,  L2R3S2 ,                     and                      L3R3S2 ,                     as shown in the following screenshot .                          Reviewing the locations with apple jam You know the box did not come from the                              MAIN                          location because it is a receiving location, and you first need to make sure                         that the box was not taken from any of the racks with sorted items. Because                         you know that the box you found contains 10 jars, this box could have been                         taken from the  L1R3S2  or  L3R3S2  locations. (The  L2R3S2                          location contains only 8 jars of this item, so the box definitely is not                         from this shelf.) Now you need to find out if the  L1R3S2  or  L3R3S2  locations contain less                 jam than the quantity that is recorded in the system. Step 2: Looking Up Items Stored in a Location Suppose that you have counted the quantities of boxes and jars of the  APJ32B                  item on the  L1R3S2  and  L3R3S2  shelves. You have found out that the                      L1R3S2  shelf contains one box of 10 jars and 3 single jars; the                      L3R3S2  contains one box of 10 jars and 6 single jars. To find out if the                      L1R3S2  or  L3R3S2  location contain less jam than the quantity that                 is recorded in the system, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN409020|IN409020]) Storage Lookup (IN409020) form. In the  Scan  box, enter                      L1R3S2 . In the table on the  Storage  tab, you can see that the                     on-hand quantity of the  APJAM32  item is  13 , which corresponds to                     one box of 10 jars and 3 separate jars.                      All the                     specified items are on the shelf, s o the box you have found is                     not from this shelf. In the  Scan  box, enter                      L3R3S2 . In the table on the  Storage  tab, you can see that the                     on-hand quantity of the  APJAM32  item is  26 , which corresponds to                     two boxes of 10 jars each and 6 separate jars. You have found only one box on                     this shelf, so the box you have found should be placed on this shelf. ]]></column>

==Story==
Suppose that you are a warehouse worker in the wholesale warehouse of the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company. When you walk around the warehouse you find items and boxes that have been inappropriately placed on the floor or on tables. One of your work tasks is to find out what are these items and where they should be stored in the Acumatica mobile app, so that you can move the items to the appropriate storage.
==Configuration Overview==
In the ''U100'' dataset, the following features have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, where they are in the ''Inventory and Order Management'' group of features:[anchor|#ul_wqn_zy2_3fb]
*''Multiple Warehouse Locations''
* ''Warehouse Management''
* ''Inventory Operations''

The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in the system:[anchor|#ul_ghb_r2d_pfb]
*A warehouse on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form: ''WHOLESALE''.
*The following warehouse locations on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] form: ''MAIN'', ''L1R3S2'', ''L2R3S2'', and ''L3R3S2''.
*A stock item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form: ''APJAM32''. For this stock item, barcodes have been specified on the '''Cross-Reference''' tab of the form.

==Process Overview==
In this activity, you will look up an item by scanning the item barcode on the Item Lookup screen of the Acumatica mobile app. You will scan the item barcode and view information about the item, such as the location and availability.{br}

You will also search for a list of the items stored in a particular location by using the Storage Lookup screen, where you will scan the location barcode and view the list of items, with the on-hand quantity for each item.
==System Preparation==
Before you start looking up items, you need to perform the following instructions:[anchor|#_1920f95c-9a2f-459d-9b77-2ee5a71573dc]
#Make sure that you have installed the Acumatica mobile app on your mobile device.
#Launch the app.
#Enter the URL and optional name of the Acumatica ERP instance with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded (for example, ''https://your.acumatica.site.com''), and tap '''Next'''.
#Enter the credentials of the user account you will use in this activity: the ''perkins'' login and the ''123'' password.
#Tap '''Sign In''' to enter the site.

==Step 1: Looking Up an Item by Scanning the Item Barcode==
Suppose that as you are walking through the warehouse, you notice a box standing on the floor near some racks; the box has 10 apple jars, each 32 ounces. You do not see other warehouse workers nearby, so you decide to find out what this box contains and where it should be placed. In the Acumatica mobile app on your mobile device, do the following:[anchor|#_1c390ced-5705-42ca-9b89-8b13d6363d32]
#On the main menu of the mobile app, tap the '''Warehouse Management''' > '''Item Lookup''' tile to view the Item Lookup screen.
#Scan the <tt>AJ32B</tt> item barcode (which is the barcode affixed to the box).
# At the bottom of the screen, tap '''Review'''. The Inventory Summary screen is opened. (This screen corresponds to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_10_00|Inventory Summary] ([~/?ScreenId=IN401000|IN401000]) form in Acumatica ERP.) 
#:On this screen, you can see that the item is stored in the following locations: ''MAIN'', ''L1R3S2'', ''L2R3S2'', and ''L3R3S2''. The ''MAIN'' location is the receiving location far from the place where you found the box. Most likely, the box was taken from the racks with sorted items. You know that the box contains 10 jars, so this box can be stored in either the ''L1R3S2'' location or the ''L3R3S2'' location. As you can see on the screen, the ''L2R3S2'' location contains only 8 jars of this item, so the box definitely is not from this location.

Now you need to find out which of the locations (''L1R3S2'' or ''L3R3S2'') contains less jam than the quantity that is recorded in the system.
==Step 2: Looking Up Items Stored in a Location==
Suppose that you have counted the quantities of boxes and jars of the ''APJAM32'' item in the ''L1R3S2'' and ''L3R3S2'' locations and found out that the ''L1R3S2'' shelf contains one box of 10 jars and 3 single jars; the ''L3R3S2'' contains one box of 10 jars and 6 single jars. To find out if the ''L1R3S2'' or ''L3R3S2'' location contains less jam than the quantity that is recorded in the system, do the following in the Acumatica mobile app:[anchor|#_a1b83268-0acf-4048-bd17-4d3cae1da103]
#On the main menu of the mobile app, tap the '''Warehouse Management''' > '''Storage Lookup''' tile to view the Item Lookup screen.
#Scan the <tt>L1R3S2</tt> location barcode.
#At the bottom of the screen, tap '''Review'''. The Storage Summary screen is opened, where you can see that the on-hand quantity of the ''APJAM32'' item is ''13'', which corresponds to one box of 10 jars and 3 separate jars. So the box you have found is not from this location.
#Scan the <tt>L3R3S2</tt> location barcode.
#At the bottom of the screen, tap '''Review'''. On the Storage Summary screen, you can see that the on-hand quantity of the ''APJAM32'' item is 26, which corresponds to two boxes of 10 jars each and 6 separate jars. You see only one box in this location, so the box you found should be placed in this location.

Scan the  AJ32B  item barcode (which is the barcode affixed                     to the box).  At the bottom of the screen, tap  Review . The Inventory                     Summary screen is opened. (This screen corresponds to the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN401000|IN401000]) Inventory Summary (IN401000) form in  Acumatica ERP.)  On this screen, you can see that the item is stored in the following                         locations:  MAIN ,  L1R3S2 ,  L2R3S2 , and  L3R3S2 . The                              MAIN  location is the receiving location far from the place where                         you found the box. Most likely, the box was taken from the racks with sorted                         items. You know that the box contains 10 jars, so this box can be stored in                         either the  L1R3S2  location or the  L3R3S2  location. As you can                         see on the screen, the  L2R3S2  location contains only 8 jars of this                         item, so the box definitely is not from this location. Now you need to find out which of the locations ( L1R3S2  or  L3R3S2 )                 contains less jam than the quantity that is recorded in the system.

To find out if the                      L1R3S2  or  L3R3S2  location contains less jam than the quantity that                 is recorded in the system, do the following in the  Acumatica                  mobile app: On the main menu of the mobile app, tap the  Warehouse Management Storage Lookup  tile to view the Item Lookup screen. Scan the  L1R3S2  location barcode. At the bottom of the screen, tap  Review . The Storage                     Summary screen is opened, where you can see that the on-hand quantity of the                          APJAM32  item is  13 , which corresponds to one box of 10 jars                     and 3 separate jars. So the box you have found is not from this location. Scan the  L3R3S2  location barcode. At the bottom of the screen, tap  Review . On the Storage                     Summary screen, you can see that the on-hand quantity of the  APJAM32  item                     is 26, which corresponds to two boxes of 10 jars each and 6 separate jars.

If the ''Warehouse Management'' and ''Fulfillment'' features are enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can perform the automated picking and packing of inventory items for shipping by using a barcode scanner or a mobile device with a scanning option.{br}

In this topic, you will read about the workflow for the automated picking and packing of inventory items in Acumatica ERP. The workflow in this topic is based on the assumption that your system has the recommended configuration described in [HelpRoot_WMS\WMS_Pick_Pack_Implem_Checklist|Picking and Packing Operations: Implementation Checklist].{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn about configuring and performing automated picking and packing. In particular, you will do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Enable the needed system features
*Specify the minimum required configuration for the automated picking and packing workflow
*Learn the recommended settings that you can specify to make the system fit your business requirements
*Pick the items for a shipment in an automated mode
*Pack the items into a box in an automated mode
*Confirm a shipment after picking and packing items

==Applicable Scenarios==
In your company&rsquo;s warehouses, picking processes and packing processes are completed by different warehouse workers. Each warehouse worker acting as a picker goes through the warehouse with a printed pick list, picks the items from the warehouse locations specified in the pick list, and transfers them to a packing line. A packer that works at the packing line selects the box for packing the shipment and packs the items; after the shipment is completely packed, the packer confirms the shipment. To track the operations as they are being performed, both pickers and packers scan the appropriate barcodes by using a barcode scanner or mobile device.{br}

You can perform automated picking of items for open shipments prepared for sales orders, transfer orders, and return orders (that is, the shipments of the ''Shipment'', ''Transfer'', and ''Receipt'' operation type specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form, respectively). You can perform automated packing for open shipments prepared for sales orders and transfer orders with at least one picked item.
==Workflow for the Automated Picking of Items==
The automated processing of picking items to be packed involves the actions shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#_9a92ac48-c9f2-40e0-be74-8656e0577935][anchor|#_15a75575-9e06-4bd9-be65-29b6a9a63fd9][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_WMS_Pick.png|popup|420px]
To process the picking of items by using Pick mode, you perform the following steps:[anchor|#_fc3acd1f-81f8-43c4-af60-3107a80987dc]
#''Switch to Pick mode''.
#:You open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) form (or the corresponding screen in the Acumatica mobile app) and switch to Pick mode by scanning or entering ''@pick'' barcode.
#''Scan the shipment number''.
#:To start the automated processing, you scan the reference number of the shipment to be processed. The system displays the lines of the scanned document in the table and inserts the reference number of the document that is currently selected for processing in the '''Shipment Nbr.''' box.
#''Scan the location barcode''.
#:When you scan the barcode of the location from which the item is picked, the system searches for the location in the lines of the document that is currently selected.
#''Scan the item barcode''.
#:When you scan the barcode of the picked item, the system searches for the item in the lines of the currently selected document. If the UOM defined by the barcode of the scanned item is specified for a non-base unit of measure (UOM), the system converts the item quantity defined by this barcode to the picked quantity in the base unit of measure for this item. The system displays the picked quantity in the '''Picked Qty.''' column and highlights the line (in bold if the line has been picked partially, or in green if the line has been picked in full). 
#Optional: ''Scan the item quantity''.
#:To change the picked quantity in the line that is currently being processed, you switch to Quantity Editing mode by scanning or entering the <tt>&#42;qty</tt> barcode, and manually enter the quantity in the UOM of defined by the barcode of the scanned item.
#''Pick another line''.
#:If another item needs to be picked for the currently selected location, you scan the item barcode (return to Step 4) and repeat the process for the item.
#''Pick items from another location''.
#:If you need to pick items from another location, you scan the location barcode (return to Step 3), and repeat the process for the location.
#:If you have finished the picking operation, to proceed with packaging, you scan the <tt>@pack</tt> barcode to switch to Pack mode.

==Workflow for the Automated Packing of Items==
The automated processing of packing items that have been picked involves the actions shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#_77d3f58a-f1be-4985-8508-9820d3c5b2a6][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_WMS_Pack.png|popup|400px]
To process the packing of items (and use Pack mode) after picking them, you perform the following steps:[anchor|#_7bef02b8-d7c5-4ee8-998c-3cd6748f2317]
#''Switch to Pack mode''.
#:You open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) form (or the corresponding screen in the Acumatica mobile app) and switch to Pack mode by scanning or entering ''@pack'' barcode.
#''Scan the document number''.
#:To start automated processing, you scan the reference number of the shipment to be processed. (If you have switched to Pack mode from Pick mode with the document selected, the document is selected automatically.) The system shows the lines of the document in the table and inserts the reference number of the document that is currently selected for processing in the '''Shipment Nbr.''' box.
#''Scan the barcode of the box''.
#:You scan the barcode of the box into which the items will be packed.
#:((({S:Warn}If the ''Automatic Packaging'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, this step is performed automatically.
)))
#''Scan the item barcode''.
#:When you scan the barcode of the packed item, the system searches for the item in the lines of the document that is currently selected. If the UOM defined by the barcode of the scanned item corresponds to a non-base unit of measure, the system converts the item quantity defined by this barcode to the packed quantity in the base unit of measure for this item. The system also shows the packed quantity in the '''Packed Qty.''' column, and highlights the line (in bold if the line has been processed partially, or in green if the line has been processed in full).
#Optional: ''Scan the item quantity''.
#:To change the quantity of packed items in the line that is currently being processed, you switch to Quantity Editing mode by scanning or entering the <tt>&#42;qty</tt> barcode, and manually enter the quantity in the UOM defined by the barcode of the scanned item.
#''Pack another line''.
#:If another item needs to be packed in the current box, you return to scanning the item barcode (return to Step 4) and repeat the process for the item. 
#Optional: ''Confirm the box''.
#:If all items are packed in a single box, you confirm the box by scanning the <tt>&#42;ok</tt> barcode or by clicking the '''OK''' button. If the items are packed in multiple boxes, the system automatically confirms the current box when you scan the barcode of the next box to be packed for the current shipment.
#:((({S:Warn}If the ''Automatic Packaging'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, this step is performed automatically for the shipments that are being packed to a single box that the system has suggested automatically.
)))
#Optional: ''Enter the box weight''.
#:You enter the total weight of the box if the weight cannot be calculated by the system based on the item settings.
#''Pack another box''.
#:If more items need to be packed to another box for the current shipment, you return to scanning the barcode of the box barcode (return to Step 3) and repeat the process for another box. 
#''Complete the packing process''.
#:If you have finished the packing operation and you don’t need to specify shipping options, you scan the <tt>&#42;confirm&#42;shipment</tt> barcode or click the '''Confirm Shipment''' button on the form toolbar. The system confirms the shipment that is currently being processed.

==Known Process Limitations==
If the ''Automatic Packaging'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, a user can process in Pack mode only shipments packed to a single box. Processing of shipments packed to two or more boxes in Pack mode is currently not supported. ]]></column>

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Picking and Packing Operations: Process Activity (Mobile) In the following activity, you will learn how to perform the picking and packing of items         for a shipment  by using the Pick, Pack, and Ship screen of the  Acumatica  mobile application, which corresponds to the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) Pick, Pack, and Ship (SO302020) form of  Acumatica ERP. The following activity is based on the                  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system settings             have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the activity             and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100  dataset             to its initial state. Story Suppose that you are a warehouse worker of the wholesale warehouse of the SweetLife Fruits         & Jams company. Your warehouse manager gives you a task to prepare a shipment with the         help of the  Acumatica  mobile app. In your organization, the pick and pack         workflow is used, which means that you go through the warehouse locations and pick the items         listed in the shipment pick list. Then you go to the packing line and pack the picked items         into boxes. Configuration Overview In the  U100  dataset, the following features have been enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, where they are in the  Inventory           and Order Management  group of features: Warehouse Management Fulfillment On the  Warehouse Management  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences (SO101000) form, the  Display the Pick Tab  and the            Display the Pack Tab  check boxes are selected. The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in the         system: A warehouse on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses (IN204000) form:              WHOLESALE . On the  Locations  tab of the form, multiple           warehouse locations are configured. The following stock items on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500)           form:  APJAM96 ,  ORJAM96 ,  LEMJAM96 . For each stock item, barcodes have           been specified on the  Cross-Reference  tab of the form. Also, a sales order for the  COFFEESHOP  customer has been entered in the system on         the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, and a shipment document has been         prepared for this order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) form. Process Overview In this activity, in the  Acumatica  mobile app, you will open the Pick,         Pack, and Ship screen (which corresponds to the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) Pick, Pack, and Ship (SO302020)         form in  Acumatica ERP), switch to Pick mode and scan the number of the shipment from the pick list.

If the ''Warehouse Management'' and ''Fulfillment'' features are enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can perform the automated packing of inventory items for shipping by using a barcode scanner or a mobile device with a scanning option.{br}

In this topic, you will read about the workflow for the automated packing of inventory items in Acumatica ERP. The workflow in this topic is based on the assumption that your system has the recommended configuration described in [HelpRoot_WMS\WMS_Pack_Implem_Checklist|Packing Operations: Implementation Checklist].{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn about configuring and performing automated packing. In particular, you will do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Enable the needed system features
*Specify the minimum required configuration for the automated packing workflow
*Learn the recommended settings that you can specify to make the system fit your business requirements
*Pack items for a shipment in an automated mode
*Confirm a shipment after packing the items

==Applicable Scenarios==
In your company&rsquo;s warehouses, there is no separate packing line, so each warehouse worker goes through the warehouse with a printed pick list, picks the items from the warehouse locations specified in the pick list, and immediately packs the items into a box for shipping. The warehouse worker then confirms the shipment. To track the performed operations, the warehouse worker scans the appropriate barcodes by using a barcode scanner or mobile device.{br}

You can perform automated packing for open shipments prepared for sales orders and transfer orders (that is, the shipments of the ''Shipment'' and ''Transfer'' operation type specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form, respectively).
==Workflow for the Automated Packing of Items==
The automated processing of packing items involves the actions shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#_11398c96-3c05-4f35-b204-60fb5d4775ae][anchor|#_b4d8d5b0-6877-4d4f-b219-92cfb7014a21][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_WMS_Pack_Only.png|popup|380px]
To process the packing of items (and use Pack mode) without picking them, you perform the following steps: [anchor|#_540f2ba7-75be-494c-a788-24cf820a187f]
#''Switch to Pack mode''.
#:You open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) form (or the corresponding screen in the Acumatica mobile app) and switch to Pack mode by scanning or entering ''@pack'' barcode.
#''Scan the document number''.
#:To start the automated processing, you scan the reference number of the shipment to be processed. The system shows the lines of the scanned document in the table and inserts the reference number of the document that is currently selected for processing in the '''Shipment Nbr.''' box.
#''Scan the barcode of the box''.
#:You scan the barcode of the box to which the items will be packed.
#:((({S:Warn}If the ''Automatic Packaging'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, this step is performed automatically.
)))
#''Scan the location barcode''.
#:When you scan the barcode of the location from which the item is being taken for packing, the system searches for the location in the lines of the document that is currently selected.
#''Scan the item barcode''.
#:When you scan the item barcode of the packed item, the system searches for the item in the lines of the document that is currently selected. If the UOM defined by the barcode of the scanned item corresponds to a non-base unit of measure, the system converts the item quantity defined by this barcode to the packed quantity in the base unit of measure for this item; the system also displays the packed quantity in the '''Packed Qty.''' column, and highlights the line (in bold if the line is processed partially, or in green if the line is processed in full).
#Optional: ''Scan the item quantity''.
#:To change the packed quantity in the line that is currently being processed, you switch to Quantity Editing mode by scanning or entering the <tt>&#42;qty</tt> barcode, and manually enter the quantity in the UOM defined by the barcode of the scanned item.
#''Pack another line''.
#:If another item needs to be packed in the current box, you return to scanning the item barcode (that is, return to Step 4) and repeat the process for the item. 
#Optional: ''Confirm the package''.
#:If all items are packed in a single box, you confirm the box by scanning the <tt>&#42;ok</tt> barcode or by clicking the '''OK''' button. If the items are packed in multiple boxes, the system automatically confirms the current box when you scan the barcode of the next box to be packed for the current shipment.
#:((({S:Warn}If the ''Automatic Packaging'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, this step is performed automatically.
)))
#Optional: ''Enter the box weight''.
#:You enter the total weight of the box if the weight cannot be calculated by the system based on the item settings.
#''Pack another box''.
#:If at least one other item needs to be packed for the current shipment, you return to scanning the barcode of the box (that is, return to Step 3) and repeat the process for another box. 
#''Complete the packing process''.
#:If you have finished the packing operation and you don&rsquo;t need to specify shipping options, you scan the <tt>&#42;confirm&#42;shipment</tt> barcode or click the '''Confirm Shipment''' button on the form toolbar. The system confirms the shipment that is currently being processed.

==Known Process Limitations==
If the ''Automatic Packaging'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, a user can process in Pack mode only shipments packed to a single box. The processing of shipments packed in two or more boxes in Pack mode is currently not supported. ]]></column>

Optional:  Confirm the package . If all items are packed in a single box, you             confirm the box by scanning the  *ok  barcode or by clicking the                OK  button. If the items are packed in multiple boxes, the             system automatically confirms the current box when you scan the barcode of the next box             to be packed for the current shipment. If the  Automatic Packaging              feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS101000) form, this step is             performed automatically. Optional:  Enter the box weight . You enter the total weight of the box if the             weight cannot be calculated by the system based on the item settings. Pack another box . If at least one other item needs to be packed for the current             shipment, you return to scanning the barcode of the box (that is, return to Step 3) and             repeat the process for another box.  Complete the packing process . If you have finished the packing operation and             you don't need to specify shipping options, you scan the                *confirm*shipment  barcode or click the  Confirm               Shipment  button on the form toolbar. The system confirms the shipment that             is currently being processed. Known Process Limitations If the  Automatic Packaging  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features         (CS100000) form, a user can process in Pack mode only shipments packed to a single box. The         processing of shipments packed in two or more boxes in Pack mode is currently not supported.        ]]></column>

To avoid any issues, restore the ''U100'' dataset to its initial state.
)))
==Story==
Suppose that you are a warehouse worker of the wholesale warehouse of the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company. Your warehouse manager gives you a task to pack a shipment. In your organization, the pack workflow is used, which means that you go through the warehouse locations, take the items, and pack the items into boxes for shipping.
==Configuration Overview==
In the ''U100'' dataset, the following features have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, where they are in the ''Inventory and Order Management'' group of features:[anchor|#ul_wqn_zy2_3fb]
*''Warehouse Management''
* ''Fulfillment''

The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in the system:[anchor|#ul_ghb_r2d_pfb]
*A warehouse on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form: ''WHOLESALE''. On the '''Locations''' tab of the form, multiple warehouse locations are configured.
*The following stock items on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form: ''APJAM96'', ''ORJAM96'', and ''LEMJAM96''. For each stock item, barcodes have been specified on the '''Cross-Reference''' tab of the form.

Also, a sales order to ''COFFEESHOP'' customer has been entered on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, and a shipment document has been prepared for this order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form.
==Process Overview==
In this activity, you will open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) form, switch to Pack mode, and scan the number of the shipment from the pick list. Then you will scan the barcode of the box to which you pack the items, and the barcode of the location from which you take the items. Then you will scan the item barcode and quantity of items being packed into the box. After you finish packing the items, you will confirm the shipment.[anchor|#_0e271378-2a8d-4a9a-886a-1a4f0f73afe5]((({S:Warn}In any working mode, you enter a command or barcode by typing it in the '''Scan''' box and pressing Enter. In production systems, you will scan the appropriate barcodes rather than manually entering them.
)))
==System Preparation==
Before you start the automated packing operations, you need to perform the following instructions:[anchor|#_8ac27484-abad-4e71-a38e-73dcd89e1adb]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded by using the ''perkins'' login and the ''123'' password.
#On the '''Warehouse Management''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form, clear the '''Display the Pick Tab''' check box and make sure the '''Display the Pack Tab''' check box is selected.
#Save your changes

==Step 1: Packing Items for Shipping==
To record that items to be added to a shipment have been picked from the warehouse locations and packed into boxes, do the following:[anchor|#_4f35f2a1-2af2-4ad8-b372-f43b83cfeda4]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) form, and make sure the '''Pack''' tab is opened.
#In the '''Scan''' box of the Summary area, enter <tt>000031</tt>, which is the reference number of the shipment for which you are performing picking and packing operations. The system loads the shipment lines to the table on the '''Pack''' tab, and shows the reference number of the shipment that is currently being processed in the '''Shipment Nbr.''' box of the Summary area.
#Enter ''MEDIUM'' to select the box to which the items are packed.
#Enter ''L3R2S2'' to specify the next location from which the items are taken.
#Enter <tt>AJ08</tt> to select the item being packed. The system highlights the first line of the shipment in bold and specifies ''1'' as the '''Picked Quantity''' and '''Packed Quantity'''.
#Set the quantity of the current line to <tt>10</tt> as follows:
##On the form toolbar, click '''Set Qty'''. The system prompts you to enter the item quantity.
##In the '''Scan''' box, type <tt>10</tt>. The system highlights the first line of the shipment in green and specifies ''10'' as the '''Picked Quantity''' and ''' Packed Quantity'''.
#Enter ''L2R1S3'' to specify the next location from which the items are taken.
#Enter <tt>OJ32</tt> to select the item being packed.
#Set the quantity of the item to <tt>7</tt>.
#On the form toolbar, click '''OK''' to confirm the package.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Confirm Shipment''' to confirm the shipment document, which is assigned the ''Confirmed'' status.

==Step 2: Reviewing the Shipment==
To review the result and make sure that the shipment has been confirmed, do the following:[anchor|#_02b617de-6682-403a-9f1d-5d0fdebd3c7f]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form, open the shipment with the ''000031'' reference number that you have processed in the previous step. It now is assigned the ''Confirmed'' status.
#Review the '''Packages''' tab. Notice that one ''MEDIUM'' box is shown in the upper table, and the '''Contents of Selected Package''' table shows the items that you have packed into this box, as shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_8d10367d-d40b-429c-ae66-07ed775c08a8][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_WMS_Pack.png|popup|Confirmed shipment|450px]
#On the '''Warehouse Management''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form, select the '''Display the Pick Tab''' check box and save your changes.

In this topic, you will read about the workflow for the automated receiving and putting away of inventory items in Acumatica ERP. The workflow in this topic is based on the assumption that your system has the recommended configuration described in [HelpRoot_WMS\WMS_Receive_Put_Away_Implem_Checklist|Receiving and Putting Away Operations: Implementation Checklist].{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn about configuring and performing automated receiving and putting away. In particular, you will do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Enable the needed system features
*Specify the minimum required configuration for the automated receiving and putting away workflow
*Learn the recommended settings that you can specify to make the system fit your business requirements
*Receive items to a receiving location of a warehouse in an automated mode
*Put away items in their storage locations in an automated mode

==Applicable Scenarios==
You can perform the automated receiving and putting away of inventory items if in your company&rsquo;s warehouses, all purchased items are received to a dedicated location. A warehouse worker receives items from a purchase receipt to this location. Then the warehouse worker puts away the received items in the locations where the items will be stored. To track the operations as they are being performed, the worker scans the appropriate barcodes by using a barcode scanner or mobile device.{br}

You can perform automated receiving of items for purchase orders with the ''Open'' status on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, and purchase receipts and purchase returns with the ''Balanced'' status on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form. You can perform the automated putting away of items for purchase receipts with the ''Released'' status on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form.
==Workflow for the Automated Receipt of Items==
The automated processing of receiving items involves the actions shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#_9a92ac48-c9f2-40e0-be74-8656e0577935][anchor|#_15a75575-9e06-4bd9-be65-29b6a9a63fd9][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_WMS_Receive.png|popup|390px]
To process the receipt of items (and to use Receive mode), you perform the following steps:[anchor|#_9079e2ce-98a2-4b28-b448-5025e22a7f6f]
#''Switch to Receive mode''.
#:You open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_20|Receive and Put Away] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302020|PO302020]) form (or the corresponding screen in the Acumatica mobile app) and switch to Receive mode by scanning or entering ''@receive'' barcode.
#''Scan the document number''.
#:To start the automated processing, you scan the reference number of the purchase order, purchase receipt, or purchase return document to be processed. The system displays the lines of the scanned document in the table. If you have scanned the purchase order number, the system creates and saves the related purchase receipt automatically. In the '''Receipt Nbr.''' box, the system inserts the reference number of the receipt or return that is currently selected for processing.
#''Scan the barcode of the receiving location''.
#:You scan the barcode of the warehouse location where the items are being received.
#''Scan the item barcode''.
#:When you scan the barcode of the received item, the system searches for the item in the lines of the document that is currently selected. If the item is found, the system highlights the line with bold. If the UOM defined by the barcode of the scanned item corresponds to a non-base unit of measure, the system converts the item quantity defined by this barcode to the received quantity in the base unit of measure for this item.
#Optional: ''Scan the item quantity''.
#:To change the received quantity in the line that is currently being processed, you switch on Quantity Editing mode by scanning or entering the <tt>&#42;qty</tt> barcode, and manually enter the quantity in the UOM defined by the barcode of the scanned item..
#Optional: ''Scan the barcode to confirm the received quantity''.
#:If no more changes are needed for the line that is currently being processed, you scan the <tt>&#42;ok</tt> barcode or click the '''OK''' button to confirm the received quantity.
#''Receive another item''.
#:If you need to receive at least one other item for the document currently being processed, you return to scanning the item barcode (that is, return to Step 4) and repeat the process for the item.
#''Receive items in another location''.
#:If items must be received in another warehouse location, you scan the barcode of this location (return to Step 3) and repeat the process for the next location.
#''Complete the receiving process''.
#:If you have finished the receiving operation but not all items have been received for the purchase receipt (and they will not be received in the future), you scan the <tt>&#42;complete&#42;polines</tt> barcode, or click the '''Complete PO Lines''' button. The system marks all purchase receipt lines as completed and releases the purchase receipt.
#:If you have finished the receiving operation and all items have been received for the purchase receipt (or the items were received partially and more items will be received in the future), you scan the <tt>&#42;release&#42;receipt</tt> barcode or click the '''Release Receipt''' button. The system does not mark partially received lines as completed and releases the purchase receipt.

==Workflow for the Automated Putting Away of Items==
The automated processing of putting away items involves the actions shown in the following diagram. [anchor|#_a2be4902-fdfa-4e1a-b828-e028d42f8fac][anchor|#_84647252-944b-4fe1-b54d-f001df68cad4][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_WMS_Put_Away.png|popup|450px]
To process the putting away of items by using Put Away mode, you perform the following steps:[anchor|#_6dd4e1fb-e362-4aa3-a79c-1246a336a887]
#''Switch to Put Away mode''.
#:You open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_20|Receive and Put Away] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302020|PO302020]) form (or the corresponding screen in the Acumatica mobile app) and switch to Put Away mode by scanning or entering ''@putaway'' barcode.
#''Scan the document number''.
#:To start the automated processing, you scan the reference number of the released purchase receipt to be processed. (If you switch to Put Away mode from Receive mode with a document selected, the system selects the document automatically.) The system displays the lines of the scanned document in the table. In the '''Receipt Nbr.''' box, the system inserts the reference number of the document that is currently selected for processing.
#''Scan the barcode of the destination location''.
#:You scan the barcode of the destination location in which you are putting away items. If the items of a particular line are put away in multiple locations, the system splits the line by locations and shows &lt;SPLIT&gt; in the '''Location''' column. You can review the IDs of the locations to which the items are put away by clicking '''Transfer Allocations''' on the table toolbar of the '''Put Away''' tab.
#:Once you have specified the destination location, the system automatically creates a single-step inventory transfer document that reflects the movement of the items from the receiving location to the storage location.
#''Scan the barcode of the item''.
#:When you scan the barcode of the received item, the system searches for the item in the lines of the document that is currently selected. If the UOM defined by the barcode of the scanned item corresponds to a non-base unit of measure, the system converts the item quantity defined by this barcode to the put away quantity in the base unit of measure for this item. To indicate the line or lines with the scanned barcode, the system selects the '''Matched''' check box in these lines. The system highlights the lines in bold if they are processed partially, and in green if they are processed in full.
#Optional: ''Scan the item quantity''.
#:To change the quantity being put away in the line that is currently being processed, you switch to Quantity Editing mode by scanning or entering the <tt>&#42;qty</tt> barcode, and manually enter the quantity in the UOM defined by the barcode of the scanned item.
#''Scan another item''.
#:If at least one other item needs to be put away, you return to scanning the barcode of the item (that is, return to Step 4) and repeat the process for the item.
#''Scan another destination location''.
#:If items must be transferred to another destination location, you scan the barcode of this location (return to Step 3) and repeat the process.
#''Complete the process of putting items away''.
#:When you have finished the operation of putting away items, you scan the <tt>&#42;release&#42;transfer</tt> barcode or click the '''Release Transfer''' button. The system releases the inventory transfer document that was prepared during the automated operation; the items are moved to the destination locations.

==Receipt of Extra Quantity==
If the actual quantity of received items is more than the quantity specified in the processed purchase document, you can process the receipt of these items as an automated operation as well. If you scan a quantity that exceeds the quantity in the line that is currently being processed, the system requests confirmation for adding this quantity. If you confirm this addition with the <tt>&#42;ok</tt> barcode or the '''OK''' button, the system adds a new line with the extra quantity to the processed purchase receipt document, and shows this line in the table on the '''Receive''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_20|Receive and Put Away] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302020|PO302020]) form. The line with the extra quantity is not linked to the purchase order for which the purchase receipt was prepared.]]></column>

The system does not mark partially             received lines as completed and releases the purchase receipt. Workflow for the Automated Putting Away of Items The automated processing of putting away items involves the actions shown in the following         diagram.  To process the putting away of items by using Put Away mode, you perform the following         steps: Switch to Put Away             mode . You open             the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302020|PO302020]) Receive and Put Away (PO302020) form (or the corresponding screen in the                Acumatica  mobile app) and switch to Put Away mode by scanning or             entering  @putaway  barcode. Scan the document number . To start the automated processing, you scan the             reference number of the released purchase receipt to be processed. (If you switch to Put             Away mode from Receive mode with a document selected, the system selects the document             automatically.) The system displays the lines of the scanned document in the table. In             the  Receipt Nbr.  box, the system inserts the reference number of             the document that is currently selected for processing. Scan the barcode of the destination location . You scan the barcode of the             destination location in which you are putting away items. If the items of a particular             line are put away in multiple locations, the system              splits the line by             locations and shows <SPLIT> in the  Location              column . You can review the IDs of the locations to which the items are             put away by clicking  Transfer Allocations  on the table toolbar of             the  Put Away  tab. Once you have specified the destination             location, the system automatically creates a single-step inventory transfer document             that reflects the movement of the items from the receiving location to the storage             location. Scan the barcode of the item . When you scan the barcode of the received item,             the system searches for the item in the lines of the document that is currently             selected.  If the UOM             defined by the barcode of the scanned item corresponds to a non-base unit of measure,             the system converts the item quantity defined by this barcode to the put away quantity             in the base unit of measure for this item.  To indicate the line or             lines with the scanned barcode, the system selects the  Matched              check box in these lines. The system highlights the lines in bold if they are processed             partially, and in green if they are processed in full. Optional:  Scan the item quantity . To change the quantity being put away in the             line that is currently being processed, you switch to Quantity Editing mode by scanning             or entering the  *qty  barcode, and manually enter              the quantity in the UOM             defined by the barcode of the scanned item . Scan another item . If at least one other item needs to be put away, you return             to scanning the barcode of the item (that is, return to Step 4) and repeat the process             for the item. Scan another destination location . If items must be transferred to another             destination location, you scan the barcode of this location (return to Step 3) and             repeat the process. Complete the process of putting items away . When you have finished the             operation of putting away items, you scan the  *release*transfer              barcode or click the  Release Transfer  button. The system releases             the inventory transfer document that was prepared during the automated operation; the             items are moved to the destination locations. Receipt of Extra Quantity If the actual quantity of received items is more than the quantity specified in the         processed purchase document, you can process the receipt of these items as an automated         operation as well. If you scan a quantity that exceeds the quantity in the line that is         currently being processed, the system requests confirmation for adding this quantity. If you         confirm this addition with the  *ok  barcode or the            OK  button, the system adds a new line with the extra quantity to         the processed purchase receipt document, and shows this line in the table on the            Receive  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302020|PO302020]) Receive and Put Away (PO302020) form.         The line with the extra quantity is not linked to the purchase order for which the purchase         receipt was prepared. ]]></column>

)))
==Story==
Suppose that you are a warehouse worker in the wholesale warehouse of the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company. Your warehouse manager gives you a task to receive the purchased fruits (80 pounds of apples and 60 pounds of oranges) in the warehouse. In your organization, the receive and put away workflow is used, which means that you receive the purchased items at a receiving location of the warehouse, and then go through the warehouse locations and put away the items in the locations where the fruits are stored. Also suppose that you are putting away the apples and part of the oranges in one fruit location, and the rest of the oranges in another fruit location.
==Configuration Overview==
In the ''U100'' dataset, the following features have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, where they are in the ''Inventory and Order Management'' group of features:[anchor|#ul_wqn_zy2_3fb]
*''Warehouse Management''
* ''Receiving''

On the '''Warehouse Management''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form, the '''Display the Receive Tab''' and '''Display the Put Away Tab''' check boxes are selected.{br}

The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in the system:[anchor|#ul_ghb_r2d_pfb]
*A warehouse on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form: ''WHOLESALE''. On the '''Locations''' tab of the form, multiple warehouse locations reflecting the warehouse structure have been configured.
*The following stock items on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form: ''APPLES'' and ''ORANGES''. For each stock item, barcodes have been specified on the '''Cross-Reference''' tab of the form.

Also, a purchase order to the ''ALLFRUITS'' vendor has been entered on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, and a purchase receipt has been prepared for this order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form.
==Process Overview==
In this activity, you will open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_20|Receive and Put Away] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302020|PO302020]) form, switch to Receive mode, and scan the number of the purchase receipt. Then you will receive the items and scan their barcodes and quantities. After you finish receiving items, you will switch to Put Away mode on the same form and scan the barcodes of the warehouse locations to which the items are being put away, and scan the item barcodes and quantities. After you finish putting away items, you will release the transfer receipt.[anchor|#_8b8114e9-7008-48b5-ada6-5b1ac0d83371]((({S:Warn}In any working mode, you enter a command or barcode by typing it in the '''Scan''' box and pressing Enter. In production systems, you will scan the appropriate barcodes rather than manually entering them.
)))
==System Preparation==
Before you start the automated receiving and putting away operations, you need to perform the following instructions:[anchor|#_1920f95c-9a2f-459d-9b77-2ee5a71573dc]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded by using the ''perkins'' login and the ''123'' password.
#On the '''Warehouse Management''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form, make sure that the '''Display the Receive Tab''' and '''Display the Put Away''' tab check boxes are selected.

==Step 1: Receiving Items in the Receiving Location==
To record that items have been received in the receiving location of the warehouse, do the following:[anchor|#_4f35f2a1-2af2-4ad8-b372-f43b83cfeda4]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_20|Receive and Put Away] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302020|PO302020]) form and make sure the '''Receive''' tab is opened.
#In the '''Scan''' box of the Summary area, enter <tt>000018</tt>, which is the reference number of the purchase receipt for which you are receiving and putting away items. The system loads the purchase receipt lines to the table, and shows the reference number of the purchase receipt that is currently being processed in the '''Receipt Nbr.''' box of the Summary area.
#Enter <tt>MAIN</tt> to select the location in which you are receiving the items.
#Enter <tt>AP1LB</tt> to select the item being received. The system highlights the first line of the purchase receipt in bold and specifies ''1'' as the '''Received Quantity'''.
#Set the quantity of the item to <tt>80</tt> as follows:
##On the form toolbar, click '''Set Qty'''. The system prompts you to enter the item quantity.
##In the '''Scan''' box, enter <tt>80</tt>. The system highlights the first line of the purchase receipt in green and specifies ''80'' as the '''Received Quantity'''.
#Enter <tt>OR1LB</tt> to select the item being received. The system highlights the second line of the purchase receipt in bold and specifies ''1'' as the '''Received Quantity'''.
#Set the quantity of the current line to ''60''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Release Receipt''' to release the purchase receipt. The system releases the purchase receipt and generates the inventory receipt transaction to record the receipt of items in the ''MAIN'' location of the warehouse.

You have received the items for the purchase receipt, and now you can proceed with putting away the received items in the storage locations.
==Step 2: Putting Away the Received Items in the Storage Locations==
To record that items are being put away from the receiving location of the warehouse in the locations where these items will be stored, do the following:[anchor|#_00af4e49-d6ab-4cdc-bb9a-0bc2877aa3e5]
#While you are still on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_20|Receive and Put Away] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302020|PO302020]) form with the ''000018'' purchase receipt selected, in the '''Scan''' box, enter ''@putaway'' to switch to Put Away mode. 
#Enter <tt>F1S2</tt> to select the location to which the items are being put away.
#Enter <tt>AP1LB</tt> to select the item to be put away in this location. The system highlights the first line of the purchase receipt in bold and specifies ''1'' as the '''Put Away Qty.''' In the Summary area, the '''Transfer Ref. Nbr.''' box shows the reference number of the inventory transfer transaction that the system automatically creates to record the movement of items from the receiving location to the storage locations.
#Set the quantity of the item to <tt>80</tt> as follows:
##On the form toolbar, click '''Set Qty'''. The system prompts you to enter the item quantity.
##In the '''Scan''' box, type <tt>80</tt>. The system highlights the first line of the purchase receipt in green and specifies ''80'' as the '''Put Away Quantity''', indicating that 80 pounds of apples have been put away on the second shelf of the first fruit location.
#Enter <tt>OR1LB</tt> to select the item being put away.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Receiving and Putting Away Operations: Process Activity In the following activity, you will learn how to perform the receiving and putting                 away of items by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302020|PO302020]) Receive and Put Away (PO302020) form. The following activity is based on the                  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system settings             have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the activity             and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100  dataset             to its initial state. Story Suppose that you are a warehouse worker in the wholesale warehouse of the SweetLife                 Fruits & Jams company. Your warehouse manager gives you a task to receive the                 purchased fruits (80 pounds of apples and 60 pounds of oranges) in the warehouse. In                 your organization, the receive and put away workflow is used, which means that you                 receive the purchased items at a receiving location of the warehouse, and then go                 through the warehouse locations and put away the items in the locations where the                 fruits are stored. Also suppose that you are putting away the apples and part of the                 oranges in one fruit location, and the rest of the oranges in another fruit                 location. Configuration Overview In the  U100  dataset, the following features have been enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, where they are in the                      Inventory and Order Management  group of features: Warehouse Management Receiving On the  Warehouse Management  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) Purchase Orders Preferences (PO301000) form, the  Display the Receive                     Tab  and  Display the Put Away Tab  check boxes                 are selected. The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in                 the system: A warehouse on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses (IN204000) form:                          WHOLESALE . On the  Locations  tab of the form,                     multiple warehouse locations reflecting the warehouse structure have been                     configured. The following stock items on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items                     (IN202500) form:  APPLES  and  ORANGES . For each stock item, barcodes                     have been specified on the  Cross-Reference  tab of the                     form. Also, a purchase order to the  ALLFRUITS  vendor has been entered on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form, and a purchase receipt has been                 prepared for this order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form. Process Overview In this activity, you will                  open the                       ([~/?ScreenId=PO302020|PO302020]) Receive and Put Away (PO302020)                 form , switch to                 Receive mode,  and scan the number of the purchase receipt. Then                 you will receive the items and scan their barcodes and quantities. After you finish                 receiving items, you will switch to Put Away mode on the same form and scan the                 barcodes of the warehouse locations to which the items are being put away, and scan                 the item barcodes and quantities. After you finish putting away items, you will                 release the transfer receipt. In any working mode, you enter a command or barcode             by typing it in the  Scan  box and pressing Enter. In production             systems, you will scan the appropriate barcodes rather than manually entering             them. System Preparation Before you start the automated receiving and putting away operations, you need to                 perform the following instructions: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the  U100  dataset preloaded by                     using the                          perkins                      login and the  123  password. On the  Warehouse Management  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) Purchase Orders Preferences (PO301000) form, make sure that the                          Display the Receive Tab  and  Display the                         Put Away  tab check boxes are selected. Step 1: Receiving Items in the Receiving Location To record that items have been received in the receiving location of the warehouse,                 do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302020|PO302020]) Receive and Put Away (PO302020) form and make sure the                          Receive  tab is opened. In the  Scan  box of the Summary area, enter                          000018 , which is the reference number of the purchase                     receipt for which you are receiving and putting away items. The system loads the                     purchase receipt lines to the table, and shows the reference number of the                     purchase receipt that is currently being processed in the  Receipt                         Nbr.  box of the Summary area. Enter  MAIN  to select the location in which you are                     receiving the items. Enter  AP1LB  to select the item being received.

Set the quantity of the item to  80  as follows: On the form toolbar, click  Set Qty . The system                             prompts you to enter the item quantity. In the  Scan  box, enter  80 .                             The system highlights the first line of the purchase receipt in green                             and specifies  80  as the  Received                             Quantity . Enter  OR1LB  to select the item being received. The system                     highlights the second line of the purchase receipt in bold and specifies                          1  as the  Received Quantity . Set the quantity of the current line to  60 . On the form toolbar, click  Release Receipt  to release the                     purchase receipt. The system releases the purchase receipt and generates the                     inventory receipt transaction to record the receipt of items in the  MAIN                      location of the warehouse. You have received the items for the purchase receipt, and now you can proceed with                 putting away the received items in the storage locations. Step 2: Putting Away the Received Items in the Storage Locations To record that items are being put away from the receiving location of the warehouse                 in the locations where these items will be stored, do the following: While you are still on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302020|PO302020]) Receive and Put Away (PO302020) form with                     the  000018  purchase receipt selected, in the  Scan                      box, enter  @putaway  to switch to Put Away mode.  Enter  F1S2  to select the location to which the items are                     being put away. Enter  AP1LB  to select the item to be put away in this                     location. The system highlights the first line of the purchase receipt in bold                     and specifies  1  as the  Put Away Qty.  In the                     Summary area, the  Transfer Ref. Nbr.  box shows the                     reference number of the inventory transfer transaction that the system                     automatically creates to record the movement of items from the receiving                     location to the storage locations. Set the quantity of the item to  80  as follows: On the form toolbar, click  Set Qty . The system                             prompts you to enter the item quantity. In the  Scan  box, type  80 .                             The system highlights the first line of the purchase receipt in green                             and specifies  80  as the  Put Away Quantity ,                             indicating that 80 pounds of apples have been put away on the second                             shelf of the first fruit location. Enter  OR1LB  to select the item being put away.  Set the quantity of the line to  40 , indicating that 40                     pounds of oranges have been put away on the second shelf of the first fruit                     location.  Enter  F2S2  to select another location to which the rest                     of the oranges is being put away. Enter  OR1LB  to select the item being put away. The system                     shows  <SPLIT>  in the  To Location ID  box,                     indicating that the items are being put away in multiple locations.

==Story==
Suppose that you are a warehouse worker in the wholesale warehouse of the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company. Your warehouse manager gives you a task to receive the purchased fruits (70 pounds of apples and 50 pounds of oranges) in the warehouse with the help of the Acumatica mobile app. In your organization, the receive and put away workflow is used, which means that you receive the purchased items at a receiving location of the warehouse, and then go through the warehouse locations and put away the items in the locations where the fruits are stored. Also suppose that you put away the apples and part of the oranges in one fruit location, and the rest of the oranges in another fruit location.
==Configuration Overview==
In the ''U100'' dataset, the following features have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, where they are in the ''Inventory and Order Management'' group of features:[anchor|#ul_wqn_zy2_3fb]

The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in the system:[anchor|#ul_ghb_r2d_pfb]
*A warehouse on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form: ''WHOLESALE''. On the '''Locations''' tab of the form, multiple warehouse locations reflecting the warehouse structure have been configured.
*The following stock items on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form: ''APPLES'' and ''ORANGES''. For each stock item, barcodes have been specified on the '''Cross-Reference''' tab of the form.

Also, a purchase order to the ''ALLFRUITS'' vendor has been entered on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, and a purchase receipt has been prepared for this order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form.
==Process Overview==
In this activity, you will open the Receive and Put Away screen in the Acumatica mobile app, switch to Receive mode, and scan the number of the purchase order. Then you will receive the items and scan their barcodes and quantities. After you finish receiving items, you will switch to Put Away mode on the same form, scan the barcodes of the warehouse locations to which the items are being put away, scan the item barcodes, and correct the quantities (if needed). After you finish putting away items, you will release the transfer receipt.
==System Preparation==

Your warehouse manager gives you a task to receive the                 purchased fruits (70 pounds of apples and 50 pounds of oranges) in the warehouse                 with the help of the  Acumatica  mobile app. In your organization,                 the receive and put away workflow is used, which means that you receive the                 purchased items at a receiving location of the warehouse, and then go through the                 warehouse locations and put away the items in the locations where the fruits are                 stored. Also suppose that you put away the apples and part of the oranges in one                 fruit location, and the rest of the oranges in another fruit location. Configuration Overview In the  U100  dataset, the following features have been enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, where they are in the                      Inventory and Order Management  group of features: Warehouse Management Receiving On the  Warehouse Management  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) Purchase Orders Preferences (PO301000) form, the  Display the Receive                     Tab  and  Display the Put Away Tab  check boxes                 are selected. The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in                 the system: A warehouse on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses (IN204000) form:                          WHOLESALE . On the  Locations  tab of the form,                     multiple warehouse locations reflecting the warehouse structure have been                     configured. The following stock items on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items                     (IN202500) form:  APPLES  and  ORANGES . For each stock item, barcodes                     have been specified on the  Cross-Reference  tab of the                     form. Also, a purchase order to the  ALLFRUITS  vendor has been entered on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form, and a purchase receipt has been                 prepared for this order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form. Process Overview In this activity, you will open the Receive and Put Away screen in the  Acumatica  mobile app, switch to Receive mode, and scan the number of the                 purchase order. Then you will receive the items and scan their barcodes and                 quantities. After you finish receiving items, you will switch to Put Away mode on                 the same form, scan the barcodes of the warehouse locations to which the items are                 being put away, scan the item barcodes, and correct the quantities (if needed).                 After you finish putting away items, you will release the transfer receipt. System Preparation Before you start the automated receiving and putting away operations, you need to                 perform the following instructions: Make sure that you have installed the  Acumatica  mobile app on                     your mobile device. Launch the app. Enter the URL and optional name of the  Acumatica ERP instance with the  U100  dataset preloaded (for example,                          https://your.acumatica.site.com ), and tap                      Next . Enter the credentials of the user account you will use in this activity: the                          perkins  login and the  123  password. Tap  Sign In  to enter the site. Step 1: Receiving Items in the Receiving Location To record the receipt of items in the warehouse, do the following in the  Acumatica  mobile app on your mobile device: On the main menu of the mobile app, tap the  Warehouse Management Receive and Put Away  tile to view the Receive and Put Away screen. On the top pane, make sure Receive mode is in use. Scan the                          000019                      barcode, which is the reference number of the purchase receipt for which you are                     receiving items. The system loads the purchase receipt lines and shows the                     reference number of the purchase receipt on the top pane. Scan the                          MAIN                      barcode to select the location to which you are receiving the items. Scan the                          AP1LB                      barcode to select the item being received. Set the quantity of the item to  70  as follows: At the bottom of the screen, tap  Set                 Qty  to change the quantity of the current line. Enter  70 . The system specifies  70  as the                             received quantity. In this activity, you are specifying the quantity             in Quantity Editing mode to save time. In a production environment, warehouse workers             would instead scan the barcode of each item included in the document. Scan the                          OR1LB                      barcode to select the next item being received. Set the quantity of the item to  50 . The system inserts                          50  as the received quantity. At the bottom of the screen, tap  Review  to                      view                     the items  that have been added to the receipt. In the top right corner of the screen, tap  More Release Receipt . The system releases the purchase receipt and generates the                     inventory receipt transaction to record the receipt of items to the  MAIN                      location of the warehouse. You have received the items for the purchase receipt, and now you can proceed with                 putting away the received items in the storage locations. Step 2: Putting Away the Received Items in the Storage Locations To record that the received items are being put away in the appropriate locations, do                 the following in the  Acumatica  mobile app: While you are still viewing the Receive and Put Away screen on your mobile                     device, at the bottom of the screen, tap  Change Mode  Put Away  to switch to Put Away                      mode .                      Scan the                          000019                      barcode, which is the reference number of the purchase receipt, again; you had                     scanned it in Step 1. Scan the                          F1S2                      barcode to select the location to which the items are being put away. Scan the                          AP1LB                      barcode to select the item to be put away in this location. The system specifies                          1  as the put away quantity. On the top pane, the  Transfer                         Nbr.  box shows the reference number of the inventory transfer                     transaction that the system automatically created to record the movement of                     items from the receiving location to the storage locations. Set the quantity of the item to  70  as follows: At the bottom of the screen, tap  Set                 Qty  to change the quantity of the current line. Enter  70 . The system specifies  70  as the                             put away quantity, indicating that 70 pounds of apples have been put                             away on the second shelf of the first fruit location. Scan the                          OR1LB                      barcode to select the item being put away. Set the quantity of the item to  30 . The system inserts                          30  as the put away quantity, indicating that 30 pounds of oranges                     have been put away on the second shelf of the first fruit location. Enter                          F2S2                      to select another location to which the rest of the oranges will be put                     away. Enter                          OR1LB                      to select the item being put away. Set the quantity of the item to  20 . The system specifies                          20  as the put away quantity, indicating that 20 pounds of oranges                     have been put away on the second shelf of the second fruit location. Now all                     items from the purchase receipt have been put away in the appropriate storage                     locations. At the bottom of the screen, tap  Review  to                      view                     the list  of items in the transfer. For the  ORANGES                      item, notice that the system shows  <SPLIT>  as the destination                     location, indicating that the items have been put away in multiple                     locations. In the top right corner of the screen, tap  More Release Transfer  to release the transfer. You have successfully received the items to the receiving location and put away the                 items in the appropriate locations. ]]></column>

 If the ''Advanced Picking'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can optimize and speed up the warehouse operations needed for fulfilling the order by using the wave picking workflow.
In this topic, you will read about the wave picking workflow in Acumatica ERP. The workflow in this topic is based on the assumption that your system has the recommended configuration described in [HelpRoot_WMS\WMS_Wave_Picking_Implem_Checklist|Wave Picking: Implementation Checklist].{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn about using wave picking workflow for fulfilling the orders. In particular, you will do the following:[anchor|#_8e0b491e-3005-4f4a-bcde-e1a01d6a56ff]
*Enable the needed system features
*Specify the minimum required configuration for the wave picking workflow
*Learn the recommended settings that you can specify to make the system fit your business requirements
*Prepare a wave picking worksheet
*Pick and pack items in a wave 
*Confirm a shipment after packing the items

==Applicable Scenarios==
You use wave picking if you need to optimize the process of picking and packing items for a group of orders to be shipped. With a wave picking flow, the warehouse manager prepares a series of pick lists for a group of orders to be shipped (also called a ''wave''). Each picker receives a consolidated pick list that includes multiple shipments for which the picker can pick all the listed items in one pass through the warehouse. The pickers collect the items and organize them in the individual totes assigned to each of the shipments. When the items are brought to the packing location, the packer takes the items from each of the totes, verifies that the shipment is collected correctly, and packs the items into boxes.
==General Process of Wave Picking==
The workflow of fulfilling orders with the wave picking workflow is shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#_0b7213fb-31f4-4ede-88bd-6586cffdae47][anchor|#_1a445a9e-b65b-4425-8ff5-36c82c9eb317][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_WMS_Wave_General_Flow.png|popup|295px]
Processing a wave includes the following processes performed by the following persons:[anchor|#_d11d41e0-b02e-4e7e-9cf3-f00b9fb9c7a2]
#A warehouse manager opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_30_50|Create and Print Pick Lists] ([~/?ScreenId=SO503050|SO503050]) form, selects the shipments to be processed in a wave, specifies the maximum number of pickers, creates a picking worksheet, and prints the wave pick lists.
#Each warehouse worker acting as a picker opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) form (or the corresponding screen in the Acumatica mobile app), switches to Pick mode, and scans the reference number of the wave pick list. Then the picker scans the barcodes of the totes that will be used for picking items for particular shipments. The picker goes through the warehouse, picks the items from the locations, scans locations&rsquo; barcodes, and items&rsquo; barcodes and quantities, and put the items in the totes. 
#A warehouse worker acting as a packer opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) form (or the corresponding screen in the Acumatica mobile app), switches to Pack mode and scans the reference number of the wave pick list. Then the packer scans the barcode of the box to which the items are being packed, takes the items from the totes, scans the barcodes and the quantity of items being packed, and puts items in boxes. After all the items are packed, the packer confirms the shipment.

The following sections illustrate and describe the workflow for a warehouse manager, a picker, and a packer. By understanding the workflow for each of these employees, you can better understand the wave picking workflow as a whole in a warehouse.
==Workflow for a Warehouse Manager==
The workflow of a warehouse manager involves the actions shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#_07e3f458-3672-4d6c-aa3e-6be0114f5df5][anchor|#_4d9e1507-8ee2-4b8a-bfc1-651a5b4c9974][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_WMS_Wave_Warehouse_Manager.png|popup|450px]
To prepare a wave picking worksheet, the warehouse manager performs the following steps:[anchor|#_eb99e113-e47a-49a2-a8d2-0e497fd739e0]
#''Selects the type of picking worksheet to be prepared.''
#:The warehouse manager opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_30_50|Create and Print Pick Lists] ([~/?ScreenId=SO503050|SO503050]) form and selects the ''Create and Print Wave Pick List'' action.
#''Specifies the number of pickers.''
#:To specify the maximum number of pickers who are currently available to be assigned to a wave, the manager enters the value in the '''Max. Number of Pickers''' box.
#Optional: ''Defines the number of totes for each picker.''
#:To define the number of totes used by each picker assigned to a wave, the manager enters the value in the '''Define Nbr. of Totes per Picker''' box.
#''Selects the shipments.''
#:In the table, the manager selects the unlabeled check boxes in the lines with the shipments to be included in the picking worksheet.
#''Creates a picking worksheet and selects the pickers.''
#:On the form toolbar, the manager clicks '''Process''' to create the picking worksheet for the selected shipments and to print wave pick lists (in which the items are grouped by the wave) and standard pick lists for each shipment to be picked. Then the manager gives these pick lists to the pickers (that is, the warehouse workers who will perform the picking).
#:((({S:Warn}If the '''Print Packing Slips with Pick Lists''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form, the system also prints packing slips with the pick lists.
)))

==Workflow for a Picker==
The workflow of a picker involves the actions shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#_0c9aae9b-5ed3-4132-ab4d-f4dae30dc4fa][anchor|#_c7c25a5d-92d2-4f88-b68e-a2b42f17fb0d][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_WMS_Wave_Picker.png|popup|380px]
To pick the items for a wave pick list, the picker performs the following steps:[anchor|#_fc3acd1f-81f8-43c4-af60-3107a80987dc]
#''Switches to Pick mode''.
#:The picker opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) form (or the corresponding screen in the Acumatica mobile app) and switches to Pick mode by scanning or entering ''@pick'' barcode.
#''Scans the number of the wave pick list''.
#:To start the automated processing, the picker scans the reference number of the wave pick list. This reference number has the ''Worksheet Nbr./Picker Nbr.'' format, where ''Worksheet Nbr.'' is the reference number of the related picking worksheet, and the ''Picker Nbr.'' is the reference number of the picker assigned to this worksheet (for example, ''000001/1''). The system displays the pick list lines in the table and inserts the reference number of the picking worksheet that is currently selected for processing in the '''Shipment Nbr.''' box.
#''Scans the barcodes of the totes to be assigned to the shipments.''
#:The picker scans the barcodes of all totes that will be used for picking the wave. Each tote is assigned to a particular shipment. The picker also places into each tote the pick list (or the packing slip) of the related shipment.
#''In each location from the wave pick list, picks the items as follows:''
## ''Scans the location barcode''.
##:When the picker scans the barcode of the location from which the item is picked, the system searches for the location in the lines of the picking worksheet that is currently selected.
##''Scans the item barcode''.
##:When the picker scans the item barcode of the picked item, the system searches for the item in the lines of the currently selected document. The system displays the picked quantity in the '''Picked Qty.''' column and highlights the line (with bold if the line has been picked partially, or in green if the line has been picked in full). If the UOM defined by the barcode of the scanned item corresponds to a non-base unit of measure, the system converts the item quantity defined by this barcode to the picked quantity in the base unit of measure for this item. 
##''Scan the tote barcode''.
##:The system notifies the picker in which tote the items must be placed. The picker scans the tote to confirm that the picked item is placed in the right tote (that is, in the one assigned to the shipment).
##Optional: ''Scans the item quantity''.
##:To change the picked quantity in the line that is currently being processed, the picker switches to Quantity Editing mode by clicking the '''Set Qty''' button on the form toolbar (or by scanning or entering the <tt>&#42;qty</tt> barcode) and manually enters the quantity in the UOM defined by the barcode of the scanned item.
##''Picks another item''.
##:If another item needs to be picked from the currently selected location, the picker scans the item barcode (returns to the second substep of this step) and repeats the process for the item.
##''Picks items from another location''.
##:If the picker needs to pick items from another location, he or she scans the location barcode (returns to the first substep of this step), and repeats the process for the location.
#''Completes the picking process''.
#:If the picker has finished picking items from his or her part of the wave, the picker scans the <tt>&#42;confirm&#42;pick</tt> barcode or clicks the '''Confirm Picking''' button on the form toolbar to confirm that the picking process is finished.((({S:Warn}Confirming the picking of a wave does not confirm the picked shipments.
)))
#:After finishing the wave picking, the picker brings the totes with items to the packing location.

==Workflow for a Packer==
The workflow of a packer involves the actions shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#_14c42728-652a-4358-b504-c5352deac60f][anchor|#_03b96536-8fc8-4350-b7fb-ff270394aefd][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_WMS_Wave_Packer.png|popup|350px]
To pack the items for a shipment, the packer performs the following steps:[anchor|#_7bef02b8-d7c5-4ee8-998c-3cd6748f2317]
#''Switches to Pack mode''.
#:The picker opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) form (or the corresponding screen in the Acumatica mobile app) and switches to Pack mode by scanning or entering ''@pack'' barcode.
#''Scans the tote barcode or the shipment number''.
#:The packer scans the barcode of the tote or the shipment number from the packing slip to start packing the items from this tote for shipping.
#For each box being packed for the selected shipment, the picker does the following:
##''Scans the barcode of the box''.
##:The packer scans the barcode of the box into which the items will be packed.
##''Scans the item barcode''.
##:When the packer scans the barcode of the packed item, the system searches for the item in the lines of the shipment that is currently selected. If the UOM defined by the barcode of the scanned item corresponds to a non-base unit of measure, the system converts the item quantity defined by this barcode to the packed quantity in the base unit of measure for this item. The system shows the packed quantity in the '''Packed Qty.''' column and highlights the line (with bold if the line has been processed partially, or in green if the line has been processed in full).
##Optional: ''Scans the item quantity''.
##:To change the packed quantity in the line that is currently being processed, the packer switches to Quantity Editing mode by scanning or entering the <tt>&#42;qty</tt> barcode, and manually enters the quantity in the UOM defined by the barcode of the scanned item..
##''Packs another item''.
##:If another item needs to be packed in the current box, the packer returns to scanning the item barcode (that is, returns to the second substep of this step) and repeats the process for the item, or proceeds to the next step if all items have been packed in the box.
##''Confirms the box''.
##:If all items have been packed in the box, the packer confirms the current box by scanning the <tt>&#42;ok</tt> barcode or by clicking the '''OK''' button. 
##''Enters the box weight''.
##:The packer enters the total weight of the box.
##''Packs another box''.
##:If more items need to be packed for the current shipment, the packer returns to scanning the barcode of the box barcode (returns to the first substep of this step) and repeats the process for another box. 
#''Completes the packing process''.
#:If the packer has finished the packing operation and specifying shipping options is not needed, the packer scans the <tt>&#42;confirm&#42;shipment</tt> barcode or clicks the '''Confirm Shipment''' button on the form toolbar. The system confirms the shipment that is currently being processed, and prints labels for the packed boxes.

==Known Process Limitations==

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Wave Picking: General Information  If the  Advanced Picking  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, you can optimize and speed up the                 warehouse operations needed for fulfilling the order by using the wave picking                 workflow. In this topic, you will read about the wave picking workflow in  Acumatica ERP. The workflow in this topic is based on the assumption that your system has the                 recommended configuration described in  Wave Picking: Implementation Checklist. Learning Objectives In this chapter, you will learn about using wave picking workflow for fulfilling the                 orders. In particular, you will do the following: Enable the needed system features Specify the minimum required configuration for the wave picking workflow Learn the recommended settings that you can specify to make the system fit your                     business requirements Prepare a wave picking worksheet Pick and pack items in a wave  Confirm a shipment after packing the items Applicable Scenarios You use wave picking if you need to optimize the process of picking and packing items                 for a group of orders to be shipped. With a wave picking flow, the warehouse manager                 prepares a series of pick lists for a group of orders to be shipped (also called a                      wave ). Each picker receives a consolidated pick list that includes                 multiple shipments for which the picker can pick all the listed items in one pass                 through the warehouse. The pickers collect the items and organize them in the                 individual totes assigned to each of the shipments. When the items are brought to                 the packing location, the packer takes the items from each of the totes, verifies                 that the shipment is collected correctly, and packs the items into boxes. General Process of Wave Picking The workflow of fulfilling orders with the wave picking workflow is shown in the                 following diagram. Processing a wave includes the following processes performed by the following                 persons: A warehouse manager opens the                           ([~/?ScreenId=SO503050|SO503050]) Create and Print Pick Lists (SO503050) form, selects the                     shipments to be processed in a wave, specifies the maximum number of pickers,                     creates a picking worksheet, and prints the wave pick lists. Each warehouse worker acting as a picker                      opens the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) Pick, Pack, and Ship (SO302020) form (or the corresponding screen in                     the  Acumatica  mobile app), switches to Pick                     mode , and scans the reference number of the wave pick list.                     Then the picker scans the barcodes of the totes that will be used for picking                     items for particular shipments. The picker goes through the warehouse, picks the                     items from the locations, scans locations' barcodes, and items' barcodes and                     quantities, and put the items in the totes.  A warehouse worker acting as a packer                      opens the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) Pick, Pack, and Ship (SO302020) form (or the corresponding screen in                     the  Acumatica  mobile app), switches to Pack mode                      and scans the reference number of the wave pick list. Then the                     packer scans the barcode of the box to which the items are being packed, takes                     the items from the totes, scans the barcodes and the quantity of items being                     packed, and puts items in boxes. After all the items are packed, the packer                     confirms the shipment. The following sections illustrate and describe the workflow for a warehouse manager,                 a picker, and a packer. By understanding the workflow for each of these employees,                 you can better understand the wave picking workflow as a whole in a warehouse. Workflow for a Warehouse Manager The workflow of a warehouse manager involves the actions shown in the following                 diagram. To prepare a wave picking worksheet, the warehouse manager performs the following                 steps: Selects the type of picking worksheet to be prepared. The warehouse                         manager opens the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO503050|SO503050]) Create and Print Pick Lists (SO503050) form and                         selects the  Create and Print Wave Pick List  action. Specifies the number of pickers. To specify the maximum number of                         pickers who are currently available to be assigned to a wave, the manager                         enters the value in the  Max. Number of Pickers                          box. Optional:  Defines the number of totes for each picker. To define the                         number of totes used by each picker assigned to a wave, the manager enters                         the value in the  Define Nbr. of Totes per Picker                          box. Selects the shipments. In the table, the manager selects the unlabeled                         check boxes in the lines with the shipments to be included in the picking                         worksheet. Creates a picking worksheet and selects the pickers. On the form                         toolbar, the manager clicks  Process  to create the                         picking worksheet for the selected shipments and to print wave pick lists                         (in which the items are grouped by the wave) and standard pick lists for                         each shipment to be picked. Then the manager gives these pick lists to the                         pickers (that is, the warehouse workers who will perform the                         picking). If the  Print Packing Slips with Pick                             Lists  check box is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences (SO101000) form, the system also prints                         packing slips with the pick lists. Workflow for a Picker The workflow of a picker involves the actions shown in the following diagram. To pick the items for a wave pick list, the picker performs the following steps: Switches to Pick                         mode . The                         picker opens the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) Pick, Pack, and Ship (SO302020) form (or the                         corresponding screen in the  Acumatica  mobile app) and                         switches to Pick mode by scanning or entering  @pick                      barcode. Scans the number of the wave pick list . To start the automated                         processing, the picker scans the reference number of the wave pick list.                         This reference number has the  Worksheet Nbr./Picker Nbr.  format,                         where  Worksheet Nbr.  is the reference number of the related picking                         worksheet, and the  Picker Nbr.  is the reference number of the picker                         assigned to this worksheet (for example,  000001/1 ). The system                         displays the pick list lines in the table and inserts the reference number                         of the picking worksheet that is currently selected for processing in the                              Shipment Nbr.  box. Scans the barcodes of the totes to be assigned to the shipments. The                         picker scans the barcodes of all totes that will be used for picking the                         wave. Each tote is assigned to a particular shipment. The picker also places                         into each tote the pick list (or the packing slip) of the related                         shipment. In each location from the wave pick list, picks the items as follows: Scans the location barcode . When the picker scans the barcode                                 of the location from which the item is picked, the system searches                                 for the location in the lines of the picking worksheet that is                                 currently selected. Scans the item barcode . When the picker scans the item barcode                                 of the picked item, the system searches for the item in the lines of                                 the currently selected document. The system displays the picked                                 quantity in the  Picked Qty.  column and                                 highlights the line (with bold if the line has been picked                                 partially, or in green if the line has been picked in full).                                  If                                 the UOM defined by the barcode of the scanned item corresponds to a                                 non-base unit of measure, the system converts the item quantity                                 defined by this barcode to the picked quantity in the base unit of                                 measure for this item.  Scan the tote barcode . The system notifies the picker in which                                 tote the items must be placed. The picker scans the tote to confirm                                 that the picked item is placed in the right tote (that is, in the                                 one assigned to the shipment). Optional:  Scans the item quantity . To change the picked                                 quantity in the line that is currently being processed, the picker                                 switches to Quantity Editing mode by clicking the  Set                                     Qty  button on the form toolbar (or by scanning or                                 entering the  *qty  barcode) and manually                                 enters                                  the                                 quantity in the UOM defined by the barcode of the scanned                                 item . Picks another item . If another item needs to be picked from the                                 currently selected location, the picker scans the item barcode                                 (returns to the second substep of this step) and repeats the process                                 for the item. Picks items from another location . If the picker needs to pick                                 items from another location, he or she scans the location barcode                                 (returns to the first substep of this step), and repeats the process                                 for the location. Completes the picking process . If the picker has finished picking items                         from his or her part of the wave, the picker scans the                              *confirm*pick  barcode or clicks the                              Confirm Picking  button on the form toolbar to                         confirm that the picking process is finished. Confirming the picking of                             a wave does not confirm the picked shipments. After                         finishing the wave picking, the picker brings the totes with items to the                         packing location. Workflow for a Packer The workflow of a packer involves the actions shown in the following diagram. To pack the items for a shipment, the packer performs the following steps: Switches to Pack                         mode . The                         picker opens the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) Pick, Pack, and Ship (SO302020) form (or the                         corresponding screen in the  Acumatica  mobile app) and                         switches to Pack mode by scanning or entering  @pack                      barcode. Scans the tote barcode or the shipment number . The packer scans the                         barcode of the tote or the shipment number from the packing slip to start                         packing the items from this tote for shipping. For each box being packed for the selected shipment, the picker does the                         following: Scans the barcode of the box . The packer scans the barcode of                                 the box into which the items will be packed. Scans the item barcode . When the packer scans the barcode of                                 the packed item, the system searches for the item in the lines of                                 the shipment that is currently selected.                                  If                                 the UOM defined by the barcode of the scanned item corresponds to a                                 non-base unit of measure, the system converts the item quantity                                 defined by this barcode to the packed quantity in the base unit of                                 measure for this item.  The system shows the packed                                 quantity in the  Packed Qty.  column and                                 highlights the line (with bold if the line has been processed                                 partially, or in green if the line has been processed in                             full). Optional:  Scans the item quantity . To change the packed                                 quantity in the line that is currently being processed, the packer                                 switches to Quantity Editing mode by scanning or entering the                                      *qty  barcode, and manually enters                                  the                                 quantity in the UOM defined by the barcode of the scanned                                 item. . Packs another item . If another item needs to be packed in the                                 current box, the packer returns to scanning the item barcode (that                                 is, returns to the second substep of this step) and repeats the                                 process for the item, or proceeds to the next step if all items have                                 been packed in the box. Confirms the box . If all items have been packed in the box, the                                 packer confirms the current box by scanning the                                      *ok  barcode or by clicking the                                      OK  button.  Enters the box weight . The packer enters the total weight of                                 the box. Packs another box . If more items need to be packed for the                                 current shipment, the packer returns to scanning the barcode of the                                 box barcode (returns to the first substep of this step) and repeats                                 the process for another box.  Completes the packing process . If the packer has finished the packing                         operation and specifying shipping options is not needed, the packer scans                         the  *confirm*shipment  barcode or clicks the                              Confirm Shipment  button on the form toolbar. The                         system confirms the shipment that is currently being processed, and prints                         labels for the packed boxes. Known Process Limitations If the  Automatic Packaging  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, a user can process in Pack mode only                 shipments packed to a single box. The processing of shipments packed in two or more                 boxes in Pack mode is currently not supported.  ]]></column>

==Story==
Suppose that the wholesale warehouse of SweetLife was temporarily closed because of inventory counting. During this time, multiple orders have been entered into the system, and they now require shipping. The warehouse manager wants to speed up the process of picking and packing items by creating a wave picking worksheet and assigning this work to multiple pickers. After the warehouse workers pick the items in a wave, a warehouse worker acting as the packer needs to pack the items and confirm the shipments.
==Configuration Overview==
In the ''U100'' dataset, the following features have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, where they are in the ''Inventory and Order Management'' group of features:[anchor|#ul_wqn_zy2_3fb]
*''Warehouse Management''
* ''Fulfillment''
* ''Advanced Picking''

The '''Print Packing Slips with Pick Lists''' check box is selected on the '''Warehouse Management''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form; with this check box selected, when a user prints worksheet pick lists, the packing slips are also printed.{br}

The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in the system:[anchor|#ul_ghb_r2d_pfb]
*A warehouse on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form: ''WHOLESALE''. On the '''Locations''' tab of the form, multiple warehouse locations have been configured. On the '''Totes''' tab, multiple totes have been configured.
*The following stock items on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form: ''APJAM96'', ''ORJAM96'', and ''LEMJAM96''. For each stock item, barcodes have been specified on the '''Cross-Reference''' tab of the form.

Multiple sales orders for different customers have been entered into the system on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form, and the shipment documents have been prepared for these orders on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form.
==Process Overview==
Acting as a warehouse manager, you will open the ''Create and Print Pick Lists (SO503050)'' form, select the shipments to be processed in a wave, specify the maximum number of pickers, create a picking worksheet, and print the wave pick lists. Then, acting as each warehouse worker,you will open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) form, switch to Pick mode, and scan the reference number of the wave pick list. Then you will scan the barcodes of the totes that will be used for picking items for particular shipments.After that you will scan locations&rsquo; barcodes, and barcodes and quantities of items being picked from these locations. Then, acting as awarehouse worker, you will open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) form, switch to Pack mode, and scan the reference number of the wave pick list. Then you will scan the barcode of the box to which the items will be packed, take the items from the totes, and scan the barcodes and the quantity of items being packed. After all the items will be packed, you will confirm the shipment.[anchor|#_64a7f646-fdd7-49fa-9482-4c02a227d8e0]((({S:Warn}In any working mode, you enter a command or barcode by typing it in the '''Scan''' box and pressing Enter. In production systems, you will scan the appropriate barcodes rather than manually entering them.
)))
==System Preparation==
Before you start the automated picking and packing operations, you need to perform the following instructions:[anchor|#_4ffe2cbb-d72c-405c-8ee3-fb642ba2cfae]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to the system with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded using the ''angelo'' login and the ''123'' password. You are initially signing in as the warehouse manager to prepare the wave picking worksheet.
#On the '''Warehouse Management''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form, make sure that the '''Display the Pick Tab''' and '''Display the Pack Tab''' check boxes are selected.

==Step 1: Preparing the Wave Picking Worksheet==
To prepare the wave picking worksheet, acting as the warehouse manager, do the following:[anchor|#_f9ce2cec-d951-4415-8898-a7b195596c13]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_30_50|Create and Print Pick Lists] ([~/?ScreenId=SO503050|SO503050]) form, and in the '''Action''' box, select ''Create and Print Wave Pick List''.
#In the '''Warehouse ID''' box, select ''WHOLESALE''.
#Specify <tt>4</tt> as the '''Max. Number of Pickers''' and <tt>4</tt> as '''Max. Number of Totes per Picker'''.
#In the table, select the unlabeled check boxes next to the shipments with reference numbers from ''000034'' through ''000045''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Process'''. Close the '''Processing''' dialog box after processing completes.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_25_00|Picking Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302500|SO302500]) form, open the created worksheet of the ''Wave'' type, and review its details. The '''Document Details''' tab lists all the items that have to be packed in a wave (as shown in the following screenshot). Notice that ''&lt;SPLIT&gt;'' is shown in the '''Location''' column for two of the lines, indicating that these items have to be picked from multiple locations.
#Click the first line in the table, and on the table toolbar, click '''Allocations'''. In the '''Allocations'''window, that opens, review the which of locations in which the items are allocated for the wave (see the following screenshot).[anchor|#_c239763e-36f5-4ba8-97d7-b5f79b319584][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_WMS_Wave_Wsh_Details.png|popup|Locations in which the items are allocated|450px]
#Open the '''Pickers''' tab, and notice that the wave will be picked by three pickers. (Although you have entered ''4'' as the maximum number of pickers, the system has found the optimal workflow and determined that three pickers are enough for picking the wave.)
#Click the first line in the table (which corresponds to the first picker), and on the table toolbar, click '''View Shipments'''. In the '''Assigned Shipments'''window, which opens, review the shipments assigned to the first picker and the items that the picker will pick for these shipments.[anchor|#_1838a99f-cf48-4fc5-9e6a-628426d4f6f4][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_WMS_Wave_Wsh_Pickers.png|popup|Shipments assigned to the picker|450px]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Print Pick Lists'''. The system opens the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\SO_64_40_06|Worksheet Pick List] ([~/?ScreenId=SO644006|SO644006]) report with generated printable pick lists and packing slips. You print the pick lists and packing slips and distribute them to the three pickers. Each picker puts pick lists and packing slips to totes assigned to shipments. For each pick list, notice the '''Pick List Nbr.''' number; you will load the pick lists for processing by using these numbers.
#Sign out of the system.

==Step 2a: Picking Items in a Wave (Picker 1)==
Acting as the first picker selected in the picking worksheet, you will assign totes to the shipments assigned to you and then pick the items, placing them in the appropriate totes. Do the following:[anchor|#_8841a955-26b7-47b5-8580-a22939c31152]

If you are using another dataset, or if any system settings             have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the activity             and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100  dataset             to its initial state. Story Suppose that the wholesale warehouse of SweetLife was temporarily closed because of                 inventory counting. During this time, multiple orders have been entered into the                 system, and they now require shipping. The warehouse manager wants to speed up the                 process of picking and packing items by creating a wave picking worksheet and                 assigning this work to multiple pickers. After the warehouse workers pick the items                 in a wave, a warehouse worker acting as the packer needs to pack the items and                 confirm the shipments. Configuration Overview In the  U100  dataset, the following features have been enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, where they are in the                      Inventory and Order Management  group of features: Warehouse Management Fulfillment Advanced Picking The  Print Packing Slips with Pick Lists  check box is selected                 on the  Warehouse Management  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences (SO101000) form; with this check box selected, when a                 user prints worksheet pick lists, the packing slips are also printed. The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in                 the system: A warehouse on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses (IN204000) form:                          WHOLESALE . On the  Locations  tab of the form,                     multiple warehouse locations have been                     configured.  On                     the  Totes  tab, multiple totes have been                     configured. The following stock items on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items                     (IN202500) form:  APJAM96 ,  ORJAM96 , and  LEMJAM96 . For each                     stock item, barcodes have been specified on the                          Cross-Reference  tab of the form. Multiple sales orders for different customers have been entered into the system on                 the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders form, and the shipment documents have been                 prepared for these orders on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000)                 form. Process Overview Acting as                 a  warehouse                 manager , you                 will  open the  Create and Print Pick Lists (SO503050)  form,                 select the shipments to be processed in a wave, specify the maximum number of                 pickers,                 create  a                 picking worksheet, and print the wave pick lists. Then, acting as each warehouse worker , you will open the                       ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) Pick, Pack, and Ship (SO302020) form, switch to Pick mode,                 a nd scan the reference number of the wave pick list. Then                  you will                  scan the barcodes of the totes that will be used for picking items                 for particular shipments . After that                  you                 will  scan                  locations'                 barcodes, and  barcodes and                 quantities  of items                 being                 picked                  from these                 locations .                  Then, acting as a warehouse                 worker , you will                 open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) Pick, Pack, and Ship (SO302020) form, switch to Pack mode,                  and scan the reference number of the wave pick list. Then                  you will                  scan                  the barcode of the box to which the items                  will be                  packed,                 take  the                 items from the totes,                  and                  scan                  the barcodes and the quantity of items being packed. After all the items                  will                 be  packed,                  you                 will  confirm the shipment. In any working mode, you enter a command or barcode             by typing it in the  Scan  box and pressing Enter. In production             systems, you will scan the appropriate barcodes rather than manually entering             them. System Preparation Before you start the automated picking and packing operations, you need to perform                 the following instructions: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to the system with the  U100  dataset preloaded                     using the  angelo  login and the  123  password. You are initially                     signing in as the warehouse manager to prepare the wave picking worksheet. On the  Warehouse Management  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences (SO101000) form, make sure that the                          Display the Pick Tab  and  Display the Pack                         Tab  check boxes are selected. Step 1: Preparing the Wave Picking Worksheet To prepare the wave picking worksheet, acting as the warehouse manager, do the                 following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO503050|SO503050]) Create and Print Pick Lists (SO503050) form, and in the                          Action  box, select  Create and Print Wave Pick                         List . In the  Warehouse ID  box, select  WHOLESALE . Specify  4  as the  Max. Number of                         Pickers  and  4  as  Max. Number                         of Totes per Picker . In the table, select the unlabeled check boxes next to the shipments with                     reference numbers from  000034  through  000045 . On the form toolbar, click  Process . Close the                          Processing  dialog box after processing                     completes. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302500|SO302500]) Picking Worksheets (SO302500) form, open the                     created worksheet of the  Wave  type, and review its details. The                          Document Details  tab lists all the items that have to                     be packed in a wave (as shown in the following screenshot). Notice that                          <SPLIT>  is shown in the  Location  column for                     two of the lines, indicating that these items have to be picked from multiple                     locations. Click the first                     line in the table, and                      o n                     the table toolbar, click  Allocations .                      I n                     the  Allocations window ,                     that opens, review the which of locations in which the items are allocated for                     the wave (see the following screenshot). Locations in which the items are allocated Open the  Pickers  tab, and notice that the wave will be                     picked by three pickers. (Although you have entered  4  as the maximum                     number of pickers, the system has found the optimal workflow and determined that                     three pickers are enough for picking the wave.) Click the first line in the table (which corresponds to the first picker), and                     on the table toolbar, click  View Shipments . In the                          Assigned Shipments window ,                     which opens, review the shipments assigned to the first picker and the items                     that the picker will pick for these shipments. Shipments assigned to the picker On the form toolbar, click  Print Pick Lists . The system                     opens the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO644006|SO644006]) Worksheet Pick List(SO644006) report with generated                     printable pick lists and packing slips. You print the pick lists and packing                     slips and distribute them to the three pickers. Each picker puts pick lists and                     packing slips to totes assigned to                     shipments.  For                     each pick list, notice the  Pick List Nbr.  number; you                     will load the pick lists for processing by using these                     numbers. Sign out of the system. Step 2a: Picking Items in a Wave (Picker 1) Acting as the first picker selected in the picking worksheet, you will assign totes                 to the shipments assigned to you and then pick the items, placing them in the                 appropriate totes. Do the following: Sign in to the system as the first picker by using the  perkins  login and                     the  123  password. Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) Pick, Pack, and Ship (SO302020) form, and make sure the                          Pick  tab is opened. In the  Scan  box of the Summary area, enter                          000001/1 , which is the reference number of the pick                     list for the first picker. The system loads the shipment lines to the table on                     the  Pick  tab, and shows the reference number of the                     picking worksheet that is currently being processed in the  Worksheet                         Nbr.  box of the Summary area. Assign totes to the shipments you will be picking by doing the following: Enter  T1 . The system assigns the tote to the                             shipment  000034 , and shows the tote ID in the  Tote                                 ID  column of all lines of this shipment. Enter  T2 . The system assigns the tote to the                             shipment  000035 . Enter  T3 . The system assigns the tote to the                             shipment  000036 . Enter  T4 . The system assigns the tote to the                             shipment  000038 . Now you have assigned the totes to shipments, and you can start picking                         items. Pick the items from the first location by doing the following: Enter  L1R1S1  to select the location from which                             you are currently picking items. Enter  OJ32  to pick the item.  Set the quantity of the item to                                  11                              as follows: On the form toolbar, click  Set Qty . The                                     system prompts you to enter the item quantity. In the  Scan  box, enter                                          11 .                                     This indicates that                                      eleven                                      32-ounce jars of orange jam have been picked from the location                                     and placed in the                                          T 3                                      tote. You are continuing to pick items for different shipments from                                 the same location, so you do not need to scan the location barcode                                 again.

Enter  AJ08  to pick the item.  Enter  AJ08  one more time to add second unit to                             the current line. On the form toolbar, click  Confirm Pick List  to confirm                     that picking is finished. As the third picker, you have finished picking the                         items. Sign out of the system. Step 3: Reviewing the Worksheet Status As the pack line operator, you will review the progress the three pickers who picked                 the items. Do the following: Sign in to the system as the pack line operator by using the  rueb  login                     and the  123  password. On the  ([~/?ScreenId=SO302500|SO302500]) Picking Worksheets (SO302500) form, open the wave                     picking worksheet, and review the  Pickers  tab (see the                     following screenshot). The user names of the workers who performed the picking                     operations are shown in the  User  column; the selected                     check boxes in each line of the  Confirmed  column indicate                     that each picker has confirmed the completion of the picking. The users who confirmed the picking of the wave Review the  Shipments  tab, as shown in the following                     screenshot. All shipments have been picked, as the selected check boxes in the                          Picked  column indicate; the picking worksheet now is                     assigned the  Picked  status. Shipments ready for packing Sign out of the system. Step 4: Packing a Shipment for the Wave At this point in the wave picking, all of the shipments from the wave can be packed.                 For the purposes of this activity, you will pack just one of the shipments, acting                 as a warehouse worker who handles packing. To pack one of the shipments from a wave,                 do the following: Sign in to the system as a warehouse worker who will perform packing operations                     by using the  sauer  login and the  123  password. Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) Pick, Pack, and Ship (SO302020) form. In the  Scan  box of the Summary area, enter  @pack                      to switch to Pack mode.  Enter                          000034 ,                     which is the reference number of one of the shipments ready for packing. Enter  LARGE  to select the box in which you are packing the items. Enter  AJ08  to select the item being packed. The system                     highlights the first line of the shipment in bold and specifies  1  as the                          Packed Qty. , and shows this item in the                          Package Content  tab. Set the quantity of the item to                          10                      as follows: On the form toolbar, click  Set Qty . The system                             prompts you to enter the item quantity. In the  Scan  box, enter  10 .                             The system highlights the first line of the shipment in green and                             specifies  10  as the  Packed Qty. Enter  OJ32  to select the next item being packed in the                     same box. Set the quantity of this item to                          8 . On the form toolbar, click  OK  to confirm the                     package. On the form toolbar, click  Confirm Shipment . Sign out of the system, and sign in again as a warehouse manager by using the                          angelo  login and the  123  password.

 If the ''Advanced Picking'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can optimize and speed up the warehouse operations needed for fulfilling the order by using the batch picking workflow.
In this topic, you will read about the batch picking workflow in Acumatica ERP. The workflow in this topic is based on the assumption that your system has the recommended configuration described in [HelpRoot_WMS\WMS_Batch_Picking_Implem_Checklist|Batch Picking: Implementation Checklist].{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn about using batch picking workflow for fulfilling the orders. In particular, you will do the following:[anchor|#_8e0b491e-3005-4f4a-bcde-e1a01d6a56ff]
*Enable the needed system features
*Specify the minimum required configuration for the batch picking workflow
*Learn the recommended settings that you can specify to make the system fit your business requirements
*Prepare a batch picking worksheet
*Pick and pack items in a batch 
*Confirm a shipment after packing the items

==Applicable Scenarios==
You use batch picking if you need to optimize the process of picking and packing items for a group of orders to be shipped. With a batch picking flow, the warehouse manager prepares a batch picking worksheet with a batch of orders to be shipped, prints the related pick lists, and gives the pick lists to the pickers who will perform this work. In batch picking, each pick list generally includes items from multiple sales orders. The pickers collect the items listed in the pick lists from the specified warehouse locations and bring these items to the sorting location. A pack line operator prints packing slips for the shipments ready for packing and give these packing slips to a packer. The packer sorts the picked items by shipments and packs them into boxes.
==General Process of Batch Picking==
The workflow of fulfilling orders with batch picking is shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#_12ae2f2d-509a-4034-8b02-355c27b8713a][anchor|#_145138f2-c55d-48dd-bbe6-f66de3cc9b9b][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_WMS_Batch_General_Flow.png|popup|220px]
Processing a batch includes the following processes performed by the following persons:[anchor|#_f2baf5dd-6821-4061-9263-88cc295b285c]
#A warehouse manager opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_30_50|Create and Print Pick Lists] ([~/?ScreenId=SO503050|SO503050]) form, selects the shipments to be processed in a batch, specifies the maximum number of pickers, creates a picking worksheet, and prints the batch pick lists.
#Each warehouse worker acting as a picker opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) form (or the corresponding screen in the Acumatica mobile app), switches to Pick mode, and scans the reference number of the batch pick list. Then the picker goes through the warehouse, picks the items from the needed locations, and scans their barcodes and quantities. Then the picker transfers the items to the sorting location and confirms the pick list.
#A pack line operator verifies that batch is picked and prints the packing slips on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_25_00|Picking Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302500|SO302500]) form.
#A warehouse worker acting as a packer opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) form (or the corresponding screen in the Acumatica mobile app), switches to Pack mode, and scans the reference number of the batch pick list. Then the packer scans the barcode of the box to which the items are being packed, and scans the barcodes and the quantity of items being packed. After all the items are packed, the packer confirms the shipment.

The following sections describe the workflow for a warehouse manager, a picker, a pack line operator, and a packer. By understanding the workflow for each of these employees, you can better understand the batch picking workflow as a whole in a warehouse.[anchor|#_8302a4e5-8944-4c02-895b-7558aadb4443]((({S:Warn}In any working mode, you enter a command or barcode by typing it in the '''Scan''' box and pressing Enter. In production systems, you will scan the appropriate barcodes rather than manually entering them.
)))
==Workflow for a Warehouse Manager==
The workflow of a warehouse manager involves the actions shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#_5eac21fd-8fc1-4a14-85fc-3b355829de1b][anchor|#_93ea2fe9-37ad-4efa-8d9d-45466e0743de][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_WMS_Batch_Warehouse_Manager.png|popup|450px]
To prepare a batch picking worksheet, the warehouse manager performs the following steps:[anchor|#_eb99e113-e47a-49a2-a8d2-0e497fd739e0]
#''Selects the type of picking worksheet to be prepared.''
#:The warehouse manager opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_30_50|Create and Print Pick Lists] ([~/?ScreenId=SO503050|SO503050]) form and selects the ''Create and Print Batch Pick List'' action.
#''Specifies the number of pickers.''
#:To specify the maximum number of pickers who are currently available to be assigned to a batch, the manager enters the value in the '''Max. Number of Pickers''' box.
#''Selects the shipments.''
#:In the table, the manager selects the unlabeled check boxes in the lines with the shipments to be included in the picking worksheet.
#''Creates a picking worksheet and selects the pickers.''
#:On the form toolbar, the manager clicks '''Process''' to create the picking worksheet for the selected shipments and to print the pick lists for the batch. Then the manager gives these pick lists to the pickers (that is, the warehouse workers who will perform the picking).

==Workflow for a Picker==
The workflow of a picker involves the actions shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#_8356be4f-7668-459d-8df4-5523ddd4ad81][anchor|#_e2609a42-cab7-46f1-9789-e8baa5a15877][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_WMS_Batch_Picker.png|popup|420px]
To pick the items for a batch pick list, the picker performs the following steps:[anchor|#_fc3acd1f-81f8-43c4-af60-3107a80987dc]
#''Switches to Pick mode''.
#:The picker opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) form (or the corresponding screen in the Acumatica mobile app) and switches to Pick mode by scanning or entering ''@pick'' barcode.
#''Scans the number of the batch pick list''.
#:To start the automated processing, the picker scans the reference number of the batch pick list. This reference number has the ''Worksheet Nbr./Picker Nbr.'' format, where ''Worksheet Nbr.'' is the reference number of the related picking worksheet, and the ''Picker Nbr.'' is the reference number of the picker assigned to this worksheet (for example, ''000001/1''). The system displays the lines of the scanned document in the table and inserts the reference number of the picking worksheet that is currently selected for processing in the '''Shipment Nbr.''' box.
#''In each location from the pick list, picks the items as follows:''
## ''Scans the location barcode''.
##:When the picker scans the barcode of the location from which the item is picked, the system searches for the location in the lines of the picking worksheet that is currently selected.
##''Scans the item barcode''.
##:When the picker scans the item barcode of the picked item, the system searches for the item in the lines of the currently selected document. The system displays the picked quantity in the '''Picked Qty.''' column and highlights the line (with bold if the line has been picked partially, or in green if the line has been picked in full). If the UOM defined by the barcode of the scanned item corresponds to a non-base unit of measure, the system converts the item quantity defined by this barcode to the picked quantity in the base unit of measure for this item. 
##Optional: ''Scans the item quantity''.
##:To change the picked quantity in the line that is currently being processed, the picker switches to Quantity Editing mode by clicking the '''Set Qty''' button on the form toolbar (or by scanning or entering the <tt>&#42;qty</tt> barcode) and manually entering the quantity in the UOM defined by the barcode of the scanned item.
##''Picks another item''.
##:If another item needs to be picked from the currently selected location, the picker scans the item barcode (returns to the second substep of this step) and repeats the process for the item.
##''Picks items from another location''.
##:If the picker needs to pick items from another location, he or she scans the location barcode (returns to the first substep of this step) and repeats the process for the location.
#''Completes the picking process''.
#:If the picker has finished picking all items in the pick list, he or she scans the <tt>&#42;confirm&#42;pick</tt> barcode or clicks the '''Confirm Pick List''' button on the form toolbar. 
#''Scans the barcode of the sorting location''.
#:When the picker brings the picked items to the sorting location, he or she scans the barcode of this location. The system creates and releases an inventory transfer transaction with the lines with the picked items to record the movement of items within the warehouse. In the transaction lines, the location from which the items were picked is specified as the source location, and the sorting location is specified as the destination location. On release of the inventory transfer, the system updates the picked quantity and in the lines of shipments for which the items have been picked, changes the initial location to the sorting location.
#:After the picker finishes the batch picking and brings the items to the sorting location, he or she gives the batch pick list to a pack line operator.

==Workflow for a Pack Line Operator==
To start the packing of the batch, the pack line operator performs the following steps:[anchor|#_e413bd64-e14a-4a78-9d87-72b31a888dc1]
#''Verifies that all pickers have completed the picking for the batch.''
#:The pack line operator opens the batch picking worksheet on the ''Picking Worksheets (SO302050)'' form, and on the '''Shipments''' tab, makes sure that all shipments included in the batch have been picked (which is indicated by the '''Picked''' check box being selected in each line).
#''Prints the packing slips''.
#:The pack line operator prints packing slips for the shipments of the batch by opening the picking worksheet on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_25_00|Picking Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302500|SO302500]) form and clicking '''Print Packing Slips''' on the form toolbar. 
#:After the pack line operator prints the packing slips, this employee gives them to a packer working at the sorting location.

==Workflow for a Packer==
The workflow of a packer involves the actions shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#_ba74cc61-071e-469e-92d1-c47cea9b5fa0][anchor|#_780a7545-0730-447b-b592-50d6bfb5760b][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_WMS_Batch_Packer.png|popup|350px]
To pack the items for shipping, the packer performs the following steps:[anchor|#_7bef02b8-d7c5-4ee8-998c-3cd6748f2317]
#''Switches to Pack mode''.
#:The packer opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) form (or the corresponding screen in the Acumatica mobile app) and switches to Pack mode by scanning or entering ''@pack'' barcode.
#''Scans the shipment number''.
#:To start the automated processing, the packer scans the reference number of the shipment in the packing slip. The system shows the shipment lines in the table and inserts the reference number of the document in the '''Shipment Nbr.''' box.
#''Scans the sorting location barcode''.
#:The packer scans the barcode of the location from which the item is picked (which is always a sorting location for the batch picking process).
#''For each box being packed for the selected shipment, does the following:''
## ''Scans the barcode of the box''.
##:The packer scans the barcode of the box into which the items will be packed.
##''Scans the item barcode''.
##:When the packer scans the barcode of the packed item, the system searches for the item in the lines of the shipment that is currently selected. If the UOM defined by the barcode of the scanned item corresponds to a non-base unit of measure, the system converts the item quantity defined by this barcode to the packed quantity in the base unit of measure for this item. The system shows the packed quantity in the '''Packed Qty.''' column, and highlights the line (with bold if the line has been processed partially, or in green if the line has been processed in full).
##Optional: ''Scans the item quantity''.
##:To change the packed quantity in the line that is currently being processed, the packer switches to Quantity Editing mode by scanning or entering the <tt>&#42;qty</tt> barcode, and manually enters the quantity in the UOM defined by the barcode of the scanned item.
##''Packs another item''.
##:If another item needs to be packed in the current box, the packer returns to scanning the item barcode (return to the second substep of this step) and repeats the process for the item, or proceeds to the next step if all items have been packed in the box.
##''Confirms the box''.
##:If all items have been packed in the box, the packer confirms the current box by scanning the <tt>&#42;ok</tt> barcode or by clicking the '''OK''' button. 
##''Enters the box weight''.
##:The packer enters the total weight of the box.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Batch Picking: General Information  If the  Advanced Picking  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features         (CS100000) form, you can optimize and speed up the warehouse operations needed for         fulfilling the order by using the batch picking workflow. In this topic, you will read about the batch picking workflow in  Acumatica ERP. The workflow in this topic is based on the assumption that your system has the         recommended configuration described in  Batch Picking: Implementation Checklist. Learning Objectives In this chapter, you will learn about using batch picking workflow for fulfilling the         orders. In particular, you will do the following: Enable the needed system features Specify the minimum required configuration for the batch picking workflow Learn the recommended settings that you can specify to make the system fit your business           requirements Prepare a batch picking worksheet Pick and pack items in a batch  Confirm a shipment after packing the items Applicable Scenarios You use batch picking if         you need to optimize the process of picking and packing items for a group of orders to be         shipped.  With a batch picking flow, the warehouse manager prepares a batch         picking worksheet with a batch of orders to be shipped, prints the related pick lists, and         gives the pick lists to the pickers who will perform this work. In batch picking, each pick         list generally includes items from multiple sales orders. The pickers collect the items         listed in the pick lists from the specified warehouse locations and bring these items to the         sorting location. A pack line operator prints packing slips for the shipments ready for         packing and give these packing slips to a packer. The packer sorts the picked items by         shipments and packs them into boxes. General Process of Batch Picking The workflow of fulfilling orders with batch picking is shown in the following diagram. Processing a batch includes the following processes performed by the following persons: A warehouse manager opens the               ([~/?ScreenId=SO503050|SO503050]) Create and Print Pick Lists (SO503050) form, selects the shipments to be           processed in a batch, specifies the maximum number of pickers, creates a picking           worksheet, and prints the batch pick lists. Each warehouse worker acting as a picker            opens the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) Pick, Pack, and Ship (SO302020) form (or the corresponding screen in the  Acumatica  mobile app), switches to Pick mode,  and scans           the reference number of the batch pick list. Then the picker goes through the warehouse,           picks the items from the needed locations, and scans their barcodes and quantities. Then           the picker transfers the items to the sorting location and confirms the pick list. A pack line operator verifies that batch is picked and prints the packing slips on the               ([~/?ScreenId=SO302500|SO302500]) Picking Worksheets (SO503050) form. A warehouse worker acting as a packer            opens the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) Pick, Pack, and Ship (SO302020) form (or the corresponding screen in the  Acumatica  mobile app), switches to Pack mode, and  scans           the reference number of the batch pick list. Then the packer scans the barcode of the box           to which the items are being packed, and scans the barcodes and the quantity of items           being packed. After all the items are packed, the packer confirms the shipment. The following sections describe the workflow for a warehouse manager, a picker, a pack line         operator, and a packer. By understanding the workflow for each of these employees, you can         better understand the batch picking workflow as a whole in a warehouse. In any working mode, you enter a command or barcode             by typing it in the  Scan  box and pressing Enter. In production             systems, you will scan the appropriate barcodes rather than manually entering             them. Workflow for a Warehouse Manager The workflow of a warehouse manager involves the actions shown in the following         diagram. To prepare a batch picking worksheet, the warehouse manager performs the following         steps: Selects the type of picking worksheet to be prepared. The warehouse manager             opens the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO503050|SO503050]) Create and Print Pick Lists (SO503050) form and selects the  Create and               Print Batch Pick List  action. Specifies the number of pickers. To specify the maximum number of pickers who             are currently available to be assigned to a batch, the manager enters the value in the                Max. Number of Pickers  box. Selects the shipments. In the table, the manager selects the unlabeled check             boxes in the lines with the shipments to be included in the picking worksheet. Creates a picking worksheet and selects the pickers. On the form toolbar, the             manager clicks  Process  to create the picking worksheet for the             selected shipments and to print the pick lists for the batch. Then the manager gives             these pick lists to the pickers (that is, the warehouse workers who will perform the             picking). Workflow for a Picker The workflow of a picker involves the actions shown in the following diagram. To pick the items for a batch pick list, the picker performs the following steps: Switches to Pick             mode . The picker             opens the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) Pick, Pack, and Ship (SO302020) form (or the corresponding screen             in the  Acumatica  mobile app) and switches to Pick mode by scanning or             entering  @pick  barcode. Scans the number of the batch pick list . To start the automated processing, the             picker scans the reference number of the batch pick list. This reference number has the                Worksheet Nbr./Picker Nbr.  format, where  Worksheet Nbr.  is the reference             number of the related picking worksheet, and the  Picker Nbr.  is the reference             number of the picker assigned to this worksheet (for example,  000001/1 ). The             system displays the lines of the scanned document in the table and inserts the reference             number of the picking worksheet that is currently selected for processing in the                Shipment Nbr.  box. In each location from the pick list, picks the items as follows: Scans the location barcode . When the picker scans the barcode of the                 location from which the item is picked, the system searches for the location in the                 lines of the picking worksheet that is currently selected. Scans the item barcode . When the picker scans the item barcode of the                 picked item, the system searches for the item in the lines of the currently selected                 document. The system displays the picked quantity in the  Picked                   Qty.  column and highlights the line (with bold if the line has been                 picked partially, or in green if the line has been picked in full).                  If the UOM defined                 by the barcode of the scanned item corresponds to a non-base unit of measure, the                 system converts the item quantity defined by this barcode to the picked quantity in                 the base unit of measure for this item.  Optional:  Scans the item quantity . To change the picked quantity in the                 line that is currently being processed, the picker switches to Quantity Editing mode                 by clicking the  Set Qty  button on the form toolbar (or by                 scanning or entering the  *qty  barcode) and manually entering                  the quantity in the                 UOM defined by the barcode of the scanned item. Picks another item . If another item needs to be picked from the currently                 selected location, the picker scans the item barcode (returns to the second substep                 of this step) and repeats the process for the item. Picks items from another location . If the picker needs to pick items from                 another location, he or she scans the location barcode (returns to the first substep                 of this step) and repeats the process for the location. Completes the picking process . If the picker has finished picking all items in             the pick list, he or she scans the  *confirm*pick  barcode or             clicks the  Confirm Pick List  button on the form toolbar.            Scans the barcode of the sorting location . When the picker brings the picked             items to the sorting location, he or she scans the barcode of this location. The system             creates and releases an inventory transfer transaction with the lines with the picked             items to record the movement of items within the warehouse. In the transaction lines,             the location from which the items were picked is specified as the source location, and             the sorting location is specified as the destination location. On release of the             inventory transfer, the system updates the picked quantity and in the lines of shipments             for which the items have been picked, changes the initial location to the sorting             location. After the picker finishes the batch picking and brings the items to the             sorting location, he or she gives the batch pick list to a pack line operator. Workflow for a Pack Line Operator To start the packing of the batch, the pack line operator performs the following steps: Verifies that all pickers have completed the picking for the batch. The pack             line operator opens the batch picking worksheet on the  Picking Worksheets               (SO302050)  form, and on the  Shipments  tab, makes sure that             all shipments included in the batch have been picked (which is indicated by the                Picked  check box being selected in each line). Prints the packing slips . The pack line operator prints packing slips for the             shipments of the batch by opening the picking worksheet on the                 ([~/?ScreenId=SO302500|SO302500]) Picking Worksheets (SO302500)  form and clicking                Print Packing Slips  on the form toolbar.  After the pack             line operator prints the packing slips, this employee gives them to a packer working at             the sorting location. Workflow for a Packer The workflow of a packer involves the actions shown in the following diagram. To pack the items for shipping, the packer performs the following steps: Switches to Pack             mode . The packer             opens the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) Pick, Pack, and Ship (SO302020) form (or the corresponding screen             in the  Acumatica  mobile app) and switches to Pack mode by scanning or             entering  @pack  barcode. Scans the shipment number . To start the automated processing, the packer scans             the reference number of the shipment in the packing slip. The system shows the shipment             lines in the table and inserts the reference number of the document in the                Shipment Nbr.  box. Scans the sorting location barcode . The packer scans the barcode of the             location from which the item is picked (which is always a sorting location for the batch             picking process). For each box being packed for the selected shipment, does the following: Scans the barcode of the box . The packer scans the barcode of the box into                 which the items will be packed. Scans the item barcode . When the packer scans the barcode of the packed                 item, the system searches for the item in the lines of the shipment that is                 currently selected.                  If the UOM defined                 by the barcode of the scanned item corresponds to a non-base unit of measure, the                 system converts the item quantity defined by this barcode to the packed quantity in                 the base unit of measure for this item.  The system shows the                 packed quantity in the  Packed Qty.  column, and highlights the                 line (with bold if the line has been processed partially, or in green if the line                 has been processed in full). Optional:  Scans the item quantity . To change the packed quantity in the                 line that is currently being processed, the packer switches to Quantity Editing mode                 by scanning or entering the  *qty  barcode, and manually enters                  the quantity in the                 UOM defined by the barcode of the scanned item. Packs another item . If another item needs to be packed in the current box,                 the packer returns to scanning the item barcode (return to the second substep of                 this step) and repeats the process for the item, or proceeds to the next step if all                 items have been packed in the box. Confirms the box . If all items have been packed in the box, the packer                 confirms the current box by scanning the  *ok  barcode or by                 clicking the  OK  button.  Enters the box weight . The packer enters the total weight of the               box. Packs another box . If more items need to be packed for the current                 shipment, the packer returns to scanning the barcode of the box barcode (returns to                 the first substep of this step) and repeats the process for another box.  Completes the packing process . If the packer has finished the packing operation             and shipping options do not need to be specified, the packer scans the                *confirm*shipment  barcode or clicks the  Confirm               Shipment  button on the form toolbar. The system confirms the shipment that             is currently being processed, and prints labels for the packed boxes. Known Process Limitations If the  Automatic Packaging  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features         (CS100000) form, a user can process in Pack mode only shipments packed to a single box. The         processing of shipments packed in two or more boxes in Pack mode is currently not supported.        ]]></column>

==Story==
Suppose that the wholesale warehouse of SweetLife was temporarily closed because of inventory counting. During this time, multiple orders have been entered into the system, and they now require shipping. The warehouse manager wants to speed up the process of picking and packing items by creating a batch picking worksheet and assigning this work to multiple pickers. After the warehouse workers pick the items and transfer them to a sorting location, a warehouse worker acting as the packer needs to pack the items and confirm the shipments.
==Configuration Overview==
In the ''U100'' dataset, the following features have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, where they are in the ''Inventory and Order Management'' group of features:[anchor|#ul_wqn_zy2_3fb]
*''Warehouse Management''
* ''Fulfillment''
* ''Advanced Picking''

The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in the system:[anchor|#ul_ghb_r2d_pfb]
*A warehouse on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form: ''WHOLESALE''. On the '''Locations''' tab of the form, multiple warehouse locations have been configured.
*The following stock items on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form: ''APJAM96'', ''ORJAM96'', and ''LEMJAM96''. For each stock item, barcodes have been specified on the '''Cross-Reference''' tab of the form.

Multiple sales orders for different customers have been entered into the system on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, and the shipment documents have been prepared for these orders on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form.
==Process Overview==
Acting as a warehouse manager, you will open the ''Create and Print Pick Lists (SO503050)'' form, select the shipments to be processed in a batch, specify the maximum number of pickers, and create a picking worksheet. Then, acting as each picker, you willopen the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) form, switch to Pick mode, and scan the reference number of the batch pick list. Then you will scan the barcodes and quantities of the items being picked. After you finish picking, you will scan the barcode of the sorting location and confirm the pick list. Then, acting as a pack line operator, you will verify that batch is picked and prepare the printable packing slips on the ''Picking Worksheets (SO503050)'' form. Then, acting as packer, you willopen the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) form, switch to Pack mode, and scan the reference number of the batch pick list. Then you will scan the barcode of the box to which the items will be packed, and scan the barcodes and the quantity of items being packed. After all the items are packed, you will confirm the shipment.[anchor|#_515daf88-15e3-479c-a598-1f30817c8530]((({S:Warn}In any working mode, you enter a command or barcode by typing it in the '''Scan''' box and pressing Enter.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Batch Picking: Process Activity In the following activity, you will learn how to process shipments in a batch by                 using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) Pick, Pack, and Ship (SO302020) form. The following activity is based on the                  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system settings             have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the activity             and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100  dataset             to its initial state. Story Suppose that the wholesale warehouse of SweetLife was temporarily closed because of                 inventory counting. During this time, multiple orders have been entered into the                 system, and they now require shipping. The warehouse manager wants to speed up the                 process of picking and packing items by creating a batch picking worksheet and                 assigning this work to multiple pickers. After the warehouse workers pick the items                 and transfer them to a sorting location, a warehouse worker acting as the packer                 needs to pack the items and confirm the shipments. Configuration Overview In the  U100  dataset, the following features have been enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, where they are in the                      Inventory and Order Management  group of features: Warehouse Management Fulfillment Advanced Picking The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in                 the system: A warehouse on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses (IN204000) form:                          WHOLESALE . On the  Locations  tab of the form,                     multiple warehouse locations have been configured. The following stock items on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items                     (IN202500) form:  APJAM96 ,  ORJAM96 , and  LEMJAM96 . For each                     stock item, barcodes have been specified on the                          Cross-Reference  tab of the form. Multiple sales orders for different customers have been entered into the                 system  on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form , and the shipment                 documents have been prepared for these                 orders  on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) form . Process Overview Acting                 as  a warehouse manager,                  you                 will  open the  Create and Print Pick Lists (SO503050)  form,                 select the shipments to be processed in a batch,                 specif y                  the maximum number of pickers,                  and                  create a picking                 worksheet.  Then,                 acting as e ach                 picker , you will open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) Pick, Pack, and Ship (SO302020) form, switch to Pick                 mode,  and scan the reference number of the batch pick list. Then                  you will                  scan                  the  barcodes                 and quantities  of                 the items being picked .                  After you finish                 picking, you will scan the barcode of the sorting location and                  confirm the pick list.                  Then, acting as                 a  pack line                 operator , you                 will                  verif y                  that batch is picked and                  prepare the                 printable  packing slips on the  Picking Worksheets                     (SO503050)  form.                  Then, acting as                  packer ,                 you will open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) Pick, Pack, and Ship (SO302020) form, switch to Pack mode,                  and                 scan  the                 reference number of the batch pick list. Then                  you will                  scan                  the barcode of the box to which the items                  will                 be  packed, and                 scan  the                 barcodes and the quantity of items being packed. After all the items are packed,                  you will                  confirm                  the shipment. In any working mode, you enter a command or barcode             by typing it in the  Scan  box and pressing Enter. In production             systems, you will scan the appropriate barcodes rather than manually entering             them. System Preparation Before you start the automated picking and packing operations, you need to perform                 the following instructions: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to the system with the  U100  dataset preloaded by                     using the  angelo  login and the  123  password.  On the  Warehouse Management  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences (SO101000) form, make sure the  Display                         the Pick Tab  and the  Display the Pack Tab                      check boxes are selected. Step 1: Preparing the Batch Picking Worksheet As the warehouse manager, you will prepare the batch picking worksheet as                 follows: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO503050|SO503050]) Create and Print Pick Lists (SO503050) form, and in the                          Action  box, select  Create and Print Batch Pick                         List .

Lot numbers and serial numbers are used to track certain types of inventory items and keep accurate records about these items’ distribution. If the ''Lot and Serial Tracking'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can configure the tracking of stock items by lot or serial number, as well as by expiration date, and process documents with these items in automated mode.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#_9b6a93b8-5cdb-43f8-a3a3-d976ae046fc4]
*Perform automated picking and packing operations with lot- and serial-tracked items
*Perform automated receiving and putting away operations with lot- and serial-tracked items
*Perform automated transfer operations with lot- and serial-tracked items
*Perform automated counting of lot- and serial-tracked items during physical inventory
*Perform automated issuing of lot- and serial-tracked items
*Perform automated receiving of lot- and serial-tracked items by using inventory receipts

==Applicable Scenarios==
You may need to track lot or serial numbers for items in any of the following cases:[anchor|#_ae21df4c-0c47-4502-8dc8-66f4a2a1262b]
*When your organization purchases items with serial numbers provided by vendors and you need to track these items by their serial numbers in a warehouse
*When your organization accepts returns or replacements of serialized items that it has sold
*When your organization provides services (such as installation or repair) for serialized items that it has sold
*When a vendor from which your organization buys items sells them in lots and provides lot numbers and expiration dates for each lot, which you want to track for the items
*When your organization sells items in lots and it is important to keep the assigned lot number tracked in the sales documents
*When your organization sells items with an expiration date and issues items based on this date

==Picking and Packing Lot- and Serial-Tracked Items==
You open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) form (or the corresponding screen in the Acumatica mobile app), switch to Pick mode, and scan a shipment number, the system loads the shipment lines into the table on the '''Pick''' tab. To select a line of the shipment for processing, you scan the item barcode and the barcode of the location from which the item is being picked. {br}

For serial-tracked items (with any assignment method), the system shows a separate line for each picked item. For lot-tracked items, the system shows the total quantity to be picked as one line and splits the line by lot.{br}

When you process the packing of items in Pack mode, for each item to be packed in a selected box, you scan the item barcode and lot or serial number; optionally, you also scan the expiration date (which must be the same as the expiration date in the shipment).
==Receiving and Putting Away Lot- and Serial-Tracked Items==
You open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_20|Receive and Put Away] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302020|PO302020]) form (or the corresponding screen in the Acumatica mobile app), switch to Receive mode, and scan or enter the purchase receipt number, the system loads the purchase receipt lines into the table on the '''Receive''' tab. To select a line for processing, you scan the item barcode and the barcode of the location to which the item is received. The settings of the item being received determine the item settings that you must enter.{br}

For lot-tracked and serial-tracked items with the ''When Used'' assignment method, specifying the lot or serial number in automated receiving and putting away operations is not applicable.{br}

For lot-tracked items with the ''When Received'' assignment method, the system requests the lot information as follows:[anchor|#_35955f55-6b95-485d-80ea-4104fccac27e]
*You must scan or enter the lot number when you are receiving an item. You receive each lot from a received quantity separately; the system splits the lines by the received lots. 
*For items of a lot class with the ''User-Enterable'' issue method, the auto-generation of lot numbers is mandatory, otherwise these items cannot be processed in an automated mode. For items that belong to a lot class for which the '''Auto-Generate Next Number''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_70_00|Lot/Serial Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) form, the system automatically generates lot numbers and displays them in the '''Lot/Serial Nbr.''' column. If you then scan a different lot number than the one that was automatically generated by the system, the system replaces the automatically generated number with the one that you have entered.
*For items of a lot class that requires the expiration date to be specified—that is, a class for which the '''Track Expiration Date''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_70_00|Lot/Serial Classes] form—you must enter the expiration date. 

For serial-tracked items with the ''When Received'' assignment method, the system requests the serial information as follows:[anchor|#_13e6e019-0afb-4787-8d6d-8c166299e58e]
*You must scan or enter the serial number when you are receiving an item. The system splits the line once you enter a serial number for a received item. If you specify a different serial number than the one that was automatically generated by the system, the system replaces the automatically generated number with the one that you have entered.
*For items of a serial class with the ''User-Enterable'' issue method, the auto-generation of serial numbers is mandatory, otherwise these items cannot be processed in an automated mode. For items that belong to a serial class for which the '''Auto-Generate Next Number''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_70_00|Lot/Serial Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) form, the system automatically generates serial numbers and displays them in the '''Lot/Serial Nbr.''' column. If you then scan a different serial number than the one that was automatically generated by the system, the system replaces the automatically generated number with the one that you have entered.

When you process the putting away of the items in Put Away mode, for each item to be put away, you scan the barcode of the receiving location, the item barcode, and then the lot or serial number.
==Processing Inventory Transfers with Lot- and Serial-Tracked Items==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_40_20|Scan and Transfer] ([~/?ScreenId=IN304020|IN304020]) form, when you transfer lot- or serial-tracked items, for each item to be processed, you scan the location barcode, the item barcode, and the barcode of the lot or serial number.
==Counting Lot- and Serial-Tracked Items==

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Automated Operations with Lot- and Serial-Tracked Items:      General     Information Lot numbers and serial numbers are used to track certain types of inventory items and keep         accurate records about these items’ distribution. If the  Lot and Serial Tracking          feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, you can configure         the tracking of stock items by lot or serial number, as well as by expiration date, and         process documents with these items in automated mode. Learning Objectives In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following: Perform automated picking and packing operations with lot- and serial-tracked items Perform automated receiving and putting away operations with lot- and serial-tracked           items Perform automated transfer operations with lot- and serial-tracked items Perform automated counting of lot- and serial-tracked items during physical           inventory Perform automated issuing of lot- and serial-tracked items Perform automated receiving of lot- and serial-tracked items by using inventory           receipts Applicable Scenarios You may need to track lot or serial numbers for items in any of the following cases: When your organization purchases items with serial numbers provided by vendors and you           need to track these items by their serial numbers in a warehouse When your organization accepts returns or replacements of serialized items that it has           sold When your organization provides services (such as installation or repair) for serialized           items that it has sold When a vendor from which your organization buys items sells them in lots and provides           lot numbers and expiration dates for each lot, which you want to track for the items When your organization sells items in lots and it is important to keep the assigned lot           number tracked in the sales documents When your organization sells items with an expiration date and issues items based on           this date Picking and Packing Lot- and Serial-Tracked Items You open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) Pick, Pack, and Ship (SO302020) form (or the corresponding screen         in the  Acumatica  mobile app), switch to Pick mode, and scan a shipment         number, the system loads the shipment lines into the table on the            Pick  tab. To select a line of the shipment for processing, you scan         the item barcode and the barcode of the location from which the item is being picked.  For serial-tracked items (with any assignment method), the system shows a separate line for         each picked item. For lot-tracked items, the system shows the total quantity to be picked as         one line and splits the line by lot. When you process the packing of items in Pack mode, for each item to be packed in a         selected box, you scan the item barcode and lot or serial number; optionally, you also scan         the expiration date (which must be the same as the expiration date in the shipment). Receiving and Putting Away Lot- and Serial-Tracked Items You open the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302020|PO302020]) Receive and Put Away (PO302020) form (or the corresponding screen         in the  Acumatica  mobile app), switch to Receive mode, and scan or enter         the purchase receipt number, the system loads the purchase receipt lines into the table on         the  Receive  tab. To select a line for processing, you scan the item         barcode and the barcode of the location to which the item is received. The settings of the         item being received determine the item settings that you must         enter . For lot-tracked and serial-tracked items with the  When Used  assignment method,         specifying the lot or serial number in automated receiving and putting away operations is         not applicable. For lot-tracked items with         the  When Received  assignment method, the system requests the lot information as         follows: Y ou           must scan or enter the lot number when you are receiving an item. You receive each lot           from a received quantity separately; the system splits the lines by the received lots.            For           items of a lot class with the  User-Enterable  issue method, the auto-generation of           lot numbers is mandatory ,            otherwise these items           cannot be processed in an automated mode.  For items that belong to a lot           class for which the  Auto-Generate Next Number  check box is selected           on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) Lot/Serial Classes (IN207000) form, the system automatically generates           lot numbers and displays them in the  Lot/Serial Nbr.  column. If you           then scan a different lot number than the one that was automatically generated by the           system, the system replaces the automatically generated number with the one that you have           entered. For items of a lot class that requires the expiration date to be specified—that           is, a class for which the  Track Expiration Date  check box is           selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) Lot/Serial Classes form—you must enter the expiration           date.  For serial-tracked items with the  When Received  assignment method, the system         requests the serial information as follows: Y ou           must scan or enter the serial number when you are receiving an item. The system splits the           line once you enter a serial number for a received item. If you specify a different serial           number than the one that was automatically generated by the system, the system replaces           the automatically generated number with the one that you have entered. For items of a serial class with the  User-Enterable  issue method, the           auto-generation of serial numbers is mandatory, otherwise these items cannot be processed           in an automated mode.  For items that belong to a serial class for which           the  Auto-Generate Next Number  check box is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) Lot/Serial Classes (IN207000) form, the system automatically generates serial           numbers and displays them in the  Lot/Serial Nbr.  column. If you           then scan a different serial number than the one that was automatically generated by the           system, the system replaces the automatically generated number with the one that you have           entered. When you process the putting away of the items in Put Away mode, for each item to be put         away, you scan the barcode of the receiving location, the item barcode, and then the lot or         serial number. Processing Inventory Transfers with Lot- and Serial-Tracked Items On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN304020|IN304020]) Scan and Transfer (IN304020) form, when you transfer lot- or         serial-tracked items, for each item to be processed, you scan the location barcode, the item         barcode, and the barcode of the lot or serial number. Counting Lot- and Serial-Tracked Items On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305020|IN305020]) Scan and Count (IN305020) form, when, during physical inventory,         you enter counted data that contain lot- or serial-tracked items, for each item to be         processed, you scan the location barcode, the item barcode, and the barcode of the lot or         serial number. During the counting of the items, if you find an item with an unregistered         serial number, you can add this item to the physical inventory document by scanning the item         barcode and the serial number. Processing Inventory Issues with Lot- and Serial-Tracked Items On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302020|IN302020]) Scan and Issue (IN302020) form, you can process inventory issues         that contain lot- or serial-tracked items. The system may prompt you to enter the lot or         serial number of the item, depending on the lot or serial class settings specified on the             ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) Lot/Serial Classes (IN207000) form as follows: For the lot or serial class with the  When Received  assignment method and              User-Enterable  issue method, the system prompts you to scan the lot or serial           number (which was specified on receiving of items). For the lot or serial class with the  When Used  assignment method, the system           prompts you to scan the lot or serial number only if the number is not generated           automatically and must be entered manually. Processing Inventory Receipts with Lot- and Serial-Tracked Items On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN301020|IN301020]) Scan and Receive (IN301020) form, you can process inventory receipts         that contain lot- or serial-tracked items. The system may prompt you to enter the lot or         serial number of the item and an expiration date, depending on the lot or serial class         settings specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) Lot/Serial Classes (IN207000) form as follows: For the lot or serial class with the  When Received  assignment method, the system           prompts you to scan the lot or serial number only if the number is not generated           automatically and must be entered manually. For the lot or serial class with the  Expiration  issue method, the system prompts           you to enter the expiration date of the item. ]]></column>

In this topic, you will read about the workflow for the automated picking and packing of lot- and serial-tracked inventory items in Acumatica ERP. The workflow in this topic is based on the assumption that your system has the recommended configuration described in [HelpRoot_WMS\WMS_LotSerial_Tracking_Implem_Checklist|Automated Operations with Lot- and Serial-Tracked Items: Implementation Checklist].
==Workflow for the Automated Picking of Lot- and Serial-Tracked Items==
The automated processing of picking lot- or serial-tracked items involves the actions shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#_43db308b-b6be-4696-8df0-863757ad7155][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_WMS_Pick_wLot.png|popup|450px]
To process the picking of lot- or serial-tracked items in Pick mode, you perform the following steps:[anchor|#_fc3acd1f-81f8-43c4-af60-3107a80987dc]
#''Switch to Pick mode''.
#:You open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) form (or the corresponding screen in the Acumatica mobile app) and switch to Pick mode by scanning or entering ''@pick'' barcode.
#''Scan the shipment number''.
#:To start the automated processing, you scan the reference number of the shipment to be processed. The system displays the lines of the scanned document in the table and inserts the reference number of the document that is currently selected for processing in the '''Shipment Nbr.''' box.
#''Scan the location barcode''.
#:When you scan the barcode of the location from which the item is picked, the system searches for the location in the lines of the document that is currently selected.
#''Scan the item barcode''.
#:When you scan the item barcode of the picked item, the system searches for the item in the lines of the currently selected document. 
#''Scan the lot or serial number of the item''.
#:You scan the lot or serial number of the item being picked. The system displays the picked quantity in the '''Picked Qty.''' column and highlights the line (in bold if the line has been picked partially, or in green if the line has been picked in full). If the UOM defined by the barcode of the scanned item corresponds to a non-base unit of measure, the system converts the item quantity defined by this barcode to the picked quantity in the base unit of measure for this item.
#:((({S:Warn}If the '''Default Auto-Generated Lot/Serial Nbr.''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form, the system specifies the lot or serial number for the item automatically.
)))
#Optional: ''Scan the item quantity''.
#:To change the picked quantity in the line that is currently being processed, you switch to Quantity Editing mode by scanning or entering the <tt>&#42;qty</tt> barcode, and manually enter the quantity in the UOM defined by the barcode of the scanned item.
#''Pick another line''.
#:If another item needs to be picked for the currently selected location, you scan the item barcode (return to Step 4) and repeat the process for the item.
#''Pick items from another location''.
#:If you need to pick items from another location, you scan the location barcode (return to Step 3) and repeat the process for the location.
#''Complete the picking process''.
#:If you have finished the picking operation for the currently selected document, you scan the <tt>@pack</tt> barcode to switch to Pack mode and proceed with packing.

==Workflow for the Automated Packing of Lot- and Serial-Tracked Items==
The automated processing of packing lot- or serial-tracked items that have been picked involves the actions shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#_9e1ea176-dfc8-48a7-a230-84dee5e5558d][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_WMS_Pack_wLot.png|popup|380px]
To process the packing of lot- or serial-tracked items in Pack mode, you perform the following steps:[anchor|#_7bef02b8-d7c5-4ee8-998c-3cd6748f2317]
#''Switch to Pack mode''.
#:You open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) form (or the corresponding screen in the Acumatica mobile app) and switch to Pack mode by scanning or entering ''@pack'' barcode.
#''Scan the document number''.
#:To start the automated processing, you scan the reference number of shipment to be processed. (If you have switched to Pack mode from Pick mode with the document selected, the document is selected automatically.) The system shows the lines of the scanned document in the table and inserts the reference number of the document that is currently selected for processing in the '''Shipment Nbr.''' box.
#''Scan the barcode of the box''.
#:You scan the barcode of the box into which the items will be packed.
#:((({S:Warn}If the ''Automatic Packaging'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, this step is performed automatically.
)))
#''Scan the item barcode''.
#:When you scan the barcode of the packed item, the system searches for the item in the lines of the document that is currently selected. If the UOM defined by the barcode of the scanned item corresponds to a non-base unit of measure, the system converts the item quantity defined by this barcode to the packed quantity in the base unit of measure for this item. 
#''Scan the lot or serial number of the item''.
#:You scan the lot or serial number of the item being packed. If the barcode of the scanned item is specified for a non-base unit of measure, the system converts this quantity to the packed quantity in the base unit of measure for this item; the system also shows the packed quantity in the '''Packed Qty.''' column, and highlights the line (in bold if the line has been processed partially, or in green if the line has been processed in full).
#:((({S:Warn}If the '''Default Auto-Generated Lot/Serial Nbr.''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form, the system specifies the lot or serial number for the item automatically.
)))
#Optional: ''Scan the item quantity''.
#:To change the packed quantity in the line that is currently being processed, you switch to Quantity Editing mode by scanning or entering the <tt>&#42;qty</tt> barcode, and manually enter the quantity in the UOM defined by the barcode of the scanned item.
#''Pack another line''.
#:If another item needs to be packed in the current box, you return to scanning the item barcode (return to Step 4) and repeat the process for the item. 
#''Confirm the box''.
#:If all items have been packed in the box, you confirm the current box by scanning the <tt>&#42;ok</tt> barcode or by clicking the '''OK''' button. 
#:((({S:Warn}This step is performed automatically for the shipments that are being packed in a single box that the system has suggested automatically.
)))
#''Enter the box weight''.
#:You enter the total weight of the box.
#:((({S:Warn}This step is performed automatically for the shipments that are being packed in a single box that the system has suggested automatically.
)))
#''Pack another box''.
#:If more items need to be packed for the current shipment, you return to scanning the barcode of the box barcode (return to Step 3) and repeat the process for another box. 
#''Complete the packing process''.
#:If you have finished the packing operation and do not need to specify shipping options, you scan the <tt>&#42;confirm&#42;shipment</tt> barcode or click the '''Confirm Shipment''' button on the form toolbar. The system confirms the shipment that is currently being processed.

==Known Process Limitations==

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Automated Operations with Lot- and Serial-Tracked Items: Picking and Packing Items If the  Lot and Serial Tracking  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form and the tracking of stock items by lot or serial         number has been configured in the system, when you pick and pack lot- or serial-tracked         items by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) Pick, Pack, and Ship (SO302020) form or the corresponding         screen in the  Acumatica  mobile app, the system may prompt the user to         enter the lot or serial number during this process. In this topic, you will read about the workflow for the automated picking and packing of         lot- and serial-tracked inventory items in  Acumatica ERP. The workflow in this topic is based on the assumption that your system has the         recommended configuration described in  Automated Operations with Lot- and Serial-Tracked Items: Implementation Checklist. Workflow for the Automated Picking of Lot- and Serial-Tracked Items The automated processing of picking lot- or serial-tracked items involves the actions shown         in the following diagram. To process the picking of lot- or serial-tracked items in Pick mode, you perform the         following steps: Switch to Pick             mode . You open             the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) Pick, Pack, and Ship (SO302020) form (or the corresponding screen in the                Acumatica  mobile app) and switch to Pick mode by scanning or             entering  @pick  barcode. Scan the shipment number . To start the automated processing, you scan the             reference number of the shipment to be processed. The system displays the lines of the             scanned document in the table and inserts the reference number of the document that is             currently selected for processing in the  Shipment Nbr.            box. Scan the location barcode . When you scan the barcode of the location from which             the item is picked, the system searches for the location in the lines of the document             that is currently selected. Scan the item barcode . When you scan the item barcode of the picked item, the             system searches for the item in the lines of the currently selected document.  Scan the lot or serial number of the item . You scan the lot or serial number of             the item being picked. The system displays the picked quantity in the  Picked               Qty.  column and highlights the line (in bold if the line has been picked             partially, or in green if the line has been picked in full).              If the UOM defined by             the barcode of the scanned item corresponds to a non-base unit of measure, the system             converts the item quantity defined by this barcode to the picked quantity in the base             unit of measure for this item. If the  Default Auto-Generated Lot/Serial Nbr.  check box             is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences (SO101000) form, the system specifies             the lot or serial number for the item automatically. Optional:  Scan the item quantity . To change the picked quantity in the line             that is currently being processed, you switch to Quantity Editing mode by scanning or             entering the  *qty  barcode, and manually enter              the quantity in the UOM             defined by the barcode of the scanned item . Pick another line . If another item needs to be picked for the currently             selected location, you scan the item barcode (return to Step 4) and repeat the process             for the item. Pick items from another location . If you need to pick items from another             location, you scan the location barcode (return to Step 3) and repeat the process for             the location. Complete the picking process . If you have finished the picking operation for             the currently selected document, you scan the  @pack  barcode to             switch to Pack mode and proceed with packing. Workflow for the Automated Packing of Lot-         and Serial-Tracked Items The automated processing of packing lot- or serial-tracked items that have been picked         involves the actions shown in the following diagram. To process the packing of lot- or serial-tracked items in Pack mode, you perform the         following steps: Switch to Pack             mode . You open             the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) Pick, Pack, and Ship (SO302020) form (or the corresponding screen in the                Acumatica  mobile app) and switch to Pack mode by scanning or             entering  @pack  barcode. Scan the document number . To start the automated processing, you scan the             reference number of shipment to be processed. (If you have switched to Pack mode from             Pick mode with the document selected, the document is selected automatically.) The             system shows the lines of the scanned document in the table and inserts the reference             number of the document that is currently selected for processing in the                Shipment Nbr.  box. Scan the barcode of the box . You scan the barcode of the box into which the             items will be packed. If the  Automatic Packaging  feature is enabled on             the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS101000) form, this step is performed             automatically. Scan the item barcode . When you scan the barcode of the packed item, the system             searches for the item in the lines of the document that is currently selected.              If the UOM defined by             the barcode of the scanned item corresponds to a non-base unit of measure, the system             converts the item quantity defined by this barcode to the packed quantity in the base             unit of measure for this item.  Scan the lot or serial number of the item . You scan the lot or serial number of             the item being packed. If the barcode of the scanned item is specified for a non-base             unit of measure, the system converts this quantity to the packed quantity in the base             unit of measure for this item; the system also shows the packed quantity in the                Packed Qty.  column, and highlights the line (in bold if the             line has been processed partially, or in green if the line has been processed in             full). If the  Default Auto-Generated Lot/Serial Nbr.              check box is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences (SO101000) form, the system             specifies the lot or serial number for the item automatically. Optional:  Scan the item quantity . To change the packed quantity in the line             that is currently being processed, you switch to Quantity Editing mode by scanning or             entering the  *qty  barcode, and manually enter              the quantity in the UOM             defined by the barcode of the scanned item . Pack another line . If another item needs to be packed in the current box, you             return to scanning the item barcode (return to Step 4) and repeat the process for the             item.  Confirm the box . If all items have been packed in the box, you confirm the             current box by scanning the  *ok  barcode or by clicking the                OK  button.  This step is performed automatically for             the shipments that are being packed in a single box that the system has suggested             automatically. Enter the box weight . You enter the total weight of the box. This step             is performed automatically for the shipments that are being packed in a single box that             the system has suggested automatically. Pack another box . If more items need to be packed for the current shipment, you             return to scanning the barcode of the box barcode (return to Step 3) and repeat the             process for another box.  Complete the packing process . If you have finished the packing operation and do             not need to specify shipping options, you scan the                *confirm*shipment  barcode or click the  Confirm               Shipment  button on the form toolbar. The system confirms the shipment that             is currently being processed. Known Process Limitations If the  Automatic Packaging  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features         (CS100000) form, a user can process in Pack mode only shipments packed to a single box. The         processing of shipments packed in two or more boxes in Pack mode is currently not supported.        ]]></column>

In this topic, you will read about the workflow for the automated receiving and putting away of lot- and serial-tracked inventory items in Acumatica ERP. The workflow in this topic is based on the assumption that your system has the recommended configuration described in [HelpRoot_WMS\WMS_LotSerial_Tracking_Implem_Checklist|Automated Operations with Lot- and Serial-Tracked Items: Implementation Checklist].
==Workflow for the Automated Receiving of Lot- or Serial-Tracked Items==
The automated processing of receiving items involves the actions shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#_e96cdd46-83af-40d0-92e4-e39bd5a1d175][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_WMS_Receive_wLot.png|popup|330px]
To process the receipt of lot- or serial-tracked items in Receive mode, you perform the following steps:[anchor|#_9079e2ce-98a2-4b28-b448-5025e22a7f6f]
#''Switch to Receive mode''.
#:You open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_20|Receive and Put Away] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302020|PO302020]) form (or the corresponding screen in the Acumatica mobile app) and switch to Receive mode by scanning or entering ''@receive'' barcode.
#''Scan the document number''.
#:To start the automated processing, you scan the reference number of the purchase order, purchase receipt, or purchase return document to be processed. The system displays the lines of the scanned document in the table. If you have scanned the purchase order number, the system creates and saves the related purchase receipt automatically. In the '''Receipt Nbr.''' box, the system inserts the reference number of the receipt or return that is currently selected for processing.
#''Scan the barcode of the receiving location''.
#:You scan the barcode of the warehouse location where the items are being received.
#''Scan the item barcode''.
#:When you scan the barcode of the received item, the system searches for the item in the lines of the document that is currently selected.
#''Scan the lot or serial number of the item''.
#:You scan the lot or serial number of the item being received.
#:((({S:Warn}If the '''Default Auto-Generated Lot/Serial Nbr.''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form, the system assigns and inserts the lot or serial number for the item automatically.
)))
#''Scan or enter the expiration date of the item''.
#:You scan the expiration date of the item being received. The system highlights the processed line in bold. If the UOM defined by the barcode of the scanned item corresponds to a non-base unit of measure, the system converts the item quantity defined by this barcode to the received quantity in the base unit of measure for this item. If the scanned item barcode corresponds to a non-base unit of measure, the system converts this quantity to the received quantity in the base unit of measure for this item.
#:((({S:Warn}If the '''Default Expiration Date''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form, the system fills in the expiration date for the item automatically.
)))
#Optional: ''Scan the item quantity''.
#:To change the received quantity in the line that is currently being processed, you switch on Quantity Editing mode by scanning or entering the <tt>&#42;qty</tt> barcode, and manually enter the quantity in the UOM defined by the barcode of the scanned item.
#''Receive another line''.
#:If you need to receive at least one other item for the document currently being processed, you return to scanning the item barcode (that is, return to Step 4) and repeat the process for the item.
#''Receive items in another location''.
#:If items must be received in another warehouse location, you scan the barcode of this location (return to Step 3) and repeat the process for the next location.
#''Complete the receiving process''.
#:If you have finished the receiving operation and all items have been received for the purchase order (or the items were received partially and more items will be received in the future), you scan the <tt>&#42;release&#42;receipt</tt> barcode or click the '''Release Receipt''' button. The system releases the purchase receipt.

==Workflow for the Automated Putting Away of Items==
The automated processing of putting away items involves the actions shown in the following diagram. [anchor|#_8f6cc243-6f57-45e0-876c-860181f7ffa2][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_WMS_PutAway_wLot.png|popup|450px]
To process the putting away of lot- or serial-tracked items in Put Away mode, you perform the following steps:[anchor|#_6dd4e1fb-e362-4aa3-a79c-1246a336a887]
#''Switch to Put Away mode''.
#:You open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_20|Receive and Put Away] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302020|PO302020]) form (or the corresponding screen in the Acumatica mobile app) and switch to Put Away mode by scanning or entering ''@putaway'' barcode.
#''Scan the document number''.
#:To start the automated processing, you scan the reference number of the released purchase receipt to be processed. (If you switched to Put Away mode from Receive mode with a document selected, the system selected the document automatically.) The system displays the lines of the scanned document in the table. In the '''Receipt Nbr.''' box, the system inserts the reference number of the document that is currently selected for processing.
#''Scan the barcode of the destination location''.
#:You scan the barcode of the destination location in which you are putting away items. If the items of a particular line are put away in multiple locations, the system splits the line by locations and shows &lt;SPLIT&gt; in the '''Location''' column. You can review the IDs of the locations to which the items are put away by clicking '''Transfer Allocations''' on the table toolbar of the '''Put Away''' tab.
#:Once you have specified the destination location, the system automatically creates a one-step inventory transfer document that reflects the movement of the items from the receiving location to the storage location.
#''Scan the barcode of the item''.
#:When you scan the item barcode of the received item, the system searches for the item in the lines of the document that is currently selected. If the UOM defined by the barcode of the scanned item corresponds to a non-base unit of measure, the system converts the item quantity defined by this barcode to the put away quantity in the base unit of measure for this item. To indicate the line or lines with the scanned barcode, the system selects the '''Matched''' check box in these lines. The system highlights the lines in bold if they are processed partially, and in green if they are processed in full.
#''Scan the lot or serial number of the item''.
#:Scan the lot or serial number of the item to be put away.
#Optional: ''Scan the item quantity''.
#:To change the quantity being put away in the line that is currently being processed, you switch to Quantity Editing mode by scanning or entering the <tt>&#42;qty</tt> barcode, and manually enter the quantity in the UOM defined by the barcode of the scanned item.
#''Scan another item''.
#:If at least one other item needs to be put away, you return to scanning the barcode of the item (that is, return to Step 4) and repeat the process for the item.
#''Scan another destination location''.
#:If items must be transferred to another destination location, you scan the barcode of this location (return to Step 3) and repeat the process.
#''Complete the process of putting items away''.
#:When you have finished the operation of putting away items, you scan the <tt>&#42;release&#42;transfer</tt> barcode or click the '''Release Transfer''' button. The system releases the inventory transfer document that was prepared during the automated operation; the items are moved to the destination locations.

Scan the barcode of the destination location . You scan the barcode of                         the destination location in which you are putting away items. If the items                         of a particular line are put away in multiple locations, the system                          splits the                         line by locations and shows <SPLIT> in the                              Location  column . You can review                         the IDs of the locations to which the items are put away by clicking                              Transfer Allocations  on the table toolbar of the                              Put Away  tab. Once you have specified the                         destination location, the system automatically creates a one-step inventory                         transfer document that reflects the movement of the items from the receiving                         location to the storage location. Scan the barcode of the item . When you scan the item barcode of the                         received item, the system searches for the item in the lines of the document                         that is currently selected.                          If the UOM                         defined by the barcode of the scanned item corresponds to a non-base unit of                         measure, the system converts the item quantity defined by this barcode to                         the put away quantity in the base unit of measure for this item.                          To indicate the line or lines with the scanned barcode,                         the system selects the  Matched  check box in these                         lines. The system highlights the lines in bold if they are processed                         partially, and in green if they are processed in full. Scan the lot or serial number of the item . Scan the lot or serial                         number of the item to be put away. Optional:  Scan the item quantity . To change the quantity being put away                         in the line that is currently being processed, you switch to Quantity                         Editing mode by scanning or entering the  *qty                          barcode, and manually enter                          the                         quantity in the UOM defined by the barcode of the scanned                         item . Scan another item . If at least one other item needs to be put away, you                         return to scanning the barcode of the item (that is, return to Step 4) and                         repeat the process for the item. Scan another destination location . If items must be transferred to                         another destination location, you scan the barcode of this location (return                         to Step 3) and repeat the process. Complete the process of putting items away . When you have finished the                         operation of putting away items, you scan the                              *release*transfer  barcode or click the                              Release Transfer  button. The system releases the                         inventory transfer document that was prepared during the automated                         operation; the items are moved to the destination locations. ]]></column>

To avoid any issues, restore the ''U100'' dataset to its initial state.
))){br}{TOC}
==Story==
Suppose that on 1/27/2020, the purchasing manager of the wholesale warehouse of SweetLife company has entered a purchase order for 30 pounds of pears (three boxes of 10 pounds each, and the boxes can have different expiration dates) from the Glory Fruit Case vendor. The vendor supplies each box with a lot number that must be used for tracking the enclosed items in the Wholesale warehouse. Then, on 1/29/2020, , the sales manager has entered a sales order for 12 pounds of pears being sold to GoodFood One Restaurant. {br}

As the warehouse worker, you will receive the items in the purchase order and put them away in the fruit locations. Then you will pick and pack the items for the sales order. Finally, at the request of the warehouse manager, you will move the remaining items (those not included in the sales order) from one location to another.
==Configuration Overview==
In the ''U100'' dataset, the following features have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, where they are in the ''Inventory and Order Management'' group of features:[anchor|#ul_wqn_zy2_3fb]
*''Inventory''
* ''Lot and Serial Tracking''
* ''Warehouse Management''
* ''Fulfillment''
* ''Receiving''
* ''Inventory Operations''

The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in the system:[anchor|#ul_ghb_r2d_pfb]
*A warehouse on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form: ''WHOLESALE''
*A stock item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form: ''PEARS''. For the stock item, the ''PE1LB'' barcode has been specified on the '''Cross-Reference''' tab of the form, and the ''ALTFRT'' lot class is assigned.
*A lot class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_70_00|Lot/Serial Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) form: ''ALTFRT''. The lot class is defined so that the fruits with the earliest expiration date are issued first. Also, auto-generation of lot numbers is configured for the lot class.
*A vendor on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form: ''GLORYFRUIT''
*A customer on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form: ''GOODFOOD''

A purchase order to ''GLORYFRUIT'' has been entered into the system on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. Also, a sales order to ''GOODFOOD'' has been entered into the system on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form.
==Process Overview==
In this process activity, you will act as a warehouse worker in the Wholesale warehouse.You will receive the items for a purchase order in automated mode and specify the lot number and expiration date for each unit of the items, and then put the received items away in the appropriate storage locations. Then you will create a shipment for a sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, and pick and pack the items for this shipment in the automated mode. Finally, you will prepare an inventory transfer to record the movement of the items from one location to another on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_40_20|Scan and Transfer] ([~/?ScreenId=IN304020|IN304020]) form.[anchor|#_23f52ae6-aa12-4ee9-ac46-382a69c35b23]((({S:Warn}In any working mode, you enter a command or barcode by typing it in the '''Scan''' box and pressing Enter. In production systems, you will scan the appropriate barcodes rather than manually entering them.
)))
==System Preparation==
Before you start performing the activity, you need to perform the following instructions:[anchor|#_d09a3573-b715-4111-b792-5858248e13a0]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded. To sign in as the sales and purchasing manager, use the ''perkins'' login and the ''123'' password.
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to 1/30/2020. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select 1/30/2020 on the calendar.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, make sure that the ''Lot and Serial Tracking'' feature is enabled.

==Step 1: Receiving and Putting Away Items==
Suppose that the Glory Fruit Case vendor has delivered the 30 pounds of pears to the Wholesale warehouse: three boxes of 10 pounds each. Two of the boxes (that is, 20 pounds of pears) have one lot number and expiration date, and the third box (that is, 10 pounds of pears) has a different lot number and expiration date. You will prepare the needed documents to reflect the receipt of the pears as follows:[anchor|#_f4f7e50b-3225-4520-87fd-2005d9ef7e2e]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_20|Receive and Put Away] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302020|PO302020]) form, and make sure the '''Receive''' tab is opened.
#In the '''Scan''' box of the Summary area, enter ''000025'', which is the reference number of the purchase order for which you will perform receiving items and putting them away to storage locations. The system creates the purchase receipt for the purchase order and loads the purchase receipt lines to the table on the '''Receive''' tab. The reference number of the purchase receipt that is currently being processed is displayed in the '''Receipt Nbr.''' box of the Summary area.
#Enter <tt>MAIN</tt> to select the location in which you have received the items.
#Enter <tt>PE1LB</tt> to select the item being received. 
#Enter <tt>FR000762</tt> to specify the lot number of the first and second boxes of pears. (These boxes have the same lot number.)
#Enter <tt>02/20/</tt>2020,  to specify the expiration date of these boxes, which have the same expiration date. The system highlights the purchase receipt line in bold, and specifies 1 as the '''Received Quantity'''. The two boxes with the lot number and expiration date you have specified contain 20 pounds, so the quantity of the line should be 20.
#Set the quantity of the current line to <tt>20</tt> as follows:
##On the form toolbar, click '''Set Qty'''. The system prompts you to enter the item quantity.
##In the '''Scan''' box, type <tt>20</tt>. 
#Enter <tt>PE1LB</tt> to select the item being received. You are now processing the third box of 10 pounds of pears, which has a different lot number and expiration date than the first two boxes had.
#Enter <tt>FR000782</tt> to specify the lot number of the third box of pears.
#Enter <tt>02/13/</tt>2020,  to specify the expiration date of this box. The system splits the line, and specifies 1 as the '''Received Quantity''' in the newly added line. The box with the lot number and expiration date you just entered contains 10 pounds, so the quantity of the line should be 10.
#Set the quantity of the current line to <tt>10</tt>. On the '''Receive''' tab, the system highlights both lines in green, indicating that these lines have been received in full.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Release Receipt''' to release the purchase receipt. The system releases the purchase receipt and generates a corresponding inventory receipt transaction to record the receipt of the items to the ''MAIN'' location of the warehouse.
#Enter ''@putaway'' to switch to Put Away mode. Notice that the purchase receipt is still selected and its reference number is shown in the '''Receipt Nbr.''' box of the Summary area.
#Enter <tt>F1S2</tt> to select the location to which the items (the 20 pounds of pears in the first two boxes) are being put away.
#Enter <tt>PE1LB</tt> to select the item to be put away to this location.
#Enter <tt>FR000762</tt> to specify the lot number of the first and second box of pears.
#Set the quantity to <tt>20</tt>.
#Enter <tt>F2S1</tt> to select the location to which the rest of the items (the remaining 10 pounds of pears, which are in the third box) are being put away.
#Enter <tt>PE1LB</tt> to select the item to be put away to this location.
#Enter <tt>FR000782</tt> to specify the lot number of the third box of pears.
#Set the quantity to <tt>10</tt>.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Release Transfer'''.
#On the '''Transfers''' tab, click the '''Reference Nbr.''' link to open the prepared inventory transfer transaction on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_40_00|Transfers] ([~/?ScreenId=IN304000|IN304000]) form. Make sure that the transfer has the ''Released'' status shown in the ''Status'' box, and make sure the lot number and expiration date have been assigned to the lines, as shown in the screenshot.[anchor|#_f58600d0-6daf-43a4-8dd4-a2d094365c7a][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_WMS_Receive_Put_Away_Lot.png|popup|Lot-tracked items moved to storage locations|450px]

==Step 2: Creating a Shipment==
In this step, will create a shipment for some of the pears that have been received and put away. Do the following:[anchor|#_96d0fc6c-f29c-4a47-ab92-3a10b2cff211]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, open a sales order to ''GOODFOOD'' dated 1/29/2020, , and make sure it has a line with the ''PEARS'' item and quantity ''12''. 
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Create Shipment''' to prepare a shipment.
#In the '''Specify Shipment Parameters''' dialog box, which opens, make sure that the 1/30/2020 date and the ''WHOLESALE'' warehouse are selected, and click '''OK'''. The system creates a shipment and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form. Notice the reference number of the shipment; you will need it in the next step.

==Step 4: Picking and Packing Items for the Shipment==
To perform automated picking and packing of the ordered items, do the following:[anchor|#_4f35f2a1-2af2-4ad8-b372-f43b83cfeda4]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) form, and make sure the '''Pick''' tab is opened.
#In the '''Scan''' box of the Summary area, enter the reference number of the shipment that you have prepared earlier in this activity. The system loads the shipment lines to the '''Pick''' tab, and shows the reference number of the shipment that is currently being processed in the '''Shipment Nbr.''' box of the Summary area. Notice that the system has split the line so that 10 units for the shipment are taken from the box with the earlier expiration date, and the rest of the shipment (2 units) are taken from another box.
#Enter <tt>F2S1</tt> to select the location from which the item is picked.
#Enter <tt>PE1LB</tt> to select the item that is being picked from the selected location.
#Enter <tt>FR000782</tt> to specify the lot number. The system highlights the second line of the shipment in green and specifies ''1'' as the '''Picked Quantity'''.
#Set the quantity to <tt>10</tt> as follows:
##On the form toolbar, click '''Set Qty'''. The system prompts you to enter the quantity.
##In the '''Scan''' box, type <tt>10</tt>. The system highlights the first line of the shipment in green and specifies ''10'' as the '''Picked Quantity'''.
#Enter <tt>F1S2</tt> to select the location from which the item is picked for the remainder of the order..
#Enter <tt>PE1LB</tt> to select the item being picked from the selected location.
#Enter <tt>FR000762</tt> to specify the lot number.
#Set the quantity to <tt>2</tt>. You have picked items for both lines, and now can processed with packing them in the box.
#Enter ''@pack'' to switch to Pack mode. Notice that the shipment is still selected and its reference number is shown in the '''Shipment Nbr.''' box of the Summary area.
#Enter <tt>MEDIUM</tt> to select the box for packaging the shipment.
#Enter <tt>PE1LB</tt> to select the item to be packed to the selected box.
#Enter <tt>FR000782</tt> to specify the lot number.
#Set the quantity to <tt>10</tt>.
#Enter <tt>PE1LB</tt> to select the item to be packed to the selected box.
#Enter <tt>FR000762</tt> to specify the lot number.
#Set the quantity to <tt>2</tt>. All items are packed in the box, so you can confirm the package.
#On the form toolbar, click '''OK''' to confirm the package.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Confirm Shipment'''.

==Step 5: Reviewing the Shipment==
Review the shipment in the system as follows:[anchor|#_02b617de-6682-403a-9f1d-5d0fdebd3c7f]
#Open the shipment that you have processed earlier on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form. Notice that it is assigned the ''Confirmed'' status.
#Review the '''Packages''' tab. Notice that one box with the ''MEDIUM'' identifier is shown in the upper table, and the '''Contents of Selected Package''' table shows the items that have been packed into this box, as shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_38c3f13d-3a72-4c88-af1d-1798182a9f7a][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_WMS_Pick_Pack_Lot.png|popup|Confirmed shipment|450px]

==Step 6: Transferring Items==
Suppose that he warehouse manager has decided to clean the ''F1S2'' location and asked you to move all items from this location to the ''F2S1'' location, which has already been cleaned. In the ''F1S2'' location, you found 18 pounds of pears and moved them to the ''F2S1'' location. Now you acting as a warehouse worker need to record this movement in the system by creating an inventory transfer. Do the following:[anchor|#_ff613c49-6149-45ed-a209-b36d2c086f13]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_40_20|Scan and Transfer] ([~/?ScreenId=IN304020|IN304020]) form.
#In the '''Scan''' box of the Summary area, enter <tt>F1S2</tt> as the origin location. 
#Enter <tt>F2S1</tt> as the destination location.
#Enter <tt>PE1LB</tt> as the item to be transferred.
#Enter <tt>FR000762</tt> to specify the lot number. The system adds a line with one unit of the item to the table on the '''Transfer''' tab.
#Set the quantity of the line to <tt>18</tt> as follows:
##On the form toolbar, click '''Set Qty'''. The system prompts you to enter the quantity.
##In the '''Scan''' box, enter<tt>18</tt>. 
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''. The system creates the transfer with the data you have entered. You can view the transfer number in the '''Reference Nbr.''' box of the Summary area.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Release'''. The system releases the transfer.
#Click the Edit button next to the '''Reference Nbr.''' box, and on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_40_00|Transfers] ([~/?ScreenId=IN304000|IN304000]) form that opens, review the inventory transfer transaction. Make sure it includes the needed line and is assigned the ''Released'' status, as shown in the screenshot below.[anchor|#_c57cde14-9d18-4b25-96f1-7800ab4032b3][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_WMS_Scan_and_Transfer_Lot.png|popup|Lot-tracked items transferred to another location|450px]

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Automated Operations with Lot- and Serial-Tracked Items: Process Activity In the following activity, you will learn how to process purchase documents, sales                 documents, and transfer transactions with lot-tracked stock items in automated                 mode. The following activity is based on the                  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system settings             have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the activity             and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100  dataset             to its initial state. Story Suppose that on 1/27/ 2020,  the                  purchasing manager of the wholesale warehouse of SweetLife company                 ha s                  entered a purchase order for 30 pounds of pears (three boxes of 10 pounds each, and                 the boxes can have different expiration dates) from the Glory Fruit Case vendor. The                 vendor supplies each box with a lot number that must be used for tracking the                 enclosed items in the Wholesale warehouse.                  Then, on 1/29/ 2020,  , the sales manager has entered a sales order for 12 pounds of pears                 being sold to GoodFood One Restaurant.                  As the warehouse worker, you will receive the items in the purchase                 order and put them away in the fruit                 locations.  Then                  you will pick and pack the items for the sales order. Finally, at                 the request of the warehouse manager, you will move the remaining items (those not                 included in the sales order) from one location to another. Configuration Overview In the  U100  dataset, the following features have been enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, where they are in the                      Inventory and Order Management  group of features: Inventory Lot and Serial Tracking Warehouse Management Fulfillment Receiving Inventory Operations The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in                 the system: A warehouse on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses (IN204000) form:                          WHOLESALE A stock item on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500)                     form:                          PEARS .                     For the stock item, the  PE1LB  barcode has been specified on the                          Cross-Reference  tab of the form, and the                          ALTFRT  lot class is assigned. A lot class on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) Lot/Serial Classes (IN207000) form:                          A LTFRT .                     The lot class is defined so that the fruits with the earliest expiration date                     are issued first. Also, auto-generation of lot numbers is configured for the lot                     class. A vendor on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors (AP303000) form:                          GLORYFRUIT A customer on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000) form:                          GOODFOOD A purchase order to                      GLORYFRUIT  has been entered into the system on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form. Also, a sales order to                      GOODFOOD  has been entered  into the system on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders form. Process Overview In this process activity, you will act as a warehouse worker in the Wholesale warehouse. Y ou                 will receive the items                  for a purchase                 order  in automated mode and specify the lot number and expiration                 date for each unit of the items, and then put the received items away in the                 appropriate storage                 locations.  Then                  you will create a                  shipment for a                  sales order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000)                 form ,                 and  pick and pack the items                  for this shipment                  in the automated                 mode.  Finally,                  you will prepare an inventory transfer to record the movement of                 the items from one location to another on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN304020|IN304020]) Scan and Transfer                 (IN304020) form. In any working mode, you enter a command or barcode             by typing it in the  Scan  box and pressing Enter. In production             systems, you will scan the appropriate barcodes rather than manually entering             them. System Preparation Before you start performing the activity, you need to perform the following                 instructions: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the  U100  dataset preloaded. To                     sign in as the sales and purchasing manager, use the                          perkins                      login and the  123  password. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to  1/30/2020. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and                     select  1/30/2020 on the calendar. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, make sure that the                          Lot and Serial Tracking  feature is enabled. Step                  1 :                 Receiving and Putting Away Items Suppose that the Glory Fruit Case vendor has delivered the 30 pounds of                  pears                  to the Wholesale warehouse: three boxes of 10 pounds each. Two of the boxes (that                 is, 20 pounds of                  pears )                 have one lot number and expiration date, and the third box (that is, 10 pounds of                  pears )                 has a different lot number and expiration date. You will prepare the needed                 documents to reflect the receipt of the                  pears                  as follows: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302020|PO302020]) Receive and Put Away (PO302020) form, and make sure the                          Receive  tab is opened. In the  Scan  box of the Summary area, enter                          000025 ,                     which is  the reference number of the purchase                     order                      for which you will perform receiving items and putting them away to storage                     locations . The system creates the purchase receipt for the                     purchase order and loads the purchase receipt lines to the table on the                          Receive  tab. The reference number of the purchase                     receipt that is currently being processed is displayed in the  Receipt                         Nbr.  box of the Summary area. Enter  MAIN  to select the location in which you have                     received the items. Enter                          PE1LB                      to select the item being received.  Enter  FR000762  to specify the lot number of the first and                     second boxes of                      pears .                     (These boxes have the same lot number.) Enter                          02/20/ 2020,   to specify the expiration date of these boxes,                     which have the same expiration date. The system highlights the purchase receipt                     line in bold, and specifies 1 as the  Received Quantity .                     The two boxes with the lot number and expiration date you have specified contain                     20 pounds, so the quantity of the line should be 20. Set the quantity of the current line to  20  as follows: On the form toolbar, click  Set Qty . The system                             prompts you to enter the item quantity. In the  Scan  box, type  20 .                          Enter                          PE1LB                      to select the item being received. You are now processing the third box of 10                     pounds of                      pears ,                     which has a different lot number and expiration date than the first two boxes                     had. Enter  FR000782  to specify the lot number of the third box                     of                      pears . Enter                          02/13/ 2020,   to specify the expiration date of this box. The                     system splits the line, and specifies 1 as the  Received                         Quantity  in the newly added line. The box with the lot number                     and expiration date you just entered contains 10 pounds, so the quantity of the                     line should be 10. Set the quantity of the current line to  10 . On the                          Receive  tab, the system highlights both lines in                     green, indicating that these lines have been received in full. On the form toolbar, click  Release Receipt  to release the                     purchase receipt. The system releases the purchase receipt and generates a                     corresponding inventory receipt transaction to record the receipt of the items                     to the  MAIN  location of the warehouse. Enter  @putaway  to switch to Put Away mode. Notice that the purchase                     receipt is still selected and its reference number is shown in the                          Receipt Nbr.  box of the Summary area. Enter  F1S2  to select the location to which the items (the                     20 pounds of                      pears                      in the first two boxes) are being put away. Enter                          PE1LB                      to select the item to be put away to this location. Enter  FR000762  to specify the lot number of the first and                     second box of                      pears . Set the quantity to  20 . Enter  F2S1  to select the location to which the rest of                     the items (the remaining 10 pounds of                      pears ,                     which are in the third box) are being put away. Enter                          PE1LB                      to select the item to be put away to this location. Enter  FR000782  to specify the lot number of the third box                     of                      pears . Set the quantity to  10 . On the form toolbar, click  Release Transfer . On the  Transfers  tab,                      click the                          Reference Nbr.  link to open the prepared inventory                     transfer transaction on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN304000|IN304000]) Transfers (IN304000) form.                      M ake                     sure that the transfer has the  Released                      status  shown in                     the  Status  box ,                      and make sure                     the lot number and expiration date have been assigned to the lines, as shown in                     the screenshot. Lot-tracked items moved to storage locations Step                  2 :                 Creating a                  Shipment In this step, will create                 a  shipment                  for some of the                  pears                  that have been received and put away.                  D o                 the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form,                      open a sales                     order to  GOODFOOD  dated 1/29/ 2020,  , and make sure it has a line with the  PEARS  item and                     quantity  12 .  On the form toolbar, click  Actions Create Shipment  to prepare a shipment. In the  Specify Shipment Parameters  dialog box, which                     opens, make sure that the                          1/30/2020 date and the  WHOLESALE  warehouse are selected, and                     click  OK . The system creates a shipment and opens it on                     the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000)                     form.  Notice                     the reference number of the shipment; you will need it in the next                     step. Step 4: Picking and Packing Items for the Shipment To perform automated picking and packing of the ordered items, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) Pick, Pack, and Ship (SO302020) form, and make sure the                          Pick  tab is opened. In the  Scan  box of the Summary area, enter the reference                     number of the shipment                      that you have                     prepared earlier in this activity . The system loads the                     shipment lines to the  Pick  tab, and shows the reference                     number of the shipment that is currently being processed in the                          Shipment Nbr.  box of the Summary                     area.  Notice                     that the system has split the line so that 10 units for the shipment are taken                     from the box with the earlier expiration date, and the rest of the shipment (2                     units) are taken from another box. Enter  F2S1  to select the location from which the item is                     picked. Enter                          PE1LB                      to select the item that is being picked from the selected location. Enter  FR000782  to specify the lot                     number.  The                     system highlights the second line of the shipment in green and specifies                          1  as the  Picked                     Quantity . Set the quantity to                      10                      as follows: On the form toolbar, click  Set Qty . The system                             prompts you to enter the quantity. In the  Scan  box, type  10 .                             The system highlights the first line of the shipment in green and                             specifies  10  as the  Picked Quantity . Enter  F1S2  to select the location from which the item is                     picked for the remainder of the order.. Enter  PE1LB  to select the item being picked from the                     selected location. Enter  FR000762  to specify the lot number. Set the quantity to  2 . You have picked items for both                     lines, and now can processed with packing them in the box. Enter  @pack  to switch to Pack mode. Notice that the shipment is still                     selected and its reference number is shown in the  Shipment                         Nbr.  box of the Summary area. Enter  MEDIUM  to select the box for packaging the                     shipment. Enter                          PE1LB                      to select the item to be packed to the selected box. Enter  FR000782  to specify the lot number. Set the quantity to  10 . Enter                          PE1LB                      to select the item to be packed to the selected box. Enter  FR000762  to specify the lot number. Set the quantity to                      2 .                      All items are packed in the box, so you can confirm the                     package. On the form                     toolbar, c lick  OK  to confirm the                     package. On the form toolbar, click  Confirm                     Shipment . Step 5: Reviewing the Shipment R eview                 the shipment in the system as follows: Open the shipment that you have processed earlier on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO303000) form. Notice that it is assigned the                          Confirmed  status. Review the  Packages  tab. Notice that one box with the                          MEDIUM  identifier is shown in the upper table, and the                          Contents of Selected Package  table shows the items                     that have been packed into this box, as shown in the following screenshot. Confirmed shipment Step 6: Transferring Items Suppose that he warehouse manager has decided to clean the  F1S2  location and                 asked you to move all items from this location to the  F2S1  location, which                 has already been cleaned. In the  F1S2  location, you found 18 pounds of                  pears                  and moved them to the  F2S1  location. Now you                  acting as a                 warehouse worker  need to record this movement in the system by                 creating an inventory transfer. Do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN304020|IN304020]) Scan and Transfer (IN304020) form. In the  Scan  box of the Summary area, enter                          F1S2  as the origin location.  Enter  F2S1  as the destination location. Enter                          PE1LB                      as the item to be transferred. Enter  FR000762  to specify the lot number. The system adds                     a line with one unit of the item to the table on the                          Transfer  tab. Set the quantity of the                      line                      to  18  as follows: On the form toolbar, click  Set Qty . The system                             prompts you to enter the quantity. In the  Scan  box,  enter 18 .  On the form toolbar, click  Save . The system creates the                     transfer with the data you have entered. You can view the transfer number in the                          Reference Nbr.  box of the Summary area. On the form toolbar, click  Release . The system releases                     the transfer. Click the Edit button next to the  Reference Nbr.  box, and                     on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN304000|IN304000]) Transfers (IN304000) form that opens, review the                     inventory transfer transaction. Make sure it includes the needed line and is                     assigned the  Released  status, as shown in the screenshot below.

)))
==Story==
Suppose that you are a warehouse worker, and you have been assigned to perform a physical inventory count by entering the barcodes of stock items and locations. You will count the quantities of coconuts in particular warehouse locations added to the physical inventory document, which your manager has provided to you.
==Configuration Overview==
In the ''U100'' dataset, the following features have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, where they are in the ''Inventory and Order Management'' group of features:[anchor|#ul_wqn_zy2_3fb]
*''Multiple Warehouse Locations''
* ''Lot and Serial Tracking''
* ''Advanced Physical Count''
* ''Warehouse Management''
* ''Inventory Operations''

The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in the system:[anchor|#ul_ghb_r2d_pfb]
*A warehouse on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form: ''WHOLESALE''.
*The following warehouse locations on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] form: ''F3S1'' and ''F3S2''.
*A stock item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form: ''COCONUTS''. For this stock item, the barcode has been specified on the '''Cross-Reference''' tab of the form.
*A physical inventory type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_89_00|Physical Inventory Types] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) form: ''CNCNT''.

Also, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_40_00|Prepare Physical Count] ([~/?ScreenId=IN504000|IN504000]) form, the physical inventory document has been created, and it has the ''Counting in Progress'' status.
==Process Overview==
As you count lot-tracked items within a physical inventory in this activity, you will scan the barcode of the physical inventory document; you will then scan the location barcode, the barcode of each item you find in this location, and the barcodes of the lot numbers that correspond to each item. When you have counted all items in all locations added to the physical inventory document, you will confirm the document.[anchor|#_1e6a39bc-fb6e-4412-8cb5-e98c094f87f8]((({S:Warn}In any working mode, you enter a command or barcode by typing it in the '''Scan''' box and pressing Enter. In production systems, you will scan the appropriate barcodes rather than manually entering them.
)))
==System Preparation==
Before you start performing the activity, launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded. To sign in as a warehouse worker, use the ''perkins'' login and the ''123'' password.
==Step 1: Entering the Counted Quantities of Items==
Suppose that you have started counting coconuts. Do the following to enter the counted quantities into the system:[anchor|#_413e6468-bd51-440b-9ae6-03bd068f0e58]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_20|Scan and Count] ([~/?ScreenId=IN305020|IN305020]) form.
#In the '''Scan''' box, enter <tt>000002</tt> (which is the reference number of the physical inventory count). The list of items that you should count is displayed on the '''Count''' tab.
#Enter <tt>F3S1</tt>, which is the barcode of the first location. 
#:Suppose that in this location, you find two boxes of coconuts with different lot numbers.
#Enter <tt>CNBOX</tt>, which is the barcode that corresponds to a box of 5 pounds of coconuts.
#Enter <tt>FR100895</tt> to specify the lot number of the coconuts. The system adds 5 units of the ''COCONUTS'' item to the corresponding table row.
#Enter <tt>CNBOX</tt> to add another box of coconuts with a different lot number.
#Enter <tt>FR100751</tt> to specify the lot number of the coconuts. The system adds 5 units of the ''COCONUTS'' item to the corresponding table row.
#:You have finished counting items in the ''F3S1'' location and can start counting items in the next location.
#Enter <tt>F3S2</tt>, which is the barcode of the second location.
#:Suppose that in this location, you find one box of coconuts.
#Enter <tt>CNBOX</tt> to add the box of coconuts.
#Enter <tt>FR100598</tt> to specify the lot number of the coconuts. The system adds 5 units of the ''COCONUTS'' item to the corresponding table row.
#:You have finished counting items in the ''F3S2'' location and need to confirm the counted data.

==Step 2: Reviewing the Quantities and Confirming the Entered Data==
After you have entered the quantities of all items in the physical inventory document, you need to review the quantities and confirm the entered data. Do the following:[anchor|#_f9f6fad2-f65b-452b-853b-ab44da197cd2]
#While you are still viewing the ''000002'' physical inventory document on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_20|Scan and Count] ([~/?ScreenId=IN305020|IN305020]) form, review the lines of the table on the '''Count''' tab. They should have the settings indicated in the following table.
#:{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="14%" ! Line Nbr.
!width="28%" ! Location
!width="28%" ! Inventory ID
!width="14%" ! Lot/Serial Number

The following activity is based on the                  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system settings             have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the activity             and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100  dataset             to its initial state. Story Suppose that you are a warehouse worker, and you have been assigned to perform a                 physical inventory count by entering the barcodes of stock items and locations. You                 will count the quantities of coconuts in particular warehouse locations added to the                 physical inventory document, which your manager has provided to you. Configuration Overview In the  U100  dataset, the following features have been enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, where they are in the                      Inventory and Order Management  group of features: Multiple Warehouse Locations Lot and Serial Tracking Advanced Physical Count Warehouse Management Inventory Operations The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in                 the system: A warehouse on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses (IN204000) form:                          WHOLESALE .

For this stock item, the barcode has been specified on                     the  Cross-Reference  tab of the form. A physical inventory type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) Physical Inventory Types (IN208900)                     form:  CNCNT . Also, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN504000|IN504000]) Prepare Physical Count (IN504000) form, the physical inventory                 document has been created, and it has the  Counting in Progress  status. Process Overview As you count lot-tracked items within a physical inventory in this activity, you will                 scan the barcode of the physical inventory document; you will then scan the location                 barcode, the barcode of each item you find in this location, and the barcodes of the                 lot numbers that correspond to each item. When you have counted all items in all                 locations added to the physical inventory document, you will confirm the                 document. In any working mode, you enter a command or barcode             by typing it in the  Scan  box and pressing Enter. In production             systems, you will scan the appropriate barcodes rather than manually entering             them. System Preparation Before you start performing the activity,                  launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the  U100  dataset preloaded. To sign                 in as a warehouse worker, use the  perkins  login and the  123                  password. Step 1: Entering the Counted Quantities of Items Suppose that you have started counting coconuts. Do the following to enter the                 counted quantities into the system: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305020|IN305020]) Scan and Count (IN305020) form. In the  Scan  box, enter  000002                      (which is the reference number of the physical inventory count). The list of                     items that you should count is displayed on the  Count                      tab. Enter  F3S1 , which is the barcode of the first location.                          Suppose that in this location, you find two boxes of coconuts with                         different lot numbers. Enter  CNBOX , which is the barcode that corresponds to a                     box of 5 pounds of coconuts. Enter  FR100895  to specify the lot number of the coconuts.                     The system adds 5 units of the  COCONUTS  item to the corresponding table                     row. Enter  CNBOX  to add another box of coconuts with a                     different lot number. Enter  FR100751  to specify the lot number of the coconuts.                     The system adds 5 units of the  COCONUTS  item to the corresponding table                         row. You have finished counting items in the  F3S1  location and can                         start counting items in the next location. Enter  F3S2 , which is the barcode of the second                         location. Suppose that in this location, you find one box of                     coconuts. Enter  CNBOX  to add the box of coconuts. Enter  FR100598  to specify the lot number of the coconuts.                     The system adds 5 units of the  COCONUTS  item to the corresponding table                         row. You have finished counting items in the  F3S2  location and need                         to confirm the counted data. Step 2: Reviewing the Quantities and Confirming the Entered Data After you have entered the quantities of all items in the physical inventory                 document, you need to review the quantities and confirm the entered data. Do the                 following: While you are still viewing the  000002  physical inventory document on the                           ([~/?ScreenId=IN305020|IN305020]) Scan and Count (IN305020) form, review the lines of the                     table on the  Count  tab. They should have the settings                     indicated in the following table. Line Nbr.

==Workflow for the Automated Issuing of Lot- and Serial-Tracked Items==
The automated processing of issuing lot- or serial-tracked items involves the actions shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#_af4505cc-0092-4945-aa18-fc299cac7df5][anchor|#_83b1310b-cb76-44f1-9caa-bc61289fc57f][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_WMS_Scan_Issue_wSN_Lot.png|popup|380px]
To issue items by using a barcode scanner or a mobile device with a scanning option, you perform the following steps:[anchor|#ol_cw5_cd4_xgb]
#''Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_20|Scan and Issue] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302020|IN302020]) form''.
#:You open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_20|Scan and Issue] form (or the corresponding screen in the Acumatica mobile app).
#''Scan the location barcode''.
#:You scan the barcode of the warehouse location where the items to be issued are stored.
#Optional: ''Scan the warehouse barcode''.
#:If the location whose identifier you scanned in the previous step is assigned to multiple warehouses, you scan the warehouse barcode. The system inserts the warehouse ID in the '''Warehouse''' box.
#''Scan the item barcode''.
#:You scan the barcode of the item that must be issued from the selected location.
#Optional: ''Scan the lot or serial number of the item''.
#:The system may prompt you to enter the lot or serial number of the item, depending on the lot or serial class settings specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_70_00|Lot/Serial Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) form.
#:If the assignment method of the lot or serial class dictates that the lot or serial number be specified on receipt of the item and the issue method dictates that the lot or serial number must be entered by a user, the system prompts you to scan the lot or serial number.
#:If the assignment method of the lot or serial class dictates that the lot or serial number be specified on issue of the item, the system prompts you to scan the lot or serial number only if the number is not generated automatically and must be entered manually.
#Optional: ''Scan the item quantity''.
#:To change the issued quantity in the line that is currently being processed, you switch to Quantity Editing mode by scanning or entering the <tt>&#42;qty</tt> barcode or by clicking '''Set Qty''' on the form toolbar; you then manually enter the quantity in the base unit of measure.
#Optional: ''Scan the barcode of the next item to be issued from the selected location''
#:If another item must be issued from the currently selected location, you scan the barcode of the next item (return to Step 4) and repeat the process for this item.
#Optional: ''Scan the barcode of the next location''.
#:If items must be issued from another warehouse location, you scan the barcode of this location (return to Step 2) and repeat the process for this location.
#''Release the inventory issue''.
#:When you have finished issuing items, you scan the <tt>&#42;release&#42;issue</tt> command or click '''Release''' on the form toolbar. The system releases the inventory issue.

)))
==Story==
Suppose that you are a warehouse worker and your manager asks you to check the boxes of bananas in refrigerators in order to find rotten bananas and write them off. To record writing off boxes with rotten bananas in the system, you will create and process an inventory issue.
==Configuration Overview==
In the ''U100'' dataset, the following features have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, where they are in the ''Inventory and Order Management'' group of features:[anchor|#ul_wqn_zy2_3fb]
*''Multiple Warehouse Locations''
* ''Lot and Serial Tracking''
* ''Warehouse Management''
* ''Inventory Operations''

The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in the system:[anchor|#ul_ghb_r2d_pfb]
*A warehouse on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form: ''WHOLESALE''.
*The following warehouse locations on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] form: ''F2S2'' and ''F3S2''.
*A stock item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form: ''BANANAS''. For this stock item, the barcodes have been specified on the '''Cross-Reference''' tab of the form.

==Process Overview==
When you issue lot-tracked items in this activity, you will scan the barcode of the location where the items are stored; you then scan a barcode of each item to be issued and the barcodes of the lot numbers that correspond to each item. When you have added all items in all locations to the issue, you will release the issue.[anchor|#_cc856ba6-ff75-4190-8f1c-7236a1e8a05a]((({S:Warn}In any working mode, you enter a command or barcode by typing it in the '''Scan''' box and pressing Enter. In production systems, you will scan the appropriate barcodes rather than manually entering them.
)))
==System Preparation==
Before you start performing the activity, launch the Acumatica ERP website and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded. To sign in as a warehouse worker, use the ''perkins'' login and the ''123'' password.
==Step 1: Processing the Issue of Items==
Suppose that when you were checking the boxes with bananas in the refrigerator locations, as instructed by your manager, you have found four boxes with rotten bananas: two boxes with different lot numbers in the ''F2S2'' location, and two boxes with the same lot number in the ''F3S2'' location. Do the following to process the issue transaction in the system:[anchor|#_413e6468-bd51-440b-9ae6-03bd068f0e58]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_20|Scan and Issue] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302020|IN302020]) form.
#In the '''Scan''' box, enter <tt>F2S2</tt>, which is the barcode of the location where the first box of bananas is stored.
#In the '''Scan''' box, enter <tt>BNBOX</tt>, which is the barcode that corresponds to a box of 10 pounds of bananas.
#In the '''Scan''' box, enter <tt>FR200384</tt> to specify the lot number of the box. The system adds 1 unit of the ''BANANAS'' item in the ''BNBOX'' unit of measure to the table on the '''Issue''' tab.
#In the '''Scan''' box, enter <tt>BNBOX</tt> for the second box of bananas.
#In the '''Scan''' box, enter <tt>FR200401</tt> to specify the lot number of the box. The system adds 1 unit of the ''BANANAS'' item in the ''BNBOX'' unit of measure to the table on the '''Issue''' tab.
#In the '''Scan''' box, enter <tt>F3S2</tt>, which is the barcode of the location where the second box of bananas is stored.
#In the '''Scan''' box, enter <tt>BNBOX</tt> to add the box of bananas.
#In the '''Scan''' box, enter <tt>FR200335</tt> to specify the lot number of the box. The system adds 1 unit of the ''BANANAS'' item in the ''BNBOX'' unit of measure to the table on the '''Issue''' tab.
#Set the quantity to <tt>2</tt> as follows:
##On the form toolbar, click '''Set Qty'''. The system prompts you to enter the quantity.
##In the '''Scan''' box, enter <tt>2</tt>. The system changes the quantity of the ''BANANAS'' item with the ''FR200335'' lot number to ''2''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''. The system saves your changes and creates the inventory issue, whose identifier you can view in the '''Reference Nbr.''' box of the Summary area.

You have added four boxes of bananas to the issue. Now you will review the inventory issue and release the issue.
==Step 2: Releasing and Reviewing the Issue==
To release and review the issue, do the following:[anchor|#_fd36aaae-1f65-4e66-8050-dc8a3f21a6a2]
#While you are still viewing the inventory issue on the '''Issue''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_20|Scan and Issue] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302020|IN302020]) form, make sure that the settings of the rows you have entered correspond to the settings in the following table.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Automated Operations with Lot- and Serial-Tracked Items: To Issue Items In this activity, you will learn how to perform automated counting of lot-tracked                 items during a physical inventory. The following activity is based on the                  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system settings             have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the activity             and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100  dataset             to its initial state. Story Suppose that you are a warehouse worker and your manager asks you to check the boxes                 of bananas in refrigerators in order to find rotten bananas and write them off. To                 record writing off boxes with rotten bananas in the system, you will create                  and process                  an inventory issue. Configuration Overview In the  U100  dataset, the following features have been enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, where they are in the                      Inventory and Order Management  group of features: Multiple Warehouse Locations Lot and Serial Tracking Warehouse Management Inventory Operations The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in                 the system: A warehouse on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses (IN204000) form:                          WHOLESALE . The following warehouse locations on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses form:  F2S2  and                      F3S2 . A stock item on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500)                     form:  BANANAS . For this stock item, the barcodes have been specified on                     the  Cross-Reference  tab of the form. Process Overview When you issue lot-tracked items in this activity, you will scan the barcode of the                 location where the items are stored; you then scan a barcode of each item to be                 issued and the barcodes of the lot numbers that correspond to each item. When you                 have added all items in all locations to the issue, you will release the issue. In any working mode, you enter a command or barcode             by typing it in the  Scan  box and pressing Enter. In production             systems, you will scan the appropriate barcodes rather than manually entering             them. System Preparation Before you start performing the activity,                  launch the  Acumatica ERP website and sign in to a company with the  U100  dataset preloaded. To sign                 in as a warehouse worker, use the  perkins  login and the  123                  password. Step 1: Processing the Issue of Items Suppose that when you were checking the boxes with bananas in the refrigerator                 locations, as instructed by your manager, you have found four boxes with rotten                 bananas: two boxes with different lot numbers in the  F2S2  location, and two                 boxes with the same lot number in the  F3S2  location. Do the following to                 process the issue transaction in the system: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302020|IN302020]) Scan and Issue (IN302020) form. In the  Scan  box, enter  F2S2 , which                     is the barcode of the location where the first box of bananas is stored. In the  Scan  box, enter  BNBOX ,                     which is the barcode that corresponds to a box of 10 pounds of bananas. In the  Scan  box, enter  FR200384  to                     specify the lot number of the box. The system adds 1 unit of the  BANANAS                      item in the  BNBOX  unit of measure to the table on the                          Issue  tab. In the  Scan  box, enter  BNBOX  for                     the second box of bananas. In the  Scan  box, enter  FR200401  to                     specify the lot number of the box.

Set the quantity to  2  as follows: On the form toolbar, click  Set Qty . The system                             prompts you to enter the quantity. In the  Scan  box, enter  2 .                             The system changes the quantity of the  BANANAS  item with the                                  FR200335  lot number to  2 . On the form toolbar, click  Save . The system saves your                     changes and creates the inventory issue, whose identifier you can view in the                          Reference Nbr.  box of the Summary area. You have added four boxes of bananas to the issue. Now you will review the inventory                 issue and release the issue. Step 2: Releasing                  and Reviewing                  the Issue To release  and                 review  the issue, do the following: While you are still viewing the inventory issue on the                          Issue  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302020|IN302020]) Scan and Issue                     (IN302020) form, make sure that the settings of the rows you have entered                     correspond to the settings in the following table.

==Workflow for the Automated Receiving of Lot- and Serial-Tracked Items==
The automated processing of receiving lot- or serial-tracked items involves the actions shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#_7cb669da-e34c-483f-9f66-3044fa75a586][anchor|#_e129766d-e18a-4f60-90e3-f6a55466ef48][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_WMS_Scan_Receive_wSN_Lot.png|popup|380px]
To receive items by using a barcode scanner or a mobile device with a scanning option, you perform the following steps:[anchor|#ol_cz1_5pn_xgb]
#''Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_20|Scan and Receive] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301020|IN301020]) form''.
#:You open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_20|Scan and Receive] form (or the corresponding screen in the Acumatica mobile app).
#''Scan the location barcode''.
#:You scan the barcode of the warehouse location, where the items are to be received.
#Optional: ''Scan the warehouse barcode''.
#:If the location whose identifier you scanned in the previous step is assigned to multiple warehouses, you scan the warehouse barcode. The system inserts the warehouse ID in the '''Warehouse''' box.
#''Scan the item barcode''.
#:You scan the barcode of the item being received.
#Optional: ''Scan the lot or serial number of the item''.
#:If the lot or serial class with the ''When Received'' assignment method specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_70_00|Lot/Serial Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) form is assigned to the item, the system prompts you to enter the lot or serial number of the item only if the number is not generated automatically and must be entered manually.
#Optional: ''Scan the expiration date of the item''.
#:If, on the previous step, you have entered the lot class with the ''When Received'' assignment method and the ''Expiration'' issue method specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_70_00|Lot/Serial Classes] form, the system prompts you to enter the expiration date of the item.
#Optional: ''Scan the item quantity''.
#:To change the received quantity in the line that is currently being processed, you switch to Quantity Editing mode by scanning or entering the <tt>&#42;qty</tt> barcode or by clicking '''Set Qty''' on the form toolbar; you then manually enter the quantity in the UOM coded in the scanned item barcode.
#Optional: ''Scan the barcode of the next item to be received''.
#:If more items need to be received in the currently selected location, you scan the barcode of the next item barcode (that is, return to Step 4), and repeat the process for the item.
#Optional: ''Scan the barcode of the next location''.
#:If items must be received in another warehouse location, you scan the barcode of this location (that is, return to Step 2) and repeat the process for this location.
#''Release the inventory receipt''.
#:When you have finished receiving items, you scan the <tt>&#42;release&#42;receipt</tt> command or click '''Release''' on the form toolbar. The system releases the inventory receipt.

This topic describes the workflow for the automated receiving of lot- or serial-tracked         items. The workflow in this topic is based on the assumption that your system has the         recommended configuration described in  Automated Operations with Lot- and Serial-Tracked Items: Implementation Checklist. Workflow for the Automated Receiving of Lot- and Serial-Tracked Items The automated processing of receiving lot- or serial-tracked items involves the actions         shown in the following diagram. To receive items by using a barcode scanner or a mobile device with a scanning option, you         perform the following steps: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN301020|IN301020]) Scan and Receive (IN301020) form . You open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN301020|IN301020]) Scan and Receive form (or the corresponding screen in the  Acumatica  mobile app). Scan the location barcode . You scan the barcode of the warehouse location,             where the items are to be received. Optional:  Scan the warehouse barcode .

If the ''Cart Tracking'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can configure cart entities, which represent the physical carts used for moving inventory items within a warehouse, and track item movements between warehouse locations.{br}{TOC}
==Configuring Carts==
When the ''Cart Tracking'' feature is enabled, you can configure carts on the '''Carts''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form. For a warehouse, you can create any number of carts. For each cart, you specify the ID and a short description, and you select the '''Active''' check box to indicate that the cart can be used for moving items.
==Viewing Items in Carts==
When you use carts in automated warehouse operations, you can quickly view the list of items in a particular cart by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_90_20|Storage Lookup] ([~/?ScreenId=IN409020|IN409020]) form or the corresponding screen in the Acumatica mobile app. You scan the barcode of a cart in a particular warehouse, and the system displays the list of items in the cart and their quantities.
==Tracking Carts in Picking Operations==
If the '''Use Carts for Picking''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form, the specification of a cart is a required step of the workflow of picking items. This configuration is used to track item movements when a warehouse worker first places the items in a cart, and then picks them from the cart and packs them for shipping. Thus, a cart represents a temporary location from which the items are picked for processing.{br}

When you are using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) form or the corresponding screen in the Acumatica mobile app, before scanning a shipment number in Pick mode, you scan the barcode of the cart that you are going to use for picking items. The system shows the ID of the currently selected cart in the '''Cart ID''' box. Then you scan the location barcode and the item barcode and specify the quantity of items that you are placing in the cart; the system shows this quantity in the '''Cart Qty.''' column for each line, thus indicating the items that have been placed in the currently selected cart. To indicate the picking of items from the cart, you use the <tt>&#42;cart&#42;out</tt> command to enter Cart Unloading mode, and you scan the item barcode and quantity; the system reduces the '''Cart Qty.''' and adds this quantity to the '''Picked Quantity'''. After the items are picked from the cart, you pack and ship the items, or you confirm the shipment without packing, depending on the workflow set up in your company. For more information about picking and packing workflows, see [HelpRoot_WMS\WMS_CartTracking|Cart Tracking in Warehouse Operations].
==Tracking Carts in Wave Picking Operations==
If the ''Advanced Picking'' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can assign totes to carts on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form. With this configuration, when a picker starts to pick a wave, instead of scanning totes one by one, the picker can scan the barcode of a cart. In this case, the system will automatically assign the totes of this cart to the shipments being picked.
==Tracking Carts in Putting Away Operations==
If the '''Use Carts for Putting Away''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form, the specification of a cart is a required step of the workflow of putting away items. This configuration is used to track item movements when a warehouse worker first places items in the cart from the receiving location, and then puts them away (moves them from the cart to the place of storage). Thus, a cart represents a temporary location from which the items are taken for processing.{br}

When you are using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_20|Receive and Put Away] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302020|PO302020]) form, before scanning a receipt number in Put Away mode, you scan the barcode of the cart that you are going to use for putting away items. The system shows the ID of the currently selected cart in the '''Cart ID''' box. Then you scan the item barcode and specify the quantity of items that you are placing in the cart; the system shows this quantity in the '''Cart Qty.''' column for each line, thus indicating items that have been placed in the currently selected cart. To indicate the putting away of each item from the cart, you use the <tt>&#42;cart&#42;out</tt> command to enter Cart Unloading mode, and scan the item barcode, the location barcode, and the quantity; the system reduces the '''Cart Qty.''' to indicate the quantity of the item being put away. After all the items for the current document are put away from the cart, you release the transfer document, and the processing is completed. For more information about the workflows associated with receiving items and putting them away, see [HelpRoot_WMS\WMS_Receive_Put_Away_Mapref|Automated Receiving and Putting Away Operations].

The system shows the ID of the currently         selected cart in the  Cart ID  box. Then you scan the location barcode         and the item barcode and specify the quantity of items that you are placing in the cart; the         system shows this quantity in the  Cart Qty.  column for each line,         thus indicating the items that have been placed in the currently selected cart. To indicate         the picking of items from the cart, you use the  *cart*out  command to         enter Cart Unloading mode, and you scan the item barcode and quantity; the system reduces         the  Cart Qty.  and adds this quantity to the  Picked           Quantity . After the items are picked from the cart, you pack and ship the         items, or you confirm the shipment without packing, depending on the workflow set up in your         company.

When you are using the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302020|PO302020]) Receive and Put Away (PO302020) form, before scanning a         receipt number in Put Away mode, you scan the barcode of the cart that you are going to use         for putting away items. The system shows the ID of the currently selected cart in the            Cart ID  box. Then you scan the item barcode and specify the         quantity of items that you are placing in the cart; the system shows this quantity in the            Cart Qty.  column for each line, thus indicating items that have         been placed in the currently selected cart.
