In Acumatica ERP, you can configure the structure of your organization as consisting of a single branch or multiple branches with different reporting settings to suit complex reporting requirements and data consolidation needs. {br}

Also, by using the Organization Structure module, your organization can automate work assignments and document assignment for approvals. {br}{TOC}
==Multibranch Functionality==
In Acumatica ERP, you can configure the system as a single entity or as a multibranch organization to match the actual organization&rsquo;s structure. All branches of the organization use the same currency and chart of accounts, and have shared lists of trade partners. You can configure automatic balancing of inter-branch transactions. If the branches operate separately, you can set up user access to specific branches only. For additional information, see the following topics: [anchor|#ul_ufn_2t5_q3]

*[HelpRoot_Organization\CS__con_Basic_Models_for_Multi-Branch_Organization|Basic Models for Multibranch Organization]
*[HelpRoot_Organization\CS__con_Branch_Security_Administration|Security of Organization Branches]

==Organizational Chart and Assignment Automation==
You can build a company tree, which is a model of your organization&rsquo;s hierarchy that includes branches and departments, as well as temporary or permanent workgroups. The company tree may reflect the administrative hierarchy and include sub-hierarchies of workgroups created within specific branches or departments. The company tree is used for creating assignment rules in approval and assignment maps and for determining the scope of the users who want to view items assigned to them. You can use assignment maps to automatically distribute the work items (such as leads, contacts, opportunities, or cases) to be processed or you can use approval maps to distribute the documents (such as time cards, expense receipts, or orders) to be approved among the workgroups, based on relevant item or document properties. For more information, see the following articles: [anchor|#ul_wdr_qgv_q3]
*[HelpRoot_Organization\EP__con_Company_Organizational_Chart|Company Tree and Workgroups]
*[HelpRoot_Organization\EP__con_Assignment_Automation|Managing Assignment and Approval Maps]

==Other Features and Options==
 Acumatica ERP provides unmatched flexibility for each organization to implement its unique business processes by using the Organization Structure functionality. In addition to the features described above, the Organization Structure functionality offers the following features and options: [anchor|#ul_kgn_2t5_q3]
*You can use departments, employee positions, and information about to whom each employee reports to build any hierarchy to be used in assignment and approval maps.
*Buildings can be assigned to branches and depreciated accordingly in the respective branches.
*Multiple work calendars may be used in the organization to correctly estimate work time and overtime in different branches and on different projects, as described in [HelpRoot_Organization\EP__con_Multiple_Calendar_Support|Support of Multiple Work Calendars].

In Acumatica ERP, a user can create new companies or maintain existing companies by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) form.
==Company Type==
Each company has one of the following types, which is specified in the '''Company Type''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) form:[anchor|#ul_aps_rqs_ncb]
*''Without Branches'': A company with this type cannot have any branches. If the ''Multi-Branch Support'' feature is not enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, this option is selected by default and cannot be changed.
*''With Branches Not Requiring Balancing'': A company with this type must have at least one branch. If multiple branches of the company are involved in a transaction, balancing entries are not required. This option is available if the ''Multi-Branch Support'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form.
*''With Branches Requiring Balancing'': A company with this type must have at least one branch. If multiple branches of the company are involved in a transaction, balancing entries are required. This option is available if the ''Multi-Branch Support'' and ''Inter-Branch Transactions'' features are enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form. 

For details about how Acumatica ERP supports multiple branches for a company, see [HelpRoot_Organization\CS__con_Multiple_Branch_Support|Multiple Branch Support].{br}

After a company has been configured, the company type still can be changed as follows.[anchor|#table_wfc_gph_ycb]

|}
==Company Maintenance==
For a company that has the ''With Branches Not Requiring Balancing'' or ''With Branches Requiring Balancing'' type, the '''Branches''' tab becomes available on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) form. On this tab, a system administrator can add new branches to the company or delete branches from the list of company branches; when the company has no branches, it can be also deleted.{br}

A company with the ''Without Branches'' type can be deleted if it has no GL history (that is, if no GL transactions are associated with the company) and if no cash accounts, employees, warehouses, and fixed assets are linked to the company.{br}

If a user clears the '''Active''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] form for a company that has branches, all the company branches will be deactivated. However, a branch cannot be deactivated if it is linked to an active warehouse, to an employee with a status other than ''Inactive'', or to a fixed asset with a status other than ''Disposed'' or ''Reversed'', and a company with such a branch also cannot be deactivated.
==Configuration of Access to Company Data==
Access to the data related to a specific branch or to all branches of a company is regulated by an access role.{br}

When an access role is specified for a company in the '''Access Role''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) form, the system prompts whether the access role should be copied to the settings of all branches of the company. When the '''Access Role''' box is cleared for the company, the system prompts whether the access role should be removed from the settings of all branches of the company. If no access role is specified for the company, an individual access role can be specified for each branch of the company on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_20_00|Branches] ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) from.{br}

A user that has access to at least one of the company branches can select the company in corresponding boxes on data entry forms.{br}

For more information about ways to manage the security of a branch, see [HelpRoot_Organization\CS__con_Branch_Security_Administration|Security of Organization Branches].
==Ledgers==
A company can post transactions to various ledgers, but it can be associated with only one actual ledger.{br}

A user can manage ledgers associated with a company in any of the following ways:[anchor|#ul_chn_th3_ycb]
*Create for a new company a ledger of the ''Actual'' type by clicking '''Create Ledger''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) form
*Review the list of the ledgers associated with the company, add an existing ledger to the list, or remove a ledger from the list by using the '''Ledgers''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] form
*Review the list of all ledgers associated with the company of the selected branch by using the '''Ledgers''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_20_00|Branches] ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) form
*Maintain the list of the companies that are allowed to post to non-actual ledgers by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_20_15_00|Ledgers] ([~/?ScreenId=GL201500|GL201500]) form

An actual ledger can be detached from a company if the ledger contains no transactions associated with any branch of the company.{br}

For more information about ledgers, see the [HelpRoot_Financials\GL__MNG_Managing_Ledgers|Managing Ledgers] chapter.
==Tax Reports==
For a company with the ''With Branches Requiring Balancing'' type, the '''File Taxes by Branches''' check box is available on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) form. If the check box is cleared, each tax report includes data related to all branches of the company. If the check box is selected, each branch of the company requires an individual report.{br}

For a company with any other type, tax reports always include company-wide data.
==Logos==
On the '''Logo''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_20_00|Branches] ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) form, a user can specify separate images for the logo displayed in the top left corner of Acumatica ERP and for the logo displayed on reports for the selected company or branch.]]></column>

Sooner or later, small and medium-sized businesses may face the challenges presented by growth. The organization can grow by adding new locations that become branches with some degree of autonomy. {br}

Because most Acumatica ERP customers are small and mid-sized businesses, the multibranch functionality has been developed for organizations that meet certain requirements: 
*All branches use the same base currency.
*The chart of accounts is shared among branches, or similar charts of accounts used by different branches can be merged into one chart of accounts used by all branches.
*The branches have the same financial year and periods.

Larger organizations with base currencies different in different branches, fiscal years, and periods can configure their subsidiaries as separate organizations with individual company IDs and use the consolidation functionality to be able to report as a single company. For details, see [HelpRoot_Financials\GL__con_GL_Consolidations|General Ledger Consolidation Process]. {br}{TOC}
==Organization as a Structure of Branches==
 Acumatica ERP supports multibranch functionality and provides several basic models for implementing most typical organization structures. For details, see [HelpRoot_Organization\CS__con_Basic_Models_for_Multi-Branch_Organization|Basic Models for Multibranch Organization]. {br}

In Acumatica ERP, an organization has a company account with a company ID. Within a company account, at least one branch is needed to represent the organization itself. If the organization includes more than one branch, organization branches are created within the same company ID. The identifiers for branches (Branch IDs) are based on the ''BIZACCT'' segmented key—that is, they have the same segments as identifiers for organization&rsquo;s customers and vendors. 
==User Access to Branch Data==
Since the branches are created within the same organization, they have some shared data and some branch-specific data. {br}

Each employee (user) is assigned to a specific branch. To restrict user access to branch-specific data, you can configure a branch access role for each branch. Then the branch employees will be able to access the shared data (as their roles allow) and the data specific to their branch. To employees who should have access to other branches too, you must assign the access roles for the branches in the user&rsquo;s scope. For details, see [HelpRoot_Organization\CS__con_Branch_Security_Administration|Security of Organization Branches]. If a user has access to several branches, the user will be able to choose the branch he or she needs by selecting it from the form toolbar on each data entry form.
==Data Shared Between Branches==
Some of the data is unconditionally shared and available in all branches for all users who have access to this data by their roles. {br}

In addition to the financial year and periods, the organization&rsquo;s branches share the following information: 
*The chart of accounts.
*Subaccounts.
*Budget tree, for details, see [HelpRoot_Financials\config_Budget_Tree_Mapref|Configuring a Budget Tree].
*Taxes, tax categories, and tax zones.
*Credit terms and overdue charges.
*Statement cycles.
*Customer and vendor classes.
*Customers and vendors. You can specify for some customer and vendor locations a default branch with which they have operations, and this location will be unavailable for selection from other branches.
*Stock and non-stock items. If you need to view inventory by branch, configure the ''INVENTORY'' segmented key appropriately, with a segment designating a branch to which the item belongs, but all items will be visible in the list of available items.
*Lot and serial classes.
*Units of measure and conversion rules.
*Posting classes for inventory.

Company tree and assignment maps should include workgroups that belong to all branches. Approval routes may pass across the entire organization.((({S:Hint}
You can use the functionality of restriction groups to assign specific accounts and subaccounts to a particular branch. For details, see [HelpRoot_Organization\CS__con_Branch_Security_Administration|Security of Organization Branches].
)))
==Branch-Specific Data==
The following entities are assigned to only one of the branches: 
*Cash accounts (each of which is denominated in a specific currency)
*Warehouses
*Employees
*Buildings (a sort of fixed asset)

Do not create a subaccount segment for branches; transactions are marked by the originating branch in other ways. Bills and invoices as well as other documents are associated with the particular branch in which they were created. To make them easily identifiable by branch, you can create branch-specific subsequences for all numbering sequences involved by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_10_10|Numbering Sequences] ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) form, so that a document originating in a specific branch will have a reference number clearly associated with the branch of origin. {br}

If a user has a branch access role that provides access to only one of the branches, the user will be able to view only the documents related to the respective branch. 
==Data Consolidation==
The multibranch functionality, as it is implemented in Acumatica ERP, enables complex organizations to view the consolidated data from multiple branches without having to perform any additional operations and in real time. It is easy to configure consolidated replenishment or centralized payment of bill or view consolidated data on reports running them from the headquarters branch. {br}

When a user opens a report or inquiry, the system checks the user&rsquo;s access rights to branches. If a user has access to all branches, this user can view the data of any selected branch or the consolidated data by leaving the '''Branch''' box blank. If a user has access to only one branch, this user will be able to view only the data related to the particular branch even if he or she runs the report that should show the consolidated data. {br}

Replenishment is performed on a branch basis, although you can implement the following scenario: The headquarters has a large warehouse for which you configure automatic replenishment. Warehouses assigned to other branches are replenished through transfers from the headquarters&rsquo; warehouse. Thus, your organization will be able to save on volume discounts. {br}

In your system, bills can be paid by a headquarters branch on behalf of other branches. To do this, assign to authorized personnel the roles that provide access to branches. Then the employees who pay the bills will be able to view the bills from all branches on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_20_00|Checks and Payments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP302000|AP302000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_50_30_00|Prepare Payments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP503000|AP503000]) forms. The cash accounts from which payments are made should be assigned to the headquarters branch.

The chart of accounts is shared among branches, or similar charts of accounts 					used by different branches can be merged into one chart of accounts used by all 					branches. The branches have the same financial year and periods.

In today’s global environment, an organization may have a hierarchic structure of subsidiaries or branches and complex multilevel reporting requirements. Such an organization may need tools for easy data consolidation, as well as better visibility into various layers of financial operations within the organization. {br}

 Acumatica ERP supports multibranch functionality and provides multiple basic one-level and two-level models, outlined in the sections below, for implementing the most typical organizational structures. For more complex organizations, such models may be combined to implement any structure. ((({S:Hint}
Choosing the model (or combination of models) that suits your organization best is an important decision that must be made before you start implementing Acumatica ERP. 
))){br}{TOC}
==Model 1: Organization with Centralized Accounting==
 With Model 1, shown in the illustration below, the organization, which is a single legal entity, consists of two branches (or locations), each branch representing a company office. Transactions are posted to these branches.[anchor|#image_gr4_cjx_ph][image:UserGuide/Images/Basic_Models_for_Multi-Branch_Organization_odel1.png|popup|200px]
To implement this model in Acumatica ERP, you have to create an additional branch that will represent the legal entity. You also have to have one posting ledger of the ''Actual'' type.{br}

You need to specify the additional branch as the consolidating branch for the posting ledger by using the '''Consolidation Branch''' column on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_20_15_00|Ledgers] ([~/?ScreenId=GL201500|GL201500]) form. The consolidating branch is used only in Form 1099-MISC and tax reports to represent the legal entity. No transactions are posted to the consolidating branch.{br}

To be able to use automatic generation of inter-branch balancing entries for documents that involve multiple branches, you need to enable the ''Inter-Branch Transactions'' feature on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, configure the posting ledger by selecting the check box in the '''Branch Accounting''' column for this ledger on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_20_15_00|Ledgers] ([~/?ScreenId=GL201500|GL201500]) form, and define the inter-branch account mapping by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_10_10_10|Inter-Branch Account Mapping] ([~/?ScreenId=GL101010|GL101010]) form.{br}

If the '''Branch Accounting''' check box is cleared for the ledger, you still can make transactions between the branches (for example, transfer fixed assets from one branch to another), but the system does not create inter-branch balancing entries. The resulting batch remains unbalanced in each of the smaller branches, but the batch is balanced in the ledger that is assigned to the consolidating branch. In this case, the branches are not independent, and separate balance sheet reports cannot be prepared.
==Model 2: Autonomous Branches==
 In Model 2, illustrated below, the organization has a number of branches with a certain level of autonomy, with each branch being a legal entity. The organization and its branches share most of the vendors and customers but keep some of the trade partners as associated with a specific branch. Each branch keeps records of its own and has an accountant or accounting staff. The profitability of each branch can be equally important. [anchor|#image_ys4_2kx_ph][image:UserGuide/Images/Basic_Models_for_Multi-Branch_Organization_odel2.png|popup|200px]
In Acumatica ERP, autonomous branches may use separate ledgers to post their transactions or they may post their transactions to a single ledger with no branch selected as a consolidation branch. If the branches post their transactions to separate ledgers, the system will generate inter-branch transactions automatically. If the branches use the same ledger, to balance the original inter-branch transactions in each branch, you should select for this ledger a check box in the '''Branch Accounting''' column on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_20_15_00|Ledgers] ([~/?ScreenId=GL201500|GL201500]) form. This allows each branch to file reports as a separate legal entity. {br}

A certain level of independence requires that some of branches have their own General Ledger accounts that cannot be used by another branch. You can use restriction groups to assign selected General Ledger accounts and subaccounts to a specific branch for use by this branch only. 
==Model 3: Autonomous Multilocation Branches==
 An organization might include a number of related legal entities with complex structures. Each legal entity has its headquarters and locations or smaller branches that are not separate legal entities. In this case, each autonomous multilocation entity keeps its own records and performs all accounting procedures. {br}

In Acumatica ERP, such an organization can be configured as a Model 3, which combines Model 1 and Model 2, functioning within one Company ID. (See the following illustration.) Each autonomous branch has its headquarters and locations (or smaller branches that are not separate legal entities) configured as branches. Each autonomous multilocation branch records its operations to a separate ledger with a ''headquarters'' branch specified as the ''consolidation branch'' for the ledger. [anchor|#image_kvj_4kx_ph][image:UserGuide/Images/Basic_Models_for_Multi-Branch_Organization_odel3.png|popup|400px]
Generally, when transactions occur between any two non-independent branches in one ledger, no inter-branch transactions are generated; however, if they are needed for any reason, you can select a check box in the '''Branch Accounting''' column on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_20_15_00|Ledgers] form for the ledger. {br}

When the inter-branch transactions occur between any branches with different posting ledgers, balancing inter-branch transactions will be generated automatically. You should create inter-branch receivable and payable accounts in each ledger and specify the rules to be used by the system for generating balancing transactions by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_10_10_10|Inter-Branch Account Mapping] ([~/?ScreenId=GL101010|GL101010]) form.
==Model 4: Multinational or Just Multicurrency Organization==
 Small and midsize businesses sooner or later may face the problem of growth. They can grow by mergers or by creating local subsidiaries or branches in new regions or countries. Due to their locations, the organization subsidiaries use different base (functional) currency and should meet different reporting requirements (including non-matching financial years); their customers and vendors are not shared. For historical reasons, the organization subsidiaries may have different structures of accounts and subaccounts. {br}

In Acumatica ERP, such subsidiaries can have separate tenant accounts with different Company IDs. The simplest structure is shown by Model 4, illustrated below. Although technically the parent organization and its subsidiaries may keep their data in the same database, they may have different base currencies, different financial year settings, and separate lists of trade partners. Such subsidiaries even can be hosted on different websites. [anchor|#image_wgt_xkx_ph][image:UserGuide/Images/Basic_Models_for_Multi-Branch_Organization_odel4.png|popup|200px]
 Acumatica ERP provides the consolidation-related functionality to be used by both sides: the parent organization and its subsidiaries. If different base currencies are used by the parent company and its subsidiary, such subsidiaries can translate their balances before they prepare the consolidation data for exporting. For details, see [HelpRoot_Financials\GL__con_GL_Consolidations|General Ledger Consolidation Process] and [HelpRoot_Financials\Multicurrency_TranslatingFinStatements_GeneralInfo|Translating Financial Statements: General Information]. {br}

If inter-branch transactions take place, they should be eliminated manually during period-end or year-end routine procedures.

The most common scenarios of managing the security of company branches are the following:[anchor|#_4021d953-84c1-4fc1-b27b-162d93e0f67d]
*Managing user access to branches: If your organization has multiple branches (and you have created multiple branches in Acumatica ERP), you can configure access to branches for employees who work in these branches. For details, see [[#_7a02454f-c63a-413d-8cf3-93d772adb500|User Access to Branches].
*Managing the visibility of data shared between branches: If you need to make data shared between branches (such as General Ledger accounts and subaccounts) visible only within a particluar branch, you can use restriction groups to resolve this task. For more information, see [[#_176ab439-4f8d-4f0c-86a9-81503ddba296|Visibility of Data Within a Branch].
((({S:Warn}You can create and maintain multiple branches in your Acumatica ERP instance only if the ''Multi-Branch Support'' feature is enabled in your system on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form (for details, see [HelpRoot_Organization\CS__con_Multiple_Branch_Support|Multiple Branch Support]).
)))[anchor|#_7a02454f-c63a-413d-8cf3-93d772adb500]
==User Access to Branches==
After multiple branches have been defined in the system, you provide access to the branches for users who will work in the system as follows:[anchor|#_02c6375c-5fd5-4929-bf96-36488ed9ae20]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_05|User Roles] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201005|SM201005]) form, you create branch-specific user roles (one role per branch) and assign these roles to user accounts. For details on user roles, see [HelpRoot_Administration\User_Roles_GeneralInfo|User Roles: General Information].
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_20_00|Branches] ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) form, you assign the roles to branches as follows: For each branch, in the '''Access Role''' box, you select the user role created for this branch.
((({S:Hint}[anchor|#_6f1b0768-d2af-4162-9a12-2adc636055ea]
*Once a role is assigned to one of the branches, other branches also must have roles assigned. A branch with no role assigned will be inaccessible to any user.
*To allow a user to access multiple branches, assign to him or her the roles for the branches to which the user should have access.
)))
If a user, based on his or her role, has access to a data entry form where this user enters a document and specifies the branch of origin, only the branches to which the user has access are available on the drop-down list. The users who have access to multiple branches can select the specific branch from the '''Branches''' menu on the form&rsquo;s title toolbar and create documents on behalf of the selected branch.{br}

No matter which branch users have access to, users who have access to the following forms, based on their roles, will see and work with all branches (because users configure system objects by using these forms):[anchor|#_691aef22-4c78-41da-8db9-cf82e76bb3bd]

[anchor|#_176ab439-4f8d-4f0c-86a9-81503ddba296]
==Visibility of Data Within a Branch==
Branches have some data shared between branches and some data kept as branch-specific (for details, see [HelpRoot_Organization\CS__con_Multiple_Branch_Support|Multiple Branch Support]). You may need to restrict the visibility of data that is shared but may contain sensitive information, such as General Ledger accounts and subaccounts. Acumatica ERP provides restriction groups so you can control which accounts and subaccounts are used with which branch. For details on configuring restriction groups for accounts and subaccounts, see [HelpRoot_Financials\GL__con_Account_and_Subaccount_Security|Account and Subaccount Security].
==Forms for Branch Security==
In the following table, you can find the list of the forms that you can use to manage restriction groups with branches and the tasks that you can resolve by using each form.[anchor|#_ebec2c3f-1fa6-40d0-97c1-41a07187012b]

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Security of Organization Branches If your organization has multiple branches defined in  Acumatica ERP, you may need to control which employees get access to which branches.                     Because branches share some data, you may also need to control access to the                     shared data.  Acumatica ERP provides user access roles, which you can use to control users' access to                     branches, and restriction groups to limit the visibility of shared data. In this                     topic, you will read about ways to manage the security of a branch. In  Acumatica ERP,             you can configure groups with direct and inverse restriction. In this topic, for             simplicity, groups with direct restriction are used in examples. You can use inverse             restriction groups in the same way as you use direct restriction groups. For details on             the types of restriction groups, see  Types of Restriction Groups. Usage Scenarios The most common scenarios of managing the security of company branches are the                     following: Managing user access to branches: If your organization has multiple branches                         (and you have created multiple branches in  Acumatica ERP), you can configure access to branches for employees who work in these                         branches. For details, see  User Access to Branches User Access to Branches. Managing the visibility of data shared between branches: If you need to make                         data shared between branches (such as General Ledger accounts and                         subaccounts) visible only within a particluar branch, you can use                         restriction groups to resolve this task. For more information, see  Visibility of Data Within a Branch Visibility of Data Within a Branch. You can create and maintain multiple branches in your  Acumatica ERP instance only if the  Multi-Branch Support  feature is enabled in your                     system on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form                     (for details, see  Multiple Branch Support). User Access to Branches After multiple branches have been defined in the system, you provide access to the branches for users who will work in the system as follows: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201005|SM201005]) User Roles (SM201005) form, you create                         branch-specific user roles (one role per branch) and assign these roles to                         user accounts. For details on user roles, see  User Roles: General Information. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) Branches (CS102000) form, you assign the roles to branches as follows: For each branch, in the  Access Role  box, you select the user role created for this branch. Once a role is assigned to one of the branches, other branches also must have roles assigned. A branch with no role assigned will be inaccessible to any user. To allow a user to access multiple branches, assign to him or her the roles for the branches to which the user should have access. If a user, based on his or her role, has access to a data entry form where this user enters a document and specifies the branch of origin, only the branches to which the user has access are available on the drop-down list. The users who have access to multiple branches can select the specific branch from the  Branches  menu on the form's title toolbar and create documents on behalf of the selected branch. No matter which branch users have access to, users who have access to the following forms, based on their roles, will see and work with all branches (because users configure system objects by using these forms):  ([~/?ScreenId=GL101010|GL101010]) Inter-Branch Account Mapping (GL101010)  ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) Branches (CS102000)  ([~/?ScreenId=CS205010|CS205010]) Buildings (CS205010)  ([~/?ScreenId=EP205000|EP205000]) Assignment and Approval Maps (EP205000)  ([~/?ScreenId=EP204060|EP204060]) Import Company Tree (EP204060)  ([~/?ScreenId=GL103020|GL103020]) Restriction Groups by Branch (GL103020)  ([~/?ScreenId=GL103040|GL103040]) GL Accounts by Branch Access (GL103040)  ([~/?ScreenId=GL103060|GL103060]) Subaccounts by Branch Access (GL103060) Visibility of Data Within a Branch Branches have some data shared between branches and some data kept as branch-specific (for details, see  Multiple Branch Support).

==Contact Information==
When you create an employee on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] form, a contact record associated with this employee is created automatically. The name, contact information, and address specified on the '''General Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] form always match those specified for the related contact on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) form. If you modify these settings for an employee (or a contact), the changes are immediately reflected for the related contact (or an employee).[anchor|#_5cb085b6-ef02-4194-9f71-1ebbc5fae4a4]
==User Account Information==
An employee may have an associated user account so that the employee can access Acumatica ERP. On the '''User Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] form, a system administrator can view and edit information about the user account, create a new user account if none exists, activate, enable, disable, or unlock the user account, assign roles to the existing user, and manage the user's password.{br}

==Employment Settings==
On the '''Employee Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] form, you can specify the following settings: [anchor|#_517ba48a-471b-49cb-9932-bd3f4efbd32e]
*The branch with which all transactions related to this employee will be associated
*The calendar that describes the work hours of the employee and the time zone the employee works from (see [HelpRoot_Organization\EP__con_Multiple_Calendar_Support|Support of Multiple Work Calendars] for information about how you can define and maintain multiple calendars in the system)
*The requirement for using time cards for the employee (for details about time cards and time reporting, see [HelpRoot_Organization\EP__con_Time_Sheet_Processing|Time Cards])
*The extent of validation of regular work hours for the employee. The requirements for the hourly rates of the employee are specified on the '''Employee Cost''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] form
*The non-stock item of the ''Labor'' type used as a source of expense accounts for transactions associated with projects or contracts. You can use the '''Labor Item Overrides''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] form to define the relationship between an earning type and a labor item, which is the source of expense accounts

On the '''Employment History''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] form, you can maintain information about the employee's history of employment in the company.[anchor|#_3618211d-8346-4d1c-9c4c-13ae0dbb94c9]
==Financial Settings==
On the '''Financial Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] form, you can specify the accounts involved in the recording of employee compensation and payments, the employee's tax zone, and the payment method to be used by default for compensation payments.[anchor|#_5c864a6a-6724-4fbe-b5cf-3f8f7b9a265a]
==Approval Settings==
An employee may be assigned as an approver to approve a document or as an owner to process a record. On the''' Assignment and Approval Maps''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] form, you can review the list of all assignment and approval maps in which the employee is involved.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) form, an employee can approve or reject the documents of various types that have the ''Pending Approval'' status. Only the following documents are visible to the currently signed-in employee on this form: [anchor|#ul_ivq_b2g_g3]
*Those assigned to the employee.
*Those assigned to other users included in the workgroup to which the employee belongs.
*Escalated documents assigned to users of workgroups that are at lower levels in the company tree but in the node of the employee&rsquo;s workgroup. See [HelpRoot_Organization\EP__con_Company_Organizational_Chart|Company Tree and Workgroups] for details about the company tree.

The [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] form is available only if the ''Approval Workflow'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. If the ''Approval Workflow'' feature is disabled, no approval of documents can be set up, with an exception of expense claims; in this case, the system assigns an expense claim for approval to the employee specified in the '''Reports to''' box on the '''General Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form for the employee who is claiming the expenses; if the '''Reports to''' box is empty, the claim requires no approval—it is assigned the ''Open'' status, and it can be released immediately after submission. (For more information about the approval of expense claims, see [HelpRoot_Organization\EP__con_Claim_Approval|Expense Claim Approval].){br}

The requirements for the      hourly rates of the employee are specified on the  Employee Cost  tab of      the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) Employees form The non-stock item of the  Labor  type used as a source of expense accounts for      transactions associated with projects or contracts. You can use the  Labor Item       Overrides  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) Employees form to define the      relationship between an earning type and a labor item, which is the source of expense      accounts On the  Employment History  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) Employees     form, you can maintain information about the employee's history of employment in the     company. Financial Settings On the  Financial Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) Employees     form, you can specify the accounts involved in the recording of employee compensation and     payments, the employee's tax zone, and the payment method to be used by default for compensation     payments. Approval Settings An employee may be assigned as an approver to approve a document or as an owner to process a     record. On the  Assignment and Approval Maps  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) Employees form, you can review the list of all assignment and approval maps in     which the employee is involved. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) Approvals (EP503010) form, an employee can approve or reject the     documents of various types that have the  Pending Approval  status. Only the following     documents are visible to the currently signed-in employee on this form:  Those assigned to the employee. Those assigned to other users included in the workgroup to which the employee belongs. Escalated documents assigned to users of workgroups that are at lower levels in the company      tree but in the node of the employee's workgroup. See  Company Tree and Workgroups for details about the company tree. The   ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) Approvals form is available only if the  Approval Workflow      feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. If the  Approval      Workflow  feature is disabled, no approval of documents can be set up, with an exception of     expense claims; in this case, the system assigns an expense claim for approval to the employee     specified in the  Reports to  box on the  General      Info  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) Employees (EP203000) form for the employee     who is claiming the expenses; if the  Reports to  box is empty, the claim     requires no approval—it is assigned the  Open  status, and it can be released     immediately after submission. (For more information about the approval of expense claims, see       Expense Claim Approval.) For details about assignment and approval maps, see  Managing Assignment and Approval Maps.

In Acumatica ERP, you can build a company tree, which is a model of your organization&rsquo;s hierarchy that includes temporary and permanent workgroups. The company tree may reflect the administrative hierarchy and include sub-hierarchies of workgroups created within specific branches or departments. The company tree is used for creating assignment rules in approval and assignment maps and for determining the scope of the users who want to view items assigned to them.{br}{TOC}
==Company Tree==
You create a company tree by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_40_61|Company Tree] ([~/?ScreenId=EP204061|EP204061]) form. The company tree serves various purposes in addition to reflecting the administrative structure of your company. The tree doesn't directly include branches, departments, and administrative units within departments, but the tree should include all workgroups that participate in company workflows—for instance, the processing of leads and cases, the resolution of overdue cases, and the approval of various documents, such as time cards, expense claims, and purchase orders. {br}

If your company includes multiple branches, consider whether the workflows are completely contained within branches. If they are, for each company branch, create a separate tree branch that arranges the workgroups involved in this organization branch&rsquo;s workflows. If a workgroup of one of the branches participates in workflows of multiple branches, make sure this workgroup is located one level higher on the company tree than other workgroups. Also, make sure the members of this group have access to all the branches involved. 
==Workgroups and Owners==
A workgroup includes members who are employees of the company. Acumatica ERP places no restrictions on the number of group members or the number of groups an employee may belong to. A group may include employees with different positions and from different departments. {br}

An employee may be a member of more than one workgroup if he or she participates in multiple workflows. For example, an employee might approve purchase orders greater than $1000 and all expense claims. On the other hand, a workgroup may include members from different departments if they participate in the same stage of a specific workflow, such as processing cases. Workgroups participating in the same workflow should be organized in a separate branch on the tree. Your company&rsquo;s tree should have a separate branch for assigning each type of document that can be automatically assigned. {br}

One member of the group should be specified as the ''owner''—the user to whom, by default, a new record or document will be assigned once the record or document is assigned to this workgroup. For example, if processing a case involves multiple employees and requires performing research, fixing the product or situation, filling out documents, and performing other activities, the owner can be a team lead who is responsible for the group. If processing a case involves only one person, the workgroup may include only one employee, who will also be its default owner. {br}

Also, workgroups can be used for grouping employees by ''crew''. If the ''Time Reporting on Activity'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, activity time can be reported, approved, and released for an entire crew at a time on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_71_00|Weekly Crew Time Entry] ([~/?ScreenId=EP307100|EP307100]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_70_10|Approve Time Activities] ([~/?ScreenId=EP507010|EP507010]), and [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_70_20|Release Time Activities] ([~/?ScreenId=EP507020|EP507020]) forms, respectively. For more information about group entry of time activities, see [HelpRoot_Organization\Crew_Time_Reporting_GeneralInfo|Crew Time Reporting: General Information].
==Workgroups in Assignment and Approval Maps==
In Acumatica ERP, you can set up automatic assignment of the following entities to workgroups and to particular employees:[anchor|#ul_e3y_rhf_bv]
*Records for processing: leads, contacts, opportunities, business accounts, and cases 
*Documents for approval: expense claims, time cards, purchase orders, sales orders, and other documents 

This functionality uses assignment maps; it may also use the company tree that contains all workgroups involved in the assignment processes. You don&rsquo;t necessarily have to create a company tree or, if a company tree has been set up, you don&rsquo;t have to always use workgroups in assignment maps because you can specify particular employees as assignees; however, you can create more efficient assignment rules when using a company tree. For each type of document or record that should be automatically assigned, you create any number of assignment maps that define the rules for such assignment, and then, on the related module&rsquo;s preferences form, you specify which assignment map is to be used during the assignment process; for details, see [HelpRoot_Organization\EP__con_Assignment_Automation|Managing Assignment and Approval Maps].

In Acumatica ERP, you can define and maintain multiple work calendars in the system. Work calendars are used for a variety of purposes, including the following: 
*Labor calculations performed for contracts and projects
*Effective scheduling of events
*Tracking the movement of goods through carriers involved in shipping to and from your company

==Work Calendar Settings==
Work calendars can be defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_90_00|Work Calendar] ([~/?ScreenId=CS209000|CS209000]) form. For each employee calendar, you can define the week's work days and specify working hours for each day. On the '''Exceptions''' tab, you can define holidays, which preempt work days or shift them to a day when the employee generally does not work, and specify any change in working hours for a particular date. {br}

If the work calendar is used for a carrier rather than an employee, specify on which days goods are moved. 
==Employee Calendars==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form, you can associate calendars with particular employees, such as salespersons or members of customer service and support workgroups. If a calendar is to be used by others, the employee should mark his or her calendar as public by using the [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\SM_20_30_10|User Profile] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) form. {br}

An employee&rsquo;s calendar can also be used for labor calculation if the employee works in customer support or on projects. Work time and overtime are calculated automatically for time cards when the employee reports time spent on a case or a project task, if billable tasks and activities are used for the service contract or project. {br}

To organize work more efficiently, employees who work together should share information about their free and busy times. They can do this in the following ways: 
*In Acumatica ERP, users can export their work calendars, which show their free and busy time, and email the resulting file to involved persons.
*Users can export their calendar data from MS Outlook and import it to Acumatica ERP (in .cvs format). MS Outlook continues to periodically update the .cvs file when changes are made in Outlook. Currently, changes to the work calendar in Acumatica ERP do not update the calendar file exported to MS Outlook.

 Acumatica ERP gives you the capability to automatically assign records (such as leads and cases) to employees for processing, to appropriately distribute work. When assigning a record to an employee, the system follows the rules and conditions specified in a previously created assignment map.{br}

Also, if the ''Approval Workflow'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can use approval maps to assign documents (such as cash transactions, expense claims, time cards, and purchase orders) to authorized employees for approval.{br}{TOC}
==Supported Types of Maps==
 Acumatica ERP supports various types of maps that may include any number of steps, rules, and conditions for assigning a record to a qualified employee for processing or for assigning a document to an authorized employee for approval. Each map has a type, which can be one of the following:[anchor|#ul_glb_clf_4z]
*''Assignment Map'': Used for assigning business accounts, cases, contacts, email activities, leads, opportunities, purchase receipts, requests, or requisitions to owners for further processing.
*''Approval Map'': Used for assigning approvers to projects or documents, such as bills and adjustments, employee time cards, equipment time cards, expense claims, expense receipts, projects, purchase orders, requests, requisitions, sales orders, or transactions.
*''Assignment and Approval Map'': Used for either assigning entities to owners or assigning approvers to documents. Maps of this type were created in earlier versions of Acumatica ERP. This type remains supported by the system to avoid data loss.

By using the '''Add Approval Map''' or '''Add Assignment Map''' buttons on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_55_00|Assignment and Approval Maps] ([~/?ScreenId=EP205500|EP205500]) form, you can start creating an approval or assignment map, which opens on a separate entry form.
==Approval Maps==
You can create a new map of the ''Approval'' type or modify an existing one by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_50_15|Approval Maps] ([~/?ScreenId=EP205015|EP205015]) form.{br}

An approval map consists of steps and rules. In the '''Steps''' pane, you can create any number of steps, each of which may include any number of rules. Steps may be executed in a sequential, parallel, or sequential-parallel fashion.{br}

For each step, you need to select an action that should be performed if no approver has been assigned in accordance with the rules specified for this step, so the document becomes automatically approved or rejected or the next step (if any) gets executed. Also, you can specify whether a step is to be executed in any case or only if no approvers have been found at all previous steps.{br}

For each rule, you specify conditions, which the system checks for the document, and actions to be performed if the conditions are met. As a result, multiple approvers may be assigned to one document. You can configure a rule so that after one approver approves the document, the system waits until other appointed approvers (if any) also approve the document, executes the next step in the approval map, or marks the document as approved. Also, you can specify for each rule whether an approver would have to enter a comment each time he or she approves or rejects a document of the particular type.{br}

If a condition, step, or rule is no longer required in an approval map, you can temporarily deactivate it by clearing the '''Active''' check box in the settings of that condition, step, or rule on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_50_15|Approval Maps] form. A deactivated step or rule is marked with the '''(Inactive)''' prefix in the '''Steps''' pane.((({S:Warn}If you are creating rules for assigning documents for approval, documents that pass through the rules unassigned are considered in the system to be approved, so you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to create complete conditions. For example, in a small business, all documents with an amount greater than $1000 may need to be approved by the CEO. In this case, you would create rules to assign all documents with an amount that exceeds $1000 to a specific user (the CEO) for approval, while all other documents do not need to be assigned. The rules should be configured to assign only documents that have specific properties.
)))
On the '''Approval Details''' tab of a corresponding document entry form, all approvers assigned to the document are listed, and for each approver, additional information is displayed that helps track which approval map and which step and rule in this map is the reason this approver has been assigned.
==Assignment Maps==
Assignment maps are created and modified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_50_10|Assignment Maps] ([~/?ScreenId=EP205010|EP205010]) form.{br}

An assignment map may include any number of rules, which are executed sequentially. Similarly to a rule in an approval map, a rule in an assignment map includes conditions and actions to be performed if the conditions are met.{br}

If you use assignment maps to distribute a particular type of record or document—for instance, to assign cases to different owners who will handle them—be sure to create a complete set of conditions so that no record or document of the specific type is left unassigned.{br}

If a condition or rule is no longer required in an assignment map, you can temporarily deactivate it by clearing the '''Active''' check box in the settings of that condition or rule on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_50_10|Assignment Maps] form. A deactivated rule is marked with the '''(Inactive)''' prefix in the '''Rules''' pane.((({S:Warn}If conditions allow the same documents to be assigned to two or more groups, all assignments will be performed in the group that is positioned higher than the other groups in the assignment map, and the documents would never reach the other groups. 
)))
==Map Application==
In Acumatica ERP, you can specify an assignment or approval map for a particular type of record or document by using one of the following forms:[anchor|#ul_thj_p5c_2v]
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_10_10_00|Time and Expenses Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=EP101000|EP101000]) for expense claims, expense receipts, employee time cards, and equipment time cards
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_10_10_00|Customer Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CR101000|CR101000]) for leads, contacts, business accounts, opportunities, and cases
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) for sales orders of any type for which the '''Require Approval''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) for purchase orders of any type
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_10_10_00|Purchase Requisitions Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ101000|RQ101000]) for purchase requests and requisitions
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_10_10_00|Cash Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CA101000|CA101000]) for cash transactions
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_10_10_00|Accounts Payable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AP101000|AP101000]) for AP documents
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) for AR documents

Users can assign such records as leads, contacts, business accounts, opportunities, and cases in bulk by using the appropriate mass-processing form, such as [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_50_30_10|Assign Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR503010|CR503010]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_50_32_10|Assign Cases] ([~/?ScreenId=CR503210|CR503210]).
==Map Execution Issues==
Any issues that occur during the execution of an assignment or approval map are recorded in the Acumatica ERP trace log. You can open the trace log by clicking '''Help''' > '''Trace''' on the form title bar. 
==Document Approval==
The appointed approvers can approve documents by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) form; only users authorized to approve documents should have access rights to this form. For more details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\CO__con_Centralized_Approvals|Approving Documents].
==Approval Notifications==
In Acumatica ERP, you can set up approval notifications, by which an employee will receive an email notification each time a document requires approval from this employee.{br}

To enable approval notifications for a particular type of document, you need to specify an approval map for this type of document on the appropriate form, which can be one of the following:[anchor|#ul_bpf_nlq_cr]
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_10_10_00|Time and Expenses Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=EP101000|EP101000]) form, '''General Settings''' tab, for expense claims, expense receipts, and time cards
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form, '''Approval''' tab, for different types of sales orders
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form, '''Approval''' tab, for different types of purchase orders
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_10_10_00|Purchase Requisitions Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ101000|RQ101000]) form, '''Approval''' tab, for requests and requisitions
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_10_10_00|Cash Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CA101000|CA101000]) form, '''General Settings''' tab, for cash transactions
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_10_10_00|Accounts Payable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AP101000|AP101000]) form, '''Approval''' tab, for bills, credit and debit adjustments, checks, quick checks, prepayment requests, and prepayments
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) form, '''Approval''' tab, for AR invoices, debit memos, credit memos, cash returns, and customer refunds
{br}

After you specify the approval map, on the same form, you need to specify the notification template that will be used for email notifications. You can create new templates or edit existing ones by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_03|Notification Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=SM204003|SM204003]) form.{br}

For cash transactions, sales orders, purchase orders, requests, and requisitions, you also need to select the '''Require Approval''' check box on the preferences form of the respective module; otherwise, the approval stage will be skipped.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Managing Assignment and Approval Maps  Acumatica ERP gives you the capability to automatically assign records (such as leads and 				cases) to employees for processing, to appropriately distribute work. When assigning 				a record to an employee, the system follows the rules and conditions specified in a 				previously created assignment map. Also, if the  Approval Workflow  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, you can use approval maps to 				assign documents (such as cash transactions, expense claims, time cards, and 				purchase orders) to authorized employees for approval. Supported Types of Maps  Acumatica ERP supports various types of maps that may include any number of steps, rules, and 				conditions for assigning a record to a qualified employee for processing or for 				assigning a document to an authorized employee for approval. Each map has a type, 				which can be one of the following: Assignment Map : Used for assigning business accounts, cases, contacts, 					email activities, leads, opportunities, purchase receipts, requests, or 					requisitions to owners for further processing. Approval Map : Used for assigning approvers to projects or documents, such 					as bills and adjustments, employee time cards, equipment time cards, expense 					claims, expense receipts, projects, purchase orders, requests, requisitions, 					sales orders, or transactions. Assignment and Approval Map : Used for either assigning entities to owners or 					assigning approvers to documents. Maps of this type were created in earlier 					versions of  Acumatica ERP. This type remains supported by the system to avoid data loss. By using the  Add Approval Map  or  Add Assignment 					Map  buttons on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP205500|EP205500]) Assignment and Approval Maps (EP205500) form, you can start creating an approval or 				assignment map, which opens on a separate entry form. Approval Maps You can create a new map of the  Approval  type or modify an existing one by 				using the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP205015|EP205015]) Approval Maps (EP205015) form. An approval map consists of steps and rules. In the  Steps   pane, you 				can create any number of steps, each of which may include any number of rules. Steps 				may be executed in a sequential, parallel, or sequential-parallel fashion. For each step, you need to select an action that should be performed if no approver has been 				assigned in accordance with the rules specified for this step, so the document 				becomes automatically approved or rejected or the next step (if any) gets executed. 				Also, you can specify whether a step is to be executed in any case or only if no 				approvers have been found at all previous steps. For each rule, you specify conditions, which the system checks for the document, and actions 				to be performed if the conditions are met. As a result, multiple approvers may be 				assigned to one document. You can configure a rule so that after one approver 				approves the document, the system waits until other appointed approvers (if any) 				also approve the document, executes the next step in the approval map, or marks the 				document as approved. Also, you can specify for each rule whether an approver would 				have to enter a comment each time he or she approves or rejects a document of the 				particular type. If a condition, step, or rule is no longer required in an approval map, you can 				temporarily deactivate it by clearing the  Active  check box in 				the settings of that condition, step, or rule on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP205015|EP205015]) Approval Maps form. A deactivated step or rule is 				marked with the  (Inactive)  prefix in the 					 Steps  pane. If you are creating rules for assigning documents for approval, documents that 				pass through the rules unassigned are considered in the system to be approved, so 				you don't necessarily have to create complete conditions. For example, in a small 				business, all documents with an amount greater than $1000 may need to be approved by 				the CEO. In this case, you would create rules to assign all documents with an amount 				that exceeds $1000 to a specific user (the CEO) for approval, while all other 				documents do not need to be assigned. The rules should be configured to assign only 				documents that have specific properties. On the  Approval Details  tab of a corresponding document entry form, all 				approvers assigned to the document are listed, and for each approver, additional 				information is displayed that helps track which approval map and which step and rule 				in this map is the reason this approver has been assigned. Assignment Maps Assignment maps are created and modified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP205010|EP205010]) Assignment Maps 				(EP205010) form. An assignment map may include any number of rules, which are executed sequentially. 				Similarly to a rule in an approval map, a rule in an assignment map includes 				conditions and actions to be performed if the conditions are met. If you use assignment maps to distribute a particular type of record or 				document—for instance, to assign cases to different owners who will handle 				them—be sure to create a complete set of conditions so that no record or 				document of the specific type is left unassigned. If a condition or rule is no longer required in an assignment map, you can 				temporarily deactivate it by clearing the  Active  check box in 				the settings of that condition or rule on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP205010|EP205010]) Assignment Maps form. A deactivated rule is marked with 				the  (Inactive)  prefix in the  Rules  				pane. If conditions allow the same documents to be assigned to two or more groups, all 				assignments will be performed in the group that is positioned higher than the other 				groups in the assignment map, and the documents would never reach the other groups. 			 Map Application In  Acumatica ERP, you can specify an assignment or approval map for a particular type of record or 				document by using one of the following forms:  ([~/?ScreenId=EP101000|EP101000]) Time and Expenses Preferences (EP101000) for expense claims, expense 					receipts, employee time cards, and equipment time cards  ([~/?ScreenId=CR101000|CR101000]) Customer Management Preferences (CR101000) for leads, contacts, business 					accounts, opportunities, and cases  ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences (SO101000) for sales orders of any type for which the 						 Require Approval  check box is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form  ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) Purchase Orders Preferences (PO101000) for purchase orders of any 					type  ([~/?ScreenId=RQ101000|RQ101000]) Purchase Requisitions Preferences (RQ101000) for purchase requests and requisitions  ([~/?ScreenId=CA101000|CA101000]) Cash Management Preferences (CA101000) for cash transactions  ([~/?ScreenId=AP101000|AP101000]) Accounts Payable Preferences (AP101000) for AP documents  ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) Accounts Receivable Preferences (AR101000) for AR documents Users can assign such records as leads, contacts, business accounts, opportunities, and cases 				in bulk by using the appropriate mass-processing form, such as   ([~/?ScreenId=CR503010|CR503010]) Assign Leads (CR503010) or   ([~/?ScreenId=CR503210|CR503210]) Assign Cases 				(CR503210). Map Execution Issues Any issues that occur during the execution of an assignment or approval map are 				recorded in the  Acumatica ERP trace log. You can open the trace log by clicking  Help Trace  on the form title bar.  Document Approval The appointed approvers can approve documents by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) Approvals (EP503010) form; only users authorized to approve documents 				should have access rights to this form. For more details, see  Approving Documents. Approval Notifications In  Acumatica ERP, you can set up approval notifications, by which an employee will receive an 				email notification each time a document requires approval from this employee. To enable approval notifications for a particular type of document, you need to specify an 				approval map for this type of document on the appropriate form, which can be one of 				the following:  ([~/?ScreenId=EP101000|EP101000]) Time and Expenses Preferences (EP101000) form, 							 General Settings  tab, for expense claims, expense 						receipts, and time cards  ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences (SO101000) form, 							 Approval  tab, for different types of sales 						orders  ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) Purchase Orders Preferences (PO101000) form, 							 Approval  tab, for different types of purchase 						orders  ([~/?ScreenId=RQ101000|RQ101000]) Purchase Requisitions Preferences (RQ101000) form, 							 Approval  tab, for requests and requisitions  ([~/?ScreenId=CA101000|CA101000]) Cash Management Preferences (CA101000) form,  General 							Settings  tab, for cash transactions  ([~/?ScreenId=AP101000|AP101000]) Accounts Payable Preferences (AP101000) form, 							 Approval  tab, for bills, credit and debit 						adjustments, checks, quick checks, prepayment requests, and prepayments  ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) Accounts Receivable Preferences (AR101000) form, 							 Approval  tab, for AR invoices, debit memos, 						credit memos, cash returns, and customer refunds After you specify the approval map, on the same form, you need to specify the notification 				template that will be used for email notifications.

For a multistage approval process, you configure one approval map in which you define the conditions for each stage of the approval process.
==Workflow of Multistage Approvals==
With multistage approvals, a document is approved by multiple approvers in a fixed order; no reviews occur simultaneously. For example, if in your company all Accounts Payable bills should be initially approved by an accountant, and the bills whose total amount exceeds some threshold must also be approved by the top manager, you can configure a multistage approval process: Once an accountant has approved the bill in the first stage, that bill (if it matches the conditions specified for the second stage) goes to the top manager for final approval.{br}

You configure the multistage approval process by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_55_00|Assignment and Approval Maps] ([~/?ScreenId=EP205500|EP205500]) form. On the '''Rules''' pane of this form, you add a row for each required approval stage (the '''Seq.''' column specifies the order number of the approval stage). In each row, you should specify the employee responsible for approving AP bills on the selected stage, and the workgroup in which the approver is included. On the '''Conditions''' pane, you specify the criteria that Accounts Payable bills must met to be assigned for approval at each stage. ((({S:Warn}For the multistage approval process, the ''Approval Workgroup ID'' parameter (available in the '''Field Name''' column of the '''Conditions''' pane) must be specified for each approval stage. By using this parameter, the system defines the order of approval stages. You must specify this parameter differently depending on whether you configure an approval process that consists of two stages or three or more stages. For details, see [HelpRoot_Organization\AP__How_To_Configure_Multistage_Approvals|To Create an Approval Map for Multistage Approvals].
)))
Besides the ''Approval Workgroup ID'' parameter, for each approval stage, you define the conditions that the documents should meet to be assigned to the approver of that stage. You can add as many specific conditions as needed (for example, whether the bill amount is above a specific threshold amount).

In the  Name  column, type a description of the                             approval stage (for example,  Approve by                                 Accountant ). In the  Workgroup  column, select the workgroup                             that includes the employee responsible for approving AP documents in the                             first stage.  In the  Assign to  column, select the employee to                             whom the documents will be assigned for approval. This employee will be                             able to see the list of documents assigned to him or her for approval on                             the  My Approvals  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) Approvals (EP503010) form. Any member of the                                 workgroup selected in the  Workgroup  column                                 will also have the ability to approve or reject AP                             documents. Click  Save  on the form toolbar. Notice that the stage                     number,  1 , has appeared in the  Seq.  column. On the  Conditions  pane, define the conditions to be used                     for assigning the documents to the approver of the first stage as follows: On the toolbar of the  Conditions  pane, click                                  Add Row . In the  Entity  column, select                              Document . In the  Field Name  column, select  Approval                                 Workgroup ID . In the  Condition  column, select  Is                                 Empty . For the first stage of a multistage approval                                 process, you must always specify the  Approval Workgroup ID                                  parameter as  Is Empty . On the toolbar, click  Add Row  to add the second                             row and specify the second condition.

In this example, all AP documents of the  Bill                                  type will be assigned to the approver of the first stage.   In the  Entity  column, select  Document .  In the  Field Name  column. select                              Type . In the  Condition  column, select                              Equals . In the  Field Value  column, type                                  INV .  Add a row for each additional condition you want to add for this stage,                             and specify the appropriate settings. On the  Rules  pane, add the second stage of the approval                     process as follows: On the pane toolbar, click  Add Row . In the  Type  column, select  Assign . In the  Name  column, type a description of the                             second approval stage (for example,  Approve by                                 CEO ). In the  Workgroup  column, select the workgroup                             that includes an employee responsible for approving AP documents on the                             second stage. In the  Assign to  column, select the employee to                             whom the documents will be initially assigned for approval. Click  Save  on the form toolbar. Notice that the stage                     number  2 , has appeared in the  Seq.  column. To specify the conditions for the second approval stage, click the row with the                     second rule in the  Rules  pane, so that the conditions                     will apply to that rule. On the  Conditions  pane, define the conditions to be                     applied for assigning AP documents for approval in the second stage as                         follows: On the pane toolbar, click  Add Row . In the  Entity  column, select                              Document . In the  Field Name  column, select  Approval                                 Workgroup ID . In the  Condition  column, select  Is Not                                 Empty .  The condition  Approval Workgroup ID Is Not Empty  must be                                     specified for the second stage of the two-stage approval                                     process. For an approval process that consists of three and more stages,                                     for the second approval stage and each subsequent stage, you                                     must specify the  Approval Workgroup ID  field name as                                     follows. In the  Condition  column, you                                     select  Equals , and in the  Field                                         Value  column, you select the workgroup (by its                                     name) that is specified as an approval workgroup for the                                     previous approval stage (in the  Workgroup                                      column of the  Rules  pane).  For example, for the second stage of the three-stage approval                                     process, if the  Finance  workgroup has been specified for                                     the first approval stage, you specify  Approval Workgroup ID                                       in the  Field Name  column,                                          Equals  in the  Condition                                      column, and  Finance  in the  Field                                         Value  column. For the third stage, if the                                          Supervisors  workgroup has been specified for the                                     second approval stage,  Approval Workgroup ID  in the                                          Field Name  column,  Equals  in                                     the  Condition  column, and                                          Supervisors  in the  Field Value                                      column. Add a new row to specify the next condition for this stage, and repeat                             as needed.  In the  Rule Type  box (located above the                          Conditions  pane), select  All conditions are                         true , so that the documents will be assigned to the approvers only if                     all the specified conditions are true. Click  Save  on the form toolbar. The approval map is configured for a multistage approval process. ]]></column>

For a parallel approval process, you need to configure multiple approval maps on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_55_00|Assignment and Approval Maps] ([~/?ScreenId=EP205500|EP205500]) form. Each approval map can contain its own conditions that must be met for Accounts Payable documents to be assigned to the specified approvers. 
==Workflow of Parallel Approvals==
Parallel approval means approval of a document by multiple employees in any order or even simultaneously. For example, in small companies, each purchase may need to be approved by an accountant and the CFO independently. In this case, you need to create two separate approval maps on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_55_00|Assignment and Approval Maps] form. In one map, you define the accountant as an approver; in another map, you define the CFO as an approver. You can specify no conditions, so that all AP documents will be independently assigned to the accountant and the CFO for approval; or you can specify the conditions to be used by the system for assigning the appropriate approvers to documents. These conditions can use such document properties as amount, vendor, or branch. {br}

By using Acumatica ERP, your company can automate work assignments and labor calculation for contracts and support services. The Time and Expenses functionality integrates with Accounts Payable, for reimbursing employee expenses, and with Accounts Receivable, for billing labor and expenses to customers. 
==Expense Claim Processing==
Using a web browser, employees can submit expense claims, attaching any scanned receipts and supporting documents. The submitted expense claims are assigned for approval according to predefined assignment rules. Once a claim has been approved, Acumatica ERP creates a bill in Accounts Payable to initiate the reimbursement and generates a customer invoice if expenses were designated as billable to a customer. For more details, see [HelpRoot_Organization\EP__con_Claim_Processing|Processing Expense Claims]. 
==Time Tracking for Customers, Contracts, and Projects==
Regardless of where your employees work from, the time they spend on daily activities is recorded in time cards to track the expenses and billing. Once time cards have been automatically assigned for approval and approved by a supervisor, they generate a customer invoice and update contract usage data if a contract is involved. For more information, see [HelpRoot_ContractManagement\AR__con_Contract_Billing|Contract Billing] and [HelpRoot_Organization\EP__con_Time_Tracking|Time Activities].
==Audit Trail==
 Acumatica ERP provides a complete audit trail of all employee transactions. After a document is approved and released, users cannot delete or cancel it. To correct mistakes, users must enter a correcting or reversing entry. Acumatica ERP keeps the details of all Time and Expenses documents, including information about the user who entered the transaction and the user who modified the record. ]]></column>

By using Acumatica ERP, employees of your company can easily file their claims for reimbursement of expenses, which may include expenditures for travel, accommodations, and freight charges. With Acumatica ERP, expense claims can be prepared, approved, and processed in accordance with the process of claim submission adopted by your company.{br}

The functionality of expense claims and expense receipts is available only if the ''Expense Management'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

Each expense claim is based on expense receipts that an employee enters into the system. A claim can include any number of receipts, each having its own settings. An employee can enter expense receipts on the fly, submit them for approval, and then, at a convenient time (for instance, the end of the month), claim approved receipts in bulk to generate the corresponding expense claims. As soon as a new claim is generated, the system automatically routes it to the authorized person for approval (and adjustment, if needed). Once the claim is approved, it can be released. When an expense claim is released, the system automatically generates a bill to reimburse the expenses to the employee. If the employee incurred the expenses while working on a project for a customer, the system also prepares the records for billing the customer.

In Acumatica ERP, an expense receipt is a record reflecting that an employee performed a transaction while working for your organization, thus incurring certain expenses.{br}{TOC}
==Enabling Expense Receipts==
To enable the functionality of expense claims, you need to enable the ''Expense Management'' feature on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
==Properties of an Expense Receipt==
Each receipt can have the following properties:[anchor|#ul_b1x_fjm_dp]
*The expense non-stock item, which defines the financial accounts, the default tax calculation mode and tax category, and the unit of measure used for the receipt. If a standard cost is specified for the item, it is used as the default unit cost. Suppose, for example, that your company reimburses expenses that the employee incurs while using a personal vehicle for company purposes. In this case, the non-stock item would represent the mileage, and you can specify the standard rate per mile as the standard cost.
*:((({S:Warn}The expense subaccount is combined according to the settings specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_10_10_00|Time and Expenses Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=EP101000|EP101000]) form.
)))
*The name of the employee who is claiming the expenses.
*The default tax zone, which is copied from the employee&rsquo;s settings; a user can override the tax zone in a particular receipt. The overridden tax zone value can be saved and used as the default tax zone in new expense receipts and claims of the employee.
*The total amount of the receipt, the tax amount (if applicable), the employee part (that is, the part of the total amount that will not be paid back to the employee), the tip amount (if applicable), and the claim amount (that is, the amount to be reimbursed to the employee, which is calculated by the following rule: '''Claim Amount''' = '''Amount''' + '''Tax Total''' (if taxes are exclusive) + '''Tip Amount''' – '''Employee Part''').
*The receipt currency, which can be any currency registered in the system. You can configure new currencies by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CM_20_20_00|Currencies] ([~/?ScreenId=CM202000|CM202000]) form.
*The reference number (optional) specified by the employee, which usually matches the number of the original receipt.
*The project or contract, which should be specified if the employee incurred the expenses while working on a particular project or contract. (In this case, the customer associated with the project or contract is filled in automatically.)
*The customer, which should be specified if the employee incurred the expenses while working for a particular customer.
*The scanned image of the original receipt.
*The tax calculation mode. If the ''Net/Gross Entry Mode'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can select whether the amounts that you enter in the expense receipt are tax-exclusive (net) or tax-inclusive (gross). For more information, see [HelpRoot_Financials\TX__con_VAT_in_Expense_Receipts#section_kkz_qp2_jbb|Tax-Exclusive and Tax-Inclusive Amounts in Expense Receipts].

==Access to Expense Receipts==
By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_10_10|Expense Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=EP301010|EP301010]) form, you can enter, view, and edit any of the following expense receipts:[anchor|#ul_mvf_pcb_2p]
*Your own receipts
*Receipts of employees in the workgroups at lower levels in the company tree than your workgroup
*Receipts that require your approval
*Receipts of employees for whom you are an appointed delegate; all delegates of an employee are listed on the '''Delegates''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form

Also, you can view expense receipts included in the expense claims that require your approval.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) form, which is available if the ''Approval Workflow'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can approve or reject receipts assigned to you, to the members of your workgroup, and to the members of the workgroups at lower levels in the company tree than your workgroup.
==Statuses of an Expense Receipts==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_10_10|Expense Receipts] form, you can also view the status of the expense receipt, which reflects its processing stage. Typical statuses for expense receipts might include the following:[anchor|#ul_edq_smd_2y]
*''On Hold'': The receipt is new and has not been submitted for approval yet, or the receipt has been rejected and then put on hold while a user is adjusting it.
*''Open'': The receipt is ready to be added to a claim after it has been approved (if approval is required for the receipt) or after it has been submitted for further processing (if approval is not required).
*''Pending Approval'': The receipt is pending approval.
*''Rejected'': The receipt has been rejected.
*''Released'': The expense claim associated with the receipt has been released.

==Approval of Expense Receipts==
If the ''Approval Workflow'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form, expense receipts that have been entered can be submitted for approval. For details, see [HelpRoot_Organization\EP__con_Receipt_Approval|Expense Receipt Approval].
==Generation of Expense Claims==
Expense receipts with the ''Open'' status can be claimed selectively or all at once to form expense claims. When you claim multiple receipts, they may form multiple claims where receipts will be grouped by their common properties. Receipts that have different employees, branches, or customers are always split into different claims. For details, see [HelpRoot_Organization\EP__HOW_To_Submit_Expense_Receipts|To Generate Expense Claims].{br}

Also, if the '''Allow Mixed Tax Settings in Claims''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_10_10_00|Time and Expenses Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=EP101000|EP101000]) form, a user can add expense receipts with a different tax zone or tax calculation mode (or both) to one claim. When this expense claim is released, the system generates multiple Accounts Payable bills, each of which contains expense receipts with the same tax zone and tax calculation mode. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Financials\TX__con_VAT_in_Expense_Receipts#section_fhb_sjf_jbb|Expense Receipts with Mixed Tax Settings].[anchor|#_41b7a29a-7c19-462a-83ed-ae33de7cde93]
==Processing of Old Receipts==
In Acumatica ERP 2019 R2 and earlier versions, the system did not calculate taxes in expense receipts—that is, there were no tax zones, tax codes, and tax amounts associated with individual receipts. Expense claims were used to calculate taxes for the receipts included into claims by using the claim tax zone.{br}

In Acumatica ERP 2020 R1, taxes are calculated in expense receipts and expense claims are used to aggregate expense receipts. The system does not calculate taxes in claims but just gather taxes of individual receipts and pass them to AP bill with no changes. {br}

After the upgrade to Acumatica ERP 2020 R1, because of these different approaches, you need to handle old unreleased receipts and claims in a special way.{br}

For unreleased expense receipts that are not included into expense claims, after the upgrade, you should specify the tax zone (if needed) to make the system calculate taxes for these receipts. After that the receipts can be claimed. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_10_20|Expense Receipt] ([~/?ScreenId=EP301020|EP301020]) form and on the '''To Be Claimed''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_10_10|Expense Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=EP301010|EP301010]) form, for each receipt with the empty tax zone that is associated with an employee linked to a tax zone, the warning is displayed to notify that the tax zone of the receipt should be updated.{br}

In old unreleased expense claims, the taxes calculated before the upgrade remain unchanged and receipts included into these claims still have no calculated taxes. You can release these claims but you cannot modify any tax related data because the system cannot recalculate taxes for claim lines. To correct these old unreleased claims, you need to delete the claims, modify individual receipts (if needed), and include the receipts into new expense claims. On the deletion of a legacy expense claim, the system calculates and adds the taxes to the expense receipts that belonged to the claim. After that, the receipts are treated as if they are created by the updated functionality.{br}

Old unreleased expense claims with the empty tax zone can be modified before release because they have no calculated taxes.{br}

During the upgrade to Acumatica ERP 2020 R1, the expense receipts and claims are modified as follows:[anchor|#_ea2e570e-001d-4404-9254-01e4ba79d092]
*The tax calculation mode is set to ''Tax Settings'' for all the receipts and claims.
*The receipt tax zone is defaulted from the claim tax zone for all the receipts included into claims.
*All the old receipts are marked with a special attribute to be able to distinguish them from new ones.

In Acumatica ERP, an employee can file a claim for the reimbursement of expenses he or she incurred on behalf of the company.{br}{TOC}
==Enabling Expense Claims==
To enable the functionality of expense claims, you need to enable the ''Expense Management'' feature on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
==Access to Expense Claims==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_10_30|Expense Claims] ([~/?ScreenId=EP301030|EP301030]) form, you can access any of the following expense claims:[anchor|#ul_xfx_bsm_dp]
*Your claims
*Claims of employees in the workgroups at lower levels in the company tree than your workgroup
*Claims of employees for whom you are an appointed delegate
*Claims that require your approval
*Claims that require approval by employees in the workgroups at lower levels in the company tree than your workgroup
((({S:Warn}For more information about the company tree, see [HelpRoot_Organization\EP__con_Company_Organizational_Chart|Company Tree and Workgroups].
)))
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_10_00|Release Expense Claims] ([~/?ScreenId=EP501000|EP501000]) form, all unreleased claims are listed, but you may not be able to edit or view the details of some claims.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) form, you can approve or reject claims assigned to you, to the members of your workgroup, and to the members of the workgroups at lower levels in the company tree than your workgroup.{br}{TOC}
==Filing of an Expense Claim==
You, as an employee, can use one of the following methods of filing an expense claim:[anchor|#ul_e2l_mhh_fx]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_10_10|Expense Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=EP301010|EP301010]) form, enter expense receipts and submit them for approval (if required). When the receipts are approved, you claim them in bulk to automatically generate the corresponding expense claims. (For details, see [HelpRoot_Organization\EP__HOW_To_Submit_Expense_Receipts|To Generate Expense Claims].)
*By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_10_30|Expense Claims] ([~/?ScreenId=EP301030|EP301030]) form, create a new claim, and then add any number of receipts to the created claim or add lines directly to the claim by using the table on the '''Expense Claim Details''' tab. You can add receipts to a claim only if it has the ''On Hold'' status.
*:((({S:Warn}If the '''Allow Mixed Tax Settings in Claims''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_10_10_00|Time and Expenses Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=EP101000|EP101000]) form, expense receipts with different tax zones or tax calculation modes (or both) can be processed within one expense claim. If the check box is cleared, all expense receipts added to one expense claim must have the same tax settings. 
)))

If the '''Hold Expense Claims on Entry''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_10_10_00|Time and Expenses Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=EP101000|EP101000]) form is selected, all new expense claims have the ''On Hold'' status, indicating that they are drafts that can be adjusted, if necessary. You need to check the details of every claim before submitting it for approval; you can submit an expense claim for approval only if all included receipts have the ''Open'' status. If the '''Hold Expense Claims on Entry''' check box is cleared, each newly created expense claim is automatically submitted for approval and the status of the claim is set to ''Pending Approval'' (if approval is required) or ''Approved'' (if no approval is required).{br}

For expenses that require documentation by your company policy, you can attach to each receipt a scanned receipt or other document that confirms your expenses.
==Properties of an Expense Claim==
In Acumatica ERP, an expense claim has the following properties: [anchor|#ul_pyz_13h_fx]
*The unique reference number, which the system assigns based on the numbering sequence specified for claims on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_10_10_00|Time and Expenses Preferences] form.
*The date when the claim is created; this date determines the post period of the bill generated by the claim release unless a particular post period is specified for the claim in the '''Post to Period''' box on the '''Financial Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_10_00|Expense Claim] ([~/?ScreenId=EP301000|EP301000]) form, which is available if the claim has the ''Pending Approval'' or ''Approved'' status.
*The total amount of the claim, which is calculated as the sum of the amounts in the '''Amount in Claim Curr.''' column for all the lines specified for the claim.
*The employee part of the total amount, which is not paid back to the employee in accordance with the company policy.
*The taxable and tax amount for the expense claim. You can review the summary information on applicable taxes on the '''Tax Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_10_00|Expense Claim] form, or you can view information for an expense claim line by clicking the link in the '''Tax Amount''' column on the '''Expense Claim Details''' tab.
*The currency in which the claim will be reimbursed to the employee; the claim currency may differ from the currency of the included receipts. By default, the claim currency matches the currency specified as the default for the employee, but it can be changed if currency override is enabled for the employee on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form.
*The customer (if applicable), which can also be specified for an individual line. The customer specified in the summary area of the claim is the default customer for claim lines; it can be overridden for each line unless a project is specified for the line and the customer is associated with this project. When the '''Billable''' check box is selected for a particular line, the customer will be billed for the expense in the amount returned to the employee.
*The branch that will reimburse the expenses to the employee. 
*The department of the employee, which can affect who approves the claim. You can set up assignment rules for claim approval whereby claims from different departments may be approved by different persons.
*The tax zone and tax calculation mode. 
*:For a newly created claim, the tax zone is copied from the employee&rsquo;s settings. For an expense claim created from an expense receipt, the tax zone is copied from the expense receipt. A user can override the tax zone in a particular claim. The overridden tax zone can be saved and used as the default tax zone in new expense claims and receipts of the employee.
*:((({S:Warn}If the ''Net/Gross Entry Mode'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can select whether the amounts in the expense claim are tax-exclusive (net) or tax-inclusive (gross). For more information, see [HelpRoot_Financials\TX__con_VAT_in_Expense_Receipts#section_kkz_qp2_jbb|Tax-Exclusive and Tax-Inclusive Amounts in Expense Receipts].
)))

==Statuses of an Expense Claim==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_10_30|Expense Claims] form, you can also view the claim's status, which reflects its processing stage. Typical statuses for expense claims might include the following: [anchor|#ul_dvn_zxg_dp]
*''On Hold'': The claim is a draft and cannot be released.
*''Pending Approval'': The claim is pending approval.
*''Approved'': The claim is either approved or requires no approval.
*''Rejected'': The claim is rejected.
*''Released'': An Accounts Payable bill has been generated based on the claim.

==Processing of Old Claims==
In Acumatica ERP 2019 R2 and earlier versions, the system did not calculate taxes in expense receipts—that is, there were no tax zones, tax codes, and tax amounts associated with individual receipts. Expense claims were used to calculate taxes for the receipts included into claims by using the claim tax zone.{br}

In Acumatica ERP 2020 R1, taxes are calculated in expense receipts and expense claims are used to aggregate expense receipts. The system does not calculate taxes in claims but just gather taxes of individual receipts and pass them to AP bill with no changes. {br}

After the upgrade to Acumatica ERP 2020 R1, because of these different approaches, you need to handle old unreleased receipts and claims in a special way as described in [HelpRoot_Organization\EP__con_Expense_Receipts#_41b7a29a-7c19-462a-83ed-ae33de7cde93|Processing of Old Receipts].

For effective processing of expenses, it may be sufficient to configure the approval of only one type of expense document. For example, if you want all expenses related to a particular project to be approved by the project manager, you can configure approval of only expense receipts associated with the project. 
)))
==Assignment for Approval==
The system performs assignment for approval automatically in one of the following ways:[anchor|#ul_fvg_4wq_2r]
*If the ''Approval Workflow'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the system uses approval maps, which can be created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_55_00|Assignment and Approval Maps] ([~/?ScreenId=EP205500|EP205500]) form. You can specify the map for claim approval on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_10_10_00|Time and Expenses Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=EP101000|EP101000]) form. However, if no approval map is specified or if a claim does not meet the conditions of the specified map, then the claim requires no approval—it is assigned the ''Open'' status, and it can be released immediately after submission.
*If the ''Approval Workflow'' feature is disabled, the system assigns an expense claim for approval to the employee specified in the '''Reports to''' box on the '''General Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form for the employee who is claiming the expenses; if the '''Reports to''' box is empty, the claim requires no approval—it is assigned the ''Open'' status, and it can be released immediately after submission.

Once the expense claim is assigned for approval, its status changes to ''Pending Approval''. The claim will not be reassigned to another approver if you enable or disable the ''Approval Workflow'' feature or if you modify the approval map specified for expense claims.
==Approval or Rejection of Expense Claims==
You can approve an individual expense claim you are viewing by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_10_00|Expense Claim] ([~/?ScreenId=EP301000|EP301000]) form. The '''Approve''' or '''Reject''' action can be applied to a claim assigned to you or to a member of a workgroup at a lower level in the company tree than your workgroup.{br}

Also, claims can be approved on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) form, which is available only if the ''Approval Workflow'' feature is enabled. If you have access to this form, you can view claims in accordance with the visibility rules applied to all documents listed on this form (that is, you can view the claims assigned to you, to the members of your workgroup, and to the members of the workgroups at lower levels in the company tree than your workgroup). You can approve all listed documents at once by clicking '''Approve All''' on the form toolbar, or you can approve only particular document by selecting them and then clicking '''Approve'''.((({S:Warn}Although you can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] form to approve expense claims assigned to other members of your workgroup, you cannot view the details of these claims on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_10_30|Expense Claims] form due to certain restrictions of user access. For more information about user access to expense claims, see [HelpRoot_Organization\EP__con_Expense_Claims|Expense Claims].
)))
Once a claim is approved, it can be released.{br}

If your system is configured for the approval of expense claims and AP bills, when the system generates bills on release of expense claims, it does not assign these bills for approval as it considers these bills to be approved because the expense claims for which these bills were generated have already been approved.

The system posts the resulting bill to the selected period, which is also copied to the '''Post Period''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form for the bill.{br}

If the employee incurred the expenses while working on a project for a customer, you can invoice the customer by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_20_00|Bill Expense Claims] ([~/?ScreenId=EP502000|EP502000]) form. In this case, the system generates an invoice for the customer in the same amount as the bill for employee reimbursement. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_20_00|Bill Expense Claims] form, each record relates to a single customer; thus, all unbilled claim lines marked as billable will be included in one invoice.{br}

The system will automatically release Accounts Payable bills and Accounts Receivable invoices from the Time and Expenses module if the '''Automatically Release AP Documents''' and '''Automatically Release AR Documents''' check boxes, respectively, are selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_10_10_00|Time and Expenses Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=EP101000|EP101000]) form. ((({S:Warn}The system automatically releases Accounts Payable bills If the '''Automatically Release AP Documents''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_10_10_00|Time and Expenses Preferences] form even if the approval workflow functionality is activated for AP documents on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_10_10_00|Accounts Payable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AP101000|AP101000]) form (the '''Require Approval''' check box is selected). 
)))
Also, the resulting transactions can be automatically posted to the General Ledger module if the '''Automatically Post on Release''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_10_10_00|Accounts Payable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AP101000|AP101000]) form.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
 Acumatica ERP supports the use of corporate credit cards on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_10_00|Expense Claim] ([~/?ScreenId=EP301000|EP301000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_10_20|Expense Receipt] ([~/?ScreenId=EP301020|EP301020]) forms. This helps employees to categorize and track the expenses, including the expenses related to a project. For example, while in the field, the workers of a construction company or professional service provider can buy something that they want to charge on a project and pay for it with a corporate card. Employees can still have out-of-pocket expenses that are reimbursed through the standard process.{br}

The corporate card functionality provides the following advantages:[anchor|#_0b07b1fa-2709-404b-ae28-f9bae01e6572]
*Administrative users can manage corporate cards.
*Corporate cards support foreign currencies.
*Expense receipts in a foreign currency can be paid with a corporate card.
*A single expense claim can be created for all corporate card expenses, as long as they have the same card currency.
*Bank transaction matching and reconciliation process support corporate card statements so that card statement records can be matched to expense receipts.

To start using the functionality of expense claims and expense receipts, which includes the corporate card functionality, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, an administrative user enables the ''Expense Management'' feature.{br}{TOC}
==Configuring Corporate Cards==
Corporate credit cards can be configured on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_25_00|Corporate Cards] ([~/?ScreenId=CA202500|CA202500]) form. The card number is used for matching transactions on a bank statement. Multiple employees can use a single corporate card; these employees are listed in the table on the form.{br}

In order to create corporate cards on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_25_00|Corporate Cards] form, GL accounts, cash accounts, payment methods, and employees must be configured as described below.{br}

If the card currency differs from the currency of an employee who uses the corporate card, for this employee, the '''Enable Currency Override''' and '''Enable Rate Override''' check boxes must be selected on the '''General Info''' tab ('''Employee Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form. (The '''Currency ID''' box, where the employee currency is specified, can also be found in this section of the form.){br}

The cash account that is used for corporate cards should be configured as follows:[anchor|#_eaf11f35-9b48-4629-b84c-839653466414]
*A separate GL account should be configured for each bank and currency.
*Each GL account has a separate cash account with the following settings specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_20_00|Cash Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CA202000|CA202000]) form:
**The '''Clearing Account''' check box is cleared.
**The '''Restrict Visibility with Branch''' check box is cleared.
**The '''Use for Corporate Cards''' check box is selected.
**Only one payment method can be associated with the cash account.
**Optionally, the '''Requires Reconciliation''' check box is selected; if it is, a numbering sequence must be specified in the '''Reconciliation Numbering Sequence''' box. The predefined ''CARECON'' numbering sequence can be selected.
{br}

Although the cash account that is used for a corporate card must have only one associated payment method, this payment method can be selected for multiple cash accounts. If a payment method is selected for a cash account that is used for a corporate card, in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_40_00|Payment Methods] ([~/?ScreenId=CA204000|CA204000]) form, the '''Use in AP''' check box is selected. Also, on the '''Settings for Use in AP''' tab of the form, this payment method should have the following settings:[anchor|#_88735079-9395-4939-973b-95bc4b462db3]
*'''Not Required''' ('''Additional Processing''' section): Selected
*'''Require Unique Payment Ref.''' ('''Payment Settings''' section): Cleared

==Paying Expense Receipts with Corporate Cards==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_10_20|Expense Receipt] ([~/?ScreenId=EP301020|EP301020]) form, in the '''Paid With''' box (in the '''Expense Details '''section of the '''Receipt Details''' tab), a user can select how the expense receipt has been paid. The following options are available:[anchor|#_1411788c-144d-4520-a3e0-8f3e519271a5]
*''Personal Account'': The company&rsquo;s expenses that the employee paid with his or her own funds and the company will need to reimburse this amount to the employee. This is the default option if the employee has no active corporate card assigned.
*''Corporate Card, Company Expense'': The company&rsquo;s expenses that are paid with a corporate card. This is the default option if the employee has an active corporate card assigned.
*''Corporate Card, Personal Expense'': The employee&rsquo;s personal expenses that are paid with a corporate card.

In the '''Corporate Card''' box, the user selects his or her corporate card. This box is unavailable on the form if ''Personal Account'' was selected in the '''Paid With''' box. The default corporate card, if any, is selected as follows:[anchor|#_fa68e37c-f829-43e1-a6d0-98e9b677a9d5]
*The corporate card used in the employee&rsquo;s most recent expense receipt is selected, if it is available. The most recent receipt is determined by the receipt&rsquo;s creation date ({{CreatedDate}}).
*If the corporate card that was used most recently is unavailable—that is, inactive, deleted, or not assigned to the employee—the employee&rsquo;s only active card or the first active card the system finds for the employee. The first corporate card is the first card in the employee&rsquo;s card list; this list is sorted alphabetically by name.

Corporate card expenses cannot be split. That is, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_10_20|Expense Receipt] form, in the '''Expense Details''' section of the '''Receipt Details''' tab, the '''Employee Part''' of an expense receipt paid with a corporate card must be zero.{br}

The '''Ref. Nbr.''' box, where a user can enter the reference number that usually matches the number of the original receipt, must be filled in if the '''Require Ref. Nbr. in Expense Receipts''' check box in selected on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_10_10_00|Time and Expenses Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=EP101000|EP101000]) form.
==Processing Expense Claims for Expense Receipts Paid with Corporate Cards==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_10_00|Expense Claim] ([~/?ScreenId=EP301000|EP301000]) form, an expense claim can contain all the employee's expense receipts paid with corporate cards as long as they have the same card currency. Each expense claim line refers to an expense receipt. On release of an expense claim, the system creates documents as follows for the expense claim lines, depending on the value in the '''Paid With''' column:[anchor|#_0497cdd1-5185-401c-ad2a-29b56b794f48]
*''Personal Account'': A single AP bill is created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form for all the expense claim lines with positive amounts and a single AP debit adjustment is created on the same form for all the expense claim lines with negative amounts.
*''Corporate Card, Company Expense'': An AP quick check is created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_40_00|Quick Checks] ([~/?ScreenId=AP304000|AP304000]) form for each expense claim line, if the '''Post Summarized Corporate Card Company Expenses''' check box is cleared on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_10_10_00|Time and Expenses Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=EP101000|EP101000]) form.
*:If the '''Post Summarized Corporate Card Company Expenses''' check box in selected, the system creates a separate AP quick check for each group of the expense claim lines with the same date, corporate card, and reference number.
*:On release of this AP quick check, the system credits the card liability account and debits the expense account of the expense item specified in the expense receipt.
*''Corporate Card, Personal Expense'': A single AP debit adjustment is created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] form for all the expense claim lines.
*:On release of this AP debit adjustment, the system credits the card liability account and debits the employee&rsquo;s AP account.

==Bank Transactions Matching and Reconciliation==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_30_65_00|Import Bank Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=CA306500|CA306500]) form, an accountant can upload bank statement records for the liability cash account of a corporate card. If a bank statement record contains the corporate card number in text format, this number is shown in the '''Card Number''' column on the form. A single bank statement may contain transactions of all the corporate cards associated with the same cash account. For more information about importing bank transactions, see [HelpRoot_Financials\CA__CON_ImportBankTrans|Importing Transactions].{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_30_60_00|Process Bank Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=CA306000|CA306000]) form, for the liability cash account of a corporate card, the accountant can match an uploaded bank statement record to an existing payment, AP bill, or expense receipt as well as create a cash transaction if such a transaction has not found in the system. For details about matching bank transactions, see [HelpRoot_Financials\CA__CON_ProcessingImportTrans|Processing Imported Transactions].{br}

In the left pane of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_30_60_00|Process Bank Transactions] form, where the system shows the list of bank statement records, imported bank transactions contain the corporate card number in text format in the '''Card Number''' column.{br}

The system uses the available information about imported transactions for searching for matching documents and for calculating the relevance rate, which is a measure of how closely a document matches the selected transaction.{br}

The system uses the settings in the '''Weights for Relevance Calculation''' section of the '''Transaction Match Settings''' dialog box—'''Ref. Nbr. Weight''', '''Doc. Date Weight''', and '''Doc. Payee Weight'''—for searching payments and invoices as matching candidates. For more information about the matching process and the relevance calculation, see [HelpRoot_Financials\CA__CON_BankTran_MatchingSettings|Transaction Matching Settings].{br}

If no payment or invoice is found, the system uses certain settings in the '''Weights for Relevance Calculation''' and '''Expense Receipt Matching''' sections of the '''Transaction Match Settings''' dialog box—'''Ref. Nbr. Weight''', '''Doc. Date Weight''', and '''Amount Weight'''—for searching expense receipts for matching candidates.{br}

Unlike the relevance calculation for payments and invoices, for calculating the relevance rate for expense receipts, the system includes in the calculation the amount weight instead of the payee weight, using the following formula:{br}

{{AmountDistance() = NORMDIST(x, 0, DifferenceAmount, probability mass function) / NORMDIST(0, 0, DifferenceAmount, probability mass function)}}{br}

{{x = ABS(BankTransactionAmount - ExpenseCardCurrencyAmount)}}{br}

{{DifferenceAmount = Amount Difference Threshold (%) * BankTransactionAmount / 100}}{br}

Payments and invoices are selected as matching candidates by the exact amount of a bank transaction, which is consistent to the logic of bank transaction matching for regular bank accounts. The '''Amount Difference Threshold (%)''' is not applied for matching of payments and invoices and applied for matching of expense receipts that are recorded with the expense currency that differs from the card currency and therefore a difference between the amount of a bank transaction and the amount of an expense receipt may take place.{br}

The {{AmountDistance()}} formula returns a floating number that ranges in value from ''0'' to ''1''.{br}

The system calculates the relevance rate for an expense receipt by using the following formula:{br}

{{Match Relevance = DocDateWeight*DateDistance() + RefNbrWeight*RefNbrDistance() + AmountWeight*AmountDistance()}}{br}

If the user selects an imported bank transaction in the left pane of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_30_60_00|Process Bank Transactions] form, in the right pane, the system shows the list of matching documents it has found. Payments are shown on the '''Match to Payments''' tab. AP documents are shown on the '''Match to Invoices''' tab. A cash transaction can be created for the bank transaction on the '''Create Payment''' tab. Expense receipts are shown on the '''Match to Expense Receipts''' tab, which is displayed on the form only for cash accounts that are used for corporate cards—that is, cash accounts for which the '''Use for Corporate Cards''' check box selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_20_00|Cash Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CA202000|CA202000]) form.{br}

When a user auto-matches bank transactions, for each bank transaction, in the right pane, the system selects the '''Matched''' check box for the best candidate among all the found candidates by using the following rules:[anchor|#_7f418d5f-ed7c-4488-8ae5-a73f30b0c5a7]
#The best match is the document with the highest match relevance that is greater than 0.75.
#If multiple documents have the same highest match relevance, the system selects the first found document with the following priority: a payment, an AP document, and an expense receipt.
#If no documents have a match relevance greater than 0.75, the best match is a document that has a match relevance is equal to or greater than 0.2.
#:For example, if the match relevance of one document is 0.25 and the match relevance of another document is 0.5, the system selects the document with the match relevance of 0.5.
#:If more than one document satisfies this condition, the system selects the first found document with the following priority: a payment, an AP document, and an expense receipt.
#If only one document is found, it is the best match if its match relevance is equal to or greater than 0.2.

If none of the conditions above has been met, there is no best match for the transaction of the bank statement.{br}

Once an expense receipt and its corresponding bank statement record have been matched and processed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_30_60_00|Process Bank Transactions] form, they are no longer displayed on the form.
==Notes on the Matching Process==
There are the following limitations of the matching process:[anchor|#_6d324446-8bc9-4029-8279-9ed730e76126]
*If a user matches a bank transaction to an expense receipt in a different currency with the amount within the amount difference threshold, releases the corresponding claim, and the cash transaction is posted, and then the user unmatches the bank transaction from the expense receipt, the cash transaction will not appear as a candidate for matching on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_30_60_00|Process Bank Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=CA306000|CA306000]) form because the amounts differ.
*If a cash transaction originates from an expense claim, the cash transaction date in the system equals the expense claim date. There can be a significant delay between the date of the bank statement transaction and the date of the cash transaction in the system, which should be considered in the filter of dates in the '''Transaction Match Settings''' dialog box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_30_60_00|Process Bank Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=CA306000|CA306000]) form.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Use of Corporate Cards in Expense Receipts  Acumatica ERP supports the use of corporate credit cards on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP301000|EP301000]) Expense Claim (EP301000) and   ([~/?ScreenId=EP301020|EP301020]) Expense Receipt (EP301020) forms. This helps employees to         categorize and track the expenses, including the expenses related to a project. For example,         while in the field, the workers of a construction company or professional service provider         can buy something that they want to charge on a project and pay for it with a corporate         card. Employees can still have out-of-pocket expenses that are reimbursed through the         standard process. The corporate card functionality provides the following advantages: Administrative users can manage corporate cards. Corporate cards support foreign currencies. Expense receipts in a foreign currency can be paid with a corporate card. A single expense claim can be created for all corporate card expenses, as long as they have      the same card currency. Bank transaction matching and reconciliation process support corporate card statements           so that card statement records can be matched to expense receipts. To start using the functionality of expense claims and expense receipts, which includes the     corporate card functionality, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form,     an administrative user enables the  Expense Management  feature. Configuring Corporate Cards Corporate credit cards can be configured on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA202500|CA202500]) Corporate Cards         (CA202500) form. The card number is used for matching transactions on a bank statement.         Multiple employees can use a single corporate card; these employees are listed in the table         on the form. In order to create corporate cards on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA202500|CA202500]) Corporate Cards         form, GL accounts, cash accounts, payment methods, and employees must be configured as         described below. If the card currency differs from the currency of an employee who uses the corporate card, for         this employee, the  Enable Currency Override  and  Enable           Rate Override  check boxes must be selected on the  General           Info  tab ( Employee Settings  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) Employees (EP203000) form. (The  Currency           ID  box, where the employee currency is specified, can also be found in this         section of the form.) The cash account that is used for corporate cards should be configured as follows: A separate GL account should be configured for each bank and currency. Each GL account has a separate cash account with the following settings specified on the          ([~/?ScreenId=CA202000|CA202000]) Cash Accounts (CA202000) form: The  Clearing Account  check box is cleared. The  Restrict Visibility with Branch  check box is cleared. The  Use for Corporate Cards  check box is selected. Only one payment method can be associated with the cash account. Optionally, the  Requires Reconciliation  check box is selected; if         it is, a numbering sequence must be specified in the  Reconciliation Numbering          Sequence  box. The predefined  CARECON  numbering sequence can be         selected. Although the cash account that is used for a corporate card must have only one associated     payment method, this payment method can be selected for multiple cash accounts. If a payment     method is selected for a cash account that is used for a corporate card, in the Summary area of     the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA204000|CA204000]) Payment Methods (CA204000) form, the  Use in      AP  check box is selected. Also, on the  Settings for Use in      AP  tab of the form, this payment method should have the following settings: Not Required  ( Additional Processing  section):       Selected Require Unique Payment Ref.  ( Payment Settings        section): Cleared Paying Expense Receipts with Corporate Cards On the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP301020|EP301020]) Expense Receipt (EP301020) form, in the  Paid           With  box (in the  Expense Details  section of the            Receipt Details  tab), a user can select how the expense receipt has         been paid. The following options are available: Personal Account : The company's expenses that the employee paid with his or her           own funds and the company will need to reimburse this amount to the employee. This is the           default option if the employee has no active corporate card assigned. Corporate Card, Company Expense : The company's expenses that are paid with a      corporate card. This is the default option if the employee has an active corporate card      assigned. Corporate Card, Personal Expense : The employee's personal expenses that are paid with      a corporate card. In the  Corporate Card  box, the user selects his or her corporate card.         This box is unavailable on the form if  Personal Account  was selected in the            Paid With  box. The default corporate card, if any, is selected as         follows: The corporate card used in the employee's most recent expense receipt is selected, if it is      available. The most recent receipt is determined by the receipt's creation date       ( CreatedDate ). If the corporate card that was used most recently is unavailable—that is, inactive, deleted,      or not assigned to the employee—the employee's only active card or the first active card the      system finds for the employee. The first corporate card is the first card in the employee's      card list; this list is sorted alphabetically by name. Corporate card expenses cannot be split. That is, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP301020|EP301020]) Expense Receipt form, in the  Expense Details      section of the  Receipt Details  tab, the  Employee      Part  of an expense receipt paid with a corporate card must be zero. The  Ref. Nbr.  box, where a user can enter the reference number that         usually matches the number of the original receipt, must be filled in if the            Require Ref. Nbr. in Expense Receipts  check box in selected on the            General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP101000|EP101000]) Time and Expenses Preferences (EP101000) form. Processing Expense Claims for Expense Receipts Paid with Corporate Cards On the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP301000|EP301000]) Expense Claim (EP301000) form, an expense claim can     contain all the employee's expense receipts paid with corporate cards as long as they have the     same card currency. Each expense claim line refers to an expense receipt. On release of an     expense claim, the system creates documents as follows for the expense claim lines, depending on     the value in the  Paid With  column: Personal Account : A single AP bill is created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form for all the expense claim lines           with positive amounts and a single AP debit adjustment is created on the same form for all           the expense claim lines with negative amounts. Corporate Card, Company Expense : An AP quick check is created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP304000|AP304000]) Quick Checks (AP304000) form for each expense claim line, if           the  Post Summarized Corporate Card Company Expenses  check box is           cleared on the  General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP101000|EP101000]) Time and Expenses Preferences (EP101000) form. If the  Post               Summarized Corporate Card Company Expenses  check box in selected, the             system creates a separate AP quick check for each group of the expense claim lines with             the same date, corporate card, and reference number. On release of this AP quick             check, the system credits the card liability account and debits the expense account of             the expense item specified in the expense receipt. Corporate Card, Personal Expense : A single AP debit adjustment is created on the         ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments form for all the expense claim lines. On       release of this AP debit adjustment, the system credits the card liability account and debits       the employee's AP account. Bank Transactions Matching and Reconciliation On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA306500|CA306500]) Import Bank Transactions (CA306500) form, an accountant can         upload bank statement records for the liability cash account of a corporate card. If a bank         statement record contains the corporate card number in text format, this number is shown in         the  Card Number  column on the form. A single bank statement may         contain transactions of all the corporate cards associated with the same cash account. For         more information about importing bank transactions, see  Importing Transactions. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA306000|CA306000]) Process Bank Transactions (CA306000) form, for the liability cash         account of a corporate card, the accountant can match an uploaded bank statement record to         an existing payment, AP bill, or expense receipt as well as create a cash transaction if         such a transaction has not found in the system. For details about matching bank         transactions, see  Processing Imported Transactions. In the left pane of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA306000|CA306000]) Process Bank Transactions form, where the system         shows the list of bank statement records, imported bank transactions contain the corporate         card number in text format in the  Card Number  column. The system uses the available information about imported transactions for searching for         matching documents and for calculating the relevance rate, which is a measure of how closely         a document matches the selected transaction. The system uses the settings in the  Weights for Relevance           Calculation  section of the  Transaction Match Settings          dialog box— Ref. Nbr. Weight ,  Doc. Date Weight ,         and  Doc. Payee Weight —for searching payments and invoices as matching         candidates. For more information about the matching process and the relevance calculation,         see  Transaction Matching Settings. If no payment or invoice is found, the system uses certain settings in the            Weights for Relevance Calculation  and  Expense Receipt           Matching  sections of the  Transaction Match Settings          dialog box— Ref. Nbr. Weight ,  Doc. Date Weight ,         and  Amount Weight —for searching expense receipts for matching         candidates. Unlike the relevance calculation for payments and invoices, for calculating the relevance         rate for expense receipts, the system includes in the calculation the amount weight instead         of the payee weight, using the following formula: AmountDistance() = NORMDIST(x, 0, DifferenceAmount, probability mass function) /           NORMDIST(0, 0, DifferenceAmount, probability mass function) x = ABS(BankTransactionAmount - ExpenseCardCurrencyAmount) DifferenceAmount = Amount Difference Threshold (%) * BankTransactionAmount /           100 Payments and invoices are selected as matching candidates by the exact amount of a bank         transaction, which is consistent to the logic of bank transaction matching for regular bank         accounts. The  Amount Difference Threshold (%)  is not applied for         matching of payments and invoices and applied for matching of expense receipts that are         recorded with the expense currency that differs from the card currency and therefore a         difference between the amount of a bank transaction and the amount of an expense receipt may         take place. The  AmountDistance()  formula returns a floating number that ranges in         value from  0  to  1 . The system calculates the relevance rate for an expense receipt by using the following         formula: Match Relevance = DocDateWeight*DateDistance() + RefNbrWeight*RefNbrDistance() +           AmountWeight*AmountDistance() If the user selects an imported bank transaction in the left pane of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA306000|CA306000]) Process Bank Transactions form, in the right pane, the system shows the list         of matching documents it has found. Payments are shown on the  Match to           Payments  tab. AP documents are shown on the  Match to           Invoices  tab. A cash transaction can be created for the bank transaction on         the  Create Payment  tab. Expense receipts are shown on the            Match to Expense Receipts  tab, which is displayed on the form only         for cash accounts that are used for corporate cards—that is, cash accounts for which the            Use for Corporate Cards  check box selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA202000|CA202000]) Cash Accounts (CA202000) form. When a user auto-matches bank transactions, for each bank transaction, in the right pane,         the system selects the  Matched  check box for the best candidate among         all the found candidates by using the following rules: The best match is the document with the highest match relevance that is greater than           0.75. If multiple documents have the same highest match relevance, the system selects the           first found document with the following priority: a payment, an AP document, and an           expense receipt. If no documents have a match relevance greater than 0.75, the best match is a document           that has a match relevance is equal to or greater than 0.2. For example, if the match             relevance of one document is 0.25 and the match relevance of another document is 0.5,             the system selects the document with the match relevance of 0.5. If more than one             document satisfies this condition, the system selects the first found document with the             following priority: a payment, an AP document, and an expense receipt. If only one document is found, it is the best match if its match relevance is equal to           or greater than 0.2. If none of the conditions above has been met, there is no best match for the transaction of         the bank statement. Once an expense receipt and its corresponding bank statement record have been matched and         processed on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA306000|CA306000]) Process Bank Transactions form, they are no longer         displayed on the form. Notes on the Matching Process There are the following limitations of the matching process: If a user matches a bank transaction to an expense receipt in a different currency with           the amount within the amount difference threshold, releases the corresponding claim, and           the cash transaction is posted, and then the user unmatches the bank transaction from the           expense receipt, the cash transaction will not appear as a candidate for matching on the               ([~/?ScreenId=CA306000|CA306000]) Process Bank Transactions (CA306000) form because the amounts           differ. If a cash transaction originates from an expense claim, the cash transaction date in the           system equals the expense claim date. There can be a significant delay between the date of           the bank statement transaction and the date of the cash transaction in the system, which           should be considered in the filter of dates in the  Transaction Match             Settings  dialog box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA306000|CA306000]) Process Bank Transactions           (CA306000) form.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
In Acumatica ERP, you can enable a feature that gives employees the ability to report the time that they spend on each time activity.{br}{TOC}
==Enabling Time Reporting==
 To enable time reporting for activities, you need to enable the ''Time Reporting on Activity'' feature on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, which makes the '''Track Time''' check box available on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_10|Activity] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306010|CR306010]) form. This check box, when selected, enables a group of elements on the same form which you can use to report the total time spent on the activity. Also, by using this group of elements, you can mark the activity as billable and specify the information required for billing—that is, the amount of billable time and the earning type of the activity (for details, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CR__con_Case_Billing|Case Billing]). {br}

If you want the '''Track Time''' check box to be selected by default for activities of certain types, you need to select the corresponding check boxes in the '''Track Time''' column on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_10_20_00|Activity Types] ([~/?ScreenId=CR102000|CR102000]) form. 
==Using Earning Types==
In Acumatica ERP, you have to specify an earning type for each billable activity; the earning type determines how the system calculates the cost of employee labor.{br}

The system recognizes two classes of earning types: those defining standard working hours and those defining overtime. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_10_20_00|Earning Types] ([~/?ScreenId=EP102000|EP102000]) form, where you can add new earning types and adjust the available ones, you can also specify whether an earning type defines standard working hours or overtime by clearing or selecting the '''Overtime''' check box, respectively. On the same form, you can update the multiplier value for any overtime earning type—the system multiplies the employee rate by the multiplier value when calculating the cost of employee labor. For standard working hours, the multiplier is always ''1''.{br}

 By default, the following earning types are available in the system:
*''Regular Hours (RG)'': Standard working hours whose cost is calculated based on the standard employee rate.
*''Overtime (OT)'': Overtime working hours whose cost is calculated by multiplying the standard rate by the value of the overtime multiplier.
*''Public Holidays (HL)'': Non-working hours of public holidays, which are non-billable. You can use this earning type to indicate that certain days included in the time card are public holidays when no work is done.
*''Vacations (VL)'': Non-working hours of vacations, which are also non-billable. You can use this earning type to indicate that the employee is not working due to vacation.

==Approving Activities==
A time activity can be associated with a project task that has an approver specified. If this is the case, the time activity must be approved before it can be released for billing. Either the project task approver or the project manager can approve the time activity.{br}

You can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_70_10|Approve Time Activities] ([~/?ScreenId=EP507010|EP507010]) form to approve activities that require your approval. If you use time cards, you can approve time activities in groups by approving time card summaries on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_70_30|Approve Time Activity Summaries] ([~/?ScreenId=EP507030|EP507030]) form.{br}

When the activities are released, the system tracks costs for specific customers, cases, contracts, or projects and generates the corresponding project transactions or customer invoices.

This check box, when selected, 				enables a group of elements on the same form which you can use to report the total 				time spent on the activity. Also, by using this group of elements, you can mark the 				activity as billable and specify the information required for billing—that is, the 				amount of billable time and the earning type of the activity (for details, see  Case Billing).  If you want the  Track Time  check box to be selected by default 				for activities of certain types, you need to select the corresponding check boxes in 				the  Track Time  column on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR102000|CR102000]) Activity Types (CR102000) 				form.  Using Earning Types In  Acumatica ERP, you have to specify an earning type for each billable activity; the earning type 				determines how the system calculates the cost of employee labor. The system recognizes two classes of earning types: those defining standard working 				hours and those defining overtime. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP102000|EP102000]) Earning Types 				(EP102000) form, where you can add new earning types and adjust the available 				ones, you can also specify whether an earning type defines standard working hours or 				overtime by clearing or selecting the  Overtime  check box, 				respectively. On the same form, you can update the multiplier value for any overtime 				earning type—the system multiplies the employee rate by the multiplier value when 				calculating the cost of employee labor. For standard working hours, the multiplier 				is always  1 .  By default, the following earning types are available in the system: Regular Hours (RG) : Standard working hours whose cost is calculated based on the 					standard employee rate. Overtime (OT) : Overtime working hours whose cost is calculated by multiplying the 					standard rate by the value of the overtime multiplier. Public Holidays (HL) : Non-working hours of public holidays, which are non-billable. 					You can use this earning type to indicate that certain days included in the time 					card are public holidays when no work is done. Vacations (VL) : Non-working hours of vacations, which are also non-billable. You can 					use this earning type to indicate that the employee is not working due to 					vacation. Approving Activities A time activity can be associated with a project task that has an approver specified. If this 				is the case, the time activity must be approved before it can be released for 				billing. Either the project task approver or the project manager can approve the 				time activity. You can use the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP507010|EP507010]) Approve Time Activities (EP507010) form to approve activities that 				require your approval. If you use time cards, you can approve time activities in 				groups by approving time card summaries on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP507030|EP507030]) Approve Time Activity Summaries 				(EP507030) form. When the activities are released, the system tracks costs for specific customers, cases, 				contracts, or projects and generates the corresponding project transactions or 				customer invoices.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
To assist you with efficient billing, calculation of payroll, and estimation of project costs, Acumatica ERP provides the time card functionality. A time card is a weekly report on the time you have spent on each activity.{br}

By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_50_00|Employee Time Card] ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]) form, employees can enter new time cards or view, edit, or release existing time cards.{br}{TOC}
==Enabling Time Cards==
Time cards are available in Acumatica ERP only if the ''Advanced Financials'' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

By default, employees are not required to fill in time cards. However, if time cards are mandatory in your company, you can make them required on a per-employee basis by selecting the '''Time Card is Required''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form.{br}

Time cards are always generated successively, which means that you cannot generate a successive time card for a particular week if no time card has been generated for the preceding week.((({S:Warn}Suppose that the latest time card was generated for an employee a considerable time ago, and now you want to resume the generation of time cards for this employee, but you don&rsquo;t need any time cards for the intervening time interval. To generate multiple empty time cards for the intervening time interval, you can select the employee on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form and then, on the '''Employment History''' tab, click '''Generate Time Cards''' on the table toolbar.
)))
==Accessing Time Cards==
If your username you are signed in with is associated with an employee—that is, the employee has the username specified in the '''Employee Login''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]), on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_50_00|Employee Time Card] ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]) form, you can create, view, or adjust any of the following time cards:[anchor|#ul_mhf_xvd_jx]
*Your time cards
*Time cards of the employees for whom you are an appointed delegate
*Time cards of the employees who report to you
*Time cards of employees in the workgroups at lower levels in the company tree than your workgroup
((({S:Warn}If you create a time card for an employee that differs from the one that associated with your username you are signed in with, this employee also must have a username specified in the '''Employee Login''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees].
)))
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) form, you can access the following time cards:[anchor|#ul_rhy_tcy_r3]
*Those assigned to you 
*:((({S:Warn}You will be able to approve or reject these time cards but you will not be able to open them on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_50_00|Employee Time Card] form.
)))
*Those assigned to other users in your workgroup
*Those escalated from users in workgroups at a lower level in the company tree but in your workgroup&rsquo;s node
((({S:Warn}For more information about the company tree, see [HelpRoot_Organization\EP__con_Company_Organizational_Chart|Company Tree and Workgroups].
)))
==Processing Time Cards==
As a rule, each time card passes through several stages, which might include preparation, approval, and release. The processing stage of a time card is indicated by its status.
==Preparing Time Cards==
When preparing a time card, an employee reports work time by creating separate detail records for the following types of activities:[anchor|#ul_hmd_z2m_fq]
*Those associated with different projects or project tasks
*Those related to different earning types
*Those that are billable and those that are non-billable 

==Assigning Time Cards for Approval==
Depending on the company policy, time cards may need to be approved by authorized employees before they can be released. The time card approval functionality is available if the ''Approval Workflow'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

Time cards are assigned for approval automatically according to the assignment rules that are included in the assignment map, which you create on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_55_00|Assignment and Approval Maps] ([~/?ScreenId=EP205500|EP205500]) form. To apply these rules, you need to specify the created map as the time card approval map by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_10_10_00|Time and Expenses Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=EP101000|EP101000]) form; if no assignment map has been specified there or if a time card meets none of the specified map's conditions, the time card automatically becomes approved. {br}

The system assigns a time card for approval when the time card is completed and the employee changes its status from ''On Hold'' to ''Open''. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Organization\EP__con_Assignment_Automation|Managing Assignment and Approval Maps].
==Approving Time Cards==
A time card cannot be released until it has been approved (if approval is required). If you are an approver, you can approve time cards in bulk by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) form, or you can approve time cards one at a time by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_50_00|Employee Time Card] ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]) form.((({S:Warn}If the ''Time Reporting on Activity'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form, you cannot approve or release a time card unless all the activities included in the time card have been approved (if required). For more information, see [HelpRoot_Organization\EP__con_Time_Tracking|Time Activities].
)))
==Using Corrective Time Cards==
If a released time card doesn&rsquo;t reflect the actual time that the employee spent on activities during the week (for example, if the employee reported 40 hours instead of actual 45 hours), the employee can create a corrective time card by opening the released time card on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_50_00|Employee Time Card] ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]) and clicking '''Actions''' &gt; '''Correct''' on the form toolbar.{br}

The data from the original time card is copied to the corrective time card, which has ''Correction'' in the '''Type''' box and the reference number of the original time card in the '''Orig. Reg. Nbr.''' read-only box. The employee can adjust the data of the corrective time card as needed before submitting it for approval (if required). After that, the original time card, because it has been replaced by the corrective time card, is no longer available on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_40_60_00|Employee Time Cards] ([~/?ScreenId=EP406000|EP406000]) inquiry form.{br}

When the corrective time card is released, new transactions are generated for only the difference in the reported hours on this card as compared to the original time card.{br}

A released corrective time card can also be corrected.((({S:Warn}You can correct equipment time cards in a similar way by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_80_00|Equipment Time Card] ([~/?ScreenId=EP308000|EP308000]) form.
)))
==Combining Time Cards and Time Activities==
In Acumatica ERP, an employee can report working hours by using time cards in combination with time activities. The reported data from a time activity instantly becomes available in one of the employee&rsquo;s time cards. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_50_00|Employee Time Card] form, the employee can view details of all time activities associated with a particular time card.{br}

A time card can be approved only if all the activities associated with the time card have been approved. When the time card is released, the associated activities are released automatically. An activity cannot be released on its own if it is associated with a time card.{br}

A project transaction may be created during time card release if any of the activities included in the time card is associated with a project. (Alternatively, the same project transaction may be generated if the activity is associated with a billable case, and the case is billed directly to the customer before the time card is released. For details about direct case billing, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CR__con_Case_Billing|Case Billing].) Such transactions can be used for tracking the project costs. 
==Using Equipment Time Cards==
By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_80_00|Equipment Time Card] ([~/?ScreenId=EP308000|EP308000]) form, employees can enter equipment time cards or update existing ones, which gives them the ability to report the time they spend using particular equipment. The processing of equipment time cards is similar to the processing of employee time cards, including the usage of corrective time cards.{br}

Equipment time cards can be associated with specific projects and project tasks. Also, you can use the approval functionality to make sure that before they are released, equipment time cards are approved by the authorized approvers. You can specify the approval map for equipment time cards on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_10_10_00|Time and Expenses Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=EP101000|EP101000]) form; however, if you have not specified the assignment map or if a time card meets none of the specified map's conditions, the time card automatically becomes approved.

In Acumatica ERP, if the ''Time Reporting on Activity'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, any group of employees (which can be described as a ''crew'') can be defined as a workgroup and then used for group entry, approval, and release of time activities.{br}{TOC}
==Managing Crews==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_40_61|Company Tree] ([~/?ScreenId=EP204061|EP204061]) form, you can group employees—that is, all people in the organization with accounts defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form—by crew. A crew can be defined through a workgroup, which you can create in the '''Company Tree''' pane. {br}

You can add members to each workgroup by using the '''Workgroup Details''' pane. A workgroup may include permanent and temporary members. Also, when creating group time activities on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_71_00|Weekly Crew Time Entry] ([~/?ScreenId=EP307100|EP307100]) form, you can add to the list of crew members any employee registered in the system, which may be convenient if that employee also performed the same activities as the other members of the crew. This added employee is marked as an ad hoc member of the crew, which indicates that the user is not a member of the selected workgroup.
==Creating Crew Time Entries==
You can create multiple identical time activities for members of a crew by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_71_00|Weekly Crew Time Entry] form.{br}

In the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_71_00|Weekly Crew Time Entry] form, you can select a workgroup and a week for which you want to enter time activities. If needed, you can associate your time entry with a project and project task.{br}

On the '''Time Activities''' tab of the form, on the table toolbar, you can click the '''Add Row''' button to create a time activity for a particular member of the workgroup or click '''Enter Bulk Time''' to open the '''Bulk Time Entry''' dialog box, where you can enter time for the crew.{br}

Initially, the left pane of the '''Bulk Time Entry''' dialog box, all members of the workgroup selected in the Summary area of the form are listed. By using this pane, you can add ad hoc members to the list, if needed, and use the unlabeled check boxes to select the members of the crew for whom time activities are to be created. In the right pane, you can enter all necessary time activities performed by the selected members during the week selected in the Summary area of the form. When you click '''Add''' or '''Add and Close''' at the bottom of the dialog box, time activities identical to the time activities specified in the right pane of the dialog box will be created for each selected member of the crew.{br}

On the '''Crew Members''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_71_00|Weekly Crew Time Entry] form, you can review the reported work hours of the crew members, including ad hoc members, broken down by the days of the week. In the Summary area of the tab, the '''Workgroup Members''' counter shows the total number of the crew members, including ad hoc members, and the '''Members with Activities''' counter shows the total number of the crew members who have time activities reported for the selected week.
==Processing Crew Time Activities==
After time activities have been created in bulk for crew members, they can be processed as ordinary time activities can.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_70_00|Employee Time Activities] ([~/?ScreenId=EP307000|EP307000]) form, you can filter activities by workgroup and, if necessary, edit them if they have not been released yet.{br}

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Crew Time Reporting: General Information In  Acumatica ERP, if the  Time Reporting on Activity  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, any group of employees (which can be described         as a  crew ) can be defined as a workgroup and then used for group entry, approval, and         release of time activities. Managing Crews On the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP204061|EP204061]) Company Tree (EP204061) form, you can group         employees—that is, all people in the organization with accounts defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) Employees (EP203000) form—by crew. A crew can be defined         through a workgroup, which you can create in the  Company Tree  pane.  You can add members to each workgroup by using the  Workgroup Details          pane. A workgroup may include permanent and temporary members. Also, when creating group         time activities on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP307100|EP307100]) Weekly Crew Time Entry (EP307100) form, you can add to the         list of crew members any employee registered in the system, which may be convenient if that         employee also performed the same activities as the other members of the crew. This added         employee is marked as an ad hoc member of the crew, which indicates that the user is not a         member of the selected workgroup. Creating Crew Time Entries You can create multiple identical time activities for members of a crew by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP307100|EP307100]) Weekly Crew Time Entry form. In the Summary area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP307100|EP307100]) Weekly Crew Time Entry form, you can select a workgroup         and a week for which you want to enter time activities. If needed, you can associate your         time entry with a project and project task. On the  Time Activities  tab of the form, on the table toolbar, you         can click the  Add Row  button to create a time activity for a         particular member of the workgroup or click  Enter Bulk Time  to open         the  Bulk Time Entry  dialog box, where you can enter time for the         crew. Initially, the left pane of the  Bulk Time Entry  dialog box, all         members of the workgroup selected in the Summary area of the form are listed. By using this         pane, you can add ad hoc members to the list, if needed, and use the unlabeled check boxes         to select the members of the crew for whom time activities are to be created. In the right         pane, you can enter all necessary time activities performed by the selected members during         the week selected in the Summary area of the form. When you click  Add          or  Add and Close  at the bottom of the dialog box, time activities         identical to the time activities specified in the right pane of the dialog box will be         created for each selected member of the crew. On the  Crew Members  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP307100|EP307100]) Weekly Crew Time Entry form,         you can review the reported work hours of the crew members, including ad hoc members, broken         down by the days of the week. In the Summary area of the tab, the  Workgroup           Members  counter shows the total number of the crew members, including ad hoc         members, and the  Members with Activities  counter shows the total         number of the crew members who have time activities reported for the selected week. Processing Crew Time Activities After time activities have been created in bulk for crew members, they can be processed as         ordinary time activities can. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP307000|EP307000]) Employee Time Activities (EP307000) form, you can filter         activities by workgroup and, if necessary, edit them if they have not been released yet. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP507010|EP507010]) Approve Time Activities (EP507010) form, you can filter         activities by workgroup and then mass-approve them by clicking  Approve           All  on the form toolbar. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP507020|EP507020]) Release Time Activities (EP507020) form, you can filter         activities by workgroup and then mass-release them by clicking  Process           All  on the form toolbar. ]]></column>
