The ability to change your own password is useful, for example, when you suspect that your account is being accessed without your consent. For details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\User_Profile_Password_Change|To Change Your Password].[anchor|#_0acb9780-70df-45f9-8143-fd5f9f326a59]
==Recovering Your User Credentials==
If you use Acumatica ERP credentials to sign in to the system, your system administrator can allow you to recover your password and login. The recovery mechanism sends emails to the email address that is specified in your account information. For details about how to recover your credentials, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\Login_and_Logout__Recover_password|To Recover a Forgotten Password or a User Name].{br}

On the [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\SM_20_30_10|User Profile] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) form, you can specify a password recovery question, the answer to which you need to enter when you are recovering your password. With a password recovery question, you reduce a risk of hacking your user account. For a procedure, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Change_Password_Recovery_Question|To Specify Your Password Recovery Question].{br}

If you have forgetten your password from a domain account, you should contact your system administrator.{br}

If you have forgotten your password from an external identity account, you should use the password recovery tools of the external identity provider.

#On the configuration menu, click '''Collapse to Top'''. The main menu is displayed as the '''Menu''' button in the upper left corner of the screen, where the '''SweetLife''' logo was previously displayed.
#Click the '''Menu''' button to display the main menu panel again.
#Click [image:UserGuide/Images/GS_UI_main_menu_more_options_button.png|15px] to open the additional configuration menu.
#On the configuration menu, click '''Expand to Left'''. The expanded main menu is displayed left of the working area again. The '''SweetLife''' logo is again displayed in the top left of the screen.

Now that you have seen the different ways the main menu can be displayed, you can display it in ways that fit your working style and make changes as needed.
==Step 2: Viewing the Initial List of Workspaces==
To view on the main menu the initial list of workspaces, do the following:[anchor|#_5302cd10-8035-416b-af45-8cfaf5211719]
#Make sure that the main menu is expanded so that you can see the names of the menu items, which correspond to the names of predefined workspaces. 
#View the names of the workspaces that are displayed on the main menu, using the scroll bar on the left as needed to see all of them. By default, on the main menu, you can see the following menu items:
#*'''Favorites'''
#* '''Data Views'''
#* '''Time and Expenses'''
#* '''Banking'''
#* '''Projects'''
#* '''Payables'''
#* '''Receivables'''
#* '''Sales Orders'''
#* '''Purchases'''
#* '''Inventory'''
#* '''More Items'''

You can click any of these menu items to view the workspace and become familiar with its content, as you will do in the next step. This will give you an idea of which workspaces might be most suitable to your job tasks.
==Step 3: Exploring a Workspace==
Suppose that you would like to explore the menu items that are related to sales orders, which are organized in the '''Sales Orders '''workspace. These items are most commonly used forms and reports, but may also be dashboards, pivot tables, and generic inquiries.{br}

To explore the '''Sales Orders ''' workspace, do the following:[anchor|#_b5831ef6-2002-4522-9869-f333f170dcfc]
#On the main menu, click the '''Sales Orders''' menu item. Over the working area, the '''Sales Orders''' workspace opens. View the elements of the workspace: the title, the tiles in the workspace, the categories, the links to menu items within the categories, and the workspace view that is currently being displayed. If the quick workspace view is displayed, you can see the '''Show All''' button on the workspace footer, and if the full workspace view is displayed, you can see the '''Show Less''' button on the workspace footer,
#In the '''Transactions''' category, click the ''Invoices'' link to open the form. The list of invoices opens.
#On the main menu, click the '''Sales Orders''' menu item to return to the '''Sales Orders''' workspace.
#On the workspace footer, click the '''Show All''' button to view all the links to menu items within the categories that can be displayed in the workspace.
#Click the '''Show Less''' button to return to the quick view of the workspace,
#On the workspace title bar, click the '''Close Workspace''' ([image:UserGuide/Images/GS_UI_workspace_titlebar_close_button.png|15px]) button to close the '''Sales Orders''' workspace.

You have explored the '''Sales Orders''' workspace to get an idea of what it contains and how you can open a form listed in it.
==Step 4: Configuring the Quick Menu of a Workspace==
Suppose that your job responsibilities include analyzing sales profitability and you need to regularly use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_40_90_00|Sales Profitability Analysis ] ([~/?ScreenId=AR409000|AR409000]) report. The predefined quick view of the '''Sales Orders''' workspace does not include the link to this report.{br}

To add the link to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_40_90_00|Sales Profitability Analysis ] report to the quick view of the '''Sales Orders''' workspace, do the following:[anchor|#_e2c96afc-c791-455e-857b-17239d245c69]
#On the main menu, click '''Sales Orders''' to open the '''Sales Orders''' workspace.
#On the workspace title bar, click the '''Configure Quick Menu''' ([image:UserGuide/Images/GS_UI_workspace_configure_quick_menu_button.png|15px]) button. The workspace opens in configuration mode: you can see the '''Sales Orders: Configuration''' title of the workspace and check boxes left of the links to menu items, such as forms, reports, and dashboards, that are available in the workspace.
#In the '''Reports''' category, select the check box left of the link to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_40_90_00|Sales Profitability Analysis ] report.
#On the workspace title bar, click the '''Exit''' button. The '''Sales Orders''' workspace opens in view mode again. Each time you open this workspace, in the '''Reports''' category, you will see the link to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_40_90_00|Sales Profitability Analysis ] report.

You have added the link to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_40_90_00|Sales Profitability Analysis ] report to the quick view of the '''Sales Orders''' workspace and you do not need to switch to the full view to open this report.
==Step 5: Adding a Predefined Workspace to the Main Menu==
Suppose that your job responsibilities as sales manager include registration and tracking of customer requests, and providing feedback to the customers. For example, you often need to quickly access the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_00|Cases] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306000|CR306000]) form to create, check, or update cases. This form and others related to cases are available in the '''Support''' workspace, which is a predefined workspace in Acumatica ERP but not one that is initially among the menu items listed on the main menu.{br}

To add the '''Support''' workspace to the main menu, do the following:[anchor|#_9ff9151b-eb84-4112-ad23-bef4ce6f2686]
#On the main menu, click the '''More Items''' menu item. The system displays over the working area a menu of the form with tiles for each of the workspaces in the system, grouped by their broader functional areas.
#Point at the '''Support''' tile (under '''Operations'''), and click the Pin ([image:UserGuide/Images/GS_UI_pin_button.png|15px]) button. The '''Support''' menu item is added (that is, pinned) to the main menu.
#On the main menu, click the '''Support''' menu item. Over the working area, the '''Support ''' workspace opens: the links that are related to support are displayed.

You have added the '''Support''' menu item to the main menu.
==Step 6: Removing a Workspace from the Main Menu==
Suppose that your job responsibilities do not include working with projects and you do not need the '''Projects''' menu item on your main menu. You can remove the '''Projects''' menu item from the main menu. It will still be available if you click '''More Items''', and your changes will not affect other users&rsquo; view of the main menu.{br}

To remove the '''Projects''' workspace from the main menu, do the following:[anchor|#_6f9f097d-2d58-4199-b022-e2f38a3db75c]
#On the main menu, click the '''Projects''' menu item. The '''Projects''' workspace opens over the working area.
#On the workspace title bar, click the '''Unpin From Main Menu Panel''' ([image:UserGuide/Images/GS_UI_unpin_button.png|15px]) button. On the main menu, notice that the '''Projects''' menu item is no longer displayed.
#On the workspace title bar of the '''Projects''' workspace, click the '''Close Workspace''' ([image:UserGuide/Images/GS_UI_workspace_titlebar_close_button.png|15px]) button to close the workspace.

You have removed the '''Projects''' menu item from the main menu.
==Step 7: Exploring the Universal Search Capabilities in Acumatica ERP==
Suppose that you would like to explore all the forms and files in Acumatica ERP that may contain information about customers, as well as the list of Help topics related to customers.{br}

To search for information related to customers, do the following:[anchor|#_b08e274a-4c1a-40f5-9ead-8859226c9291]
#In the Search box, located in the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, type <tt>customer</tt>. The Search form opens. On the '''Menu Items''' tab, scan the menu items that have the ''customer'' keyword in their names; if you point at any of the items&rsquo; names, the identifier (ID) of the item is also shown (for example, if in the '''Profiles''' category, you point at the''' Customers''' menu item, you can see the ''AR3030PL'' ID).
#:((({S:Hint}In this context, ''menu item'' refers to any item for which a link can be included in a workspace: a form, a report, a dashboard, a generic inquiry, or a pivot table.
)))
#On the '''Transactions and Profiles''' tab, scan the list of transactions and customer profiles that contain the ''customer'' keyword.
#:((({S:Warn}If the '''Transactions and Profiles''' tab does not contain any search results, make sure that the full-text search index for your Acumatica ERP instance has been built. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Search_indexes_update|To Build Search Indexes].
)))
#On the '''Help Topics''' tab, scan the list of the Help topics that contain the ''customer'' keyword. 
#On the '''Files''' tab, scan the list of the files that have the ''customer'' keyword in their names.
#In the upper right corner, click the Close Workspace button to close the Search form.

You have explored the types of information that you can find by using the universal search capabilities in Acumatica ERP and the way you perform this search.
==Step 8: Exploring the Built-In Help System==
Suppose that you will be creating sales orders. You open an existing sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form to become familiar with the form layout and the information that is included, and you are wondering how to correctly fill in the '''Requested On''' box of the form.{br}

To locate the information by using the Help menu and the Help system, do the following:[anchor|#_93cf5ef3-4cfb-4b46-b00c-2c26faa26367]
#On the main menu, click '''Sales Orders'''. The '''Sales Orders''' workspace opens.
#In the '''Transactions''' category, click '''Sales Orders'''. The list of sales orders opens.
#In the '''Order Nbr.''' column, click any link to open a sales order. The [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form opens with the sales order you selected.
#In the top pane of the screen, click the '''Open Help''' button. The Help menu opens, displaying links to Help topics that are related to sales orders.
#In the '''Form Reference''' section of the Help menu, click ''Sales Orders (SO301000)'' to search for details about the '''Requested On''' box of the form. The [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] Help topic opens in a new tab of the web browser.
#In the table of contents of the topic, click the link for the ''Summary Area'' section of the topic, which corresponds to the part of the form with the box.
#In the section, read the description of the '''Requested On''' element.

You have found out the information about the expected setting in the '''Requested On''' box of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form.]]></column>
			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Learning About the  Acumatica ERP UI: Process Activity The following activity will help you identify the basic elements of the  Acumatica ERP user interface and use these elements to navigate through the system. Story Suppose that you are David Chubb, a new sales manager of the SweetLife Fruits &                 Jams company. You have signed in to your  Acumatica ERP instance for the first time and you would like to become familiar with the UI                 before you start setting up your working environment to meet your preferences. Prerequisites You should learn how to sign in to  Acumatica ERP; you need to be signed in to gain hands-on familiarity with the user interface.                 For details, see  Accessing Acumatica ERP: Process Activity. Process Overview When you have signed in to  Acumatica ERP, you should do the following: View the basic UI elements Explore the main menu Explore the workspaces Search for the information related to customers in  Acumatica ERPExplore the Help system System Preparation Before you start getting familiar with the basic elements of  Acumatica ERP, make sure that the following tasks have been performed: You have installed an  Acumatica ERP instance with the  U100  data set, or a system administrator has                     performed this task for you. A system administrator has built the full-text search index for your  Acumatica ERP instance, if applicable. For details, see  To Build Search Indexes. You have signed in to  Acumatica ERP with the following credentials: User name:  chubb Password:  123 For details, see  Accessing Acumatica ERP: Process Activity. Step 1: Exploring the Main Menu and                 the Ways to Display It On the left side of the  Acumatica ERP screen, you can see the main menu and its menu items, each of which represents a                 functional area of the system. Suppose that you would like to experiment with ways                 you can place the main menu on the screen, to see which fits your preferences. To change the appearance of the main menu                 in various ways, do the following: In the lower part of the main menu, click                                               (the  Collapse Main Menu Panel  button) to hide the names                     of the main menu items.  With the main menu collapsed, notice that there is                         more space for the main area on the screen. This can be a beneficial way to                         display the main menu for users who are familiar with the icons of the main                         menu and would rather view a larger working area. Click                                               (the  Expand Main Menu Panel  button) to show the names of                     the main menu items and an expanded main menu panel again. Click                                               (the  Open Configuration Menu  button) to open the                     additional configuration menu. On the configuration menu, click  Collapse to Top . The                     main menu is displayed as the  Menu  button in the upper                     left corner of the screen, where the  SweetLife  logo was                     previously displayed. Click the  Menu  button to display the main menu panel                     again. Click                                               to open the additional configuration menu. On the configuration menu, click  Expand to Left . The                     expanded main menu is displayed left of the working area again. The                          SweetLife  logo is again displayed in the top left of                     the screen. Now that you have seen the different ways the main menu can be displayed, you can                 display it in ways that fit your working style and make changes as needed. Step 2: Viewing the Initial List of Workspaces To view on the main menu the initial list of workspaces, do the following: Make sure that the main menu is expanded so that you can see the names of the                     menu items, which correspond to the names of predefined workspaces.  View the names of the workspaces that are displayed on the main menu, using the                     scroll bar on the left as needed to see all of them. By default, on the main                     menu, you can see the following menu items: Favorites Data                                  Views Time and Expenses Banking Projects Payables Receivables Sales Orders Purchases Inventory More Items You can click any of these menu items to view the workspace and become familiar with                 its content, as you will do in the next step. This will give you an idea of which                 workspaces might be most suitable to your job tasks. Step 3: Exploring a                  Workspace Suppose that you would like to explore the menu items that are related to sales                 orders, which are organized in the  Sales Orders  workspace.                 These items are most commonly used forms and reports, but may also be dashboards,                 pivot tables, and generic inquiries. To explore the  Sales Orders   workspace, do the following: On the main menu, click the  Sales Orders  menu item. Over                     the working area, the  Sales Orders  workspace opens. View                     the elements of the workspace: the title, the tiles in the workspace, the                     categories, the links to menu items within the categories, and the workspace                     view that is currently being displayed. If the quick workspace view is                     displayed, you can see the  Show All  button on the                     workspace footer, and if the full workspace view is displayed, you can see the                          Show Less  button on the workspace footer, In the  Transactions  category, click the  Invoices                      link to open the form.                      The                     list of invoices  opens. On the main menu, click the  Sales Orders  menu item to                     return to the  Sales Orders  workspace. On the workspace footer, click the  Show All  button to                     view all the links to menu items within the categories that can be displayed in                     the workspace. Click the  Show Less  button to return to the quick view of                     the workspace, On the workspace title bar, click the  Close Workspace                          ( )                     button to close the  Sales Orders  workspace. You have explored the  Sales Orders  workspace to get an idea of                 what it contains and how you can open a form listed in it. Step 4: Configuring the Quick Menu of a Workspace Suppose that your job responsibilities include analyzing sales profitability and you                 need to regularly use the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR409000|AR409000]) Sales Profitability Analysis  (AR409000) report. The                 predefined quick view of the  Sales Orders  workspace does not                 include the link to this report. To add the link to the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR409000|AR409000]) Sales Profitability Analysis  report to the quick view of                 the  Sales Orders  workspace, do the following: On the main menu, click  Sales Orders  to open the                          Sales Orders  workspace. On the workspace title bar, click the  Configure Quick                         Menu                          ( )                     button. The workspace opens in configuration mode: you can see the                          Sales Orders: Configuration  title of the workspace                     and check boxes left of the links to menu items, such as forms, reports, and                     dashboards, that are available in the workspace. In the  Reports  category, select the check box left of the                     link to the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR409000|AR409000]) Sales Profitability Analysis  report. On the workspace title bar, click the  Exit  button. The                          Sales Orders  workspace opens in view mode again. Each                     time you open this workspace, in the  Reports  category,                     you will see the link to the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR409000|AR409000]) Sales Profitability Analysis  report. You have added the link to the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR409000|AR409000]) Sales Profitability Analysis  report to the quick                 view of the  Sales Orders  workspace and you do not need to                 switch to the full view to open this report. Step 5: Adding a Predefined Workspace to the Main Menu Suppose that your job responsibilities as sales manager include registration and                 tracking of customer requests, and providing feedback to the customers. For example,                 you often need to quickly access the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR306000|CR306000]) Cases (CR306000) form                 to create, check, or update cases. This form and others related to cases are                 available in the  Support  workspace, which is a predefined                 workspace in  Acumatica ERP but not one that is initially among the menu items listed on the main menu. To add the  Support  workspace to the main menu, do the                 following: On the main menu, click the  More Items  menu item. The                     system displays over the working area a menu of the form with tiles for each of                     the workspaces in the system, grouped by their broader functional areas. Point at the  Support  tile (under                          Operations ), and click the Pin                         ( ) button. The                          Support  menu item is added (that is, pinned) to the                     main menu. On the main menu, click the  Support  menu item. Over the                     working area, the  Support   workspace opens: the links                     that are related to support are displayed. You have added the  Support  menu item to the main menu. Step 6: Removing a Workspace from the Main Menu Suppose that your job responsibilities do not include working with projects and you                 do not need the  Projects  menu item on your main menu. You can                 remove the  Projects  menu item from the main menu. It will                 still be available if you click  More Items , and your changes                 will not affect other users' view of the main menu. To remove the  Projects  workspace from the main menu, do the                 following: On the main menu, click the  Projects  menu item. The                          Projects  workspace opens over the working area. On the workspace title bar, click the  Unpin From Main Menu                         Panel                          ( ) button. On                     the main menu, notice that the  Projects  menu item is no                     longer displayed. On the workspace title bar of the  Projects  workspace,                     click the  Close Workspace                          ( )                     button to close the workspace. You have removed the  Projects  menu item from the main                 menu. Step 7: Exploring the Universal Search Capabilities in  Acumatica ERPSuppose that you would like to explore all the forms and files in  Acumatica ERP that may contain information about customers, as well as the list of Help topics                 related to customers. To search for information related to customers, do the following: In the Search box, located in the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP screen, type  customer .                      The                     Search form  opens. On the  Menu Items                      tab, scan the menu items that have the  customer  keyword in their names;                     if you point at any of the items' names, the identifier (ID) of the item is also                     shown (for example, if in the  Profiles  category, you                     point at the  Customers  menu item, you can see the                          AR3030PL  ID). In this context,  menu item                          refers to any item for which a link can be included in a workspace: a form,                         a report, a dashboard, a generic inquiry, or a pivot table. On the  Transactions and Profiles  tab, scan the list of                     transactions and customer profiles that contain the  customer                          keyword. If the  Transactions and                             Profiles  tab does not contain any search results, make sure                         that the full-text search index for your  Acumatica ERP instance has been built. For details, see  To Build Search Indexes. On the  Help Topics  tab, scan the list of the Help topics                     that contain the  customer  keyword.  On the  Files  tab, scan the list of the files that have                     the  customer  keyword in their names. In the upper right corner, click the Close Workspace button to close the Search                     form. You have explored the types of information that you can find by using the universal                 search capabilities in  Acumatica ERP and the way you perform this search. Step 8: Exploring the Built-In Help System Suppose that you will be creating sales orders. You open an existing sales order on                 the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form to become familiar with the form                 layout and the information that is included, and you are wondering how to correctly                 fill in the  Requested On  box of the form. To locate the information by using the Help menu and the Help system, do the                 following: On the main menu, click  Sales Orders . The                          Sales Orders  workspace opens. In the  Transactions  category, click  Sales                         Orders . The list of sales orders opens. In the  Order Nbr.  column, click any link to open a sales                     order. The   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form opens with the sales                     order you selected. In the top pane of the screen, click the  Open Help                      button. The Help menu opens, displaying links to Help topics that are related to                     sales orders. In the  Form Reference  section of the Help menu, click                          Sales Orders (SO301000)  to search for details about the                          Requested On  box of the form. The   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders Help topic opens in a new tab of the web                     browser. In the table of contents of the topic, click the link for the  Summary                         Area  section of the topic, which corresponds to the part of the form                     with the box. In the section, read the description of the  Requested On                      element. You have found out the information about the expected setting in the                      Requested On  box of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders                 (SO301000) form. ]]></column>

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[In the following sections, you will get to know how the Acumatica ERP universal search capabilities help you find needed information.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#_7bb4f8c9-e39a-4ee1-ae6a-1e6f82497bbd]
*Search for a profile, such as a customer or stock item record defined in the system
*Search for a specific menu item, such as a form of any type or a report
*Search for a specific transaction, such as an invoice or a GL (General Ledger) transaction
*Search for a file attached to a record
*Search for a Help topic

==Applicable Scenarios==
You search across the system for specific data in any of the following cases:[anchor|#_b0409713-07fd-4366-aa10-49cb8feee9cd]
*You need to quickly find a form or report by its name or ID (identifier).
*You need to find a dashboard.
*You need to find a particular transaction or profile created in the system by its reference number or keyword, such as customer name.
*You need to look up the information about a particular Acumatica ERP record in a Help topic.
*You need to find a particular file attached to a record.

==Universal Search==
With the Acumatica ERP universal search, you can quickly find particular data in the system.{br}

The Search box is located in the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen. When you type a keyword or phrase in the Search box (or copy the keyword or phrase and paste it into the box), the results found in the system may include any of the following:[anchor|#_d6e582be-e043-44ef-ae66-1b002c29e56e]
*Menu items, such as forms, reports, dashboards, pivot tables, and generic inquiries
*Help topics
*Files and notes attached to system records
*Transactions
*Documents
*Profiles, such as vendors, customers, prospects, employees, leads, and cases

You can also search for a form or report by its title or ID.{br}

((({S:Hint}You can find a form or report by using the Search box, if the link to this particular form or report has been added to any of the workspaces. If you cannot find the form that you need for your work, contact a system administrator.
))){br}

The system searches for all matches of the keyword or phrase that you have entered in the Search box. On the tabs of the Search form, the system then lists all the search results that contain at least one match of the keyword or phrase. {br}

The system narrows the search results based on your access rights. If you do not have access rights to particular data (such as vendor accounts), the data does not appear in the search results, even though the results match the search criteria. Your access rights to files that are attached to records are determined by your access rights to these records and to the forms where these records are created.
==Search Form=={br}

To start a search, you type a keyword or phrase in the Search box or copy the keyword or phrase and paste it into the box. The system opens the Search form. The Search form overlaps the form, report or dashboard that is opened in the working area when you start your search. The following screenshot shows the basic elements of the Search form.[anchor|#_a6dc839f-fd25-4025-9684-2be3481976fa][anchor|#_f12a9291-4988-40af-815d-91c70c45fb3c][image:UserGuide/Images/GS_searching_search_form.png|popup|Search form|450px][anchor|#_e7f51a99-5c34-413b-b518-c71ee85b9aae]
#The tabs of the Search form, which are described in the next section
#The search results for the selected tab
#The Close button; when you close the Search form, you go back to the form, report, or dashboard that was opened when you started your search

==Tabs of the Search Form==
When you type your search string in the Search box, the system displays the search results on the following tabs of the Search form:[anchor|#_00256278-6db5-488b-9ea9-9a24b0fac425]
*'''Menu Items''': On this tab, you can view the links to forms or reports with the search string in their name or ID.
*'''Transactions and Profiles''': On this tab, you can view the following:
**If the search string you type is a reference number or ID, the list of documents and transactions—such as invoices, sales orders, journal transactions, and shipments—identified by the reference number or ID. Entering a reference number or ID is the only way you can find a particular document through the Search form.
**If the search string you type is a keyword, partial keyword, or phrase, the list of profiles—such as customers, employees, companies, and stock items—with the search string in their names. Also, the descriptions of  transactions and profiles are searched for the search strings and transactions are listed on this tab if their descriptions contain the search string.
*'''Help Topics''': This tab lists Help topics of the Help system that contain the search string in their name or content. You can click the link to a Help topic to open the topic in a new browser tab.
*'''Files''': On this tab, you can view the list of the files attached to records that contain the search string in their name.

*The name of the form, such as ''Sales Orders'', ''Customers'', or ''Employees''
*The form ID, such as ''SO301000'', ''AR303000'', or ''EP203000''

On the '''Menu Items''' tab of the Search form, the system displays the link to the list of the records (such as sales orders, customers, or employees) that have been created using the data entry form whose name or ID you typed.((({S:Hint}To open a particular record, in the list of records, you click the ID of the record. If a list of record contains more than one page, you should first search for the record you need and then click the ID of the record.

==Story==
Suppose that you are David Chubb, a new sales manager of the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company. Your colleague who works with the customer FourStar Coffee & Sweets Shop has gone on vacation. Your manager called you and asked for some information on the customer and suggested that you use “the Customer History Summary report”. You are not yet familiar with this report.{br}

You need to find out the following information about FourStar Coffee & Sweets Shop:[anchor|#_4aaffe31-2dd0-4755-9362-d1069cba89f3]
*The customer address
*The invoice with the largest amount for goods sold in January 2020
*The status of the invoice with the reference number ''000064''

*The data presented in the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\AR_65_21_00|Customer History Summary] ([~/?ScreenId=AR652100|AR652100]) report

==Process Overview==
In this process activity, you will do the following:[anchor|#_da25f6bd-eafd-455a-b199-7a84790947e4]
#Conduct your first search and view the search results
#Search for a customer profile by the name of the customer
#Search for a record in a list of records
#Search for the invoice by its reference number
#Search for a file that is attached to a sales order
#Search for the information in a Help topic 

==System Preparation==
Before you start searching for the needed information in Acumatica ERP, make sure that the following tasks have been performed:[anchor|#_e5a88d9d-f3eb-4ea9-9977-46523d0e1427]
*You have installed an Acumatica ERP instance with the ''U100'' dataset, or a system administrator has performed this task for you.

==Step 1: Conducting a Search==
Suppose that you want to practice conducting a search, to become familiar with the steps involved. {br}

To conduct a search for the word ''employee'', do the following:[anchor|#_96bb7f3a-3d1f-4d2b-8ad9-b1f5eb2d1a4c]
#In the Search box, type <tt>employee</tt>. You may need to wait for a moment until the system completes the search. When the search is complete, the '''Menu Items''' tab of the Search form opens with the search results.
#:((({S:Hint}When you type a keyword or phrase in the Search box (or copy it into the box), you should not select Enter. Selecting Enter results in the system switching to the next tab of the Search form (the '''Transactions and Profiles''' tab). This may be inconvenient if you are searching for a form, report, or dashboard because these search results are displayed on the '''Menu Items''' tab of the Search form, which opens by default if you do not select Enter.
)))
#View the search results, if any, on the various tabs. The Search form displays the following information:
#*On the '''Menu Items''' tab, forms and reports that have the ''employee'' keyword in their names
#*On the '''Transactions and Profiles''' tab, records that have the ''employee'' keyword in their names and descriptions and notes (attached to records)
#*On the '''Help Topics''' tab, Help topics that have the ''employee'' keyword in their names or their content
#*On the '''Files''' tab, files that have the ''employee'' keyword in their names
#*:((({S:Hint}[anchor|#_b663328e-0b67-4958-b91a-672ac1f5731e]
*When you click a particular link on the '''Menu Items''', '''Transactions and Profiles''' or '''Files''' tab, a form opens. If you would like to again view your search results, you should start the search again. When you click a particular link on the '''Help Topics''' tab, a Help topic opens in a new browser tab.
*For documents, transactions, profiles, Help topics, and files, if the list of the search results is longer than one page, you can see the '''Next''' button at the lower part of the Search form.
)))

==Step 2: Searching for a Customer Profile==
To search for a customer profile, do the following:[anchor|#_9ff9151b-eb84-4112-ad23-bef4ce6f2686]
#In the Search box, type <tt>fourstar</tt>. The Search form opens.
#On the '''Transactions and Profiles''' tab, click ''Customer: FourStar Coffee & Sweets Shop''. The [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form opens with this customer selected. 
#On the '''General Info''' tab of the form, find the '''Main Address''' section. You can view the customer address here.

==Step 3: Searching for a Record in a List of Records==
To search for an invoice in the list of invoices, do the following:[anchor|#_8772dd79-8121-44f4-9f88-8b0609fd1475]
#In the Search box, type <tt>SO303000</tt>, which is the ID of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form. The Search form opens.
#In the '''Transactions''' category of the '''Menu Items''' tab, click ''Invoices''. The list of invoices that have been created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] form opens with this invoice selected.
#In the '''Customer''' column, click any row that has the value ''COFFEESHOP''.
#Select Shift+F to display the invoices with ''COFFEESHOP'' in the '''Customer''' column.
#In the list of the invoices for FourStar Coffee & Sweets Shop, notice the highest amount in the '''Amount''' column and the date in January 2020.

==Step 4: Searching for an Invoice by Its Reference Number==
To search for the needed invoice by its reference number, do the following:[anchor|#_12d3339d-f8aa-4606-8fa8-c2645bbabefa]
#In the Search box, type <tt>000064</tt>. The Search form opens.
#On the '''Transactions and Profiles''' tab, click ''Invoice: 000064 - FourStar Coffee & Sweets Shop''. The [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form opens. In the Summary area (which is located under the form title bar and the form toolbar), notice the value in the '''Status''' box: ''Closed''.

You can search for any document or transaction by its reference number in this way.
==Step 5: Searching for a File Attached to a Record==
Now you need to search for the scanned purchase order from ''FourStar Coffee & Sweets Shop'', which is attached to the sales order with the reference number ''000063''.{br}

To search for a file attached to a record, do the following:[anchor|#_17a353ed-6512-4ade-a05e-4d75590c0161]
#In the Search box, type <tt>000063</tt>. The Search form opens.
#On the '''Files''' tab, click ''Sales Orders (IN 000063)\PO&#95;Four&#95;Stars&#95;Coffee&#95;Sweets&#95;Shop.pdf''. The [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_10|File Maintenance] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202510|SM202510]) form opens with this file selected. Notice that one version of the file is listed in the table of the form.
#On the table toolbar, click '''View Selected Version'''. The file is downloaded to your computer. 
#:((({S:Hint}If multiple versions of the file are listed, you need to first click the row with the needed version.
)))
#Open the file and view the details. As mentioned, you need to find the date and number of this scanned purchase order.

==Step 6: Searching for a Help Topic==
Suppose that you need to run the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\AR_65_21_00|Customer History Summary] ([~/?ScreenId=AR652100|AR652100]) report on the customer ''FourStar Coffee & Sweets Shop''. Before running this report, you want to find the description of the report as a whole and the parameters you select before running the report.{br}

To search for this Help topic, do the following:[anchor|#_6f38c86b-7d5d-4b2d-a662-b7d6af8c00fa]
#In the Search box, type <tt>customer history summary</tt>. The Search form opens.
#On the '''Help Topics''' tab, click the ''Customer History Summary'' link.
#:((({S:Warn}Do not click the link with the report name followed by its number (''Customer History Summary'' (AR652100)); this link contains a list of links related to the report rather than being the report reference topic.
)))The report reference Help topic for the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\AR_65_21_00|Customer History Summary] ([~/?ScreenId=AR652100|AR652100]) report opens in a new browser tab. You can read about the description and parameters of the report.

You need to find out the following information about FourStar Coffee & Sweets                 Shop: The customer address The invoice with the largest amount for goods sold in January  2020The status of the invoice with the reference number  000064 The date and number of the customer's scanned purchase order (a file), which the                     sales order  000063  is based on The data presented in the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR652100|AR652100]) Customer History Summary (AR652100) report Process Overview In this process activity, you will do the following: Conduct your first search and view the search results Search for a customer profile by the name of the customer Search for a record in a list of records Search for the invoice by its reference number Search for a file that is attached to a sales order Search for the information in a Help topic  System Preparation Before you start searching for the needed information in  Acumatica ERP, make sure that the following tasks have been performed: You have installed an  Acumatica ERP instance with the  U100  dataset, or a system administrator has                     performed this task for you. A system administrator has built the full-text search index for your  Acumatica ERP instance, if applicable. For details, see  To Build Search Indexes. You have signed in to  Acumatica ERP with the following credentials: User name:  chubb Password:  123 For details, see  Accessing Acumatica ERP: Process Activity. Step 1: Conducting a Search Suppose that you want to practice conducting a search, to become familiar with the                 steps involved.  To conduct a search for the word  employee , do the following: In the Search box, type  employee . You may need to wait                     for a moment until the system completes the search.                      When                     the search is complete, the  Menu Items  tab of the Search                     form opens with the search results. When you type a keyword or             phrase in the Search box (or copy it into the box), you should not select Enter.             Selecting Enter results in the system switching to the next tab of the Search form (the                  Transactions and Profiles              tab ).             This may be inconvenient if you are searching for a form, report, or dashboard because             these search results are displayed on the  Menu Items  tab of the             Search form, which opens by default if you do not select Enter. View the search results, if any, on the various tabs. The Search form displays                     the following information: On the  Menu Items  tab, forms and reports that                             have the  employee  keyword                              in                             their names On the  Transactions and Profiles  tab, records                             that have the  employee  keyword in their names and descriptions                             and notes (attached to records) On the  Help Topics  tab, Help topics that have the                                  employee  keyword in their names or their content On the  Files  tab,                              files                              that have the  employee  keyword in their                                 names When you click a particular link on the  Menu                                             Items ,  Transactions and                                             Profiles  or  Files                                          tab, a form opens. If you would like to again view your                                         search results, you should start the search again. When you                                         click a particular link on the  Help                                             Topics  tab, a Help topic opens in a new                                         browser tab. For documents, transactions,                                          profiles ,                                         Help topics, and files, if the list of the search results is                                         longer than one page, you can see the                                              Next  button at the lower part of                                         the Search form. Step 2: Searching for a Customer Profile To search for a customer profile, do the following: In the Search box, type  fourstar . The Search form                     opens. On the  Transactions and Profiles  tab, click  Customer:                         FourStar Coffee & Sweets Shop . The   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers                     (AR303000) form opens with this customer selected.  On the  General Info  tab of the form, find the                          Main Address  section. You can view the customer                     address here. Step 3: Searching for a Record in a List of Records To search for an invoice in the list of invoices, do the following: In the Search box, type  SO303000 , which is the ID of the                           ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form. The Search form opens. In the  Transactions  category of the  Menu                         Items  tab, click  Invoices . The list of invoices that have                     been created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices form opens with this invoice                     selected. In the  Customer  column, click any row that has the value                          COFFEESHOP . Select Shift+F to display the invoices with  COFFEESHOP  in the                          Customer  column. In the list of the invoices for FourStar Coffee & Sweets Shop, notice the                     highest amount in the  Amount  column and the date in                     January  2020. Step 4: Searching for an Invoice by Its Reference Number To search for the needed invoice by its reference number, do the following: In the Search box, type  000064 . The Search form                     opens. On the  Transactions and Profiles  tab, click  Invoice:                         000064 - FourStar Coffee & Sweets Shop . The   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form opens. In the Summary area (which                     is located under the form title bar and the form toolbar), notice the value in                     the  Status  box:  Closed . You can search for any document or transaction by its reference number in this                 way. Step 5: Searching for a File Attached to a Record Now you need to search for the scanned purchase order from  FourStar Coffee &                     Sweets Shop , which is attached to the sales order with the reference number                      000063 . To search for a file attached to a record, do the following: In the Search box, type  000063 . The Search form                     opens. On the  Files  tab, click  Sales Orders (IN                         000063)\PO_Four_Stars_Coffee_Sweets_Shop.pdf . The   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202510|SM202510]) File Maintenance (SM202510) form opens with this file selected.                     Notice that one version of the file is listed in the table of the form. On the table toolbar, click  View Selected Version . The                     file is downloaded to your computer.  If multiple versions of                         the file are listed, you need to first click the row with the needed                         version. Open the file and view the details. As mentioned, you need to find the date and                     number of this scanned purchase order. Step 6: Searching for a Help Topic Suppose that you need to run the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR652100|AR652100]) Customer History Summary (AR652100) report on                 the customer  FourStar Coffee & Sweets Shop . Before running this report,                 you want to find the description of the report as a whole and the parameters you                 select before running the report. To search for this Help topic, do the following: In the Search box, type  customer history summary . The                     Search form opens. On the  Help Topics  tab, click the  Customer History                         Summary                          link. Do not click the link with the report name followed by its                         number ( Customer History Summary  (AR652100)); this link contains a                         list of links related to the report rather than being the report reference                         topic. The report reference Help                      topic                      for the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR652100|AR652100]) Customer History Summary (AR652100) report opens in a new browser                     tab. You can read about the description and parameters of the report. ]]></column>

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[In the following sections, you will find information about filtering and sorting of data in Acumatica ERP.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#_7bb4f8c9-e39a-4ee1-ae6a-1e6f82497bbd]
*Recognize the types of filters
*Recall the details of the sorting capabilities
*Identify the basic elements of the filtering area
*Create a simple filter
*Make a quick filter your default filter
*Create a quick filter
*Delete a quick filter

==Applicable Scenarios==
You use filters in either of the following cases:[anchor|#_b0409713-07fd-4366-aa10-49cb8feee9cd]
*You need to quickly select data according to particular criteria.
*You need to work on a regular basis with data that is selected according to particular criteria.

==Filters in Acumatica ERP==
When you work with large amounts of data, filtering is a crucial capability of the system that you can use to view and process the data. In Acumatica ERP, you can create and save filters that meet your needs. You can filter data in various forms and reports. For details on using filters in reports, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\Working_With_Reports_Mapref|Working with Reports].{br}

All Acumatica ERP filters are form-specific, which means that if a filter is set up for one form, you cannot apply it to another form.{br}

Acumatica ERP provides the following types of filters (which are described in the remaining sections of this topic):[anchor|#_dd48f89e-21a1-4576-8036-03592a00fd68]
*Simple filter
*Quick filter
*Advanced filter
*Ad hoc filter

A shared filter is one that is available to all users of the system. A user that has access to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_90_10|Filters] ([~/?ScreenId=CS209010|CS209010]) form can make a quick or an advanced filter and define it to be shared with other users.{br}

For details on applying filters, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS_Filtering_and_Sorting_Process_Activity|Filtering and Sorting in Acumatica ERP: Process Activity].[anchor|#_16c8ba86-8dcf-42ee-86d9-13c29b50e16e][anchor|#_dac6d101-f7c4-42aa-b8c8-261bf2b823e0]
==Simple Filters==
A simple filter is a filter that you can quickly apply to data in a table, and the filter remains applied while you are on the form. You can also sort data in a table column and turn column sorting on and off. To apply a simple filter, you click the header of the table column to open the Sorting and Filtering Settings dialog box. {br}

In this dialog box, you can do any of the following:[anchor|#_b9b5889a-538d-49c0-ab1f-3dea8cd4a78c]
*Specify filtering conditions for the column
*Sort the data in the column
*Cancel the sorting in the column

Once you specify these settings and click '''OK''' to close the dialog box, the table shows only the table rows that meet the sorting and filtering conditions that you have specified.[anchor|#_eabd9eeb-6ce4-4f98-9221-765d74e52f0f]
==Quick Filters==[anchor|#_914bdd76-1652-465e-b7f5-ef4e72ede76b]
A quick filter is a reusable filter that you can apply to data in the table of the following types of the Acumatica ERP forms (For details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS_Working_With_Data_Entry_Forms_GeneralInfo|Working with Data Entry Forms: General Information].): [anchor|#_5b0a41d5-fccb-4b44-aa1c-9059ced93058]
*A generic inquiry form (such as a list of records)
*An inquiry form
*A mass processing form

You can apply one quick filter or multiple quick filters to the data in the table.{br}

To apply a quick filter based on the data in a table column, you do either of the following:[anchor|#_9b5f793d-49dc-4df0-b1bf-489ed9edea53]
*Drag the header of the column to the filtering area, which causes the system to create a Quick Filter button. You then click the Quick Filter button there and specify conditions for the column in the Sorting and Filtering Settings dialog box, which opens.
*Click the header of the column, and in the Sorting and Filtering Settings dialog box, which opens, specify conditions for the column.
[anchor|#_39448923-6d56-4f0b-8fdf-1e9d7bf1ae1c]
In the Sorting and Filtering Settings dialog box, you select one of the following, based on the content of the column:[anchor|#ul_hgm_cqn_ckb]
*The values of the quick filter if the column has a fixed set of options
*The filter condition of the quick filter if the column has an unlimited number of values
[anchor|#_781192a2-32c4-42c0-a059-aa088be01031]
You can save a quick filter for future use. When you save a quick filter, the system adds to the table a tab with the quick filter applied.{br}

You can define a quick filter as a default filter, which means that each time you open the form, the filter tab is automatically opened.
==Advanced Filters==
An advanced filter is a shared filter defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_90_10|Filters] ([~/?ScreenId=CS209010|CS209010]) form for a processing or inquiry form by a system administrator. The system administrator can configure complex conditions for the advanced filter and apply the filter by default for users. If an advanced filter has been defined for a form, you can apply it anytime. For details, see [HelpRoot_ReportingTools\GI_Reusable_Filters_Mapref|Managing Advanced Filters].[anchor|#_501f86f2-a162-4da3-bf72-40a1109d250c]
==Ad Hoc Filters==
An ad hoc filter is a filter that you can set up on a report form to fine-tune the basic report parameters.{br}

You cannot save an ad hoc filter to be reused at a later time. You can, however, set up a report template that contains the filtering and sorting settings of an ad hoc filter, save this template, and reuse it.
==Basic Elements of the Filtering Area==
The filtering area is a UI element of the Acumatica ERP form that you can use to set up, configure, and apply filters.{br}

The following screenshot shows the basic elements of the filtering area. [anchor|#_da77ad5e-71ec-4e10-8704-7a056510d39e][anchor|#_1b2963b8-5482-4ea5-968d-bb17cabfadf5][image:UserGuide/Images/GS_filtering_and_sorting_filtering_area.png|popup|Basic elements of the filtering area|450px][anchor|#_fec60a0f-c13e-4fc0-a3f3-869673fcdf28]

The following activity will help you create and apply filters in Acumatica ERP.
==Story==
Suppose that you are David Chubb, a new sales manager of the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company. On January 30, 2020, you are starting to work with the GoodFood One Restaurant customer. To learn the details about products ordered by the customer so far in 2020, you need to find all the sales orders that have been created in January 2020. You also want all the sales orders for this customer to be displayed on a separate filter tab in the list of sales orders.
==Process Overview==
In this process activity, you will do the following:[anchor|#_da25f6bd-eafd-455a-b199-7a84790947e4]
#Create a simple filter
#Create a quick filter
#Make a quick filter the default filter for your user account
#Delete a quick filter
#Filter data in a table by a selected cell value
#Turn on and off column sorting in a table

==System Preparation==
Before you start working with filters in Acumatica ERP, make sure that the following tasks have been performed:[anchor|#_e5a88d9d-f3eb-4ea9-9977-46523d0e1427]
*You have installed an Acumatica ERP instance with the ''U100'' dataset, or a system administrator has performed this task for you.
*You have signed in to Acumatica ERP with the following credentials:
**User name: ''chubb''
**Password: ''123''
*:For details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS_Accessing_Acumatica_ERP_Process_Activity|Accessing Acumatica ERP: Process Activity].

==Step 1: Creating a Simple Filter==
Suppose that you need to view the list of sales orders that have been created in January 2020.
To create a simple filter, do the following:[anchor|#_96bb7f3a-3d1f-4d2b-8ad9-b1f5eb2d1a4c]
#On the main menu, click '''Sales Orders'''. The '''Sales Orders''' workspace opens.
#In the '''Transactions''' category of the workspace, click ''Sales Orders''. The list of sales orders opens, listing the sales orders that have been created in the system.
#In the list of sales orders, click the header of the '''Date''' column. 
#In the Sorting and Filtering Settings dialog box, which opens, do the following:
##Select '''Is Between''' in the list of filter conditions.
##In the '''From''' box, specify ''01/01/2020''.
##In the '''To''' box, specify ''01/31/2020''.
##At the bottom of the dialog box, click '''OK'''. The system closes the dialog box. In the list of sales orders, you can see the sales orders that were created in January 2020. 
#:((({S:Hint}In the filtering area, you can see the '''Date: &rsquo;1/1/2020&rsquo; - &rsquo;1/31/2020&rsquo;''' Quick Filter button. You can save a simple filter as a quick filter, which can be used in future sign-ins; you will do this in the next step.
)))
#Drag the '''Date: &rsquo;1/1/2020&rsquo; - &rsquo;1/31/2020&rsquo;''' Quick Filter button out of the filtering area to delete the simple filter.

==Step 2: Creating a Quick Filter==
Suppose that as David Chubb, you will regularly need to view all the sales orders for GoodFood One Restaurant and you need an easy way to do this. You will create a quick filter, which is reusable, applied to the data in the list of sales orders. When you save this quick filter, the system will add to the table of sales orders a separate tab with the quick filter applied. {br}

To create this quick filter, do the following:[anchor|#_1d81045f-1e78-42dc-b56c-2ac4e6d24892]
#While you are still viewing the list of sales orders, click the header of the '''Customer''' column. The Sorting and Filtering Settings dialog box opens.
#In the dialog box, make sure that the '''Equals''' condition is selected. 
#In the search box at the bottom of the dialog box, enter the customer ID: <tt>GOODFOOD</tt>.
#Click '''OK'''. The system closes the dialog box, and the list of sales orders now contains only the sales orders that have been created for GoodFood One Restaurant. In the filtering area, you can see the '''Customer:= &rsquo;GOODFOOD&rsquo;''' Quick Filter button.
#In the filtering area, click '''Save'''.
#In the '''Filter Settings''' dialog box, which opens, do the following:
##In the '''Filter Name''' box, enter the name of the quick filter: <tt>GoodFood</tt>.
##Click '''OK'''.

 The system closes the dialog box. In the table, notice the '''GOODFOOD''' filter tab, which displays all the sales orders for GoodFood One Restaurant.
==Step 3: Making a Quick Filter Your Default Filter==
Suppose that GoodFood One Restaurant is your main customer. Every time you open the list of sales orders you need to view the '''GOODFOOD''' filter tab, which lists this customer&rsquo;s sales orders. Thus, you will make this quick filter your default filter. ((({S:Hint}Because this filter is not shared with other users, it will be the default filter for only your user account.
))){br}

To make a quick filter your default filter, do the following:[anchor|#_9ff9151b-eb84-4112-ad23-bef4ce6f2686]
#While you are still viewing the '''GOODFOOD''' filter tab of the Sales Orders form, click the '''Filter Settings''' button. The '''Filter Settings''' dialog box opens.
#In the dialog box, do the following:
##Select the '''Default''' check box.
##Click '''Save'''.
##Click '''Apply'''.
#:The system closes the dialog box. The '''GOODFOOD''' filter tab will now be displayed by default every time you open the list of sales orders. 

==Step 4: Deleting a Quick Filter==
Suppose that your manager has assigned the GoodFood One Restaurant customer to another sales manager, so you no longer need the '''GOODFOOD''' quick filter that you created in Step 2.{br}

To delete the quick filter, do the following:[anchor|#_8772dd79-8121-44f4-9f88-8b0609fd1475]
#While you are still viewing the '''GOODFOOD''' filter tab of the list of sales orders, click the '''Filter Settings''' button. The '''Filter Settings''' dialog box opens.
#In the dialog box, do the following:
##In the box left of the '''Default''' check box, make sure that ''GoodFood'' is selected.
##Click '''Remove'''.
#In the dialog box, which opens, click '''OK'''. The system closes the dialog box and removes the quick filter. The quick filter is no longer displayed in the '''Filter Settings''' dialog box.
#Close the '''Filter Settings''' dialog box.

==Step 5: Filtering Data by a Selected Cell Value==
Suppose that you need to view all the sales orders that have the ''Invoiced'' status. {br}

To filter the data in the table by the ''Invoiced'' value in the '''Status''' column, do the following:[anchor|#_51c08280-5972-4129-8d69-8292028fcbb4]
#While you are still viewing the list of sales orders, on the '''All Records''' tab, in the '''Status''' column, click a cell that has the ''Invoiced'' value.
#:((({S:Hint}If you cannot see on the first page of records any sales orders that have the ''Invoiced'' status, click the '''Go to Next Page''' button at the bottom right corner of the screen.
)))
#Select Shift+F. In the list of sales orders, you can now see the sales orders that have the ''Invoiced'' status.
#:((({S:Hint}In the filtering area, you can see the '''Status:= Invoiced''' Quick Filter button.
)))
#Optional: Drag the quick filter outside of the filtering area to turn off the filter. 

==Step 6: Turning On Column Sorting==
Suppose that you need to sort sales orders by customer name in alphabetical order.{br}

 To turn on sorting in the '''Customer''' column, do the following:[anchor|#_3cc1e27e-9d2b-4449-88e4-374408e80ef3]
#While you are still viewing the list of sales orders, click the header of the '''Customer''' column.
#In the Sorting and Filtering Settings dialog box, which opens, click '''Sort Ascending'''. The Sorting and Filtering Settings dialog box is closed, and the sales orders in the table are sorted in alphabetical order by customer.

==Step 7: Turning Off Column Sorting==
To turn off sorting in the '''Customer''' column of the table, do the following:[anchor|#_69de1186-57ae-42f4-a583-0636e63de522]
#While you are still viewing the list of sales orders, click the header of the '''Customer''' column.
#In the Sorting and Filtering Settings dialog box, which opens, again click '''Sort Ascending''', which has a check mark left of the option. The Sorting and Filtering Settings dialog box is closed, and the sorting is turned off.

In the filtering area, you can see the  Date:                             '1/1/2020' - '1/31/2020'  Quick Filter button. You can save a                         simple filter as a quick filter, which can be used in future sign-ins; you                         will do this in the next step. Drag the  Date: '1/1/2020' - '1/31/2020'  Quick Filter                     button out of the filtering area to delete the simple filter. Step 2: Creating a Quick Filter Suppose that as David Chubb, you will regularly need to view all the sales orders for                 GoodFood One Restaurant and you need an easy way to do this. You will create a quick                 filter, which is reusable, applied to the data in the list of sales orders. When you                 save this quick filter, the system will add to the table of sales orders a separate                 tab with the quick filter applied.

In the  Filter Settings  dialog box, which opens, do the                         following: In the  Filter Name  box, enter the name of the                             quick filter:  GoodFood . Click  OK .  The system closes the dialog box. In the table, notice the                      GOODFOOD  filter tab, which displays all the sales orders                 for GoodFood One Restaurant. Step 3: Making a Quick Filter Your Default Filter Suppose that GoodFood One Restaurant is your main customer. Every time you open the                 list of sales orders you need to view the  GOODFOOD  filter                 tab, which lists this customer's sales orders. Thus, you will make this quick filter                 your default filter.                      Because this filter is not shared with other users, it will be the                     default filter for only your user account. To make a quick filter your default filter, do the following: While you are still viewing the  GOODFOOD  filter tab of                     the Sales Orders form, click the  Filter Settings  button.

In the filtering area, you can see the  Status:=                             Invoiced  Quick Filter button. Optional: Drag the quick filter outside of the                      filtering                     area t o turn off the filter.  Step 6: Turning On Column Sorting Suppose that you need to sort sales orders by customer name in alphabetical                 order.  To turn on sorting in the  Customer  column, do the                 following: While you are still viewing the list of sales orders, click the header of the                          Customer  column. In the Sorting and Filtering Settings dialog box, which opens, click                          Sort Ascending .                      The                     Sorting and Filtering Settings dialog box is closed, and the sales orders in the                     table are sorted in alphabetical order by customer. Step 7: Turning Off Column Sorting To turn off sorting in the  Customer  column of the table, do                 the following: While you are still viewing the list of sales orders, click the header of the                          Customer  column. In the Sorting and Filtering Settings dialog box, which opens, again click                          Sort Ascending , which has a check mark left of the                     option. The Sorting and Filtering Settings dialog box is closed, and the sorting                     is turned off. ]]></column>

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[In the following sections, you will find information about adjusting layout of a table on an Acumatica ERP form.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#_7bb4f8c9-e39a-4ee1-ae6a-1e6f82497bbd]
*Hide or display table columns
*Adjust column width
*Rearrange columns

==Applicable Scenarios==
You modify the default table layout on a form if you would like to view additional information or rearrange the data in a table according to your work tasks.
==Table Layout==
On an Acumatica ERP form, you can adjust the layout of any table to meet your requirements. Specifically, you can hide or display table columns, rearrange columns by dragging them, and change column width. {br}

When you have adjusted the layout of a specific table on a particular form, your individual settings for the layout of this table are automatically saved to the server and automatically applied in all your future user sessions. These changes are available to you on any browser or device and are applied to your user account only. Also, these changes are applied to only the specific table on the specific form that you changed; they are not applied to any other tables.[anchor|#_16c8ba86-8dcf-42ee-86d9-13c29b50e16e][anchor|#_dac6d101-f7c4-42aa-b8c8-261bf2b823e0]
==Column Configuration Capabilities==
For each table, you can manage the column set to be displayed by using the '''Column Configuration''' dialog box. You click the Column Configuration button ([anchor|#_35c48f5a-6e17-4fea-a90b-3f4122123b7c][image:UserGuide/Images/GS_table_layout_column_configuration_button.png|8px]), which is located in the header row of the leftmost table column, to open the '''Column Configuration''' dialog box. {br}

You can adjust table layout as follows:[anchor|#_199d833f-d054-4491-82a1-749d004ad50a]
*Hide columns
*Display columns that were previously hidden
*Change the order of columns
*Restore the default table layout
[anchor|#_48a54f4e-0a23-4d96-b26e-f8b29bd1411b]
==Setting the Accessibility of the Table Columns==
For each table of a data entry or mass processing form, you can identify the accessibility of the column cells by using the '''Column Configuration''' dialog box. In the '''Selected Columns''' list of this dialog box, the system displays the columns that are visible on the table. These table columns may look like those in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_1386b8d5-6325-4b51-8465-e2d4f88c5f2c][anchor|#_e0bc27b9-2827-4cca-94de-be11d3211d7b][image:Shared/Images/GS_UI_Tab_Buttons_Visibility.png|popup|Accessibility of the column cells|250px][anchor|#_f32d1c6a-77ff-4d1a-81d5-dc19e04384db]
*[image:Shared/Images/GS_UI_Tab_Button.png|Accessibility of the column cells]: Indicates that the column is accessible through a keyboard. This button is not visible by default and appears only when you point at the column name.
*[image:Shared/Images/GS_UI_Tab_Button_Strikethrough.png|Accessibility of the column cells]: Indicates that the column is not accessible through a keyboard. If accessibility for a column has been turned off, this button is visible by default and stays visible when you point at the column name. The system skips this column when the user selects the Tab key on the keyboard.

To change the state of the accessibility of a column, in the '''Selected Columns''' list of the dialog box, you point at the column name and click the '''Tab''' or [anchor|#_7f12f7be-6fde-4f94-a1ea-6c2f0f78c0a0][image:Shared/Images/GS_UI_Tab_Button_Strikethrough.png|Accessibility of the column cells] button, which appears.{br}

By default, changes in the column configuration are applied to the current user account. However, a user with administrative access to the system can configure the column accessibility and share its configuration with specific users in the system or make it the default configuration for all users.]]></column>

Also, these changes are         applied to only the specific table on the specific form that you changed; they are not         applied to any other tables. Column Configuration Capabilities For each table, you can manage the column set to be displayed by using the            Column Configuration  dialog box. You click the Column Configuration         button ( ), which is located in the header row of the         leftmost table column, to open the  Column Configuration  dialog box.  You can adjust table layout as follows: Hide columns Display columns that were previously hidden Change the order of columns Restore the default table layout Setting the Accessibility of the Table Columns For each table of a data entry or mass processing form, you can identify the accessibility of the                 column cells by using the  Column Configuration  dialog box. In                 the  Selected Columns  list of this dialog box, the system                 displays the columns that are visible on the table. These table columns may look                 like those in the following screenshot. Accessibility of the column cells : Indicates that the column is                     accessible through a keyboard. This button is not visible by default and appears                     only when you point at the column name. : Indicates that the column is                     not accessible through a keyboard. If accessibility for a column has been turned                     off, this button is visible by default and stays visible when you point at the                     column name. The system skips this column when the user selects the Tab key on                     the keyboard. To change the state of the accessibility of a column, in the  Selected                     Columns  list of the dialog box, you point at the column name and                 click the  Tab  or   button, which appears. By default, changes in the column configuration are applied to the current user                 account. However, a user with administrative access to the system can configure the                 column accessibility and share its configuration with specific users in the system                 or make it the default configuration for all users. ]]></column>

The following activity will help you modify the table layout of an Acumatica ERP form in order to arrange data according to your preferences.
==Story==
Suppose that you are David Chubb, a new sales manager of the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company. Your colleague Pam Brawner has gone on vacation and you are currently working with her customers. To identify all the sales orders that she created or modified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form in January 2020, you need certain key information to be displayed in the list of sales orders: the user that created the sales order, the user that last modified the sales order, and the description of the sales order.
==Process Overview==
In this process activity, you will do the following:[anchor|#_da25f6bd-eafd-455a-b199-7a84790947e4]
#Display hidden table columns
#Change the order of columns in a table
#Hide the table columns that you do not need to see
#Adjust column width
#Restore the default settings of table layout

==System Preparation==
Before you start adjusting the layout of a table, make sure that the following tasks have been performed:[anchor|#_a4273209-3c90-4125-a3d2-a1c6ab268e62]
*You have installed an Acumatica ERP instance with the ''U100'' dataset, or a system administrator has performed this task for you.
*You have signed in to Acumatica ERP with the following credentials:
**User name: ''chubb''
**Password: ''123''
*:For details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS_Accessing_Acumatica_ERP_Process_Activity|Accessing Acumatica ERP: Process Activity].
[anchor|#_cc3ac9f2-0d1c-4acf-9d6c-4c9bbcf5fe3d]
==Step 1: Adding Hidden Columns to a Table==
Suppose that in the list of sales orders, you need to view the sales orders that were created or modified by your colleague Pam Browner and the description she has added to each sales order. To do this, you need to see the content of the '''Created By''', '''Last Modified By''', and '''Description''' columns.[anchor|#_167d166b-c6e3-4d15-9fe8-222836764e98]{br}

To add these hidden columns to the table, do the following:[anchor|#_ec08746c-54e1-4152-85d9-f8f19ae65688]
#On the main menu, click '''Sales Orders'''. The '''Sales Orders''' workspace opens.
#In the '''Transactions''' category of the workspace, click ''Sales Orders''. The list of sales orders opens.
#In the list of sales orders, click the Column Configuration button, which is located in the header row of the leftmost column header. The '''Column Configuration''' dialog box opens.
#In the dialog box, add the needed columns to the list of the selected columns as follows:
##In the '''Available Columns''' list, select '''Created by''' and click the Add Column button to move the name of the column to the '''Selected Columns''' list.
##In the '''Available Columns''' list, select '''Last Modified By''' and click the Add Column button to move the name of the column to the '''Selected Columns''' list.
##In the '''Available Columns''' list, select '''Description''' and click the Add Column button to move the name of the column to the '''Selected Columns''' list.
##:((({S:Hint}[anchor|#_185a8e55-1098-44a0-9a72-e87181a86121]
*You can double-click the name of the column to move it between the lists.
*You can select more than one column by using the Ctrl or Shift key.
*You can type the name of the column in the search box of the Column Configuration dialog box, to quickly find a column in a long list of columns.
)))
##Click '''OK''', which closes the '''Column Configuration''' dialog box. Notice that the '''Created By''', '''Last Modified By''' and '''Description''' columns are displayed in the list of records. If you cannot see the columns, use the horizontal scroll bar in the footer of the table.
#:((({S:Hint}To view all the columns that have been added to the table, click the '''Fit to Screen''' ([anchor|#_a0b97872-10d1-49a0-a21b-d9a2ad59875e][image:UserGuide/Images/GS_table_layout_fit_to_screen_button.png|15px]) button, which is located on the table toolbar.
)))

==Step 2: Changing the Order of Columns in a Table==
Suppose that you would like to view next to the numbers of sales orders the names of the users who created and modified sales orders. To do this, you need the '''Created By''' and '''Last Modified By''' columns to be displayed after the '''Order Nbr.''' column.{br}

To change the order of columns in a table, do the following:[anchor|#_93c5ea23-fe74-4aa8-9640-84a9284f62b6]
#While you are still viewing the list of sales orders, drag the header of the '''Created By''' column to place the column after the '''Order Nbr.''' column.
#Drag the header of the '''Last Modified By''' column to place the column after the '''Created By''' column.

==Step 3: Hiding Table Columns==
Suppose that you would like to view the names of the customers, but you do not need to view customer IDs. That is, you want to hide the '''Customer''' column in the list of sales orders.{br}

To hide the table column, do the following:[anchor|#_880adb71-6f51-41cd-9d14-7f2570c374f6]
#While you are still viewing the list of sales orders, click the Column Configuration button to open the '''Column Configuration''' dialog box.
#In the dialog box, do the following:
##In the '''Selected Columns''' list, select '''Customer'''.
##Click the Remove Column button to move the name of the column to the '''Available Columns''' list.
##Click '''OK''', which closes the '''Column Configuration''' dialog box. Notice that the '''Customer''' column is not displayed in the list of sales orders.
##:((({S:Hint}If the content of the table does not take up the whole screen and there is extra space on the right, click the '''Fit to Screen''' ([anchor|#_dad2ca7f-6192-4ffc-8551-d4f54ee5deaa][image:UserGuide/Images/GS_table_layout_fit_to_screen_button.png|15px]) button, which is located on the table toolbar. The content of the table is resized to fit the screen.
)))

==Step 4: Adjusting the Column Width Manually==
Suppose that in the list of sales orders, you would like to make the '''Description''' column wider to display all the content in the rows; you also want to make the '''Customer Name''' column narrower.{br}

To adjust the column width manually, do the following:[anchor|#_16bc7b2e-b108-4d04-9061-dee17728c3a8]
#While you are still viewing the list of sales orders, point at the right side of the '''Customer Name''' column header. When the pointer becomes a double-sided arrow, drag the pointer left to move the column boundary and make the column narrower.
#Point at the right side of the '''Description''' column header. When the pointer becomes a double-sided arrow, drag the pointer right to move the column boundary and make the column wider.
#:((({S:Hint}If there is not enough space on your screen to make the '''Description''' column wider, make some other columns narrower or hide a column that you do not use, as shown in Step 3.
)))

==Step 5: Restoring the Default Table Layout==
Suppose that you have made many changes to a table, the data has become difficult to read, and you would like to cancel all your changes and restore the default layout of the table.{br}

To restore the default table layout, do the following:[anchor|#_1bde31a8-5490-4015-b4a6-82b2c017dbe0]
#While you are still viewing the list of sales orders, click the Column Configuration button to open the '''Column Configuration''' dialog box.
#In the dialog box, do the following:
##Click '''Reset to Default'''.
##Click '''OK''' to close the dialog box.

The default table layout of the list of records is displayed.]]></column>

If you cannot see the columns,                                 use the horizontal scroll bar in the footer of the table. To view all the columns that have been added to the table,                             click the  Fit to Screen  ( ) button,                             which is located on the table toolbar. Step 2: Changing the Order of Columns in a Table Suppose that you would like to view next to the numbers of sales orders the names of                 the users who created and modified sales orders. To do this, you need the                      Created By  and  Last Modified By                  columns to be displayed after the  Order Nbr.  column. To change the order of columns in a table, do the following: While you are still viewing the list of sales orders, drag the header of the                          Created By  column to place the column after the                          Order Nbr.  column. Drag the header of the  Last Modified By  column to place                     the column after the  Created By  column. Step 3: Hiding Table Columns Suppose that you would like to view the names of the customers, but you do not need                 to view customer IDs. That is, you want to hide the  Customer                  column in the list of sales orders. To hide the table column, do the following: While you are still viewing the list of sales orders, click the Column                     Configuration button to open the  Column Configuration                      dialog box. In the dialog box, do the following: In the  Selected Columns  list, select                                  Customer . Click the Remove Column button to move the name of the column to the                                  Available Columns  list. Click  OK , which closes the  Column                                 Configuration  dialog box. Notice that the                                  Customer  column is not displayed in the list                             of sales                                 orders. If the content of the table does not take up the whole                                 screen and there is extra space on the right, click the                                      Fit to Screen  ( ) button,                                 which is located on the table toolbar. The content of the table is                                 resized to fit the screen. Step 4: Adjusting the Column Width Manually Suppose that in the list of sales orders, you would like to make the                      Description  column wider to display all the content in                 the rows; you also want to make the  Customer Name  column                 narrower. To adjust the column width manually, do the following: While you are still viewing the list of sales orders, point at the right side of                     the  Customer Name  column header. When the pointer becomes                     a double-sided arrow, drag the pointer left to move the column boundary and make                     the column narrower. Point at the right side of the  Description  column header.                     When the pointer becomes a double-sided arrow, drag the pointer right to move                     the column boundary and make the column wider. If there is not                         enough space on your screen to make the  Description                          column wider, make some other columns narrower or hide a column that you do                         not use, as shown in Step 3. Step 5: Restoring the Default Table Layout Suppose that you have made many changes to a table, the data has become difficult to                 read, and you would like to cancel all your changes and restore the default layout                 of the table. To restore the default table layout, do the following: While you are still viewing the list of sales orders, click the Column                     Configuration button to open the  Column Configuration                      dialog box. In the dialog box, do the following: Click  Reset to Default . Click  OK  to close the dialog box. The default table layout of the list of records is displayed. ]]></column>

In the following sections, you will find an overview of the Acumatica ERP forms. You will learn how to work with data entry forms, which you use to enter records into Acumatica ERP. You will learn about navigating to data entry forms, as well as creating, copying, and viewing records on these forms. Also, you will read about the capabilities for attaching files and notes to records on the forms.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#_7bb4f8c9-e39a-4ee1-ae6a-1e6f82497bbd]
*Navigate to a data entry form
*Create a new record by using a data entry form
*Copy an existing record and use the copy to create a new record on the same data entry form
*Attach a file to a record
*Attach a note to a record

==Applicable Scenarios==
You work with a data entry form in any of the following cases:[anchor|#_b0409713-07fd-4366-aa10-49cb8feee9cd]
*You need to create a record (such as an AR invoice, a GL transaction, a customer, an employee, or a stock item).
*You need to modify or act upon a record.
*You need to attach a file to a record.
*You need to attach a note to a record.
[anchor|#section_dyh_hch_flb]
==Records in Acumatica ERP==
Much of the work that most users do in the system involves creating and working with records: objects in the system that can be created by a user or automatically. A record can be categorized as any of the following:[anchor|#ul_s1d_pdh_flb]
*A transaction is a record that represents the exchange or movement of money, goods, or services. Examples of transactions include appointments, change orders, bank deposits, invoices, inventory issues, payments, and purchase orders. 
*A profile is a record that holds the basic settings of a person, company, or entity when no exchange or movement is involved. Examples of profiles include customers, employees, inventory items, fixed assets, credit terms, and projects.
*A class is a special type of record that holds the settings of a particular group of profiles and is used to create new profiles of the type. Examples of classes include item classes, customer classes, vendor classes, opportunity classes, and account classes.

==Types of Forms in Acumatica ERP==
 Acumatica ERP functionality is based on forms. Forms are webpages in Acumatica ERP that you use to configure the system, enter and process records, create reports, and export and import data in various formats. You access forms through workspaces, search results, and direct links to the applicable webpages (such as those in documentation).{br}

The main types of Acumatica ERP forms are listed below:[anchor|#_db3cc939-c5d8-430d-8936-3c5f02e94218]
*Data entry forms: Data entry forms are the primary means by which users enter data to track day-to-day activities. You use a data entry form to create a new record—which may be a transaction or a profile—in the system and to view or edit the settings of the record. An example of a data entry form is the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form.
*:When you save the data that you have entered on a data entry form, a new record is created in the system or an existing record is modified or deleted, depending on the changes you have made on the form.
*Maintenance forms: Maintenance forms are generally used by system administrators and other department-specific specialists to create system records that ease the process of correctly entering records on data entry forms and help companies implement their policies. These records include posting classes (and other types of classes), statement cycles, overdue charges, carriers, ship via codes, and ledgers. Maintenance forms are generally listed under the '''Preferences''' and '''Profiles''' categories in workspaces. An example of a maintenance form is the Reason Codes (CS2110PL) form.
*Lists of records: Each of these forms contains a list of transactions, profiles, or classes. When you click the name of a data entry or maintenance form in a workspace or on the Search form, the system initially opens the list of records that have been created by using the form. From this list, you can open the needed record on the corresponding form, or you can open the corresponding form to create a new record. An example of a list of records is the Invoices and Memos (AR3010PL) form.
*:((({S:Hint}In Help topics and training courses, you may encounter the terms ''substitute form'' and ''list as entry point'' to describe lists of records; these terms are used in descriptions of the technical implementation of a list of records.
)))
*Mass processing forms: You use a mass processing form to process records of particular types, such as invoices or payments. With these forms, which are generally listed under the '''Processes''' category in workspaces, you can process all listed records or only those you select. A mass processing form usually has selection criteria you can use to list the needed records. An example of a mass processing form is the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_50_10_00|Release AR Documents] ([~/?ScreenId=AR501000|AR501000]) form.
*Preferences forms: You use a preferences form to specify the general settings for a particular workflow (such as the processing of sales orders and other related documents) that can be performed by using transactions or profiles. These forms are listed under the '''Preferences''' category in workspaces. All preferences forms have ''Preferences'' in the title. An example of a preferences form is the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) form.
*Inquiry forms: Inquiry forms are developed using C# and delivered with Acumatica ERP. On an inquiry form, you specify any needed selection criteria and view a list of records that meet the criteria. These forms (which are listed under the '''Inquiries''' category in workspaces) give you visibility into data that has been entered into the system. An example of an inquiry form is the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_40_20_00|Account by Period] ([~/?ScreenId=GL402000|GL402000]) form.
*Generic inquiry forms: Generic inquiry forms include predefined generic inquiries, which are delivered with Acumatica ERP, and custom generic inquiries that a technical specialist responsible for the customization of Acumatica ERP in your company develops. Generic inquiry forms are based on queries that collect data from the Acumatica ERP database and displays the results in the UI. For details, see [HelpRoot_ReportingTools\SM__MNG_Managing_Generic_Inquiry|Managing Generic Inquiries].
*Report forms: You use a report form to specify the parameters of a report and then run the report. You can then print the generated report, export it to a file, or send it by email. Report forms are listed under the '''Reports''' category in workspaces. An example of a report form is the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\AR_63_20_00|AR Balance by GL Account] ([~/?ScreenId=AR632000|AR632000]) form.

==Form Title Bar==
The form title bar is located at the top of the data entry form. The form title bar displays the title of the form and includes a variety of buttons and menu commands, some of which you can use to manage information related to the record or the form. These buttons and menu commands may vary by form and by the access rights of your user account.
==Form Toolbar==
The form toolbar of a data entry form contains standard buttons that you can use to save or cancel changes you have made to the record, or to add or delete a record. Depending on the particular form, the form toolbar may contain navigation buttons (buttons to go to different records), processing buttons, and menus consisting of commands related to the selected record or records.
==Summary Area==
The Summary area of a data entry form displays general information about the selected record, such as date, number, status, customer, or description. The elements in the Summary area may vary by form and by the access rights of your user account.
==Tabs==
The tabs of a data entry form are used for organizing information and providing easier navigation to needed information. Most data entry forms in Acumatica ERP have more than one tab.
==Details Area==
The Details area of a data entry form contains the details or other essential data of the record you are viewing. Depending on the form and the tab of the form (if applicable), the Details area may display one of the following:[anchor|#_1087a74c-9182-4133-8b73-f95d7035b45e]
*A table with the rows (sometimes referred to as ''lines'' or ''details'') of the record, as in the lower half of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_30_10_00|Journal Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=GL301000|GL301000]) form or on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form
*A number of UI elements with their settings, as on the '''General Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form or on the '''Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) form

[anchor|#section_bhh_d23_flb]
==Row==
The Details area of the form may consist of a table or of multiple tabs, some of which contain tables. For example, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, the '''Document Details''' tab contains rows that correspond to each line of the sales order, and the '''Tax Details''' tab contains rows for each of the individual taxes applied to the sales order lines. Each row of a table in the Details area is a detail of the selected record, or a detail related to the record in some regard.
==Creation of a Record==
In Acumatica ERP, you can create a record in the following ways:[anchor|#_ab105eb3-12ae-4017-a20d-00ebba1f9ef6]
*By adding a new record: Starting with a blank data entry form except for the elements filled in with default settings, you fill in all necessary elements of the record.
*By using the copy-and-paste actions: You copy and paste a record of the same type.
*By using a template or class: You select a previously created template or class for the new record, and the system fills in some settings of the record based on the settings of the template or class.

If you create a record by copying another record or use a template or class, you can create records much more easily because you need to fill in or change fewer settings. For applicable forms, you can find the copying and pasting options and a list of templates in the '''Clipboard''' ([anchor|#_0a33d682-1f57-4d51-aac5-a90191b283ce][image:UserGuide/Images/GS_forms_clipboard_menu.png|Basic elements of a data entry form]) menu on the form toolbar.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Working with Data Entry Forms: General Information In the following sections, you will find an overview of          the  Acumatica ERP forms. You will learn how to          work          with data entry forms, which you use to enter records into  Acumatica ERP. You will learn about navigating to data entry forms, as well as creating, copying, and         viewing records on these forms. Also, you will read about the capabilities for attaching         files and notes to records on the forms. Learning Objectives In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following: Navigate to a data entry form Create a new record by using a data entry form Copy an existing record and use the copy to create a new record on the same data entry           form Attach a file to a record Attach a note to a record Applicable Scenarios You work with a data entry form in any of the following cases: You need to create a record (such as an AR invoice, a GL transaction, a customer, an           employee, or a stock item). You need to modify or act upon a record. You need to attach a file to a record. You need to attach a note to a record. Records in  Acumatica ERPMuch of the work that most users do in the system involves creating and working with         records: objects in the system that can be created by a user or automatically. A record can         be categorized as any of the           following: A transaction is a record that represents the exchange or movement of money, goods, or             services. Examples of transactions include appointments, change orders, bank deposits,             invoices, inventory issues, payments, and purchase orders.  A profile is a record that holds the basic settings of a person, company, or entity             when no exchange or movement is involved. Examples of profiles include customers,             employees, inventory items, fixed assets, credit terms, and projects. A class is a special type of record that holds the settings of a particular group of             profiles and is used to create new profiles of the type. Examples of classes include             item classes, customer classes, vendor classes, opportunity classes, and account             classes. Types of Forms in  Acumatica ERP Acumatica ERP functionality is          based          on forms. Forms are webpages in  Acumatica ERP that you use to configure the system, enter and process records, create reports, and         export and import data in various formats. You access forms through workspaces, search         results, and direct links to the applicable webpages (such as those in documentation). The main types of  Acumatica ERP forms are listed below: Data entry forms: Data entry forms are the primary means by which users enter data to           track day-to-day activities. You use a data entry form to create a new record—which           may be a transaction or a profile—in the system and to view or edit the settings of           the record. An example of a data entry form is the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form. When you save the data that             you have entered on a data entry form, a new record is created in the system or an             existing record is modified or deleted, depending on the changes you have made on the             form. Maintenance forms: Maintenance forms are generally used by system administrators            and           other department-specific specialists  to create system records that           ease the process of correctly entering records on data entry forms and help companies           implement their policies. These records include posting classes (and other types of           classes), statement cycles, overdue charges, carriers, ship via codes, and ledgers.           Maintenance forms are generally listed under the  Preferences  and              Profiles  categories in workspaces. An example of a maintenance           form is the Reason Codes (CS2110PL) form. Lists of records: Each of these forms contains a list of transactions, profiles, or           classes. When you click the name of a data entry or maintenance form in a workspace or on           the Search form, the system initially opens the list of records that have been created by           using the form. From this list, you can open the needed record on the corresponding form,           or you can open the corresponding form to create a new record. An example of a list of           records is the Invoices and Memos (AR3010PL)             form. In Help topics and training courses, you may encounter the terms                substitute form  and  list as entry point  to describe lists of records;             these terms are used in descriptions of the technical implementation of a list of             records. Mass processing forms: You use a mass processing form to process records of particular           types, such as invoices or payments. With these forms, which are generally listed under           the  Processes  category in workspaces, you can process all listed           records or only those you select. A mass processing form usually has selection criteria           you can use to list the needed records. An example of a mass processing form is the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR501000|AR501000]) Release AR Documents (AR501000) form. Preferences forms: You use a preferences form to specify the general settings for a           particular workflow (such as the processing of sales orders and other related documents)           that can be performed by using transactions or profiles. These forms are listed under the              Preferences  category in workspaces. All preferences forms have              Preferences  in the title. An example of a preferences form is the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) Accounts Receivable Preferences (AR101000) form. Inquiry forms: Inquiry forms are developed using C# and delivered with  Acumatica ERP. On an inquiry form, you specify any needed selection criteria and view a list of           records that meet the criteria. These forms (which are listed under the              Inquiries  category in workspaces) give you visibility into data           that has been entered into the system. An example of an inquiry form is the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL402000|GL402000]) Account by Period (GL402000) form. Generic inquiry forms: Generic inquiry forms include predefined generic inquiries, which           are delivered with  Acumatica ERP, and custom generic inquiries that a technical specialist responsible for the           customization of  Acumatica ERP in your company develops. Generic inquiry forms are based on queries that collect data           from the  Acumatica ERP database and displays the results in the UI. For details, see  Managing Generic Inquiries. Report forms: You use a report form to specify the parameters of a report and then run           the report. You can then print the generated report, export it to a file, or send it by           email. Report forms are listed under the  Reports  category in           workspaces. An example of a report form is the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR632000|AR632000]) AR Balance by GL Account (AR632000) form. Basic Elements of the  Acumatica ERP Data Entry Form A data entry form in  Acumatica ERP has basic elements that help you enter data into the system, search for needed         information, and share information with other users. The availability of a particular         element may vary by form or based on the access rights of your user account. The following screenshot shows the basic elements of a data entry form, which are described         in the next several sections.  Basic elements of a data entry form Form title bar Form toolbar Summary area Tabs Details area Row (line or detail) Form Title Bar The form title bar is located at the top of the data entry form. The form title bar         displays the title of the form and includes a variety of buttons and menu commands, some of         which you can use to manage information related to the record or the form. These buttons and         menu commands may vary by form and by the access rights of your user account. Form Toolbar The form toolbar of a data entry form contains standard buttons that you can use to save or         cancel changes you have made to the record, or to add or delete a record. Depending on the         particular form, the form toolbar may contain          navigation         buttons (buttons to go to different records),  processing buttons, and         menus consisting of commands related to the selected record or records. Summary Area The Summary area of a data entry form displays general information about the selected         record, such as date, number, status, customer, or description. The elements in the Summary         area may vary by form and by the access rights of your user account. Tabs The tabs of a data entry form are used for organizing information and providing easier         navigation to needed information. Most data entry forms in  Acumatica ERP have more than one tab. Details Area The Details area of a data entry form contains the details or other essential data of the         record you are viewing. Depending on the form and the tab of the form (if applicable), the         Details area may display one of the following: A table with the            rows            (sometimes referred to as  lines  or            details )            of the record, as in the lower half of the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL301000|GL301000]) Journal Transactions (GL301000) form           or on the  Document Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form A number of UI elements with their settings, as on the  General             Info  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000) form or on the              Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) Contacts (CR302000)           form A rich text editor that includes text area and formatting toolbar, as on the              Details  tab of a   ([~/?ScreenId=CR306000|CR306000]) Cases (CR306000)           form Row The Details area of the form may consist of a table or of multiple tabs, some of which         contain tables. For example, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, the            Document Details  tab contains rows that correspond to each line of         the sales order, and the  Tax Details  tab contains rows for each of         the individual taxes applied to the sales order lines. Each row of a table in the Details         area is a detail of the selected record, or a detail related to the record in some         regard. Creation of a Record In  Acumatica ERP, you can create a record in the following ways: By adding a new record: Starting with a blank data entry form except for the elements           filled in with default settings, you fill in all necessary elements of the record. By using the copy-and-paste actions: You copy and paste a record of the same type. By using a template or class: You select a previously created template or class for the           new record, and the system fills in some settings of the record based on the settings of           the template or class. If you create a record by copying another record or use a template or class, you can create         records much more easily because you need to fill in or change fewer settings. For         applicable forms, you can find the copying and pasting options and a list of templates in         the  Clipboard  ( ) menu on the form toolbar. For details, see            To Copy a Document Contents to a New Document and  To Create a Document by Using a Template. For more information, see  Copy-and-Paste Options and Document Templates.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
The following activity will give you experience navigating to a data entry form—in this case, the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. On the form, you will create a record (a sales order) and create another sales order by copying the first sales order. You will also attach a file to the first sales order and a note to the second sales order and view the note you have attached.
==Story==
Suppose that you are David Chubb, a new sales manager of the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company. You have received two orders for fruit. The first one is a purchase order for 50 pounds of apples for the GoodFood One Restaurant customer. The second order is a similar order for 50 pounds of oranges for the FourStar Coffee & Sweets Shop customer; you have not received a purchase order from this customer yet. You need to create sales orders for both orders for fruit.
==Process Overview==
In this process activity, you will do the following:[anchor|#_da25f6bd-eafd-455a-b199-7a84790947e4]
#Create a new sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form
#Attach the scanned purchase order from the customer to the sales order
#Create another new sales order by copying the existing sales order
#Attach a note to the second sales order

==System Preparation==
Before you start performing the steps of this activity in Acumatica ERP, make sure that the following tasks have been performed:[anchor|#_e5a88d9d-f3eb-4ea9-9977-46523d0e1427]
*You have installed an Acumatica ERP instance with the ''U100'' dataset, or a system administrator has performed this task for you.
*You have signed in to Acumatica ERP with the following credentials:
**User name: ''chubb''
**Password: ''123''
*:For details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS_Accessing_Acumatica_ERP_Process_Activity|Accessing Acumatica ERP: Process Activity].
*The business date in your system is set to 1/30/2020. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button in the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, and select 1/30/2020 in the calendar.

==Step 1: Creating a Sales Order==
Suppose that you have received a purchase order from the GoodFood One Restaurant customer, and you need to create a new sales order based on the purchase order. The customer has assigned the reference number ''10557'' to its purchase order.{br}

To create this sales order, do the following:[anchor|#_1d81045f-1e78-42dc-b56c-2ac4e6d24892]
#On the main menu, click the '''Sales Orders''' menu item. The '''Sales Orders''' workspace opens.
#In the workspace, click the '' New Sales Order'' tile. The [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form opens so that you can create a new record.
#:((({S:Hint}Not all data entry forms have a tile at the top of the workspace that you can click to create a new record on the form. As an alternate way of opening any data entry form in the workspace to create a new record, you can point at the link to the form (in this case, ''Sales Orders'', which is listed in the '''Transactions''' category) and click the '''New''' button right of the link. 
)))
#In the '''Date''' box of the Summary area of the form, specify 1/30/2020.
#In the '''Requested On''' box, specify 1/30/2020. 
#In the '''Customer''' box, select the customer as follows:
##Click the magnifier icon.
##In the lookup table, which opens, double-click ''GOODFOOD''. The system closes the lookup table and fills in the '''Customer''' box with the option you have selected.
#In the '''Description''' box, type <tt>Apples</tt>.
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, click the '''Add Row''' button. In the row, specify the following settings:
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''APPLES''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>50</tt>
#:((({S:Hint}A number of columns in the row—such as the '''Warehouse''', '''Line Description''', '''UOM''', '''Unit Price''', and '''Ext. Price'''—are filled in automatically, based on the settings of the item. The ''APPLES'' item has been predefined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form in the ''U100'' dataset.
)))
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''. The system saves the sales order and assigns it the ''Open'' status.
#In the '''Customer Order Nbr.''' box, type the number the customer has assigned to the purchase order: <tt>10557</tt>.
#:((({S:Hint}The '''Customer Order Nbr.''' box holds the number of the external customer document the sales order is based on. The internal reference number, which you can see in the '''Order Nbr.''' box, was automatically assigned to the sales order.
)))
#Click '''Save & Close''' to save the sales order. The system closes the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form and opens the list of sales orders that have been created in the system. In the list of sales orders, you can see the sales order that you have just created.

==Step 2: Attaching a File to the Sales Order==
Suppose that you need to attach the scanned purchase order from the GoodFood One Restaurant customer to the sales order for 50 pounds of apples, which you created in the previous step. The file with this scanned purchase order has been provided in the ''U100'' data and has the name <tt>PO&#95;GoodFood1Restaurant.pdf</tt>.{br}

To attach the file to the existing sales order, do the following:[anchor|#_9ff9151b-eb84-4112-ad23-bef4ce6f2686]
#While you are still viewing the list of sales orders, in the '''Order Nbr.''' column, click the number of the sales order. The [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form opens with the sales order you have created for the GoodFood One Restaurant customer.
#On the form title bar, click '''Files'''. The '''Files''' dialog box opens.
#In the dialog box, click '''Browse''', select the <tt>PO&#95;GoodFood1Restaurant.pdf</tt> file, and upload the file. The file is uploaded to the system; notice that the system has added the link to the uploaded file to the '''Files''' dialog box.
#Close the dialog box.
#:On the form title bar, you can see the number of attached files in parentheses right of the '''Files''' button.

==Step 3: Copying the Sales Order==
Suppose that the FourStar Coffee & Sweets Shop customer ordered 50 pounds of oranges. Most settings of the new sales order are the same as those in the sales order that you created in Step 1. Thus, to quickly create the new sales order, you will copy the existing sales order and change needed settings of the copied order.{br}

To copy the sales order, do the following:[anchor|#_bb1ecfae-7de2-4a89-9d1a-c134708ced4b]
#While you are still viewing the sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, click the '''Actions''' menu button on the form toolbar to view the available menu commands.
#On the '''Actions''' menu, click '''Copy Order'''. The '''Copy To''' dialog box opens.
#:((({S:Hint}An instruction to click a menu command on a menu is typically phrased as follows: On the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Copy Order'''.
)))
#In the dialog box, click '''OK'''. The [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form reopens for the new sales order. Some elements on the form are filled in with the data of the sales order that you have copied.
#In the '''Customer''' box of the form,select ''COFFEESHOP''. 
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, in the '''Inventory ID''' column of the only row, double-click right of the ''APPLES'' link. The value is highlighted.
#:((({S:Warn}If you had instead clicked the link that has the ''APPLES'' value, the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form would open in a pop-up window, displaying the settings of this item.
)))
#In the column, type <tt>orange</tt>.
#In the list of options that appears (which changes as you type), select ''ORANGES - Fresh oranges 1 lb''.
#In the '''Quantity''' column, type <tt>10</tt>.
#In the '''Unit Price''' column, type <tt>2.15</tt>.
#In the '''Description''' box of the Summary area, update the description for the sales order: Type <tt>ORANGES</tt>.
#Click '''Save''' to save the sales order you have copied and changed.

==Step 4: Attaching a Note to the Sales Order==
Suppose that you are going to be absent from the office next week. Your colleague will be working with the FourStar Coffee & Sweets Shop customer during your absence. You need to inform your colleague that you have not yet received a purchase order for the 50 pounds of oranges (for which you created a sales order in the previous step). You usually attach a note to the sales order in this case, to be sure that the information is documented. {br}

To add the note to the sales order, do the following:[anchor|#_8772dd79-8121-44f4-9f88-8b0609fd1475]
#While you are still viewing the sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, on the form title bar, click '''Notes'''. The '''Enter Record Note''' dialog box opens.
#In the dialog box, type the text of the note, and click '''OK'''. On the form title bar, you can see a yellow icon ([image:UserGuide/Images/GS_forms_note_button.png|10px]) left of the '''Notes''' button, which indicates that a note has been added to the sales order.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''. The sales order is saved along with the note you have added to it.
#Click '''Discard Changes and Close''' ([image:UserGuide/Images/GS_UI_form_discard_changes_close_button.png|10px]) to close the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form (you have not made changes to the record since saving the note). The list of sales orders opens. 
#:You can view the note attached to the sales order by clicking [anchor|#_53f250f4-b6ca-49ef-b709-5ae102f50cbf][image:UserGuide/Images/GS_forms_note_button.png|10px] in the '''Notes''' column of the row with the sales order; alternatively, you can open the sales order and then click [anchor|#image_mcz_bxc_dkb][image:UserGuide/Images/GS_forms_note_button.png|10px] on the form title bar, left of the '''Notes''' button.

On the form title bar, you can see the number of                         attached files in parentheses right of the  Files                          button. Step 3: Copying the Sales Order Suppose that the FourStar Coffee & Sweets Shop customer ordered 50 pounds of                 oranges. Most settings of the new sales order are the same as those in the sales                 order that you created in Step 1. Thus, to quickly create the new sales order, you                 will copy the existing sales order and change needed settings of the copied                 order. To copy the sales order, do the following: While you are still viewing the sales order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, click the  Actions  menu button on the                     form toolbar to view the available menu commands. On the  Actions  menu, click  Copy                         Order . The  Copy To  dialog box opens. An instruction to click a menu command on a menu is typically                         phrased as follows: On the form toolbar, click  Actions Copy Order . In the dialog box, click  OK . The   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form reopens for the new sales order.                     Some elements on the form are filled in with the data of the sales order that                     you have copied. In the  Customer  box of the form,select  COFFEESHOP .   On the  Document Details  tab, in the  Inventory                         ID  column of the only row, double-click right of the                          APPLES  link. The value is highlighted. If you                         had instead clicked the link that has the  APPLES  value, the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form would open in a pop-up window,                         displaying the settings of this item. In the column, type  orange . In the list of options that appears (which changes as you type), select                          ORANGES - Fresh oranges 1 lb . In the  Quantity  column, type                      10 . In the  Unit Price  column, type                          2.15 . In the  Description  box of the Summary area, update the                     description for the sales order: Type  ORANGES . Click  Save  to save the sales order you have copied and                     changed. Step 4: Attaching a Note to the Sales Order Suppose that you are going to be absent from the office next week. Your colleague                 will be working with the FourStar Coffee & Sweets Shop customer during your                 absence. You need to inform your colleague that you have not yet received a purchase                 order for the 50 pounds of oranges (for which you created a sales order in the                 previous step). You usually attach a note to the sales order in this case, to be                 sure that the information is documented.  To add the note to the sales order, do the following: While you are still viewing the sales order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, on the form title bar, click  Notes .                     The  Enter Record Note  dialog box opens. In the dialog box, type the text of the note, and click                          OK . On the form title bar, you can see a yellow icon                         ( ) left of the                          Notes  button, which indicates that a note has been                     added to the sales order. On the form toolbar, click  Save . The sales order is saved                     along with the note you have added to it. Click  Discard Changes and Close  ( )                     to close the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form (you have not made                     changes to the record since saving the note). The list of sales orders opens.                          You can view the note attached to the sales order by clicking                               in the                              Notes  column of the row with the sales order;                         alternatively, you can open the sales order and then click                               on the form title bar, left of the                              Notes  button. ]]></column>

During the normal course of business, you may need to enter recurring or similar records (documents, transactions, classes, or profiles)—some of which include many lines—repeatedly. To help you minimize input errors and save time, Acumatica ERP provides document templates for data entry forms and maintenance forms and copy-and-paste options for many forms. When you&rsquo;re creating a new record, you can use either functionality to ease this process.{br}{TOC}
==Copying and Pasting==
In Acumatica ERP, you can easily create a new record by copying and pasting the data of an existing record of the same type. This functionality can also be used to create new records, such as vendor or customer classes, by copying existing records. For applicable forms, the copying and pasting options are offered on the '''Edit''' menu on the form toolbar.{br}

Because classes are usually created during implementation, there is seldom a need to save and keep templates for them, but it may be helpful later to copy and paste an existing class. Generally, you first create the default vendor or customer class that includes the values that suit most vendors or customers; when you create a new class, you will see elements filled in with the values from the default class. With copy-and-paste functionality, you can create a new class based on a non-default class. To do so, complete the following steps: 
#On the appropriate form, bring up the class you want to copy.
#On the '''Clipboard''' menu on the form toolbar, select '''Copy'''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Insert''' to clear the elements for a new object.
#On the '''Clipboard''' menu, select '''Paste'''.
#Type the name for the new class.
#Edit the elements with different values for the new class than for the original class.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save''' to save the new class.

This functionality works similarly for  various types of records, such as transaction or profile; bring up the appropriate form for the record and follow the instructions above. [anchor|#_75c065d1-ccb7-427a-ab17-2c5f14b2afde]((({S:Hint}If a record contains more than 1000 detail lines, only the first 1000 detail lines are copied to a new record.
)))
==Using Templates==
You can create an unlimited number of templates for various records—such as bills, invoices, sales orders, or purchase orders—through the appropriate data entry forms. You can also use templates for most records created by maintenance forms. These records include customer and vendor classes, stock and non-stock items, warehouses, kit specifications, and mailing lists. Also, you can create templates for customer or vendor business accounts. You even can create a template of a chart of inter-branch account mapping. {br}

Template features include the following: 
*All element values can be changed.
*Default values can be used (rather than values determined by the template) for correct date calculations.
*New lines can be added to a template or to a template-based new record.
*The template doesn&rsquo;t have to be a complete record with all the elements filled in.
*Templates have user-provided names.

Once you open a record that you want to use as a template for similar records, create the template based on the record as follows: 
#On the '''Clipboard''' menu on the form toolbar, select '''Save as Template'''. 
#:The system navigates to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_90_20|Document Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=SM209020|SM209020]) form, where you can see the selected a record with all its values.
#Provide a brief description for the template. This description will also be used as the template identifier.
#In the '''Values''' table, make sure that no element holds the document reference number; a new reference number will be generated for any record based on this template.
#For date- or period-related elements (such as document date, post period, due date, and cash discount date), clear the '''Active''' check boxes. For any new record, another date will be needed. Values based on the document date will be calculated automatically, based on the document date and the credit terms associated with the customer or vendor.
#Also clear the '''Active''' check box for the vendor or customer reference number provided for the record. You need to type new values for new documents.
#Save the template.

==Testing the Template==
To test the template, proceed as follows: 
#Return to the initial form that was used to create the template.
#Click '''Insert''' on the form toolbar.
#On the '''Clipboard''' menu, select the '''Paste''' option.
#Check that the record has the appropriate date, post period, and amounts. If so, click '''Save''' on the form toolbar; if not, modify the template by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_90_20|Document Templates] form accordingly: 
#*If some of the values inherited from the original record are not appropriate, modify the values.
#*If some of the elements should have default values rather than values from the template, clear the respective '''Active''' check box.
#*Save the template.

If needed, repeat these steps to test the template again.

In the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202520|SM202520]) Search in Files (SM202520) form that opens, search for                     needed files. In the right pane of the form do one of the following:  If you want to attach one file, select the file you want to attach and                             click  Add Link and Close . If you want to attach multiple files, select the file you want to attach                             and click  Add Link . Repeat this step for other                             files you want to add. You can click  Add Link and                                 Close  for the last file or simply close the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202520|SM202520]) Search in Files (SM202520) form. The system attaches the files to the record and increments the counter of files                 attached. To Attach a File to a Record Detail Open the form, and select the record you want to attach the file to. In the table, at the beginning of the appropriate detail row, click Files to                     open the  Files  dialog box. In the  Files  dialog box, click  Add                         Link .

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[In the following sections, you will find information about Acumatica ERP dashboards and the basic steps of designing dashboards.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#_c2a619d3-2413-451e-980b-eee54172584d]
*Identify the basic elements of an Acumatica ERP dashboard and their functions
*Recognize the types of widgets and their main features
*List the basic steps of designing a dashboard
*Modify your copy of a dashboard
*Define a dashboard as your home page
*Reset a dashboard

==Applicable Scenarios==
You should learn about the Acumatica ERP dashboards in either of the following cases:[anchor|#_d5d6e791-c6de-47d1-94ef-a6d344c2d011]
*You need to monitor real-time operational metrics related to your work.
*You need to modify a dashboard to fit your requirements.

==Dashboards==
With Acumatica ERP dashboards, you can monitor current financial, operational, and organizational information of your company, and analyze real-time trends that relate to your job. On dashboards, different types of information can be displayed in various presentation forms—such as text, charts, graphs, and tables—depending on your preferences and the specific type of data you want to see. {br}

A dashboard is a collection of widgets that are displayed on a single screen. Acumatica ERP dashboards support various types of widgets, which have drill-down capabilities. By using the drill-down capabilities, you can navigate directly from a dashboard widget to the source of the data you are viewing, so that you can learn more about and take actions on the data that is highlighted on the dashboard. This data might be, for example, key customers’ details for the past 12 months, or the number of projects that will be closed within 30 days.{br}

You can create a dashboard if you have access to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_86_00|Dashboards] ([~/?ScreenId=SM208600|SM208600]) form. Among the dashboard settings, you can specify the dashboard owner role for this dashboard. A user who has been assigned the dashboard owner role can design this dashboard from scratch, share the dashboard with other users, and enable other users to personalize the dashboard. ((({S:Warn}If you will be designing this dashboard, be sure to select a role that you are assigned to as the dashboard owner role. Otherwise, you will be working with your personal copy of the dashboard, and other users will not see any widgets that you add to the dashboard.
)))
==Types of Widgets==
A widget is a dashboard component that provides a particular type of information, such as a real-time data view or wiki article.{br}

Before you modify a dashboard, you need to plan how many widgets and which types you will add to it. We recommend that you add no more than seven to ten widgets to a particular dashboard. If a dashboard is cluttered with too many widgets, the users viewing the dashboard cannot understand the data quickly and easily.{br}

You can add to a dashboard the following types of widgets:[anchor|#_d4ca5992-65a8-4ad7-99db-f3be5995ad6e]
*A chart: A graphical representation of data from an Acumatica ERP form. You can use charts of various types, such as bar charts and line charts.
*A data table: A systematic display of data from an Acumatica ERP form, with data arranged into rows and columns.
*An embedded page: A document or an image that is stored on an external resource, such as cloud storage.
*A pivot table: A data table organized to filter, sort, count, total, or give the average of data from an Acumatica ERP inquiry, displaying the summarized results in a separate table.
*A Power BI tile: A chart, scorecard, or other analytical information that is represented on a Power BI dashboard designed by your organization.
*A scorecard KPI: A statistical record that measures progress or achievement toward a set performance indicator by showing parameters that are important to the business processes of your organization and should be monitored daily.
*A trend card KPI: A statistical record showing parameters whose dynamic change is important to the business processes of your organization.
*A wiki page: A reference topic, procedure, business plan, or other content that is frequently consulted by Acumatica ERP users.

Most types of widgets are based on data from generic inquiries. A generic inquiry is a user-definable (generally by a developer or system administrator) tool that collects data from the system database and displays the query results on an Acumatica ERP form. {br}

If you have access rights to view the form a particular widget is based on, you can do the following:[anchor|#_11d5080d-ce50-401c-8ed5-d820e5a620d5]
*During dashboard design: Select for the widget the data that is displayed on the widget and drill down as needed for more details
*While you are viewing the dashboard: View the widget, which displays data from the form

For details, see [HelpRoot_Interface\DB__mng_UIG_Dashboards|Dashboards].
==Dashboard Modes==
In Acumatica ERP, dashboards can be displayed in view or design mode. When you open a dashboard, it is displayed in view mode. To modify a dashboard (if you have access rights to do so), you switch to design mode, which is described in the following sections.
==Basic Elements of a Dashboard in Design Mode==
When a dashboard is in design mode, you may see the following basic elements on the dashboard.[anchor|#_32c0e0c0-8a69-4956-89ba-cdf3542f3b2a][anchor|#_9ae35f09-5c9c-48d4-96da-a6a6c189cfcf][image:UserGuide/Images/GS_dashboards_basic_elements_in_editing_mode.png|popup|Basic elements of a dashboard in design mode|450px][anchor|#_e7796cb5-638e-402f-b4db-9eab5975782b]

Learning Objectives In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following: Identify the basic elements of an  Acumatica ERP      dashboard and their functions Recognize the types of widgets and their main features List the basic steps of designing a dashboard Modify your copy of a dashboard Define a dashboard as your home page Reset a dashboard Applicable Scenarios You should learn about the  Acumatica ERP     dashboards in either of the following cases: You need to monitor real-time operational metrics related to your work. You need to modify a dashboard to fit your requirements. Dashboards With  Acumatica ERP     dashboards, you can monitor current financial, operational, and organizational information of     your company, and analyze real-time trends that relate to your job. On dashboards, different     types of information can be displayed in various presentation forms—such as text, charts,     graphs, and tables—depending on your preferences and the specific type of data you want to     see.  A dashboard is a collection of widgets that are displayed on a single screen.  Acumatica ERP     dashboards support various types of widgets, which have drill-down capabilities. By using the     drill-down capabilities, you can navigate directly from a dashboard widget to the source of the     data you are viewing, so that you can learn more about and take actions on the data that is     highlighted on the dashboard. This data might be, for example, key customers’ details for the     past 12 months, or the number of projects that will be closed within 30 days. You can create a dashboard if you have access to the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM208600|SM208600]) Dashboards     (SM208600) form. Among the dashboard settings, you can specify the dashboard owner role for this     dashboard. A user who has been assigned the dashboard owner role can design this dashboard from     scratch, share the dashboard with other users, and enable other users to personalize the     dashboard.  If you will be designing this dashboard, be sure to select a      role that you are assigned to as the dashboard owner role. Otherwise, you will be working with      your personal copy of the dashboard, and other users will not see any widgets that you add to      the dashboard. Types of Widgets A widget is a dashboard component that provides a particular type of information, such as a     real-time data view or wiki article. Before you modify a dashboard, you need to plan how many widgets and which types you will add     to it. We recommend that you add no more than seven to ten widgets to a particular dashboard. If     a dashboard is cluttered with too many widgets, the users viewing the dashboard cannot     understand the data quickly and easily. You can add to a dashboard the following types of widgets: A chart: A graphical representation of data from an  Acumatica ERP      form. You can use charts of various types, such as bar charts and line charts. A data table: A systematic display of data from an  Acumatica ERP      form, with data arranged into rows and columns. An embedded page: A document or an image that is stored on an external resource, such as      cloud storage. A pivot table: A data table organized to filter, sort, count, total, or give the average of      data from an  Acumatica ERP      inquiry, displaying the summarized results in a separate table. A Power BI tile: A chart, scorecard, or other analytical information that is represented on      a Power BI dashboard designed by your organization. A scorecard KPI: A statistical record that measures progress or achievement toward a set      performance indicator by showing parameters that are important to the business processes of      your organization and should be monitored daily. A trend card KPI: A statistical record showing parameters whose dynamic change is important      to the business processes of your organization. A wiki page: A reference topic, procedure, business plan, or other content that is      frequently consulted by  Acumatica ERP      users. Most types of widgets are based on data from generic inquiries. A generic inquiry is a     user-definable (generally by a developer or system administrator) tool that collects data from     the system database and displays the query results on an  Acumatica ERP     form.  If     you have access rights to view the form  a particular widget is based on, you     can do the following: During dashboard design: Select for the widget the data that is displayed on the widget and      drill down as needed for more details While you are viewing the dashboard: View the widget, which displays data from the form For details, see  Dashboards. Dashboard Modes In  Acumatica ERP,     dashboards can be displayed in view or design mode. When you open a dashboard, it is displayed     in view mode.      To     modify a dashboard  (if you have access rights to do so), you switch to design     mode, which is described in the following sections. Basic Elements of a Dashboard in Design Mode When a dashboard is in design mode, you may see the following basic elements on the     dashboard. Basic elements of a dashboard in design mode The dashboard title bar, which you can use to invoke needed actions. A widget in design mode. A widget with unavailable data. If you do not have access rights to view a form, you cannot      view the data in the widget. This is true of both view mode and design mode. A title bar of a widget, with buttons you can click to edit or delete the widget. A blank widget in design mode. A widget placeholder. You can add a new widget or replace with an existing widget this UI      element. The  Reset to Default  button.

The following activity will walk you through the process of modifying your copy of an Acumatica ERP dashboard. This activity will also introduce you to the use of the drill-down capability to obtain more detail about the data that is displayed in a widget of the dashboard.
==Story==
Suppose that you are David Chubb, a new sales manager of the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company. You have been using a predefined dashboard to stay informed about overdue customers. You need to create your own copy of the dashboard in order to monitor your overdue customers and the quantities of available items that you can sell.
==Process Overview==
In this process activity, you will do the following:[anchor|#_da25f6bd-eafd-455a-b199-7a84790947e4]
#Switch on design mode for the predefined dashboard
#Modify a widget
#Drill down to the underlying data shown in a widget
#Remove widgets from the dashboard
#Rearrange widgets on the dashboard
#Resize a widget
#Select the dashboard layout template
#Add a widget to a dashboard
#Specify the dashboard as your Acumatica ERP home page
#Reset the modified dashboard to the default view

==System Preparation==
Before you start modifying a dashboard in Acumatica ERP, make sure that the following tasks have been performed:[anchor|#_e5a88d9d-f3eb-4ea9-9977-46523d0e1427]
*You have installed an Acumatica ERP instance with the ''U100'' dataset, or a system administrator has performed this task for you.
*You have signed in to Acumatica ERP with the following credentials:
**User name: ''chubb''
**Password: ''123''
*:For details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS_Accessing_Acumatica_ERP_Process_Activity|Accessing Acumatica ERP: Process Activity].
*The business date in your system is set to 1/30/2020. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button in the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, and select 1/30/2020 in the calendar.

==Step 1: Switching On Design Mode for the Predefined Dashboard==
Suppose that you need to save a copy of the dashboard and switch it to design mode, to modify it for your personal use.{br}

To switch on design mode of the dashboard, do the following:[anchor|#_00521501-c8bf-4881-86e9-507db9ec8f72]
#Open the '''Dashboards''' workspace.
#:((({S:Hint}To open the '''Dashboards ''' workspace more quickly during this activity, add the workspace to the main menu, as described in the [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS_Learning_UI_Process_Activity|Learning About the Acumatica ERP UI: Process Activity].
)))
#In the '''Dashboard: Finance''' category, click ''Controller''. The ''Controller'' dashboard opens.
#On the dashboard title bar, click the '''Create User Copy''' button. The system creates your personal copy of the dashboard. Notice that the '''Design''' button has appeared on the dashboard title bar.
#:((({S:Warn}You can see the '''Create User Copy''' button on the dashboard title bar before you switch on design mode for a dashboard for the first time. When you have created your copy of the dashboard, the '''Design''' button is displayed on the dashboard title bar.
)))
#Click the '''Design''' button. You have switched the dashboard to design mode.

==Step 2: Modifying a Widget==
Suppose that in the existing ''Top Overdue Balances'' widget, you need to add to the chart a legend that has the invoice amount for each customer.{br}

To modify the widget in this way, do the following:[anchor|#_41e26b04-55c7-4dd3-9c48-23a821a34367]
#While you are still viewing the ''Controller'' dashboard in design mode, on the widget title bar of the ''Top Overdue Balances'' widget, click the Edit button ([image:UserGuide/Images/GS_dashboards_edit_button.png|10px]). The '''Widget Properties''' dialog box opens.
#In the dialog box, click '''Configure'''. The '''Chart Settings''' dialog box opens.
#In the '''Legend''' box of the '''Series''' section, select ''Invoice Amount''.
#In the '''Legend Position''' box, select ''Bottom''.
#Click '''OK''' to close the '''Chart Settings''' dialog box.
#In the '''Widget Properties''' dialog box, click '''Finish'''. Notice that the view of the chart has changed so that the invoice amount for each customer is displayed in the legend of the chart. 
#:You can see the modified ''Top Overdue Balances'' widget in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_46b15949-bcf0-4706-880c-d8a84b48f896][image:UserGuide/Images/GS_dashboards_modified_dashboard_0.png|popup|The modified Top Overdue Balances widget|450px]
#On the dashboard title bar, click the '''Design''' button to switch to view mode for the dashboard.

==Step 3: Drilling Down to the Underlying Data of a Widget==
Suppose that while viewing the ''Controller'' dashboard, you need to quickly open the overdue balance details for the HM’s Bakery & Cafe customer.{br}

To view the data that the widget is based on, do the following:[anchor|#_2ed68360-c08d-4391-b948-328cbb4631f1]
#Point at the title of the ''Top Overdue Balances'' widget, and notice that it is a button you can click.
#Click the '''Top Overdue Balances''' button. The '''Overdue''' tab of the ''DB AR Customer Summary (GI000049)'' inquiry form opens in a new browser tab, where you can see the overdue balance details for HM’s Bakery & Cafe. You can close this tab when you are done viewing the inquiry form.
#:((({S:Hint}To drill down to the underlying data of such widgets as a Power BI tile, a scorecard KPI, or a trend card KPI, you can click the needed tile to view the data that the tile in the widget is based on.
)))

==Step 4: Removing Widgets from the Dashboard==
Suppose that in your copy of the ''Controller'' dashboard, you do not need the following widgets, which are related to cash: ''Cash Position'', ''Cash On-Hand'', ''Cash Required: 30 Days'', ''Cash Required: 60 Days'', the widget with unavailable data, and any blank widgets.{br}

To remove these widgets from the dashboard, do the following:[anchor|#_dd3cd04b-de82-4061-a462-02f382903be9]
#While you are again viewing the ''Controller'' dashboard in view mode, click the '''Design''' button on the dashboard title bar to switch on design mode for the dashboard.
#On the widget title bar of the ''Cash Position'' widget, click the Remove button ([image:UserGuide/Images/GS_dashboards_remove_button.png|The modified Top Overdue Balances widget|10px]). The warning dialog box opens.
#In the warning dialog box, click '''OK'''. The widget is removed from the dashboard, and the remaining widgets are automatically rearranged.
#By performing similar actions to those in the previous two instructions, delete the following widgets from your dashboard:
##''Cash On-Hand''
## ''Cash Required: 30 Days''
## ''Cash Required: 60 Days''
##A widget with unavailable data; for such a widget, a gray lock icon is shown against a white background
##Any blank widgets (those in which you see only a white background and the widget toolbar)
#:You can see the modified dashboard in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_404261d2-f73d-4120-a619-adb4762d59fc][image:UserGuide/Images/GS_dashboards_modified_dashboard_1.png|popup|The dashboard without the widgets related to cash|450px]
#On the dashboard title bar, click the '''Design''' button to switch to view mode for the dashboard.

==Step 5: Rearranging Widgets on the Dashboard==
Suppose that you want to move the ''Top Overdue Balances'' widget to the lower-left part of the dashboard.{br}

To rearrange widgets on the dashboard, do the following:[anchor|#_fd7b3a14-3f2e-4b80-9fa1-f666b12ed949]
#While you are still viewing the ''Controller'' dashboard in view mode, click the '''Design''' button on the dashboard title bar to switch on design mode.
#Drag the ''Top Overdue Balances'' widget by its title bar to the lower-left part of the dashboard.

You can see the modified dashboard in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_3b887ef3-e951-46ca-a35e-06a787737750][anchor|#_7b0a6dc7-05aa-4f82-b620-7e3ea6f13c48][image:UserGuide/Images/GS_dashboards_modified_dashboard_2.1.png|popup|The Top Overdue Balances widget moved to the lower-left part of the dashboard|450px]
==Step 6: Resizing a Widget==
Suppose that you want to make the ''Top Overdue Balances'' widget larger.{br}

To resize the widget, do the following:[anchor|#_d5fbd54c-351f-474b-a5fe-064012017fa8]
#While you are still viewing the ''Controller'' dashboard in design mode, drag the bottom right corner of the ''Top Overdue Balances'' widget to the right to make it larger (the width of the widget should be about half of the width of the working area).
#:You can see the modified dashboard in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_762dad3a-7039-4a72-92a5-0636a9940322][image:UserGuide/Images/GS_dashboards_modified_dashboard_2.2.png|popup|The resized Top Overdue Balances widget|450px]
#On the dashboard title bar, click the '''Design''' button to switch to view mode for the dashboard.

==Step 7: Selecting a Template for the Dashboard Layout ==
Suppose that you want to arrange the widgets on the dashboard so that the left column takes two-thirds of the working area width. {br}

To select a dashboard layout template, do the following:[anchor|#_b4fa5a34-015e-4d82-b516-817d4db8bf1a]
#While you are still viewing the ''Controller'' dashboard in view mode, click the '''Design''' button on the dashboard title bar to switch on design mode for the dashboard.
#On the dashboard title bar, click the '''Edit Layout''' button.
#In the '''Dashboard Layouts''' dialog box, which opens, do the following:
##Select the layout template that has a wide left column (two-thirds of the working area) and a narrow right column (one-third of the working area).
##Click '''OK'''. The dialog box is closed, and the dashboard widgets are arranged within the selected layout. You can see the modified dashboard, with the left column taking two-thirds of the working area, in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_015b29d0-e380-4dff-8dec-8b6d4fde803a][image:UserGuide/Images/GS_dashboards_modified_dashboard_3.png|popup|The dashboard layout with the wider left column|450px]
#On the dashboard title bar, click the '''Design''' button to switch to view mode for the dashboard.

==Step 8: Adding a Data Table Widget to the Dashboard==
Suppose that in January 2020, your supplier has been experiencing delays in delivering apples. Thus, on the dashboard, you need to monitor the quantity of apples that are available for selling. {br}

To add a data table widget to the dashboard, do the following:[anchor|#_a33d6460-9613-4215-a038-60ae770d1797]
#While you are still viewing the ''Controller'' dashboard in view mode, click the '''Design''' button on the dashboard title bar to switch on design mode for the dashboard.
#In the widget placeholder in the right part of the screen, click ''add a new widget''. The '''Add Widget''' dialog box opens.
#In the '''Add Widget''' dialog box, select '''Data Table'''.
#Click '''Next'''.
#In the '''Widget Properties''' dialog box, which opens, select the generic inquiry as follows:
##In the '''Inquiry Screen''' box, click the magnifier icon. The lookup table opens.

##In the '''Title''' column, double-click the ''Inventory Summary'' name of the generic inquiry, which closes the lookup table and fills in the '''Inquiry Screen''' box of the dialog box.
#Specify the generic inquiry parameters as follows:
##Click '''Inquiry Parameters'''. The '''Inquiry Parameters''' dialog box opens.
##In the dialog box, specify the values of the inquiry parameters as follows:
##*For the '''Inventory ID''' parameter, select ''APPLES''.
##*For the '''Warehouse''' parameter, select ''WHOLESALE''.
##:((({S:Hint}To select each of these values, you first double-click in the '''Value''' column for the needed row. Then you can click the magnifier icon and select the value in the lookup table, or you can start typing the value in the column and select the value from the list of options containing the typed string.
)))
##Clear the check boxes in the '''Use Default Value''' column for the following parameters:
##*'''Expand by Lot/Serial Number'''
##* '''Subitem'''
##* '''Location'''
##Click '''OK'''.
#In the '''Widget Properties''' dialog box (which you return to after closing the '''Inquiry Parameters''' dialog box), specify column settings for the data table as follows:
##Click '''Column Settings'''.
##In the '''Column Settings''' dialog box, which opens, move columns from the '''Selected Columns''' list to the '''Available Columns''' list by selecting each needed column and then clicking the arrow pointing left. The ''' Selected Columns''' list should contain the following columns:
##*'''Inventory ID'''
##* '''Available'''
##* '''Warehouse'''
##* '''On Hand'''
##Click '''OK'''. The '''Column Settings''' dialog box is closed.
#In the '''Caption''' box of the '''Widget Properties''' dialog box (to which you return), type <tt>APPLES</tt> to specify the title of the widget.
#Click '''Finish''' to create the widget with the settings you have specified, save it, and add it to the dashboard.
#Drag the right border of the '''Apples''' widget to the right to make it larger, so that it takes the whole right column. You can see the modified dashboard with the new data table widget in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_b8e92b5d-3a54-4629-b40f-0ffa700870dd][image:UserGuide/Images/GS_dashboards_modified_dashboard_4.png|popup|The dashboard with the data table widget|450px]
#On the dashboard title bar, click the '''Design''' button to switch to view mode for the dashboard.

==Step 9: Defining the Dashboard as Your Acumatica ERP Home Page==
To make your modified ''Controller'' dashboard your home page in Acumatica ERP, do the following:[anchor|#_51c6b079-8d05-4ea0-80ff-113dc6189c7c]
#In the top pane, click the User menu button (where your user name appears), and on the User menu, click '''My Profile'''. The [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\SM_20_30_10|User Profile] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) form opens.
#On the '''General Info''' tab ('''Personal Settings''' section), in the '''Home Page''' box, click the magnifier icon to open the lookup table.
#In the Search box of the lookup table, type <tt>controller</tt> to search for the ''Controller'' dashboard.
#In the '''Title''' column, double-click ''Controller'' to select the value, close the lookup table, and fill in the '''Home Page''' box.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save''' to save your changes.
#In the upper left corner of the Acumatica ERP screen, click the Home button to make sure that the ''Controller'' dashboard, which you have defined as your home page, opens.

==Step 10: Resetting the Dashboard ==
Suppose that due to changes in your job responsibilities, you do not need your user copy of the dashboard and you would like to return to using the predefined ''Controller'' dashboard, which you used before creating a copy and personalizing it.{br}

To reset the dashboard, do the following while you are still viewing the ''Controller'' dashboard:[anchor|#_fa14bb9f-ca4f-4379-9289-96a8d95862c6]
#On the dashboard title bar, click the '''Design''' button to switch on design mode.

Step 1: Switching On Design Mode for the Predefined Dashboard Suppose that you need to save a copy of the dashboard and switch it to design mode,                 to modify it for your personal use. To switch on design mode of the dashboard, do the following: Open the  Dashboards  workspace. To open                         the  Dashboards   workspace more quickly during this                         activity, add the workspace to the main menu, as described in the  Learning About the Acumatica ERP UI: Process Activity. In the  Dashboard: Finance  category, click                          Controller . The  Controller  dashboard opens. On the dashboard title bar, click the  Create User Copy                      button. The system creates your personal copy of the dashboard. Notice that the                          Design  button has appeared on the dashboard title                         bar. You can see the  Create User                             Copy  button on the dashboard title bar before you switch on                         design mode for a dashboard for the first time. When you have created your                         copy of the dashboard, the  Design  button is displayed                         on the dashboard title bar. Click the  Design  button. You have switched the dashboard                     to design mode. Step 2: Modifying a Widget Suppose that in the existing  Top Overdue Balances  widget, you need to add to                 the chart a legend that has the invoice amount for each customer. To modify the widget in this way, do the following: While                     you are still viewing the  Controller  dashboard in design                     mode , on the widget title bar                      of                     the  Top Overdue Balances  widge t, click the Edit button                         ( ).                     The  Widget Properties  dialog box opens. In the dialog box, click  Configure . The  Chart                         Settings  dialog box opens. In the  Legend  box of the  Series                      section, select  Invoice Amount . In the  Legend Position  box, select  Bottom . Click  OK  to close the  Chart                         Settings  dialog box. In the  Widget Properties  dialog box, click                          Finish . Notice that the view of the chart has changed                     so that the invoice amount for each customer is displayed in the legend of the                     chart.  You can see the modified  Top Overdue Balances  widget in the                         following screenshot. The modified Top Overdue Balances widget On the dashboard title bar, click the  Design  button to                     switch to view mode for the dashboard. Step 3: Drilling Down to the Underlying Data of a Widget Suppose that while viewing the  Controller  dashboard, you need to quickly open                 the overdue balance details for the HM’s Bakery & Cafe customer. To view the data that the widget is based on, do the following: Point at the title of the  Top Overdue Balances  widget, and notice that it                     is a button you can click. Click the  Top Overdue Balances  button. The                          Overdue  tab of the  DB AR Customer Summary                         (GI000049)  inquiry form opens in a new browser tab, where you can see                     the overdue balance details for HM’s Bakery & Cafe. You can close this tab                     when you are done viewing the inquiry form. To drill down to the                         underlying data of such widgets as a Power BI tile, a scorecard KPI, or a                         trend card KPI, you can click the needed tile to view the data that the tile                         in the widget is based on. Step 4: Removing Widgets from the Dashboard Suppose that in your copy of the  Controller  dashboard, you do not need the                 following widgets, which are related to cash:  Cash Position ,  Cash                     On-Hand ,  Cash Required: 30 Days ,  Cash Required: 60 Days , the                 widget with unavailable data, and any blank widgets. To remove these widgets from the dashboard, do the following: While you are again viewing the  Controller  dashboard in view mode, click                     the  Design  button on the dashboard title bar to switch on                     design mode for the dashboard. On the widget title bar of the  Cash Position  widget, click the Remove                     button ( ).                     The warning dialog box opens. In the warning dialog box, click  OK . The widget is                     removed from the dashboard, and the remaining widgets are automatically                     rearranged. By performing similar actions to those in the previous two instructions, delete                     the following widgets from your dashboard: Cash On-Hand Cash Required: 30 Days Cash Required: 60 Days A widget with unavailable data; for such a widget, a gray lock icon is                             shown against a white background Any blank widgets (those in which you see only a white background and                             the widget toolbar) You can see the modified dashboard in the following screenshot. The dashboard without the widgets related to cash On the dashboard title bar, click the  Design  button to                     switch to view mode for the dashboard. Step 5: Rearranging Widgets on the Dashboard Suppose that you want to move the  Top Overdue Balances  widget to the                 lower-left part of the dashboard. To rearrange widgets on the dashboard, do the following: While you are still viewing the  Controller  dashboard in view mode, click                     the  Design  button on the dashboard title bar to switch on                     design mode. Drag the  Top Overdue Balances  widget by its title bar to the lower-left                     part of the dashboard. You can see the modified dashboard in the following screenshot. The Top Overdue Balances widget moved to the lower-left part of the                     dashboard Step 6: Resizing a Widget Suppose that you want to make the  Top Overdue Balances  widget larger. To resize the widget, do the following: While you are still viewing the  Controller  dashboard in design mode, drag                     the bottom right corner of the  Top Overdue Balances  widget to the right                     to make it larger (the width of the widget should be about half of the width of                     the working area). You can see the modified dashboard in the following                         screenshot. The resized Top Overdue Balances widget On the dashboard title bar, click the  Design  button to                     switch to view mode for the dashboard. Step 7: Selecting a Template for the Dashboard Layout  Suppose                 that you want to arrange the widgets on the dashboard so that the left column takes                 two-thirds of the working area width.  To select a dashboard layout template,  do the following: While you are still viewing the  Controller  dashboard in view mode, click                     the  Design  button on the dashboard title bar to switch on                     design mode for the dashboard. On the dashboard title bar, click the  Edit Layout                      button. In the  Dashboard Layouts  dialog box, which opens, do the                         following: Select the layout template that has a wide left column (two-thirds of                             the working area) and a narrow right column (one-third of the working                             area). Click  OK . The dialog box is closed, and the                             dashboard widgets are arranged within the selected layout. You can see                             the modified dashboard, with the left column taking two-thirds of the                             working area, in the following screenshot. The dashboard layout with the wider left column On the dashboard title bar, click the  Design  button to                     switch to view mode for the dashboard. Step 8: Adding a Data Table Widget to the Dashboard Suppose that in January  2020, your supplier has been experiencing delays in delivering apples. Thus, on the                 dashboard, you need to monitor the quantity of apples that are available for                 selling.  To add a data table widget to the dashboard, do the following: While you are still viewing the  Controller  dashboard in view mode, click                     the  Design  button on the dashboard title bar to switch on                     design mode for the dashboard. In the widget placeholder in the right part of the screen, click  add a new                         widget . The  Add Widget  dialog box opens. In the  Add Widget  dialog box, select  Data                         Table . Click  Next . In the  Widget Properties  dialog box, which opens, select                     the generic inquiry as follows: In the  Inquiry Screen  box, click the magnifier                             icon. The lookup table opens. In the Search box, type  inventory summary . In the  Title  column, double-click the                                  Inventory Summary  name of the generic inquiry, which closes                             the lookup table and fills in the  Inquiry Screen                              box of the dialog box. Specify the generic inquiry parameters as follows: Click  Inquiry Parameters . The  Inquiry                                 Parameters  dialog box opens. In the dialog box, specify the values of the inquiry parameters as                                 follows: For the  Inventory ID  parameter, select                                          APPLES . For the  Warehouse  parameter, select                                          WHOLESALE . To select each of these values, you first                                 double-click in the  Value  column for the                                 needed row. Then you can click the magnifier icon and select the                                 value in the lookup table, or you can start typing the value in the                                 column and select the value from the list of options containing the                                 typed string. Clear the check boxes in the  Use Default Value                              column for the following parameters: Expand by Lot/Serial Number Subitem Location Click  OK . In the  Widget Properties  dialog box (which you return to                     after closing the  Inquiry Parameters  dialog box), specify                     column settings for the data table as follows: Click  Column Settings . In the  Column Settings  dialog box, which opens,                             move columns from the  Selected Columns  list to                             the  Available Columns  list by selecting each                             needed column and then clicking the arrow pointing left. The                                   Selected Columns  list should contain the following                                  columns : Inventory ID Available Warehouse On Hand Click  OK . The  Column                                 Settings  dialog box is closed. In the  Caption  box of the  Widget                         Properties  dialog box (to which you return), type                          APPLES  to specify the title of the widget. Click  Finish  to create the widget with the settings you                     have specified, save it, and add it to the dashboard. Drag the right border of the  Apples  widget to the right                     to make it larger, so that it takes the whole right column. You can see the                     modified dashboard with the new data table widget in the following                         screenshot. The dashboard with the data table widget On the dashboard title bar, click the  Design  button to                     switch to view mode for the dashboard. Step 9: Defining the Dashboard as Your  Acumatica ERP Home Page To make your modified  Controller  dashboard your home page in  Acumatica ERP, do the following: In the top pane, click the User menu button (where your user name appears), and                     on the User menu, click  My Profile . The   ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) User Profile (SM203010) form opens. On the  General Info  tab ( Personal                         Settings  section), in the  Home Page  box,                     click the magnifier icon to open the lookup table. In the Search box of the lookup table, type  controller  to                     search for the  Controller  dashboard. In the  Title  column, double-click  Controller  to                     select the value, close the lookup table, and fill in the  Home                         Page  box. On the form toolbar, click  Save  to save your                     changes. In the upper left corner of the  Acumatica ERP screen, click the Home button to make sure that the  Controller                      dashboard, which you have defined as your home page, opens. Step 10: Resetting the Dashboard  Suppose that due to changes in your job responsibilities, you do not need your user                 copy of the dashboard and you would like to return to using the predefined                      Controller  dashboard, which you used before creating a copy and                 personalizing it. To reset the dashboard, do the following while you are still viewing the                      Controller  dashboard: On the dashboard title bar, click the  Design  button to                     switch on design mode. Click the  Reset to Default  button to replace the settings                     of your copy of the dashboard with the settings of the predefined                     dashboard. ]]></column>

==Adding Parameters to the Selection Area==
If you want to provide users with ability to filter data on widgets on the fly, you can add parameters to the Selection area of a dashboard; the functionality of these parameters is similar to that of the parameters in the Selection area of inquiry forms. When users select parameter values, the system filters the data on all applicable widgets by these values. You can configure filters for the following types of widgets (those that display data from generic inquiries):[anchor|#_7a7c1423-3d1d-45e8-987d-73d7a32868a0]
*Chart
*Data table
*Scorecard KPI
*Trend card KPI
[anchor|#_c8542f28-3bb2-43da-af36-885d10b9d53c]((({S:Warn}Widget data can be filtered by the parameter value only if the inquiry form on which the widget is based contains data access class (DAC) field that is used by the parameter.
))){br}

To configure the filtering of data on widgets, you do the following:[anchor|#_5cab6fe4-2fbe-4031-8192-0be36f2c74d6]
#On the '''Parameters''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_86_00|Dashboards] ([~/?ScreenId=SM208600|SM208600]) form, you select the dashboard and then add one parameter or multiple parameters that will be displayed in the Selection area of the dashboard. 
#:((({S:Hint}If you do not have access to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_86_00|Dashboards] form, ask your system administrator to add the required parameter or parameters.
)))
#For each widget whose data should be filtered by the values of the added parameter or parameters, in the '''Filter Settings''' dialog box (which you can open by clicking the '''Filter Settings''' button in the '''Widget Properties''' dialog box), you select the parameters. For details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Add_Parameters_to_Widget_Properties|To Configure Filtering of Widget Data by Dashboard Parameters].
[anchor|#_516a22f0-3648-4d11-a5cb-ceb6f232f9db]
==Cashing of Dashboard Widgets==
When a dashboard with many widgets is refreshed or opened, it may take a lot of time to load data for all widgets. Dashboard widgets can display information that is updated very frequently (such as every five minutes) or very rarely (such as once a week). You, as a dashboard designer, can manage the interval at which the system refreshes data for each widget. {br}

You can specify the interval at which the system refreshes data or switch off caching by using the '''Refresh Data''' box of the '''Widget Properties''' dialog box for any type of widget.{br}

After a dashboard designer specifies the refresh interval for a widget, the system loads the widget data from the database and caches the data when a user opens the dashboard with the widget for the first time. When the dashboard is reopened or the dashboard page is refreshed, by the user, the system displays the data on the widget from the cache (that is, does not load the data from the database) if the data was updated a shorter time ago than the interval specified in the '''Refresh Data''' box.{br}

To switch off caching for a particular widget and make the system to update widget&rsquo;s data each time a dashboard is opened or refreshed, the dashboard designer should select the ''On Page Reload'' option in the '''Refresh Data''' box for the widget.{br}

A user can view information about how much time has passed since the last update of a widget’s data in the pop-up pane that appears when the user points to the widget (as shown in the following screenshot). The user can manually update the widget data by clicking this pane.[anchor|#_12ad0a77-2fbc-494d-845b-366d9f5bf286][anchor|#_46a80e74-c923-4775-9114-1dbb93059dc9][image:Shared/Images/UI_Caching_Dashboard_Widgets_Last_Updated.png|popup|Date and time of the last update of the widget&rsquo;s data|300px]

To switch off caching for a particular widget and make the system to update widget's                 data each time a dashboard is opened or refreshed, the dashboard designer should                 select the  On Page Reload  option in the  Refresh Data                  box for the widget. A user can view information about how much time has passed since the last update of a                 widget’s data in the pop-up pane that appears when the user points to the widget (as                 shown in the following screenshot). The user can manually update the widget data by                 clicking this pane. Date and time of the last update of the widget's data ]]></column>

After the dashboard has been created, you populate it with widgets. Each type of widget has its own specific settings. In this topic, you will read about configuring colors in chart widgets, filtering data on widgets, and updating information on widgets.[anchor|#_4a20b050-e166-42df-804a-499aecc762d0]
==Configuring Colors for Chart Widgets==
You can specify custom colors for series in chart widgets. Series can be displayed on the following types of chart widgets: line, column, stacked column, bar, and stacked bar. You may need to change the default colors of series, for example, to make the dashboard correspond to your corporate style.{br}

To specify the colors depending on the series values, you should use expressions in the '''Color''' box of the '''Chart Settings''' dialog box. For example, to make a chart element red if the series value is ''USD'' and blue if the series value is ''EUR'', you would specify the following expression: {{=Switch(Value = 'USD', '#FF0000', Value = 'EUR', '#0A26FF')}}. For details on expressions, see [HelpRoot_ReportingTools\Using_Expressions|Using Expressions].
==Filtering Data On Widgets==
On widgets that use inquiry forms as their data source (such as charts and scorecard KPI widgets), you can filter data by specific criteria. Acumatica ERP provides you with the following ways to filter data on a particular widget:[anchor|#_ce6c79ee-3e6d-4134-b5dd-28df6641a665]
*By using a shared filter: If any shared filters have been created for the inquiry form that is used as a data source for a widget, you can select any of these shared filters in the '''Shared Filter to Apply''' box in the '''Widget Properties''' dialog box to filter the data on the widget. Only users who can edit the dashboard can change the shared filters for a widget on the dashboard.
*By specifying filtering conditions: You can specify filtering conditions (as you can for reusable filters) in the '''Filter Settings''' dialog box. You open this dialog box by clicking '''Filter Settings''' in the '''Widget Properties''' dialog box, which you open for the widget by clicking Edit on the widget toolbar. (For details, see [HelpRoot_ReportingTools\GI_Reusable_Filters_Mapref|Managing Advanced Filters].) Only users who can edit the dashboard can change filter conditions for a widget on the dashboard.
*By using dashboard parameters: You can add parameters to a dashboard, and users can filter data on widgets as needed by selecting parameter values. For details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__con_Dashboard_Configuration#_f0711e28-0735-43e7-ae16-6bbb1be1b451|Adding Parameters to the Selection Area] in [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__con_Dashboard_Configuration|Dashboard Configuration].

==Updating Information on Widgets==
You can refresh the information on a particular widget by clicking '''Refresh''' in the top left corner of a widget toolbar.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[In the following sections, you will find information about typical Acumatica ERP reports and report parameters.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#_c2a619d3-2413-451e-980b-eee54172584d]
*Identify the basic elements of the report form
*Specify report parameters and generate a report
*Create a report template
*Share your report template
*Set up an ad hoc filter for a report
*Print a report
*Export a report to Excel

==Applicable Scenarios==
You learn about Acumatica ERP reports if you need to quickly obtain the required data from the system in a user-friendly, easy to grasp format in order to view and analyze this data, which can be tailored in both data selection and format. You can also share key information with your colleagues or external organizations.
==Acumatica ERP Reports==
 Acumatica ERP reports are designed to give you a real-time view of your work, and you can adjust the report parameters to meet your specific information needs. With the reports’ drilling capabilities, you can drill down to the level of detail that is affecting your report or explore different report elements.{br}

You can generate the following types of reports:[anchor|#_56aeac4c-2172-438d-9bd1-4493dcc63dc6]
*Standard reports, such as the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\SO_62_05_00|Shipment Summary] ([~/?ScreenId=SO620500|SO620500]) report, [HelpRoot_ReportReference\SO_61_10_00|Sales Order Details by Customer] ([~/?ScreenId=SO611000|SO611000]) report or [HelpRoot_ReportReference\AR_67_60_00|Daily Sales Profitability] ([~/?ScreenId=AR676000|AR676000]) report.
*Printed forms, such as the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\SO_64_10_10|Sales Order] ([~/?ScreenId=SO641010|SO641010]) report, the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\SO_64_40_00|Pick List] ([~/?ScreenId=SO644000|SO644000]) report, or the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\SO_64_20_00|Shipment Confirmation] ([~/?ScreenId=SO642000|SO642000]) report.
*Analytical reports, such as the ''Sales Profitability Analysis'' (AR409000) report, which are described in [HelpRoot_ReportingTools\GL__GL_ARM_Reports|Managing Analytical Reports].

You can also use inquiry forms for building reports, such as the ''Leads BI (CR3010BI)'' or ''Cases BI (CR3060BI)'' form. For details, see [HelpRoot_ReportingTools\SM__MNG_Managing_Generic_Inquiry|Managing Generic Inquiries].{br}

You run a report by accepting or modifying the report parameters and clicking the '''Run Report''' button on the report form toolbar. In most reports, you can select the detailed or summary format of the report, specify the dates to be included in the report, select your company or company and branch, and specify other parameters that determine the data to be included in the report, such as the specific warehouse.{br}

When you have generated a report, you can do any of the following:[anchor|#_fe95c5b0-ce4d-461e-a316-cbdb70e80aa4]
*Print the report, if printing settings are configured for Acumatica ERP, or save a copy of the report as a PDF file.
*Send the report by email. If email settings are configured for Acumatica ERP, you can send a report to your colleagues or interested parties in an external organization.
*Export the report to an Excel spreadsheet or a PDF file.
*Save your report parameters in a template that you can reuse. You can make the template as your default for the particular report, which means that every time you open the report form, it opens with the parameters that you specified for the template.
*Share your report template with other users, if the selected parameters may be used frequently to meet users’ needs for information.
*Make changes to the report parameters and rerun the report, if you determine that your initial selections did not provide the needed information or you want a different picture of the data (such as a different report format).

==Basic Elements of the Report Form==
The following screenshot shows the basic elements of an Acumatica ERP report form.[anchor|#_ec29d895-4016-4e64-ad6c-848a1db60afd][anchor|#_28d50ae0-222d-4b49-b997-a2de994e9ae4][image:UserGuide/Images/GS_reports_report_form_basic_elements.png|popup|Basic elements of the report form|450px][anchor|#_2652b928-a7b7-4407-971c-3f09a4c91011]
#The report form toolbar, with buttons you can use to run the report, save the report parameters as a template, remove the current template, or schedule the processing of the report with the selected template
#The '''Parameters''' button, which you use to switch between the report parameters (after it has been run) and the report form
#The Template area, where you can select an existing template, set the selected template as your default for the report form, and share the template with other users
#The tabs of the report form
#The Tab area, which shows the elements of the selected tab

==Sorting in Reports ==
When you are specifying the parameters of the report, you can specify sorting conditions for the report data on the '''Additional Sort and Filters''' tab of the report form.[anchor|#_66c54d82-e14b-494d-a75c-36edad7fc43a]
==Ad Hoc Filters==
An ad hoc filter is a filter that you can set up on a report form to fine-tune the basic report parameters.{br}

You cannot save an ad hoc filter to be reused at a later time. You can, however, set up a report template that contains the filtering and sorting settings of an ad hoc filter, save this template, and reuse it.]]></column>

In most reports, you         can select the detailed or summary format of the report, specify the dates to be included in         the report, select your company or company and branch, and specify other parameters that         determine the data to be included in the report, such as the specific warehouse. When you have generated a report, you can do any of the following: Print the report, if printing settings are configured for  Acumatica ERP, or save a copy of the report as a PDF file. Send the report by email. If email settings are configured for  Acumatica ERP, you can send a report to your colleagues or interested parties in an external           organization. Export the report to an Excel spreadsheet or a PDF file. Save your report parameters in a template that you can reuse. You can make the template           as your default for the particular report, which means that every time you open the report           form, it opens with the parameters that you specified for the template. Share your report template with other users, if the selected parameters may be used           frequently to meet users’ needs for information. Make changes to the report parameters and rerun the report, if you determine that your           initial selections did not provide the needed information or you want a different picture           of the data (such as a different report format). Basic Elements of the Report Form The following screenshot shows the basic elements of an  Acumatica ERP report form. Basic elements of the report form The report form toolbar, with buttons you can use to run the report, save the report           parameters as a template, remove the current template, or schedule the processing of the           report with the selected template The  Parameters  button, which you use to switch between the report           parameters (after it has been run) and the report form The Template area, where you can select an existing template, set the selected template           as your default for the report form, and share the template with other users The tabs of the report form The Tab area, which shows the elements of the selected tab Sorting in Reports  When you are specifying the parameters of the report, you can specify sorting conditions         for the report data on the  Additional Sort and Filters  tab of the         report form. Ad Hoc Filters An ad hoc filter is a filter that you can set up on a report form to fine-tune the                 basic report parameters. You cannot save an ad hoc filter to be reused at a later time. You can, however, set                 up a report template that contains the filtering and sorting settings of an ad hoc                 filter, save this template, and reuse it. ]]></column>

In the following activity, you will practice generating some Acumatica ERP reports, so that you become familiar with the report parameters you can adjust to meet your needs.
==Story==
Suppose that you are David Chubb, a new sales manager of the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company. It is the end of January 2020, and you need to view the data about inventory items that have been sold in January and the statuses of sales orders that have been created for your customer, GoodFood One Restaurant.
==Process Overview==
In this process activity, you will do the following:[anchor|#_da25f6bd-eafd-455a-b199-7a84790947e4]
#Run a report
#Change the report parameters and rerun the report
#Create a template for a report
#Define the template as your default for the report
#Share the report template with other users
#Configure an ad hoc filter for the report
#Print a report to a PDF file
#Export a report to an Excel spreadsheet

==System Preparation==
Before you start working with Acumatica ERP reports, make sure that the following tasks have been performed:[anchor|#_a0c1efb4-a30c-4e34-8870-bf08ba9088c6]
*You have installed an Acumatica ERP instance with the ''U100'' dataset, or a system administrator has performed this task for you.
*You have signed in to Acumatica ERP with the following credentials:
**User name: ''chubb''
**Password: ''123''
*:For details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS_Accessing_Acumatica_ERP_Process_Activity|Accessing Acumatica ERP: Process Activity].
*The business date in your system is set to 1/30/2020. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button in the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, and select 1/30/2020 in the calendar. 

==Step 1: Running a Report==
Suppose that you need to find out sales profitability for stock items in January 2020. You will use the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\AR_67_40_00|Sales Profitability by Item Class and Item] ([~/?ScreenId=AR674000|AR674000]) report to view this information.{br}

To run this report, do the following:[anchor|#_b02c27db-b00f-49ec-8046-c0757b9aae92]
#On the main menu, click '''Sales Orders'''. The '''Sales Orders''' workspace opens.
#In the '''Reports''' category of the workspace, click ''Sales Profitability by Item Class and Item''. The report form opens, from which you can run the report.
#On the '''Report Parameters''' tab (which is displayed automatically when a report form opens), do the following:
##In the '''Start Date''' box, make sure that the ''1/1/2020'' value is selected.
##In the '''End Date''' box, make sure that the ''1/30/2020'' value is selected.
##On the report form toolbar, click '''Run Report'''. The report is generated and displayed in the working area. 
##:((({S:Hint}Notice that the report toolbar has a different set of buttons than the report form toolbar does; the '''Parameters''' button is still available, which you can use to switch between the report and the report form.
)))

==Step 2: Changing the Report Parameters and Rerunning the Report==
Suppose that you need to modify the parameters of the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\AR_67_40_00|Sales Profitability by Item Class and Item] ([~/?ScreenId=AR674000|AR674000]) report so that you can see the completed transactions for apples sold to GoodFood One Restaurant in January 2020.{br}

To change the report parameters, do the following:[anchor|#_4c274cdf-c3f4-4280-b84f-ef3360df752b]
#While you are still viewing the generated the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\AR_67_40_00|Sales Profitability by Item Class and Item] ([~/?ScreenId=AR674000|AR674000]) report, click '''Parameters''' on the report form toolbar to switch to the report form.
#On the '''Report Parameters''' tab, do the following:
##In the '''Report Format''' box, select ''Summary''.
##In the '''Inventory''' box, select ''APPLES''.
##In the '''Customer''' box, select ''GOODFOOD''.
##Clear the '''Released Transactions Only''' check box.
##Select the '''Completed Transactions Only''' check box.
#On the report form toolbar, click '''Run Report'''. The report, which displays the summary data on sales profitability for apples in January 2020, is generated and displayed in the working area.

==Step 3: Creating a Template for a Report==
Suppose that currently you only work with sales to the GoodFood One Restaurant customer. At the end of every month, you need to monitor the status of sales orders for the customer by using the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\SO_61_10_00|Sales Order Details by Customer] ([~/?ScreenId=SO611000|SO611000]) report. You would like to specify the parameters for the report once and save the template of the report, so that you can quickly reuse the report parameters. In February you are going on vacation, and you would like to share the report template with your colleague who will be working with the customer during your absence.{br}

To create a template for the report, do the following:[anchor|#_99856dd2-2b3c-4eb0-be34-2aa9be2bc314]
#On the main menu, click '''Sales Orders'''. The '''Sales Orders''' workspace opens.
#In the '''Reports''' category of the workspace, click ''Sales Order Details by Customer''. The report form opens.
#On the '''Report Parameters''' tab, do the following:
##In the '''Start Date''' box, make sure that the ''1/1/2020'' value is selected.
##In the '''End Date''' box, make sure that the ''1/30/2020'' value is selected.
##In the '''Customer ID''' box, select ''GOODFOOD''.
#On the report form toolbar, click '''Save Template'''.
#In the '''Enter Template Name''' dialog box, which opens, do the following:
##Type <tt>GOODFOOD</tt>.
##Click '''OK'''. The system closes the dialog box and saves the template. In the '''Template''' box of the Template area, you can see the name of the template: ''GOODFOOD''.
#Run the report to notice all the parameters that you have selected for the template.

==Step 4: Define the Template as Your Default==
Suppose that you would like to make the ''GOODFOOD'' template, which you created in the previous step, your default template for the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\SO_61_10_00|Sales Order Details by Customer] ([~/?ScreenId=SO611000|SO611000]) report. This means that each time you open the report, the report parameters of the template are automatically selected.{br}

To make ''GOODFOOD'' your default template for the report, do the following:[anchor|#_77cd2fcc-3b5d-4608-af37-459a1f398d22]
#While you are still viewing the generated [HelpRoot_ReportReference\SO_61_10_00|Sales Order Details by Customer] report, click the '''Parameters''' button on the report form toolbar to switch to the report form.
#In the Template area, select the '''Default''' check box.
#On the report form toolbar, click '''Save Template'''.
#In the '''Enter Template Name''' dialog box, which opens, click '''OK''' to save your changes in the template. Each time you open the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\SO_61_10_00|Sales Order Details by Customer] report form, your report parameters for the ''GOODFOOD'' template will be selected by default.

==Step 5: Sharing the Report Template==
Suppose that in February, you are going on vacation and you would like to share the ''GOODFOOD'' report template (which you created in Step 3) with your colleague who will be working with the customer during your absence.{br}

To define the template of the report so that it can be shared with other users, do the following:[anchor|#_9225a458-5d3b-4d10-9e1f-720e6e36a4f5]
#While you are still viewing the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\SO_61_10_00|Sales Order Details by Customer] ([~/?ScreenId=SO611000|SO611000]) report form, in the Template area, clear the '''Default''' check box.
#:((({S:Warn}You cannot share a default template. If you select the '''Shared''' check box, the '''Default''' check box becomes cleared and unavailable for editing.
)))
#Select the '''Shared''' check box.
#On the report form toolbar, click '''Save Template'''.
#In the '''Enter Template Name''' dialog box, which opens, click '''OK''' to save your changes to the template. Now other users can select your template in the '''Template''' box of the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\SO_61_10_00|Sales Order Details by Customer] report form.

==Step 6: Configuring an Ad Hoc Filter for the Report==
Suppose that you need to know the statuses of the sales orders that contain apples and oranges sold to the GoodFood One Restaurant customer. The [HelpRoot_ReportReference\SO_61_10_00|Sales Order Details by Customer] ([~/?ScreenId=SO611000|SO611000]) report provides this information, but it can take you quite long to scan for specific details. By using an ad hoc filter, you can select the needed details.
To configure an ad hoc filter for a report, do the following:[anchor|#_8cbf8e35-2f64-4932-8135-2a8b1701a530]
#While you are still viewing the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\SO_61_10_00|Sales Order Details by Customer] ([~/?ScreenId=SO611000|SO611000]) report form, make sure that the ''GOODFOOD'' report template is selected.
#On the '''Additional Sort and Filters''' tab, in the '''Additional Filtering Conditions''' table, do the following:
##Click '''Add Row''' to add a row to the table.
##In the '''Property''' column of the added row, select ''Sales Order Line.Inventory ID''.
##In the '''Condition''' column, select ''Equals''.
##In the '''Value''' column, select ''APPLES''.
##In the '''Operator''' column, select ''Or''.
##Click '''Add Row''' to add another row to the table.
##In the '''Property''' column of the added row, select ''Sales Order Line.Inventory ID''.
##In the '''Condition''' column, select ''Equals''.
##In the '''Value''' column, select ''ORANGES''.
#On the report form toolbar, click '''Run Report'''. The report, which displays the statuses of the sales orders that contain apples and oranges sold to the GoodFood One Restaurant, is generated and displayed in the working area.
#Optional: Save the report template that has the settings of your ad hoc filter as follows:
##Click '''Parameters''' to switch to the report form.
##On the report form toolbar, click '''Save Template'''.
##In the '''Enter Template Name''' dialog box, which opens, type <tt>GOODFOOD: apples & oranges</tt>, and click '''OK''' to save the template.
#:In the '''Template''' box, you can select the ''GOODFOOD: apples & oranges'' report template.

==Step 7: Printing a Report to a PDF File==
Suppose that you need to print a pick list for a warehouse employee who is shipping an order to the HM’s Bakery & Cafe customer. The [HelpRoot_ReportReference\SO_64_40_00|Pick List] ([~/?ScreenId=SO644000|SO644000]) report is designed to generate an easy-to-comprehend version of any pick list.{br}

To print the report to a PDF file, do the following:[anchor|#_8a848588-1171-4beb-af5c-82fb2c25ed3c]
#On the main menu, click '''Sales Orders'''. The '''Sales Orders''' workspace opens.
#In the '''Printed Forms''' category of the workspace, click ''Pick List''. The report form opens.
#In the '''Shipment Nbr.''' box of the '''Report Parameters''' tab, select the shipment number ''000028''.
#On the report form toolbar, click '''Run Report'''. The form of the report is displayed.
#On the report toolbar, click '''Print'''.
#In the dialog box, which opens, do the following:
##Select the option related to printing the report as a PDF file.
##Save the PDF file to your computer.
#:((({S:Warn}If a printer is configured in your Acumatica ERP system, you could instead select a printer from the list and print the document.
)))

==Step 8: Exporting a Report to Excel==
Suppose that you need to run the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\SO_61_25_00|Shipment Register] ([~/?ScreenId=SO612500|SO612500]) report and then export the report to Excel for a warehouse employee who will use the exported report data as a template to prepare a register for the warehouse.{br}

To export a report to Excel, do the following:[anchor|#_d330ebd6-7710-42af-9d25-5e1e094385fc]
#On the main menu, click '''Sales Orders'''. The '''Sales Orders''' workspace opens.
#Click the '''Show All''' button to switch to the full view of the workspace.
#In the '''Reports''' category of the workspace, select ''Shipment Register''. The report form opens.
#In the '''Start Date''' box of the '''Report Parameters''' tab, make sure that the ''1/1/2020'' value is selected.
#In the '''End Date''' box, make sure that the ''1/30/2020'' value is selected.
#On the report form toolbar, click '''Run Report'''. The report is displayed.
#On the report toolbar, click '''Export''' > '''Excel'''. The report is exported in Excel and downloaded to your computer.

The report,                     which displays the summary data on sales profitability for apples in January  2020, is generated and displayed in the working area. Step 3: Creating a Template for a Report Suppose that currently you only work with sales to the GoodFood One Restaurant                 customer. At the end of every month, you need to monitor the status of sales orders                 for the customer by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO611000|SO611000]) Sales Order Details by Customer (SO611000) report. You                 would like to specify the parameters for the report once and save the template of                 the report, so that you can quickly reuse the report parameters. In February you are                 going on vacation, and you would like to share the report template with your                 colleague who will be working with the customer during your absence. To create a template for the report, do the following: On the main menu, click  Sales Orders . The                          Sales Orders  workspace opens. In the  Reports  category of the workspace, click  Sales                         Order Details by Customer . The report form opens. On the  Report Parameters  tab, do the following: In the  Start Date  box, make sure that the                                  1/1/2020  value is selected. In the  End Date  box, make sure that the                                  1/30/2020  value is selected. In the  Customer ID  box,                              se lect                                  GOODFOOD . On the report form toolbar, click  Save Template . In the  Enter Template Name  dialog box, which opens, do                     the following: Type                                  GOODFOOD . Click  OK . The system closes the dialog box and                             saves the template. In the  Template  box of the                             Template area, you can see the name of the template:                              GOODFOOD . Run the report to notice all the parameters that you have selected for the                     template. Step 4: Define the Template as Your Default Suppose that you would like to make the  GOODFOOD  template, which you created                 in the previous step, your default template for the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO611000|SO611000]) Sales Order Details by Customer                 (SO611000) report. This means that each time you open the report, the report                 parameters of the template are automatically selected. To make  GOODFOOD  your default template for the report, do the following: While you are still viewing the generated   ([~/?ScreenId=SO611000|SO611000]) Sales Order Details by Customer                     report, click the  Parameters  button on the report form                     toolbar to switch to the report form. In the Template area, select the  Default  check box. On the report form toolbar, click  Save Template . In the  Enter Template Name  dialog box, which opens, click                          OK  to save your changes in the template. Each time                     you open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO611000|SO611000]) Sales Order Details by Customer report form, your report parameters                     for the  GOODFOOD  template will be selected by default. Step 5: Sharing the Report Template Suppose that in February, you are going on vacation and you would like to share the                      GOODFOOD  report template (which you created in Step 3) with your                 colleague who will be working with the customer during your absence. To define the template of the report so that it can be shared with other users, do                 the following: While you are still viewing the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO611000|SO611000]) Sales Order Details by Customer (SO611000)                     report form, in the Template area, clear the  Default                      check                         box. You cannot share a default template. If you select the                              Shared  check box, the                              Default  check box becomes cleared and unavailable                         for editing. Select the  Shared  check box. On the report form toolbar, click  Save Template . In the  Enter Template Name  dialog box, which opens, click                          OK  to save your changes to the template. Now other                     users can select your template in the  Template  box of the                           ([~/?ScreenId=SO611000|SO611000]) Sales Order Details by Customer report form. Step 6: Configuring an Ad Hoc Filter for the Report Suppose that you need to know the statuses of the sales orders that contain apples                 and oranges sold to the GoodFood One Restaurant customer. The   ([~/?ScreenId=SO611000|SO611000]) Sales Order Details by Customer (SO611000) report provides this information, but it                 can take you quite long to scan for specific details. By using an ad hoc filter, you                 can select the needed                 details. To configure an ad hoc filter for a report, do the following: While you are still viewing the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO611000|SO611000]) Sales Order Details by Customer (SO611000)                     report form, make sure that the  GOODFOOD  report template is                     selected. On the  Additional Sort and Filters  tab, in the                          Additional Filtering Conditions  table, do the                         following: Click  Add Row  to add a row to the table. In the  Property  column of the added row, select                                  Sales Order Line.Inventory ID . In the  Condition  column, select                              Equals . In the  Value  column, select  APPLES . In the  Operator  column, select  Or . Click  Add Row  to add another row to the                             table. In the  Property  column of the added row, select                                  Sales Order Line.Inventory ID . In the  Condition  column, select                              Equals . In the  Value  column, select  ORANGES . On the report form toolbar, click  Run Report . The report,                     which displays the statuses of the sales orders that contain apples and oranges                     sold to the GoodFood One Restaurant, is generated and displayed in the working                     area. Optional: Save the report template that has the settings of your ad hoc filter                     as follows: Click  Parameters  to switch to the report                             form. On the report form toolbar, click  Save                             Template . In the  Enter Template Name  dialog box, which                             opens, type  GOODFOOD: apples & oranges , and                             click  OK  to save the template. In the  Template  box, you can select the                              GOODFOOD: apples & oranges  report template. Step 7: Printing a Report to a PDF File Suppose that you need to print a pick list for a warehouse employee who is shipping                 an order to the HM’s Bakery & Cafe customer. The   ([~/?ScreenId=SO644000|SO644000]) Pick List                 (SO644000) report is designed to generate an easy-to-comprehend version of any pick                 list. To print the report to a PDF file, do the following: On the main menu, click  Sales Orders . The                          Sales Orders  workspace opens. In the  Printed Forms  category of the workspace, click                          Pick List . The report form opens.

In the dialog box, which opens, do the                         following: Select the option related to printing the report as a PDF file. Save the PDF file to your computer. If a printer is configured in your  Acumatica ERP system, you could instead select a printer from the list and print the                         document. Step 8: Exporting a Report to Excel Suppose that you need to run the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO612500|SO612500]) Shipment Register (SO612500) report                 and then export the report to Excel for a warehouse employee who will use the                 exported report data as a template to prepare a register for                  the                 warehouse. To export a report to Excel, do the following: On the main menu, click  Sales Orders . The                          Sales Orders  workspace opens. Click the  Show All  button to switch to the full view of                     the workspace. In the  Reports  category of the workspace, select                          Shipment Register . The report form opens. In the  Start Date  box of the  Report                         Parameters  tab, make sure that the  1/1/2020  value is                     selected. In the  End Date  box, make sure that the  1/30/2020                      value is selected. On the report form toolbar, click  Run Report . The report                     is displayed. On the report toolbar, click  Export Excel . The report is exported in Excel and downloaded to your                     computer. ]]></column>

If execution of the schedule should be repeated multiple times a day, in                             the  Every  box, select the interval between                             successive executions of the schedule. In the  Next Execution Time  box, make sure the                             next execution time is correct. If you want the system to execute the schedule at exactly the time                             specified in the  Next Execution Time  box, select                             the  Exact Time  check box. If the check box is                             cleared, the system may shift the next execution time of the schedule by                             multiple minutes. Click  Save  on the form toolbar             to create the schedule. When you save a newly created schedule, the system gives it an             identifier in accordance with the built-in numbering sequence intended for automation             schedules.  After you have added a schedule for the report processing, the system will                     send the report with the parameters specified in the template according to the                     schedule settings. ]]></column>

You can pass training         courses in any order or select a recommended learning path. A learning path is a set of courses that helps a learner to easily navigate through the         course catalog.  Acumatica Open University provides different learning paths, that are recommended based on the         learner’s specific role. By clicking any of the offered learning paths, you get the list of         the courses that match your needs. After you complete all the courses in the learning path,         you can update your social network profiles by listing specific skills to spotlight these         skills. ]]></column>

*When you are initially using Acumatica ERP, you may need to change the basic settings of your working environment that are available in your user profile.
*You have worked with Acumatica ERP for some time and need to make particular adjustments to your basic working environment.

==Overview of Your User Profile Settings==
On the [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\SM_20_30_10|User Profile] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) form, you can customize your basic working environment settings. By using this form, you can change your personal settings (first name, last name, and phone number), time zone, default branch, default warehouse, home page, and regional (locale) settings. The changes you make on this form affect your user account only. {br}

You can access the [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\SM_20_30_10|User Profile] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) form by clicking '''My Profile''' in the User menu.
==Default Branch==
In some cases, multiple branches of a company are defined in the Acumatica ERP instance. Users can select the current branch (and company, if needed) from those to which they have access. Each user&rsquo;s current branch is inserted into the applicable boxes on forms and reports; this branch can be overridden, if needed.
If you work primarily in one of the branches to which you have access, you can specify a default branch. The default branch is then selected by the system as your current branch each time you sign in to Acumatica ERP. The system then inserts the name of this branch into the boxes on forms as you are creating system records and using mass processing forms, inquiry forms, and reports.
==Time Zones==
In Acumatica ERP, time zones are specified with respect to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). A system administrator specifies the default time zone for all system users on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_05|Site Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200505|SM200505]) form. {br}

If your time zone differs from the default time zone that is specified in the system, you can select your time zone on the [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\SM_20_30_10|User Profile] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) form.
After you have selected your time zone, the date of creation for all the documents in the system will be displayed based on your time zone. Also, if you create a schedule to run a particular process at a specified time, the system will start the schedule based on your time zone.
==Home Page==
The home page is the first page that you see when you sign in to Acumatica ERP. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_05|Site Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200505|SM200505]) form, a system administrator specifies a default home page to be used by all users of the site who have not specified a personal default home page. By default, for the ''U100'' dataset, the home page is the Welcome to [anchor|#short_company_name]Acumaticapage. The Welcome to Acumatica page displays links to Acumatica resources, announcements, and news. {br}

If you want to specify a different default home page for your user account than the one specified for the system as a whole, you can select your home page in the '''Personal Settings''' section of the [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\SM_20_30_10|User Profile] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]). As your home page, you can select a form or a dashboard.
==Locale Settings==
The default locale for Acumatica ERP is specified by a system administrator on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_50|System Locales] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200550|SM200550]) form. {br}

You can select your default locale that determines the language to be used and change your regional settings, such as date, time, and number formats on the [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\SM_20_30_10|User Profile] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) form. Dates, time and numbers are displayed in the system documents according to the local preferences that you have specified for your user account.]]></column>

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
In the following activity, you will change some of the basic settings of your Acumatica ERP working environment that are available in your user profile, so that you understand how to make these changes in your own user profile.
==Story==
Suppose that you are David Chubb, a new sales manager of the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company. So far, you have worked in New York for the SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center branch. Your time zone is Eastern Time, which is Greenwich Mean Time minus five hours.{br}

You have just been transferred to the Service and Equipment Sales Center branch, and you are temporarily working from your home, which is located in Denver, Colorado. Your current time zone is Mountain Time, which is Greenwich Mean Time minus seven hours. For performing your job responsibilities, you need to frequently view sales prices for stock items on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form. You need to select your current time zone and to have sales prices for stock items displayed on your home page. 
==Prerequisites==
You have explored the basic elements of the Acumatica ERP UI. For details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS_Learning_UI_GeneralInfo|Learning About the Acumatica ERP UI: General Information].
==Process Overview==
In this process activity, you will do the following:[anchor|#_da25f6bd-eafd-455a-b199-7a84790947e4]
#Select your time zone for Acumatica ERP
#Select your default branch
#Define your home page

==System Preparation==
Before you start changing the basic settings of your Acumatica ERP working environment, make sure that the following tasks have been performed:[anchor|#_a0c1efb4-a30c-4e34-8870-bf08ba9088c6]
*You have installed an Acumatica ERP instance with the ''U100'' dataset, or a system administrator has performed this task for you.
*You have signed in to Acumatica ERP with the following credentials:
**User name: ''chubb''
**Password: ''123''
*:For details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS_Accessing_Acumatica_ERP_Process_Activity|Accessing Acumatica ERP: Process Activity].

==Step 1: Selecting Your Time Zone==
To select your time zone in Acumatica ERP, do the following:[anchor|#_00521501-c8bf-4881-86e9-507db9ec8f72]
#Click the User menu button, and in the User menu, click '''My Profile'''. The [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\SM_20_30_10|User Profile] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) form opens.
#On the '''General Info''' tab ('''Personal Settings''' section), in the '''Time Zone''' box, select ''(GMT-07:00) Mountain Time (US & Canada)''. 
#:((({S:Hint}If you know the exact name of the time zone, you can type a part of the name in the '''Time Zone''' box. The search results will be limited to the values that match your search request.
)))
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''. The times and dates shown in the system and in documents are displayed in time zone that you have selected.
#:((({S:Hint} For instance, if another user located in the Eastern Time zone has created a document at 1:00 AM on January 16, 2020, David Chubb, who sees times and dates according to Mountain Time, will see a date of 1/15/2020 (because 1:00 AM Eastern Time is 11:00 PM Mountain Time on the previous day).
)))

==Step 2: Selecting Your Default Branch==
To select your default branch, do the following:[anchor|#_0c455326-322f-4137-b6c5-526f6f90b04f]
#While you are still viewing the [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\SM_20_30_10|User Profile] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) form, in the '''Default Branch''' box (which is in the '''Personal Settings''' section of the''' General Info''' tab), click the magnifier icon.
#In the lookup table, which opens, double-click ''SWEETEQUIP'' to select the Service and Equipment Sales Center branch as your default branch.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.
#:((({S:Warn}This change will not be applied during the current session; the next time you sign in, the system will set the default branch as your current branch, as you can see in the next several instructions.
)))
#Sign out of Acumatica ERP.
#Sign in to Acumatica ERP again.
#Open the Company and Branch Selection menu. On the menu, you can see a check mark next to the ''Service and Equipment Sales Center'' branch, which means that this is your current branch. Thus, the system has set your current branch to the default branch you have specified.

==Step 3: Defining Your Home Page==
As David Chubb, you want your home page to be set to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form so that you can immediately see the sales prices when you sign in (and any other time you click the Home button).{br}

To define your homepage, do the following:[anchor|#_d66fe9b0-5c7a-4976-a2b8-7bccc7f1666a]
#In the top pane, click the User menu button, and in the User menu, click '''My Profile''' to open the [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\SM_20_30_10|User Profile] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) form.
# In the '''Home Page''' box (which is in the '''Personal Settings''' section of the''' General Info''' tab), click the magnifier icon. The lookup table opens.
#In the search box of the lookup table, type <tt>sales prices</tt> (the name of the form that will be David Chubb&rsquo;s home page) to limit the search results to the values that match your search request. Among the results will be the form you want, with '' Sales Prices'' in the '''Title''' column; double-click it to select the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form as your home page. The system closes the lookup table and fills in the '''Home Page''' box.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.
#In the upper left corner of the Acumatica ERP screen, click the Home button to make sure that the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form, which you defined as your home page, opens.

Step 1: Selecting Your Time Zone To select your time zone in  Acumatica ERP, do the following: Click the User menu button, and in the User menu, click  My                         Profile . The   ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) User Profile (SM203010) form                     opens. On the  General Info  tab ( Personal                         Settings  section), in the  Time Zone  box,                     select  (GMT-07:00) Mountain Time (US & Canada) .  If                         you know the exact name of the time zone, you can type a part of the name in                         the  Time Zone  box. The search results will be limited                         to the values that match your search request. On the form toolbar, click  Save . The times and dates                     shown in the system and in documents are displayed in time zone that you have                         selected.  For instance, if another user located in the                         Eastern Time zone has created a document at 1:00 AM on January 16, 2020,                         David Chubb, who sees times and dates according to Mountain Time, will see a                         date of 1/15/2020 (because 1:00 AM Eastern Time is 11:00 PM Mountain Time on                         the previous day). Step 2: Selecting Your Default Branch To select your default branch, do the following: While you are still viewing the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) User Profile (SM203010) form,                     in the  Default Branch  box (which is                      in                     the  Personal Settings  section of the  General                         Info  tab), click the magnifier                     icon. In the lookup table,                      which                     opens,  double-click  SWEETEQUIP  to select the Service                     and Equipment Sales Center branch as your default branch. On the form toolbar, click                          Save . This change will not be applied during the current session;                         the next time you sign in, the system will set the default branch as your                         current branch, as you can see in the next several instructions. Sign out of  Acumatica ERP. Sign in to  Acumatica ERP again. Open the Company and Branch Selection menu. On the menu, you can see a check                     mark next to the  Service and Equipment Sales Center  branch, which means                     that this is your current branch. Thus, the system has set your current branch                     to the default branch you have specified. Step 3: Defining Your Home Page As David Chubb, you want your home page to be set to the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) Sales Prices (AR202000) form so that you can immediately see the                 sales prices when you sign in (and any other time you click the Home button). To define your homepage, do the following: In the top pane, click the User menu button, and in the User menu, click                          My Profile  to open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) User Profile (SM203010) form.  In the  Home Page  box (which is in the                          Personal Settings  section of the  General                         Info  tab), click the magnifier icon. The lookup table                     opens. In the search box of the lookup table, type  sales prices                      (the name of the form that will be David Chubb's home page) to limit the search                     results to the values that match your search request. Among the results will be                     the form you want, with   Sales Prices  in the  Title                      column; double-click it to select the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) Sales Prices (AR202000)                     form as your home page.

In the upper left corner of the  Acumatica ERP screen, click the Home button to make sure that the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) Sales Prices (AR202000) form, which you defined as your home                     page, opens. ]]></column>

When you process documents, you may want to apply your personal settings. For example, you may want to sign all PDF files you export from the system with your personal digital signature. In Acumatica ERP, you can specify personal settings for documents exported to Microsoft Excel and for emails that you send from the system.{br}

In this topic, you will read about personalizing settings for document processing.{br}{TOC}
==Email Settings==
Your personal email account is specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) form by a system administrator who creates user accounts. You can view and change it on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\SM_20_30_10|User Profile] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) form.{br}

If you need to send emails from Acumatica ERP, you can configure your signature that will be automatically added to each email. You can create your signature on the '''Email Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\SM_20_30_10|User Profile] form.{br}

On the same tab, you can select the system email account that will be used as the default email account when you send emails through Acumatica ERP. Incoming emails and replies to mass emails will be automatically sorted by the system and routed to your personal email account.{br}

For more information about using the email functionality in Acumatica ERP, see [HelpRoot_Administration\EP__con_Email_Management|Managing Emails].
==Personal Certificate==
If you are authorized to generate PDF files, you can specify your personal certificate for signing these files.

With the task management capabilities of Acumatica ERP, you can keep personal to-do lists, configure reminders for all tasks or only the most important ones, track tasks assigned to you, create tasks, assign tasks to other users, and follow up on tasks assigned to others. These capabilities help you do the right things at the right time, so you can improve your performance and efficiency. 
==Tasks==
Each task has a ''creator'' and an ''assignee'': The task&rsquo;s creator is the employee who created the task, and its assignee is the employee to whom the task is assigned. (The creator and assignee may be the same employee.) A task should be assigned before it is saved. {br}

Tasks can be created as associated with no specific entity, or they can be created as associated with any of the following entities: leads, contacts, opportunities, business accounts, cases, employees, and projects. You can create such an association by using one of the following methods: [anchor|#ul_vvr_gf3_xp]
*Specifying a related entity by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_20|Task] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306020|CR306020]) form when you create a new task or adjust an existing one
*Creating a task by using the '''Activities''' tab on the corresponding data entry form. For instance, to create a task that will be associated with a certain case, you would use this tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_00|Cases] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306000|CR306000]) form.
{br}

When creating a task, the creator can configure a reminder for it and specify on what day before the due date the assignee should receive the reminder. On the specified date, the reminder will appear in the info area of the assignee&rsquo;s screen and will be blinking or highlighted in red until either of the users, the creator or the assignee, completes the task or changes its status.[anchor|#_86953628-ab3c-4978-9b67-7b540a16c014]((({S:Warn}Before you can start using reminders, you must ask your system administrator to enable the reminder functionality. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\Configuring_reminders|To Turn On Reminders] in the Acumatica ERP Installation Guide.
)))[anchor|#_b3f37502-4193-474e-9f21-d496e84ea2fc][anchor|#_399d3984-395b-4e87-8fdb-ddc152167d1c]
==Task Tracking Options==
You can view the total number of your tasks and events, including the new ones, in the info area at the top of any Acumatica ERP form. The '''Tasks''' link opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_40_40_00|Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=EP404000|EP404000]) form. By using this form, you can view the following tasks: [anchor|#ul_qzr_fj3_xp]
*Those you have created. If these tasks are assigned to other users, you might want to track them to see whether they are being fulfilled (and what related activities have been created for the tasks). Such tasks are displayed on the '''Follow-Up Tasks''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_40_40_00|Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=EP404000|EP404000]) form. 
*Those assigned to the users in your workgroup.
*Escalated tasks assigned to users of workgroups that are positioned, in the company tree, on levels lower than your workgroup but in the same node. 
((({S:Hint}You can hide a task, event, or other activity from external users by marking it ''Internal'' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_20|Task] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306020|CR306020]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_30|Event] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306030|CR306030]), or [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_10|Activity] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306010|CR306010]) form, respectively.
))){br}

To make the most important tasks noticeable to you at a glance, you can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_40_40|Event and Task Categories] ([~/?ScreenId=EP204040|EP204040]) form to associate different colors with different categories of tasks. For example, if you select red for the most important tasks, yellow for less important tasks, and green for normal tasks, you will see the tasks marked by exclamation marks (in the column with the '''!''' heading) highlighted with the respective colors. {br}

Tasks do not require approvals; they are completed by the assignees or canceled by the creators.

Many users, having worked with Microsoft Excel for years, prefer to perform detailed financial analysis by using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet on their desktop. For such users, Acumatica ERP supports integration with Microsoft Excel.[anchor|#_b16d61a3-73b1-48df-927f-864126fb8079]((({S:Warn}Acumatica ERP uses the spreadsheet format introduced in Microsoft Office 2007, so if you use an earlier version of Microsoft Office, you should install the appropriate plug-in.
))){br}{TOC}
==Exporting to Excel==
You can export data from any Acumatica ERP table to an Excel spreadsheet any time you want to. For the detailed procedure, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Export_Data_to_Excel|To Export Data to Excel].{br}

The general settings your organization uses for export are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_05|Site Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200505|SM200505]) form. 
==Updating Excel Spreadsheets==
If you have exported data from an inquiry form to an Excel file, you can update your Excel file with data from the Acumatica ERP database. You can retrieve the data from the web and update the file contents without re-exporting data from the system and repeating all post-export configuration steps.[anchor|#_c3fcd92d-5582-475b-a2e5-07946dff4d09]((({S:Warn}Acumatica ERP uses the spreadsheet format introduced in Microsoft Office 2007, so if you use an earlier version of Microsoft Office, you should install the appropriate plug-in.
)))
The contents of the file are updated with the filtering criteria you have specified on the inquiry form before exporting the data. If the filtering criteria includes the default values, these values will be updated as well. For example, if the filtering criteria includes the current financial period, when the period is changed in the system, it will be automatically updated in the file.{br}

For details on updating a spreadsheet, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\Exporting_to_Excel__how_update|To Update an Excel Spreadsheet].
==Aggregating Excel Spreadsheets==
Additionally, you can aggregate data from multiple forms to one Excel workbook and use the file as you want—for example, as a source for summarizing and analyzing data. To aggregate data in this way, do the following:[anchor|#ol_bkd_n1x_lk]
#Export data from each form you want to use.
#Copy the sheets from the exported files to one Excel workbook, and save the resulting file.

Once you have performed these steps, when you refresh data in Excel, the data on all spreadsheets will be updated simultaneously.[anchor|#_7f4c13b3-460d-4fe4-8910-5e378add5b0d]((({S:Warn}Acumatica ERP uses the spreadsheet format introduced in Microsoft Office 2007, so if you use an earlier version of Microsoft Office, you should install the appropriate plug-in.
)))
==Importing from Excel==
With Acumatica ERP, you can easily import data from an Excel spreadsheet into a table on a data entry form—for example, you can import the details of a bill on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form. For details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Import_Data_From_File|To Import Data from a Local File to a Table].

Acumatica ERP  uses the             spreadsheet format introduced in Microsoft Office 2007, so if you use an earlier version             of Microsoft Office, you should install the appropriate plug-in. Exporting to Excel You can export data from any  Acumatica ERP table to an Excel spreadsheet any time you want to. For the detailed procedure, 				see  To Export Data to Excel. The general settings your organization uses for export are defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200505|SM200505]) Site Preferences (SM200505) form.  Updating Excel Spreadsheets If you have exported data from an inquiry form to an Excel file, you can update your Excel 				file with data from the  Acumatica ERP database. You can retrieve the data from the web and update the file contents 				without re-exporting data from the system and repeating all post-export 				configuration steps. Acumatica ERP  uses the             spreadsheet format introduced in Microsoft Office 2007, so if you use an earlier version             of Microsoft Office, you should install the appropriate plug-in. The contents of the file are updated with the filtering criteria you have specified 				on the inquiry form before exporting the data. If the filtering criteria includes 				the default values, these values will be updated as well. For example, if the 				filtering criteria includes the current financial period, when the period is changed 				in the system, it will be automatically updated in the file. For details on updating a spreadsheet, see  To Update an Excel Spreadsheet. Aggregating Excel Spreadsheets Additionally, you can aggregate data from multiple forms to one Excel workbook and 				use the file as you want—for example, as a source for summarizing and 				analyzing data. To aggregate data in this way, do the following: Export data from each form you want to use. Copy the sheets from the exported files to one Excel workbook, and save the 					resulting file. Once you have performed these steps, when you refresh data in Excel, the data on all 				spreadsheets will be updated simultaneously. Acumatica ERP  uses the             spreadsheet format introduced in Microsoft Office 2007, so if you use an earlier version             of Microsoft Office, you should install the appropriate plug-in. Importing from Excel With  Acumatica ERP, you can easily import data from an Excel spreadsheet into a table on a data 				entry form—for example, you can import the details of a bill on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form. For details, see  To Import Data from a Local File to a Table.  ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000])  ([~/?ScreenId=SM200505|SM200505])  ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) ]]></column>

Also, Acumatica ERP streamlines the approval workflow by providing a single form, [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]), that you can use as a starting point for all documents that require approval. For details, see [HelpRoot_Organization\EP__con_Assignment_Automation|Managing Assignment and Approval Maps]. {br}{TOC}
==Visibility Options==
 By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) form, you can perform approvals of documents of multiple types, including cash transactions, purchase orders, requisition requests, requisitions, expense claims, time cards, and equipment time cards.{br}

By using the filter tabs on the form, you can view documents grouped in any of the following ways:[anchor|#ul_izh_xfs_r3]
*All documents that you can approve, including escalated documents assigned to users of workgroups that are at lower levels in the company tree but in the node of your workgroup
*Documents that are assigned to you for approval
*Documents that are assigned to the users of your workgroup
((({S:Hint}With some types of documents, such as expense claims or employee time cards, although you are allowed to approve documents assigned to other users of your workgroup, you may not be able to view the details of these documents on corresponding entry forms due to the specifics of the document visibility settings effective on these forms.
)))
==Approval or Rejection of Documents==
As an approver, you can either reject or approve a particular document. You can approve or reject all the documents listed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] form or only the documents you select. To approve particular documents, you need to select the unlabeled check box for each document and then click '''Approve'''.{br}

If the approval map for a particular type of document is configured so that entering a reason is required to complete document approval or rejection, such documents cannot be approved or rejected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] form. In this case, approvers can use only the corresponding entry form to approve or reject documents of that type.((({S:Warn}If a document that requires multiple approvals is first approved by a member of a workgroup located (on the company tree) above any of the assigned workgroups, the document immediately becomes approved by the lower groups, regardless of whether those groups have actually performed their approvals. 
)))
If you reject a document, the system assigns the ''Rejected'' status to it. Rejected documents cannot be removed from the system; they are stored with the history of approvals. If your organization&rsquo;s policies allow the editing of rejected documents, users can modify the rejected documents. Any modification removes all approval records for the document, and the approval process can be started again from the lowest level.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Add Widget Dialog Box for Chart Widgets You use the  Add                 Widget  dialog box to add a widget to a dashboard and to modify an             existing widget. The settings that you need to specify depend on the widget type. When                 you add a new widget by using this dialog box, you perform two steps. In the first                 step, you select the type of the widget that you want to add to the dashboard; the                 system brings up the version of the  Add Widget  dialog box                 that is specific to the widget type. In the second step, you specify the properties                 that are specific to the selected widget type. When you modify an existing widget,                 you perform only the second step. (In this case, the system immediately brings up                 the appropriate version of the dialog box.) Add Widget Dialog Box: Step 1 When you want to add a new widget to a dashboard, you first need to select the option button         representing the type of the widget in the  Add Widget  dialog box. The         elements of the dialog box are described in the table below. Element Description Widget Type The type of widget to be added to the dashboard, which can be one of the following: Chart : A graphical representation of data from an                            Acumatica ERP form. You can use charts of various types, such as bar charts and line                         charts. For more information, see  Chart Widgets. Data Table : Data from an  Acumatica ERP form arranged into rows and columns. For more information, see  Data Table Widgets.

For more information, see  Embedded Page Widgets. Header : The title of the widget section. For                         details, see  Header Widgets. Pivot Table : A data table organized to filter,                         sort, count, total, or give the average of data from an  Acumatica ERP generic inquiry, displaying the summarized results in a separate table.                         For details, see  Pivot Table Widgets. Power BI Tile : A chart, scorecard, or other type of                         analytical information that is represented on Power BI dashboards designed                         by your organization. For more information, see  Power BI Tile Widgets. Scorecard KPI : A parameter that is important for                         the business processes of your organization and that should be monitored on                         a daily basis. For more information, see  Scorecard KPI Widgets. Trend Card KPI : A parameter whose dynamic change is                         important to the business processes of your organization.

Does Not Equal : Returns  TRUE  if the field value is                                     not equal to the  Value 1  value. Is Greater Than : Returns  TRUE  if the field value                                     is greater than the  Value 1  value. Is Greater Than or Equal To : Returns  TRUE  if the                                     field value is greater than or equal to the  Value                                         1  value. Is Less Than : Returns  TRUE  if the field value is                                     less than the  Value 1  value. Is Less Than or Equal To : Returns  TRUE  if the                                     field value is less than or equal to the  Value                                         1  value. Is Between : Returns  TRUE  if the field value is                                     between the  Value 1  and  Value                                         2  values. (For this option, you must specify                                     both  Value 1  and  Value                                         2 .)

Does Not Contain : Returns  TRUE  if the field value                                     (string) does not contain the  Value 1                                      value. Starts With : Returns  TRUE  if the field value                                     contains at the beginning the  Value 1                                      value. Ends With : Returns  TRUE  if the field value ends                                     with the  Value 1  value. Is Empty : Returns  TRUE  if the field value is empty                                     (null). Is Not Empty : Returns  TRUE  if the field value is                                     not empty (not null). If you try to filter the inquiry results by using a string                                 that contains an underscore, the result will also contain the values                                 with the same string with any symbol instead of the underscore. For                                 example, if you try to filter the inquiry by a customer name that                                 contains the  Customer_Name  string, the system will return all                                 the customers whose name contains any of the following strings:                                      Customer_Name ,  Customer-Name , and  Customer                                     Name . The reason that all of these strings will be returned                                 is that the underscore is used as a wildcard                             character. Use                                 Parameter A check box that indicates (if selected) that a dashboard parameter                             is used in the filtering condition. When this check box is selected,                             only active dashboard parameters are displayed in the  Value                                 1  and  Value 2  columns. Value 1 The value you enter for the logical condition used to filter the                             data, if the selected condition requires a value. The value you enter                             must conform with the data type of the selected property. You can enter                             or select a fixed value, one of the predefined parameters, or one of the                             dashboard parameters.  The predefined parameters are listed in  Managing Advanced Filters. Value 2 The second value for the logical condition, if the selected logical                             condition requires a second value. (For example, the  Is Between                              logical condition requires a second value.) The value you enter must                             conform with the data type of the selected property. You can enter or                             select a fixed value, one of the predefined parameters, or one of the                             dashboard parameters. The predefined parameters are listed in  Managing Advanced Filters. Brackets A group of closing brackets to group logical conditions. Operator The logical operator to be used between groups of logical                             conditions.

Funnel : The column values are displayed as individual slices in the                     funnel. The height of each slice is determined by an aggregated column value                     selected in the  Value  box. For example, a column might be                     a customer ID. Sort By The sort order for the legend data. The left box defines the sequence to be                 sorted as follows:  Legend : The legend data is sorted by the values in the column you                     selected in the  Legend  box. Legend Values : The legend data is sorted by value you selected in the                        Value  box.  The right box defines the sort order. The way the values are sorted depends                   on the chart type as well as this selection. The following options are                   available: Ascending : Doughnut : The smallest sector is displayed in the upper part of the                         doughnut, and larger sectors are displayed clockwise in ascending                         order. Line ,  Column , and  Stacked Column : The lowest value                         (the first alphabetic value for text data) appears in the left part of the                         horizontal axis, and higher values are shown to the right in ascending                         order. The function ignores null values. Bar  and  Stacked Bar : The lowest value (the first alphabetic                         value for text data) appears in the upper part of the vertical axis, and                         higher values are arranged downward along the vertical axis in ascending                         order. The function ignores null values. Funnel : The lowest value (the first alphabetic value for text data)                         appears on the top of the funnel, and higher values are arranged downward in                         ascending order. The function ignores null values. Descending : Doughnut : The largest sector is displayed in the upper part of the                         doughnut, and smaller sectors are displayed clockwise in descending                         order. Line ,  Column  and  Stacked Column : The highest value                         (the last alphabetic value for text data) appears in the left part of the                         horizontal axis, and lower values are shown to the right in descending                         order. The function ignores null values. Bar  and  Stacked Bar : The highest value (the last alphabetic                         value for text data) appears in the upper part of the vertical axis, and                         lower values are arranged downward along the vertical axis in descending                         order. The function ignores null values. Funnel : The highest value (the last alphabetic value for text data)                         appears on the top of the funnel, and lower values are arranged downward in                         descending order. The function ignores null values. The default values in these boxes depend on the type             of the field that you selected in the  Legend  box, as described         below: String  type: The default value for the sequence in the left box is                          Legend Values  and for the sort order in the right box is                          Descending .

((({S:Warn}If you try to filter the inquiry results by using a string that contains an underscore, the result will also contain the values with the same string with any symbol instead of the underscore. For example, if you try to filter the inquiry by a customer name that contains the ''Customer&#95;Name'' string, the system will return all the customers whose name contains any of the following strings: ''Customer&#95;Name'', ''Customer-Name'', and ''Customer Name''. The reason that all of these strings will be returned is that the underscore is used as a wildcard character.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Add Widget Dialog Box for Data Table Widgets You use the  Add                 Widget  dialog box to add a widget to a dashboard and to modify an             existing widget. The settings that you need to specify depend on the widget type. When                 you add a new widget by using this dialog box, you perform two steps. In the first                 step, you select the type of the widget that you want to add to the dashboard; the                 system brings up the version of the  Add Widget  dialog box                 that is specific to the widget type. In the second step, you specify the properties                 that are specific to the selected widget type. When you modify an existing widget,                 you perform only the second step. (In this case, the system immediately brings up                 the appropriate version of the dialog box.) Add Widget Dialog Box: Step 1 When you want to add a new widget to a dashboard, you first need to select the option button         representing the type of the widget in the  Add Widget  dialog box. The         elements of the dialog box are described in the table below.

Is Between : Returns  TRUE  if the field value is                                     between the  Value 1  and  Value                                         2  values. (For this option, you must specify                                     both  Value 1  and  Value                                         2 .)

Starts With : Returns  TRUE  if the field value                                     contains at the beginning the  Value 1                                      value. Ends With : Returns  TRUE  if the field value ends                                     with the  Value 1  value. Is Empty : Returns  TRUE  if the field value is empty                                     (null). Is Not Empty : Returns  TRUE  if the field value is                                     not empty (not null). If you try to filter the inquiry results by using a string                                 that contains an underscore, the result will also contain the values                                 with the same string with any symbol instead of the underscore. For                                 example, if you try to filter the inquiry by a customer name that                                 contains the  Customer_Name  string, the system will return all                                 the customers whose name contains any of the following strings:                                      Customer_Name ,  Customer-Name , and  Customer                                     Name . The reason that all of these strings will be returned                                 is that the underscore is used as a wildcard                             character. Use                                 Parameter A check box that indicates (if selected) that a dashboard parameter                             is used in the filtering condition. When this check box is selected,                             only active dashboard parameters are displayed in the  Value                                 1  and  Value 2  columns. Value 1 The value you enter for the logical condition used to filter the                             data, if the selected condition requires a value. The value you enter                             must conform with the data type of the selected property. You can enter                             or select a fixed value, one of the predefined parameters, or one of the                             dashboard parameters.  The predefined parameters are listed in  Managing Advanced Filters. Value 2 The second value for the logical condition, if the selected logical                             condition requires a second value. (For example, the  Is Between                              logical condition requires a second value.) The value you enter must                             conform with the data type of the selected property. You can enter or                             select a fixed value, one of the predefined parameters, or one of the                             dashboard parameters. The predefined parameters are listed in  Managing Advanced Filters. Brackets A group of closing brackets to group logical conditions. Operator The logical operator to be used between groups of logical                             conditions. ]]></column>

((({S:Warn}If you try to filter the inquiry results by using a string that contains an underscore, the result will also contain the values with the same string with any symbol instead of the underscore. For example, if you try to filter the inquiry by a customer name that contains the ''Customer&#95;Name'' string, the system will return all the customers whose name contains any of the following strings: ''Customer&#95;Name'', ''Customer-Name'', and ''Customer Name''. The reason that all of these strings will be returned is that the underscore is used as a wildcard character.

Does Not Equal : Returns  TRUE  if the field value is                                     not equal to the  Value 1  value. Is Greater Than : Returns  TRUE  if the field value                                     is greater than the  Value 1  value. Is Greater Than or Equal To : Returns  TRUE  if the                                     field value is greater than or equal to the  Value                                         1  value. Is Less Than : Returns  TRUE  if the field value is                                     less than the  Value 1  value.

(For this option, you must specify                                     both  Value 1  and  Value                                         2 .) Contains : Returns  TRUE  if the field value (string)                                     contains the  Value 1  value. Does Not Contain : Returns  TRUE  if the field value                                     (string) does not contain the  Value 1                                      value. Starts With : Returns  TRUE  if the field value                                     contains at the beginning the  Value 1                                      value. Ends With : Returns  TRUE  if the field value ends                                     with the  Value 1  value. Is Empty : Returns  TRUE  if the field value is empty                                     (null). Is Not Empty : Returns  TRUE  if the field value is                                     not empty (not null). If you try to filter the inquiry results by using a string                                 that contains an underscore, the result will also contain the values                                 with the same string with any symbol instead of the underscore. For                                 example, if you try to filter the inquiry by a customer name that                                 contains the  Customer_Name  string, the system will return all                                 the customers whose name contains any of the following strings:                                      Customer_Name ,  Customer-Name , and  Customer                                     Name . The reason that all of these strings will be returned                                 is that the underscore is used as a wildcard                             character. Use                                 Parameter A check box that indicates (if selected) that a dashboard parameter                             is used in the filtering condition. When this check box is selected,                             only active dashboard parameters are displayed in the  Value                                 1  and  Value 2  columns. Value 1 The value you enter for the logical condition used to filter the                             data, if the selected condition requires a value. The value you enter                             must conform with the data type of the selected property. You can enter                             or select a fixed value, one of the predefined parameters, or one of the                             dashboard parameters.  The predefined parameters are listed in  Managing Advanced Filters. Value 2 The second value for the logical condition, if the selected logical                             condition requires a second value. (For example, the  Is Between                              logical condition requires a second value.) The value you enter must                             conform with the data type of the selected property. You can enter or                             select a fixed value, one of the predefined parameters, or one of the                             dashboard parameters. The predefined parameters are listed in  Managing Advanced Filters. Brackets A group of closing brackets to group logical conditions. Operator The logical operator to be used between groups of logical                             conditions. ]]></column>

((({S:Warn}If you try to filter the inquiry results by using a string that contains an underscore, the result will also contain the values with the same string with any symbol instead of the underscore. For example, if you try to filter the inquiry by a customer name that contains the ''Customer&#95;Name'' string, the system will return all the customers whose name contains any of the following strings: ''Customer&#95;Name'', ''Customer-Name'', and ''Customer Name''. The reason that all of these strings will be returned is that the underscore is used as a wildcard character.
)))

For the list of standard buttons, see  Table Toolbar. Element Description Active A check box that indicates (if selected) that the row is an active                             filter. Brackets The opening bracket or brackets for composing a logical expression                             with multiple filtering conditions. Data Field The field whose value the filter should be applied to. Condition One of the following logical conditions, which will be applied to the                             value of the field specified as the  Data Field                              and the values in the  Value 1  and                                  Value 2  fields if applicable: Equals : Returns  TRUE  if the value of the                                          Data Field  field is equal to the                                     value specified as  Value 1 . Does Not Equal : Returns  TRUE  if the field value is                                     not equal to the  Value 1  value. Is Greater Than : Returns  TRUE  if the field value                                     is greater than the  Value 1  value. Is Greater Than or Equal To : Returns  TRUE  if the                                     field value is greater than or equal to the  Value                                         1  value. Is Less Than : Returns  TRUE  if the field value is                                     less than the  Value 1  value. Is Less Than or Equal To : Returns  TRUE  if the                                     field value is less than or equal to the  Value                                         1  value. Is Between : Returns  TRUE  if the field value is                                     between the  Value 1  and  Value                                         2  values. (For this option, you must specify                                     both  Value 1  and  Value                                         2 .) Contains : Returns  TRUE  if the field value (string)                                     contains the  Value 1  value. Does Not Contain : Returns  TRUE  if the field value                                     (string) does not contain the  Value 1                                      value. Starts With : Returns  TRUE  if the field value                                     contains at the beginning the  Value 1                                      value. Ends With : Returns  TRUE  if the field value ends                                     with the  Value 1  value. Is Empty : Returns  TRUE  if the field value is empty                                     (null). Is Not Empty : Returns  TRUE  if the field value is                                     not empty (not null). If you try to filter the inquiry results by using a string                                 that contains an underscore, the result will also contain the values                                 with the same string with any symbol instead of the underscore. For                                 example, if you try to filter the inquiry by a customer name that                                 contains the  Customer_Name  string, the system will return all                                 the customers whose name contains any of the following strings:                                      Customer_Name ,  Customer-Name , and  Customer                                     Name . The reason that all of these strings will be returned                                 is that the underscore is used as a wildcard                             character. Use                                 Parameter A check box that indicates (if selected) that a dashboard parameter                             is used in the filtering condition. When this check box is selected,                             only active dashboard parameters are displayed in the  Value                                 1  and  Value 2  columns. Value 1 The value you enter for the logical condition used to filter the                             data, if the selected condition requires a value. The value you enter                             must conform with the data type of the selected property. You can enter                             or select a fixed value, one of the predefined parameters, or one of the                             dashboard parameters.  The predefined parameters are listed in  Managing Advanced Filters. Value 2 The second value for the logical condition, if the selected logical                             condition requires a second value. (For example, the  Is Between                              logical condition requires a second value.) The value you enter must                             conform with the data type of the selected property. You can enter or                             select a fixed value, one of the predefined parameters, or one of the                             dashboard parameters. The predefined parameters are listed in  Managing Advanced Filters. Brackets A group of closing brackets to group logical conditions. Operator The logical operator to be used between groups of logical                             conditions. ]]></column>

((({S:Warn}If you try to filter the inquiry results by using a string that contains an underscore, the result will also contain the values with the same string with any symbol instead of the underscore. For example, if you try to filter the inquiry by a customer name that contains the ''Customer&#95;Name'' string, the system will return all the customers whose name contains any of the following strings: ''Customer&#95;Name'', ''Customer-Name'', and ''Customer Name''. The reason that all of these strings will be returned is that the underscore is used as a wildcard character.

Is Greater Than or Equal To : Returns  TRUE  if the                                     field value is greater than or equal to the  Value                                         1  value. Is Less Than : Returns  TRUE  if the field value is                                     less than the  Value 1  value. Is Less Than or Equal To : Returns  TRUE  if the                                     field value is less than or equal to the  Value                                         1  value. Is Between : Returns  TRUE  if the field value is                                     between the  Value 1  and  Value                                         2  values. (For this option, you must specify                                     both  Value 1  and  Value                                         2 .)

Starts With : Returns  TRUE  if the field value                                     contains at the beginning the  Value 1                                      value. Ends With : Returns  TRUE  if the field value ends                                     with the  Value 1  value. Is Empty : Returns  TRUE  if the field value is empty                                     (null). Is Not Empty : Returns  TRUE  if the field value is                                     not empty (not null). If you try to filter the inquiry results by using a string                                 that contains an underscore, the result will also contain the values                                 with the same string with any symbol instead of the underscore. For                                 example, if you try to filter the inquiry by a customer name that                                 contains the  Customer_Name  string, the system will return all                                 the customers whose name contains any of the following strings:                                      Customer_Name ,  Customer-Name , and  Customer                                     Name . The reason that all of these strings will be returned                                 is that the underscore is used as a wildcard                             character. Use                                 Parameter A check box that indicates (if selected) that a dashboard parameter                             is used in the filtering condition. When this check box is selected,                             only active dashboard parameters are displayed in the  Value                                 1  and  Value 2  columns. Value 1 The value you enter for the logical condition used to filter the                             data, if the selected condition requires a value. The value you enter                             must conform with the data type of the selected property. You can enter                             or select a fixed value, one of the predefined parameters, or one of the                             dashboard parameters.  The predefined parameters are listed in  Managing Advanced Filters. Value 2 The second value for the logical condition, if the selected logical                             condition requires a second value. (For example, the  Is Between                              logical condition requires a second value.) The value you enter must                             conform with the data type of the selected property. You can enter or                             select a fixed value, one of the predefined parameters, or one of the                             dashboard parameters. The predefined parameters are listed in  Managing Advanced Filters. Brackets A group of closing brackets to group logical conditions. Operator The logical operator to be used between groups of logical                             conditions. ]]></column>

==Filter Settings Table==
For a filter, the Filter Settings table contains clauses that make up the filter, with each row defining one clause of the filter. A filter may contain just one clause, or it may contain multiple simple clauses that you combine into one logical expression by using brackets and logical operators. The columns of the table are described below.{br}

If the filter is shared (the '''Shared''' check box is selected for the filter), the table is available only if the user account under which you are signed in has access to shared filters.[anchor|#_27fa9a41-636a-441a-8a0f-5be94d74ef13]{br}

The table toolbar includes only standard buttons. For the list of standard buttons, see [HelpRoot_Interface\Details_Toolbar|Table Toolbar].[anchor|#_sjk_zyq_mg]

|- 
| '''Value'''
| The value for the logical condition used to filter the data, if the selected condition requires a value. The value you enter must conform with the data type of the selected property. You can enter or select a fixed value or one of the predefined parameters (which are listed in [HelpRoot_ReportingTools\GI_Reusable_Filters_GeneralInfo|Advanced Filters: General Information]).
|- 
| '''Value2'''

|- 
| '''Brackets'''
| A set of closing brackets to group clauses. You use brackets for filters with multiple clauses.
|- 
| '''Operator'''
| The logical operator (''And'' or ''Or'') to be used between clauses or groups of clauses. You select this operator to join the current clause with the next one. Use the ''And'' operator to find the records that meet the criteria in both the selected clause and the next clause. Use the ''Or'' operator to find the records that meet the criteria in either the selected clause or the next clause. You can apply these operators to single clauses or groups of clauses.

===Printers by Report Table===
In this table, you can list reports that you regularly print and specify the default printer to be used when you print each of these reports. When you print a report from the list, the system uses the assigned printer.{br}

For each report that requires printing, a mailing should be created beforehand on the preferences form that corresponds to the functionality of the specific report. For example, for purchasing-related reports, mailings would be created on the '''Reporting Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form. You should ask a system administrator if such a mailing exists and request any needed assistance if it does not.{br}

Because labels are printed by using reports, you can also use this table to configure the printing of labels for a specific carrier on a particular printer.

In this case, too, a mailing should be created beforehand and assigned to the report that is used for printing the labels of this carrier; a system administrator may be able to assist you in finding or creating the needed mailing.

For example, for purchasing-related reports, mailings 						would be created on the  Reporting Settings  tab of the 							  ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) Purchase Orders Preferences (PO101000) form. You should ask a system 						administrator if such a mailing exists and request any needed assistance if 						it does not. Because labels are printed by using reports, you can also use this table to 						configure the printing of labels for a specific carrier on a particular 						printer. This capability may be useful for users who print carrier labels 						when the carrier has a specific label size. In this case, too, a mailing 						should be created beforehand and assigned to the report that is used for 						printing the labels of this carrier; a system administrator may be able to 						assist you in finding or creating the needed mailing.

Ship Via The identifier of the carrier whose labels will be printed on the printer selected in the  Default Printer  column.
