*Create a lead manually
*Import leads from a purchased list

==Marketing Leads in Acumatica ERP==
A marketing lead is contact information representing a person or a company that has a potential interest in products or services your organization offers. Leads make up the organization’s marketing audience, which is the target for marketing activities, such as marketing campaigns or advertisements.{br}

A marketing manager defines the organization’s marketing strategy, goals, and target audience, as well as acquiring and managing data on the marketing audience. When the audience data has been acquired, the marketing manager can create the needed leads in the system.
==Lead Creation==
Lead creation in Acumatica ERP consists of either or both of the following general steps:[anchor|#_f71404f5-e328-44c1-8aa4-0dd911a12e61]
*Creating leads manually
*Importing lead data from external sources

As soon as leads have been added to the system and checked for duplicates, as described in [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Mktg_Validating_Recs_Duplicates_Mapref|Validating Records for Duplicates], you can assign these leads to owners either one by one or in batches according to the rules that have been specified in the system, and the owners start working on these leads, as described in [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Mktg_Assigning_Leads_To_Owners_Mapref|Assigning Leads To Owners].{br}

In Acumatica ERP, you can create a lead in any of the following ways:[anchor|#_c147d045-4dee-4191-9dc8-4ff1a92b6ce6]
*By manually entering lead data on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form. For detailed instructions, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Mktg_Creating_Leads_Create_Lead|Creating Leads: To Create a Lead Manually].
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) form, if you click '''Actions''' > '''Create Lead'''.
*By using import scenarios to import lists of leads on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_36|Import by Scenario] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206036|SM206036]) form. For detailed instructions, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Mktg_Creating_Leads_Import_List_of_Leads|Creating Leads: To Import Leads From a Purchased List].
*By creating a lead from the Acumatica add-in for Outlook based on the details of the selected email recipient or sender. For detailed instructions, see [HelpRoot_Integration\OU_00_00_00| Acumatica Add-In for Outlook] and [HelpRoot_Integration\OU__how_To_Create_Lead|To Create a Lead by Using the Acumatica Add-In].
*By enabling integration with web services on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_70_40|Web Services] ([~/?ScreenId=SM207040|SM207040]) form for the automatic import of leads. For details, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Customization\CG_GL_Items_WebServices|Web Service Endpoints].
*By using the integration with HubSpot. For details, see [HelpRoot_CRM\config_HubSpot_Mapref|Configuring Integration with HubSpot].
*By activating the functionality of incoming mail processing on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_02|System Email Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=SM204002|SM204002]) form for the automatic creation of leads based on information about the sender. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\EM__con_Mail_Processing|Incoming Mail Processing].

==Contact Information==
On the '''Contact Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form, you can specify the name, contact information, and address of the selected lead. Also, this tab holds information about the lead's consent to the processing of personal data if the ''GDPR Compliance Tools'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. (For details about GDPR compliance tools, see [HelpRoot_Administration\GD__MNG_Handling_Personal_Data|Handling Personal Data].){br}

If the '''Override''' check box on the '''Contact Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] form is cleared, the contact information of the selected lead is synchronized with the contact information of the related contact and business account on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) form and the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) form, respectively. If the check box is selected, the contact information for the selected lead on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] form can differ from the contact information of the related record on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] and [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] forms, as well as from the contact information of the leads related to this lead. The synchronization or overriding of settings applies to all the settings on the '''Contact Info''' tab.[anchor|#_c1c19014-a7b4-4630-87e6-56caaa0420d7]
==Synchronization of Settings in Leads, Contacts, and Business Accounts==
In Acumatica ERP, you can easily synchronize the contact-related settings of a lead with the same settings in the contact and business account related to that lead. With this synchronization turned on, changes to the contact information of any of these entities causes the settings in the related entities to be updated as well.((({S:Hint}The synchronization or overriding of settings applies to all the settings on the '''Contact Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form, all the settings on the '''Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) form, and the contact and address settings (of the primary contact of the business account) on the '''General''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) form. 
)))
You can synchronize contact information in leads, contacts, and business accounts by using the '''Override''' check box on the '''Contact Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) form as follows:[anchor|#_a0399093-c279-47e6-bd3d-d4ef6beb89d7]
*If the check box is cleared and the business account related to the contact has not been converted to a customer or a vendor yet, the contact information of the contact on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] form is synchronized with the contact information of the related lead and business account on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] and [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] forms, respectively, and can be updated in both directions. That is, if you update the contact and address settings on any of these forms, the settings will be also updated on the related forms.
*If the check box is selected, the contact information for the selected contact on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] form can differ from the contact information of the related lead and business account on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] and [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] forms. If contact information is updated on any of these forms, the changes are not related on the other forms.

==Flexible Classification of Leads==
In Acumatica ERP, you can easily categorize leads into different classes and gather different sets of additional information about leads of different classes. When you create a new lead, the system can automatically assign a class to this lead and you can change the class as needed. For each class, you can create a set of attributes, which give users the ability to further classify leads within the class. For each attribute, you can define the type of control that represents it in the UI (check box, text box, or combo box) and specify the possible values, if applicable. For details, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Classes_Mapref|Configuring Classes in CRM].{br}

When a class for a lead has been selected, the attributes assigned to this class appear on the '''Attributes''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form as additional elements that can be used to specify information about a lead.{br}

An administrator can customize the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form to add to the Summary area the '''User-Defined Fields''' tab that holds the attributes. By using these fields, you can easily specify the attributes for the leads you are working with.]]></column>

For details, see  Incoming Mail Processing. Contact Information On the  Contact Info  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads         (CR301000) form, you can specify the name, contact information, and address of the selected         lead. Also, this tab holds information about the lead's consent to the processing of         personal data if the  GDPR Compliance Tools  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. (For details about GDPR compliance tools, see            Handling Personal Data.) If the  Override  check box on the  Contact Info          tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads form is cleared, the contact information of the         selected lead is synchronized with the contact information of the related contact and         business account on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) Contacts (CR302000) form and the             ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) Business Accounts (CR303000) form, respectively. If the check         box is selected, the contact information for the selected lead on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads form can differ from the contact information of the         related record on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) Contacts and   ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) Business Accounts forms, as well as from the contact information of         the leads related to this lead. The synchronization or overriding of settings applies to all         the settings on the  Contact Info  tab. Synchronization of Settings in Leads, Contacts, and Business                  Accounts In  Acumatica ERP, you can easily synchronize the contact-related settings of a lead with the same                 settings in the contact and business account related to that lead. With this                 synchronization turned on, changes to the contact information of any of these                 entities causes the settings in the related entities to be updated as well. The synchronization or overriding of settings applies to all the                     settings on the  Contact Info  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads (CR301000) form, all the settings on                     the                          Details                      tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) Contacts (CR302000) form, and the                     contact and address settings (of the primary contact of the business account) on                     the  General  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) Business Accounts (CR303000) form.                      You can synchronize contact information in leads, contacts, and business accounts by                 using the  Override  check box on the  Contact                     Info  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) Contacts                 (CR302000) form as                  follows: If the check box is cleared and the business account related to the contact has                     not been converted to a customer or a vendor yet, the contact information of the                     contact on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) Contacts form is synchronized                     with the contact information of the related lead and business account on the                           ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads and   ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) Business Accounts forms, respectively, and can be                     updated in both directions. That is, if you update the contact and address                     settings on any of these forms, the settings will be also updated on the related                     forms. If the check box is selected, the contact information for the selected contact                     on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) Contacts form can differ from the                     contact information of the related lead and business account on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads and   ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) Business Accounts forms. If contact information is                     updated on any of these forms, the changes are not related on the other                     forms. Flexible Classification of Leads In  Acumatica ERP, you can easily categorize leads into different classes and gather different sets of         additional information about leads of different classes. When you create a new lead, the         system can automatically assign a class to this lead and you can change the class as needed.         For each class, you can create a set of attributes, which give users the ability to further         classify leads within the class. For each attribute, you can define the type of control that         represents it in the UI (check box, text box, or combo box) and specify the possible values,         if applicable. For details, see  Configuring Classes in CRM. When a class for a lead has been selected, the attributes assigned to this class appear on         the  Attributes  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads (CR301000)         form as additional elements that can be used to specify information about a lead. An administrator can customize the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads (CR301000) form to add         to the Summary area the  User-Defined Fields  tab that holds the         attributes. By using these fields, you can easily specify the attributes for the leads you         are working with. ]]></column>

)))
==Story==
Suppose that you are Bill Owen, a marketing manager of the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company. SweetLife uses purchased lists as sources of leads. The lists are imported into Acumatica ERP so that all records are stored in a single place, managed, and classified. You have acquired a new purchased list, <tt>PurchasedLeads.xlsx</tt>, which has the contact information of bakery and restaurant employees. You need to import these leads from the Microsoft Excel file to Acumatica ERP.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, the following tasks have been performed:[anchor|#_d05b3823-d782-40ea-b8d8-a1fe43ff8ba8]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Customer Management'' feature has been enabled.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_70_00|Lead Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR207000|CR207000]) form, the ''STORE'' lead class has been added.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_15|Data Providers] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206015|SM206015]) form, the ''Lead Import from Purchased List'' data provider has been added and configured.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) form, the ''Import Leads from Purchased List'' import scenario has been configured. This scenario can be used for the import of leads from a Microsoft Excel file to Acumatica ERP. The ''Lead Import from Purchased List'' data provider is used for this import scenario. The imported leads will belong to the ''STORE'' lead class. For details, see [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__mng_Configuring_Import_Scenarios|Configuring Import Scenarios].

==Process Overview==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_36|Import by Scenario] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206036|SM206036]) form, you will select the ''Import Leads from Purchased List'' import scenario and then upload to the system the Microsoft Excel file with the purchased list of leads. After that, you will prepare the data so that the system validates the rows of records, and then you will initiate the import process.
==System Preparation==
Before you start importing leads from a purchased list to Acumatica ERP, do the following:[anchor|#_89e97719-b17b-4b85-82cf-6191bc681554]

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Creating Leads: To Import Leads From a Purchased List The following activity demonstrates how to import a purchased list of leads to  Acumatica ERP by using an import scenario. The following activity is             based on the  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system             settings have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the             activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100              dataset to its initial state. Story Suppose that you are Bill Owen, a marketing manager of the SweetLife Fruits &                 Jams company. SweetLife uses purchased lists as sources of leads. The lists are                 imported into  Acumatica ERP so that all records are stored in a single place, managed, and classified. You                 have acquired a new purchased list,  PurchasedLeads.xlsx , which                 has the contact information of bakery and restaurant employees. You need to import                 these leads from the Microsoft Excel file to  Acumatica ERP. Configuration Overview For the purposes of this activity, the following tasks have been performed: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS101000) form, the                          Customer Management  feature has been enabled. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR207000|CR207000]) Lead Classes (CR207000) form, the                          STORE  lead class has been added. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM206015|SM206015]) Data Providers (SM206015) form, the  Lead                         Import from Purchased List  data provider has been added and                     configured. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) Import Scenarios (SM206025) form, the                          Import Leads from Purchased List  import scenario has been configured.                     This scenario can be used for the import of leads from a Microsoft Excel file to                          Acumatica ERP. The  Lead Import from Purchased List  data provider is used for this                     import scenario. The imported leads will belong to the  STORE  lead class.                     For details, see  Configuring Import Scenarios. Process Overview On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM206036|SM206036]) Import by Scenario (SM206036) form, you will select                 the  Import Leads from Purchased List  import scenario and then upload to the                 system the Microsoft Excel file with the purchased list of leads. After that, you                 will prepare the data so that the system validates the rows of records, and then you                 will initiate the import process. System Preparation Before you start importing leads from a purchased list to  Acumatica ERP, do the following: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as a marketing manager with the following                         credentials: Username:  owen Password:  123 Make sure that the business date in your system is set to  1/30/2020.

[anchor|#_b367349b-5a4a-475c-9fd0-1c05a60f750b]
==Duplicate Validation in Acumatica ERP==
When a new lead, contact, or business account is created in the system, Acumatica ERP can check the newly created record for duplicates on entry (when the record is saved for the first time) or at the request of the user.{br}

Records can be validated for duplicates if the following setup tasks have been performed in the system:[anchor|#_e21bc387-cf6a-49a4-b93e-5dccc3e7f55d]

For more details, see [[#_0954a1df-8f02-48a9-be29-c28a296e7eb3|Calculation of Validation Scores].

After the setup tasks have been performed, users can validate records for duplicates, as described in [[#_6e44cf9f-926b-48e8-b71d-932190e18d25|Validation of Records for Duplicates]. They can merge duplicate records into one record, which involves updating the information in the target record and closing the duplicate record. (For details, see [[#_e5c77f3d-093b-4eb4-bc9d-4ff252988c54|Merging of Records on the Duplicates Tab].) Optionally, users can link the related leads, contacts, and business accounts, as described in [[#_c44677c4-a874-4691-9ca2-446047a2f853|Linking of Records on the Duplicates Tab]. As a result, the leads, contacts, and business accounts in the system are free of duplication, which improves productivity for the personnel, who can now work with consistent and reliable data.[anchor|#_924721b8-4821-4871-961c-fd6e58697cdf]
==Duplicate Validation Rules for Leads, Contacts, and Business Accounts==
Lead, contact, and business account records have the same internal fields (and corresponding UI elements), which contain the contact and address settings of a person or company. By using the settings on the '''Duplicate Validation Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_10_10_00|Customer Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CR101000|CR101000]) form, you can specify your organization’s rules for duplicate validation. You can select the fields according to your criteria; for example, you can compare only email addresses or compare multiple settings, such as email addresses, last names, and company names.{br}

You determine how the duplicate validation process is performed by using the '''Duplicate Validation Settings''' tab. The lower part of this tab contains three tabs, where you specify various duplication validation rules. During the duplication validation process, the system does the following:[anchor|#_59d6bd33-b12e-4bb1-b753-330c8e6b0d5a]
*Validates leads against other leads, contacts, and business accounts according to the rules specified on the '''Lead and Contact Validation Rules''' tab.
*Validates contacts against other contacts and leads based on the rules specified on the '''Lead and Contact Validation Rules''' tab.
*Validates leads against business accounts using the rules specified on the '''Lead and Account Validation Rules''' tab.
*Validates business accounts against other business accounts based on the rules specified on the '''Account Validation Rules''' tab.

Consider the example of the lead and contact validation rules shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_3fea5f10-e084-434b-9ae6-047c1400baa4][anchor|#_826d8cd2-3d1b-44cf-a68c-fd17bcf1a8f4][image:UserGuide/Images/CRM_Duplicate_Validation_GeneralInfo_Lead_Contact_Valid_Rules_1.png|popup|Example of duplicate validation rules for leads and contacts |750px]
You can use the following elements on the tab (which correspond to the items labeled in the screenshot):[anchor|#_02645c42-f746-44db-8221-5a09a8c99719]
#'''Lead and Contact Validation Rules''' tab: Here you can specify settings (matching fields, score weights, and transformation rules) for lead and contact validation.
#'''Matching Field''' column: In this column, you can specify each field whose values the system will compare during the validation process. 
#'''Score Weight''' column: The score weight you specify here indicates the share that the field contributes to the total validation score if two values match. The total validation score of a pair of compared records is calculated as the sum of the weights of the fields whose values match. By using the rules specified in the example shown in the screenshot, if email addresses match, the weight of 1.5 is added, and if both email addresses and last names match, the weight of 3.5 is added.
#'''Transformation Rule''' column: For each listed field, this column contains one of the following options, which indicate the rule the system will use to transform the matching field values before comparing them:
#*''None'': No additional rules are applied; the whole values are compared as they are.
#*''Split Words'': The system will compare separate words that make up the two values.
#*''Domain Name'': The system will compare the applicable domain name, such as ''domain.com''. In an email address or a URL (the ''Web'' field), the system will use the domain part of the address. For example, if the email address is ''email@example.com'', then only ''example.com'' will be used for comparison.
#'''Lead and Contact Validation Threshold''' box (Summary area of the tab): Here you can specify the threshold value used to determine whether the compared records are possible duplicates.
#:((({S:Hint}The total score of the fields listed in the '''Score Weight''' column should be greater than or the same as the value in the '''Lead and Contact Validation Threshold''' box.
)))

With the settings shown in the screenshot above, during lead and contact duplicate validation, the system compares all the values in the '''Score Weight''' column, adds the validation scores for the values that match, and then compares the total validation score against the threshold specified in the '''Lead and Contact Validation Threshold''' box. If the total validation score equals or exceeds this threshold value, the compared records are considered possible duplicates.[anchor|#_2ba2065e-ca10-4d52-9a37-c9c9392a7943]
==Additional Duplicate Validation Settings==
On the '''Duplicate Validation Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_10_10_00|Customer Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CR101000|CR101000]) form, you can specify additional duplicate validation settings to do the following:[anchor|#_74671cd7-553a-4812-9942-a034fdb52697]
*Validate a lead or contact for duplicates on entry: If you select the '''Validate Leads and Contacts for Duplicates on Entry''' check box, the system will validate each new lead or contact as soon as a user creates the record on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) form and saves the record for the first time. As a result of validation, the record is given the duplicate status of either ''Validated'' or ''Possible Duplicate'': The system inserts one of these values in the '''Duplicate''' box of the Summary area.
*Validate a business account for duplicates on entry: If you select the '''Validate Accounts for Duplicates on Entry''' check box, the system will validate each new business account as soon as a user creates the account on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) form and saves the record for the first time. As a result of validation, the business account is given the duplicate status of either ''Validated'' or ''Possible Duplicate'': The system inserts one of these values in the '''Duplicate''' box of the Summary area.
*Validate a lead or contact for duplicates base on the email address of the lead or contact: If you select the '''Require Unique Email Address on Contact Validation''' check box, the system will validate each new lead or contact email address for duplication as soon as a user specifies the email address on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] form and saves the record for the first time. As a result of validation, the record is given the duplicate status of either ''Validated'' or ''Possible Duplicate'': The system inserts one of these values in the '''Duplicate''' box of the Summary area.
[anchor|#_0954a1df-8f02-48a9-be29-c28a296e7eb3]
==Calculation of Validation Scores==
In Acumatica ERP, grams are used for the calculation of validation scores for each lead, contact, or business account. Each record has a number of settings, such as {{Last Name}}, {{Email}}, or {{Class ID}}. The grams value assigned to a particular record is defined by the total number of settings that are involved in the calculation of the validation score.{br}

As a rule, validation scores are calculated automatically if the ''Lead/Contact Duplicate Validation'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

You need to recalculate validation scores on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_50_34_00|Calculate Grams] ([~/?ScreenId=CR503400|CR503400]) form in the following cases:((({S:Warn}The [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_50_34_00|Calculate Grams] form is available only if the ''Lead/Contact Duplicate Validation'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
)))[anchor|#_48ce7f5c-95b6-48e6-8d78-e29336b4289c]
*Validation rules have been changed on the '''Duplicate Validation Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_10_10_00|Customer Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CR101000|CR101000]) form.
*The ''Lead/Contact Duplicate Validation'' feature was temporarily disabled while a batch of new records was imported into Acumatica ERP and then was enabled again.
[anchor|#_6e44cf9f-926b-48e8-b71d-932190e18d25]
==Validation of Records for Duplicates==
 Acumatica ERP provides the ability to mass-validate groups of records for duplicates and to validate individual records.{br}

To mass-validate records, you can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_50_34_10|Validate Leads and Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR503410|CR503410]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_50_34_20|Validate Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR503420|CR503420]) forms. On these forms, you can validate either records with the ''Not Validated'' duplicate status or all listed records.((({S:Warn}Validating all the records in the system may be a time-consuming process if you are validating a very large number of records. You can speed up duplicate validation by using parallel processing. For details, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Mktg_Validating_Recs_Duplicates_Mapref|Validating Records for Duplicates].
))){br}

If you validate all records, once you click '''Process All''' on the form toolbar, the system starts processing records one by one, first changing the duplicate status of each record to ''Not Validated'' in the '''Duplicate''' box of the Summary area on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form for a lead and the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) form for each contact. As a result of validation, each record is given a duplicate status of either ''Validated'' or ''Possible Duplicate''.((({S:Warn}We recommend that you not interrupt the duplicate validation process. If you do, you will not be able to resume it; each time you click '''Process All''', the processing starts anew for all listed records.
))){br}

You can validate individual records by manually executing the '''Check for Duplicates''' action, which is available in the '''Actions''' menu on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads], [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts], and [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) data entry forms, as described in [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Mktg_Validating_Recs_Duplicates_Validate_Multiple_Leads|Validating Records for Duplicates: To Validate Multiple Leads for Duplicates]. Also, new records can be validated on entry if the corresponding settings have been specified on the '''Duplicate Validation Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_10_10_00|Customer Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CR101000|CR101000]) form. In this case, validation scores are calculated for each new record on entry so that you do not have to manually run the gram recalculation process on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_50_34_00|Calculate Grams] ([~/?ScreenId=CR503400|CR503400]) form.{br}

If at least one possible duplicate has been found for a record, the '''Duplicates''' tab appears on the corresponding data entry form: [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads], [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts], or [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts]. On this tab, you can merge duplicate records into one record or link records, as described in the following sections.[anchor|#_e5c77f3d-093b-4eb4-bc9d-4ff252988c54]
==Merging of Records on the Duplicates Tab==
When you have performed validation for duplicates (whether validation has been performed for a group of records or an individual record), you can merge duplicate records relative to the lead, contact, or business account selected on the data entry form on the '''Duplicates''' tab of the respective form as follows:[anchor|#_a5aa1760-d9a8-4215-8bc3-e487ffb4e98c]
*On this tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form, you can merge the target lead you select with the selected duplicate lead. Before merging leads, you should indicate to the system which settings to use: those of the target lead or those of the duplicate lead.
*On this tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) form, you can merge the target contact you select with the selected duplicate contact. Before merging contacts, you should indicate to the system which settings to use: those of the target contact or those of the duplicate contact.
*On this tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) form, you can merge the target business account you select with the selected duplicate business account. Before merging business accounts, you should indicate to the system which settings to use: those of the target business account or those of the duplicate account.
((({S:Danger}The system does not allow merging of leads that are associated with different contacts: You cannot select such leads for merging.
)))
When you have resolved conflicts between the matching fields and merged the target record with the duplicate record, the duplicate record is no longer displayed on the '''Duplicates''' tab. For the duplicate record, the system inserts the ''Duplicated'' value in the ''' Duplicate''' box of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads], [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts], or [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] form (Summary area) and closes this record as duplicate. Also, most of the settings in the Summary area of the form and the settings on the tabs of the form become unavailable for editing. For details, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Mktg_Validating_Recs_Duplicates_Validating_Lead|Validating Records for Duplicates: To Validate a Lead for Duplicates].[anchor|#_c44677c4-a874-4691-9ca2-446047a2f853]
==Linking of Records on the Duplicates Tab==
When you have performed validation for duplicates (whether validation has been performed for a group of records or an individual record), you can associate leads with contacts or business accounts, or contacts with leads and business accounts on the '''Duplicates''' tab of the respective form as follows:[anchor|#_aa811ecb-2604-471a-a365-d71b702b54da]
*On this tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form, you can associate the lead selected on the form with a contact or business account. When you associate the lead with a contact or business account by clicking '''Link to Entity''' on the table toolbar of the '''Duplicates''' tab, you can see the contact or business account in the '''Contact''' or '''Account''' box in the Summary area of the form. Before associating the selected lead with a contact or business account, you should indicate to the system which settings to use: those of the target lead or those of the contact or business account with which you are associating with the lead. 
*On this tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) form, you can associate the contact selected on the form with a lead or business account. When you associate the contact with a lead or business account by clicking '''Link to Entity''', you can see the lead on the '''Leads''' tab of the form or the business account in the '''Account''' box in the Summary area of the form. Before associating the selected contact with a lead or business account, you should indicate to the system which settings to use: those of the target contact or those of the lead or business account with which you are associating with the contact.

When you have associated a record with the lead, contact, or business account, this record is no longer displayed on the '''Duplicates''' tab. For details, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Mktg_Validating_Recs_Duplicates_Validating_Lead|Validating Records for Duplicates: To Validate a Lead for Duplicates].]]></column>
			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Validating Records for Duplicates: General Information Duplicate records in your marketing data may cause data quality problems that result in         lost productivity for your marketing and sales teams. A large number of duplicate leads,         contacts, and business accounts could trigger the sending of the same marketing materials         multiple times to the same contact or business account. The probability of duplicates         significantly increases each time that you add to the system a large batch of new         records. To address these issues,  Acumatica ERP provides flexible tools for eliminating duplicate records. Learning Objectives In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following: Validate leads and contacts for duplicates Merge duplicate leads Link leads and contacts Applicable Scenarios You may want to learn how to validate records for duplicates in  Acumatica ERP in either (or both) of the following cases: You have imported to the system a batch of new leads and need to check these leads for           duplicates. You regularly validate all records in the system for duplicates, and it is time to again           initiate this process. Duplicate Validation in  Acumatica ERPWhen a new lead, contact, or business account is created in the system,  Acumatica ERP can check the newly created record for duplicates on entry (when the record is saved for         the first time) or at the request of the user. Records can be validated for duplicates if the following setup tasks have been performed in         the system: The  Lead/Contact Duplicate Validation  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. Default duplicate validation rules have been defined for each type of records (leads,           contacts, and business accounts) on the  Duplicate Validation             Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR101000|CR101000]) Customer Management Preferences (CR101000) form. For           more details, see  Duplicate Validation Rules for Leads, Contacts, and Business Accounts Duplicate Validation Rules for Leads, Contacts, and Business Accounts. Additional duplicate validation settings should also be specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR101000|CR101000]) Customer Management Preferences form. For more details, see  Additional Duplicate Validation Settings Additional Duplicate Validation Settings. The calculation of grams, which are used for the calculation of validation scores, has           been performed for each contact, lead, or business account record on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR503400|CR503400]) Calculate Grams (CR503400) form. For more details, see  Calculation of Validation Scores Calculation of Validation Scores. After the setup tasks have been performed, users can validate records for duplicates, as         described in  Validation of Records for Duplicates Validation of Records for Duplicates. They can merge duplicate records into one record, which involves updating         the information in the          target         record  and closing the duplicate record. (For details, see  Merging of Records on the Duplicates Tab Merging of Records on the Duplicates Tab.) Optionally, users can link the related leads, contacts, and business         accounts, as described in  Linking of Records on the Duplicates Tab Linking of Records on the Duplicates Tab. As a result, the leads, contacts, and business accounts in the system are         free of duplication, which improves productivity for the personnel, who can now work with         consistent and reliable data. Duplicate Validation Rules for Leads, Contacts, and Business Accounts Lead, contact, and business account records have the same internal          fields         (and corresponding UI         elements),  which         contain the contact and address settings of a person or company. By using the settings on         the  Duplicate Validation Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR101000|CR101000]) Customer Management Preferences (CR101000) form, you can specify your organization’s rules for         duplicate validation. You can select the fields according to your criteria; for example, you         can compare only email addresses or compare multiple settings, such as email addresses, last         names, and company names. You determine how the duplicate validation process is performed by using the            Duplicate Validation Settings  tab. The lower part of this tab         contains three tabs, where you specify various duplication validation rules. During the         duplication validation process, the system does the following: Validates leads against other leads, contacts, and business            accounts            according to the rules specified on the  Lead and Contact Validation             Rules  tab. Validates contacts against other contacts and leads based on the rules specified on the              Lead and Contact Validation Rules  tab. Validates leads against business accounts using the rules specified on the              Lead and Account Validation Rules  tab. Validates business accounts against other business accounts based on the rules specified           on the  Account Validation Rules  tab. Consider the example of the lead and contact validation rules shown in the following         screenshot. Example of duplicate validation rules for leads and contacts  You can use the following elements on the tab (which correspond to the items labeled in the         screenshot): Lead and Contact Validation Rules  tab: Here you can specify           settings (matching fields, score weights, and transformation rules) for lead and contact           validation. Matching Field  column: In this column, you can specify each field           whose values the system will compare during the validation process.  Score Weight  column: The score weight you specify here indicates           the share that the field contributes to the total validation score if two values match.           The total validation score of a pair of compared records is calculated as the sum of the           weights of the fields whose values match. By using the rules specified in the example           shown in the screenshot, if email addresses match, the weight of 1.5 is added, and if both           email addresses and last names match, the weight of 3.5 is added. Transformation Rule  column: For each listed field, this column           contains one of the following options, which indicate the rule the system will use to           transform the matching field values before comparing             them: None : No additional rules are applied; the whole values are compared as they               are. Split Words : The system will compare separate words that make up the two               values. Domain Name : The system will compare the applicable domain name, such as                  domain.com . In an email address or a URL (the  Web  field), the system               will use the domain part of the address. For example, if the email address is                  email@example.com , then only  example.com  will be used for               comparison. Lead and Contact Validation Threshold  box (Summary area of the           tab): Here you can specify the threshold value used to determine whether the compared           records are possible duplicates. The total score of the fields listed in             the  Score Weight  column should be greater than or the same as the             value in the  Lead and Contact Validation Threshold            box. With the settings shown in the screenshot above, during lead and contact duplicate         validation, the system compares all the values in the  Score Weight          column, adds the validation scores for the values that match, and then compares the total         validation score against the threshold specified in the  Lead and Contact           Validation Threshold  box. If the total validation score equals or exceeds this         threshold value, the compared records are considered possible duplicates. Additional Duplicate Validation Settings On the  Duplicate Validation Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR101000|CR101000]) Customer Management Preferences (CR101000) form, you can specify additional duplicate validation         settings to do the following: Validate a lead or contact for duplicates on entry: If you select the              Validate Leads and Contacts for Duplicates on Entry  check box,           the system will validate each new lead or contact as soon as a user creates the record on           the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads (CR301000) or   ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) Contacts (CR302000) form and saves the record for the           first time. As a result of validation, the record is given the duplicate status of either              Validated  or  Possible Duplicate : The system inserts one of these values in           the  Duplicate  box of the Summary area. Validate a business account for duplicates on entry: If you select the              Validate Accounts for Duplicates on Entry  check box, the system           will validate each new business account as soon as a user creates the account on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) Business Accounts (CR303000) form and saves the record for the first time. As a           result of validation, the business account is given the duplicate status of either              Validated  or  Possible Duplicate : The system inserts one of these values in           the  Duplicate  box of the Summary area. Validate a lead or contact for duplicates base on the email address of the lead or           contact: If you select the  Require Unique Email Address on Contact             Validation  check box, the system will validate each new lead or contact           email address for duplication as soon as a user specifies the email address on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads or   ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) Contacts form and saves           the record for the first time. As a result of validation, the record is given the           duplicate status of either  Validated  or  Possible Duplicate : The system           inserts one of these values in the  Duplicate  box of the Summary           area. Calculation of Validation Scores In  Acumatica ERP, grams are used for the calculation of validation scores for each lead, contact, or         business account. Each record has a number of settings, such as  Last Name ,            Email , or  Class ID . The grams value assigned to a         particular record is defined by the total number of settings that are involved in the         calculation of the validation score. As a rule, validation scores are calculated automatically if the  Lead/Contact Duplicate           Validation  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000)         form. You need to recalculate validation scores on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR503400|CR503400]) Calculate Grams (CR503400)         form in the following cases: The   ([~/?ScreenId=CR503400|CR503400]) Calculate Grams form           is available only if the  Lead/Contact Duplicate Validation  feature is enabled on           the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. Validation rules have been changed on the  Duplicate Validation             Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR101000|CR101000]) Customer Management Preferences (CR101000) form. The  Lead/Contact Duplicate Validation  feature was temporarily disabled while a           batch of new records was imported into  Acumatica ERP and then was enabled again. Validation of Records for Duplicates  Acumatica ERP provides the ability to mass-validate groups of records for duplicates and to validate         individual records. To mass-validate records, you can use the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR503410|CR503410]) Validate Leads and Contacts (CR503410) and             ([~/?ScreenId=CR503420|CR503420]) Validate Accounts (CR503420) forms. On these forms, you can validate either         records with the  Not Validated  duplicate status or all listed records. Validating all the records in the system may be a time-consuming process           if you are validating a very large number of records. You can speed up duplicate           validation by using parallel processing.            For           details, see  Validating Records for Duplicates. If you validate all records, once you click  Process All  on the form         toolbar, the system starts processing records one by one, first changing the duplicate         status of each record to  Not Validated  in the  Duplicate  box of         the Summary area on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads (CR301000) form for a lead and the             ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) Contacts (CR302000) form for each contact. As a result of         validation, each record is given a duplicate status of either  Validated  or            Possible Duplicate . We recommend that you not interrupt the           duplicate validation process. If you do, you will not be able to resume it; each time you           click  Process All , the processing starts anew for all listed           records. You can validate individual records by manually executing the  Check for           Duplicates  action, which is available in the  Actions          menu on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads,   ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) Contacts, and   ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) Business Accounts (CR303000) data entry forms, as described in  Validating Records for Duplicates: To Validate Multiple Leads for Duplicates. Also, new         records can be validated on entry if the corresponding settings have been specified on the            Duplicate Validation Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR101000|CR101000]) Customer Management Preferences (CR101000) form. In this case, validation scores are calculated         for each new record on entry so that you do not have to manually run the gram recalculation         process on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR503400|CR503400]) Calculate Grams (CR503400) form. If          at least one possible duplicate has been found for a record, the            Duplicates  tab appears on the corresponding data entry form:   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads,   ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) Contacts, or   ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) Business Accounts. On this tab, you can merge duplicate records into one record or         link records, as described in          the         following sections . Merging of Records on the Duplicates Tab When you have performed validation for duplicates (whether validation has been performed         for a group of records or an individual record), you can merge duplicate records relative to         the lead, contact, or business account selected on the data entry form on the            Duplicates  tab of the respective form as follows: On this tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads (CR301000) form, you can merge the           target lead you select with the selected duplicate lead. Before merging leads, you should           indicate to the system which settings to use: those of the target lead or those of the           duplicate lead. On this tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) Contacts (CR302000) form, you can merge the           target contact you select with the selected duplicate contact. Before merging contacts,           you should indicate to the system which settings to use: those of the target contact or           those of the duplicate contact. On this tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) Business Accounts (CR303000) form, you can merge the           target business account you select with the selected duplicate business account. Before           merging business accounts, you should indicate to the system which settings to use: those           of the target business account or those of the duplicate account. The system does not allow merging of leads that are associated with         different contacts: You cannot select such leads for merging. When you have resolved conflicts between the matching fields and merged the target record         with the duplicate record, the duplicate record is no longer displayed on the            Duplicates  tab. For the duplicate record, the system inserts the            Duplicated  value in the   Duplicate  box of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads,   ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) Contacts, or   ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) Business Accounts form (Summary area) and closes this record as duplicate. Also,         most of the settings in the Summary area of the form and the settings on the tabs of the         form become unavailable for editing. For details, see  Validating Records for Duplicates: To Validate a Lead for Duplicates. Linking of Records on the Duplicates Tab When you have performed validation for duplicates (whether validation has been performed         for a group of records or an individual record), you can associate leads with contacts or         business accounts, or contacts with leads and business accounts on the            Duplicates  tab of the respective form as follows: On this tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads (CR301000) form, you can associate           the lead selected on the form with a contact or business account. When you associate the           lead with a contact or business account by clicking  Link to Entity            on the table toolbar of the  Duplicates  tab, you can see the contact           or business account in the  Contact  or              Account  box in the Summary area of the form. Before associating           the selected lead with a contact or business account, you should indicate to the system           which settings to use: those of the target lead or those of the contact or business           account with which you are associating with the lead.  On this tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) Contacts (CR302000) form, you can associate           the contact selected on the form with a lead or business account. When you associate the           contact with a lead or business account by clicking  Link to Entity ,           you can see the lead on the  Leads  tab of the form or the business           account in the  Account  box in the Summary area of the form. Before           associating the selected contact with a lead or business account, you should indicate to           the system which settings to use: those of the target contact or those of the lead or           business account with which you are associating with the contact. When you have associated a record with the lead, contact, or business account, this record         is no longer displayed on the  Duplicates  tab.

==Story==
Suppose that you are Bill Owen, a marketing manager of the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company. You have created a new lead, ''Robert Watson'', the director of the supply chain at the Home Supplies store. Before you start working with the lead in the system, you need to validate the lead for duplicates.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, the following tasks have been performed:[anchor|#_3bff7b7c-70ae-4527-8dc8-0248faca363d]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the following features have been enabled:
**''Customer Management'': Provides the customer relationship management (CRM) functionality, including lead and customer tracking. This feature also gives users the ability to manage sales opportunities, contacts, marketing lists, and campaigns.
**''Lead/Contact Duplicate Validation'' in the ''Customer Management'' group of features: Provides the duplicate validation functionality.
*The ''Rob Watson'' leads has been created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form.
*The ''Rob Watson'' contact has been created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) form and associated with the ''Rob Watson''lead.
*The ''Robert Watson'' leads has been created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form.

==Process Overview==
In this activity, you will validate a lead for duplicates, merge the duplicate lead records into one record, and associate the lead record with the related contact record by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form.
==System Preparation==
Before you start validating a lead for duplicates, you should do the following:[anchor|#_49408a70-7c4a-4268-a217-e2acaf2bf475]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as a marketing manager by using the following credentials:
#*Username: ''owen''
#*Password: ''123''
#Make sure that on the Company and Branch Selection menu, in the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, the ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center'' branch is selected.

==Step 1: Validating a Lead for Duplicates==
To validate the ''Robert Watson'' lead for duplicates, do the following:[anchor|#_fa742785-635f-4638-890f-918dff014a89]
#Open the Leads (CR3010PL) form.
#In the row with ''Robert Watson'' in the '''Display Name''' column and ''Filled in an inquiry form on the company website'' in the '''Description''' column, click the ''Robert Watson'' link. The lead record opens on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form.
#:((({S:Hint}To search for a record in a list of records, you can enter a keyword or phrase in the Search box of the table toolbar. The system will find all the records that match your search criteria and display these records in the table. For details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS_Searching_in_Acumatica_ERP_Mapref|Searching in Acumatica ERP].
)))
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Check for Duplicates'''. Because a possible duplicate has been found, the '''Duplicates''' tab appears on the form, and the system has inserted''Possible Duplicate'' in the '''Duplicate''' box of the Summary area.

You have validated the ''Robert Watson'' lead for duplicates. On the '''Duplicates''' tab, you can see the duplicate lead and contact records.
==Step 2: Merging Duplicates==
To merge two duplicate ''Robert Watson'' lead records, do the following:[anchor|#_6e303f8b-448e-471a-b51a-084dfe9d0bbe]
#While you are still viewing the ''Robert Watson'' lead on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form, open the '''Duplicates''' tab.
#On the tab, select the unlabeled check box for the possible duplicate lead ''Rob Watson'', which is displayed in the table. Notice that the '''Merge''' button has become available on the table toolbar.
#:((({S:Hint}If the table lists more than one lead, you can select the unlabeled check boxes for all listed leads. In the next instructions, you will be able to select among the needed settings of these duplicate leads for the target lead record.
)))
#Click '''Merge'''. In the '''Target''' box of the dialog box that opens, the current lead is displayed. In the table below this box, you can see the list of duplicate values in the two records you are merging.
#:((({S:Hint}In the '''Target''' box, you can click the magnifier icon to select the record that you want to keep as the dedicated record. In the lookup table that opens, you can see the list of duplicate leads. The duplicate lead ''Rob Watson'' has a different first name (which is not correct) and does not have a job title or a phone number, so your target lead is the one you should keep.
)))
# While you are still working in the dialog box, do the following:
##In the row with ''Job Title'' in the '''Name''' column, select ''Director of Supply Chain''.
##In the row with ''Phone 1'' in the '''Name''' column, select ''212-962-2362''.
##Click '''OK''' to merge the duplicate records and close the dialog box. In the Summary area, notice that the system has inserted ''Validated'' in the '''Duplicate''' box. The duplicate record that has been merged with the target one and has been removed from the '''Duplicates''' tab; the system has given the record the ''Disqualified'' status.

==Step 3: Linking Records on the Duplicates Tab==
To associate the ''Robert Watson'' lead with the ''Rob Watson'' contact and correct the settings in the contact record (the correct first name is Robert, not Rob), do the following:[anchor|#_157bbfb8-a804-4c3c-b8df-06b8f140a5bc]

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Validating Records for Duplicates: To Validate a Lead for Duplicates Before you start working with a lead (or another employee does so), you may want to                 make sure that the lead has no duplicate leads in the system. The following activity                 will                  show                  you                  how to  validate a lead for duplicates. The following activity is             based on the  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system             settings have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the             activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100              dataset to its initial state. Story Suppose that you are Bill Owen, a marketing manager of the SweetLife Fruits &                 Jams company. You have created a new lead,  Robert Watson , the director of the                 supply chain at the Home Supplies store. Before you start working with the lead in                 the system, you need to validate the lead for duplicates. Configuration Overview For the purposes of this activity, the following tasks have been performed: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, the following features                     have been enabled: Customer Management :                              Provides                             the customer relationship management (CRM) functionality, including lead                             and customer tracking. This feature also gives users the ability to                             manage sales opportunities, contacts, marketing lists, and                              campaigns . Lead/Contact Duplicate Validation  in the  Customer                                 Management  group of features:                              Provides                             the duplicate validation functionality. The  Rob Watson  leads has been created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads (CR301000) form. The  Rob Watson  contact has been created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) Contacts (CR302000) form and associated with the  Rob                         Watson lead . The  Robert Watson  leads has been created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads (CR301000) form. Process Overview In                 this activit y, you will validate a                 lead for duplicates, merge the duplicate lead records into one record, and associate                 the lead record with the related contact record by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads (CR301000) form. System Preparation Before you start validating a lead for duplicates, you should do the following: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as a marketing manager by using the following                         credentials: Username:  owen Password:  123 Make sure that on the Company and Branch Selection menu, in the top pane of the                          Acumatica ERP screen, the  SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center  branch is                     selected. Step 1: Validating a Lead for Duplicates To validate the  Robert Watson  lead for duplicates, do the following: Open the Leads (CR3010PL) form. In the row with  Robert Watson  in the  Display Name                      column and  Filled in an inquiry form on the company website  in the                          Description  column, click the  Robert Watson                      link. The lead record opens on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads                     (CR301000) form. To search for a record in a list of records,                         you can enter a keyword or phrase in the Search box of the table toolbar.                         The system will find all the records that match your search criteria and                         display these records in the table. For details, see  Searching in Acumatica ERP. On the form toolbar, click  Actions Check for Duplicates . Because a possible duplicate has been found, the                          Duplicates  tab appears on the form, and                     the                      system has inserted Possible Duplicate  in the  Duplicate  box of the                     Summary area. You have validated the  Robert Watson  lead for duplicates. On the                      Duplicates  tab, you can see the duplicate lead and                 contact records. Step 2: Merging Duplicates To merge two duplicate  Robert Watson  lead records, do the following: While you are still viewing the  Robert Watson  lead on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads (CR301000) form, open the                          Duplicates  tab. On the tab, select the unlabeled check box for the possible duplicate lead                          Rob Watson , which is displayed in the table. Notice that the                          Merge  button has become available on the table                         toolbar. If the table lists more than one lead, you can                         select the unlabeled check boxes for all listed leads. In the next                         instructions, you will be able to select among the needed settings of these                         duplicate leads for                         the                          target lead record . Click  Merge . In the                          Target                      box of the dialog box that opens, the current lead is displayed. In the table                     below this box, you can see the list of duplicate values in the two records you                     are merging. In the  Target  box, you can                         click the magnifier icon to select the record that you want to keep as the                         dedicated record. In the lookup table that opens, you can see the list of                         duplicate leads. The duplicate lead  Rob Watson  has a different first                         name (which is not correct) and does not have a job title or a phone number,                         so your target lead is the one you should keep.  While you are still working in the dialog box, do the following: In the row with  Job Title  in the  Name                              column, select  Director of Supply Chain . In the row with  Phone 1  in the  Name                              column, select  212-962-2362 . Click  OK  to merge the duplicate records and close                             the dialog box. In the Summary area, notice that the system has inserted                                  Validated  in the  Duplicate  box. The                             duplicate record that has been merged with the target one and has been                             removed from the  Duplicates  tab; the system has                             given the record the  Disqualified  status. Step 3: Linking Records on the Duplicates Tab To associate the  Robert Watson  lead with the  Rob Watson  contact and                 correct the settings in the contact record (the correct first name is Robert, not                 Rob), do the following: While you are still viewing the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads (CR301000) form                     for the lead  Robert Watson , open the  Duplicates                      tab.  In the row with  Contact  in the  Type  column and                          Robert Watson  in the  Display Name  column,                     click the  Robert Watson  link to open the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) Contacts (CR302000) form in a pop-up window,                     and review the data in the contact record. Notice that the contact does not have                     a job title or any phone numbers. Close the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) Contacts form. On the table toolbar, click  Link to Entity . In the  Warning  dialog box, which opens, click                          No , because you do not want to replace the contact                     information specified in the lead record with the information from the contact                     record; the information in the lead record is correct and has more details. The                     system closes the dialog box. In the  Contact  box of the                     Summary area, you can see the  Robert Watson  contact that the lead has                     been associated with. On the form toolbar, click  Actions Check for Duplicates  to make sure that no duplicate records for the  Robert                         Watson  lead have been found in the system. Notice that the system has                     inserted  Validated  in the  Duplicate  box.  You have associated the lead with the contact. ]]></column>

)))
#When the duplicate validation process has been completed, click '''Close''' to close the dialog box. Notice that the list of the records on the form no longer contains any records.

You have validated newly imported leads for duplicates. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form, in the '''Duplicate''' column, the system has inserted the appropriate value for each lead: ''Validated'' or ''Possible Duplicate''. {br}

Now you can view possible duplicate records, as described in the following step. Merging duplicates and linking the related leads and contacts is described in [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Mktg_Validating_Recs_Duplicates_Validating_Lead|Validating Records for Duplicates: To Validate a Lead for Duplicates].
==Step 2: Viewing Possible Duplicate Records==
In the previous step, you have validated all leads in the system for duplicates. Now you need to view the list of leads that have possible duplicates and the ''Thomas Jones'' lead among these records.{br}

To view possible duplicates, do the following:[anchor|#_5d3644ad-3bb8-49c0-8f67-9931ae4cf51a]
#While you are still viewing the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_50_34_10|Validate Leads and Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR503410|CR503410]) form, in the table, click the column header of the '''Duplicate''' column.
#In the Sorting and Filtering Settings dialog box, which opens, create a filter to view only records with the ''Possible Duplicate'' status as follows:
##Click '''Clear All'''.
##Select ''Possible Duplicate''.
##Click '''OK'''.

When the duplicate validation process has been completed, click                          Close  to close the dialog box. Notice that the list                     of the records on the form no longer contains any records. You have validated newly imported leads for duplicates. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads (CR301000) form, in the                      Duplicate                  column, the system has inserted the appropriate                  value                  for each lead:  Validated  or  Possible Duplicate .  Now you can view possible duplicate records, as described in the following step.                 Merging duplicates and linking the related leads and contacts is described in  Validating Records for Duplicates: To Validate a Lead for Duplicates. Step 2: Viewing Possible Duplicate Records In the previous step, you have validated all leads in the system for duplicates. Now                 you need to view the list of leads that have possible duplicates and the  Thomas                     Jones  lead among these records. To view possible duplicates, do the following: While you are still viewing the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR503410|CR503410]) Validate Leads and Contacts                     (CR503410) form, in the table, click the column header of the                          Duplicate  column. In the Sorting and Filtering Settings dialog box, which opens, create a filter                     to view only records with the  Possible Duplicate  status as follows: Click  Clear All . Select  Possible Duplicate . Click  OK . The table now lists only the records that have the  Possible                             Duplicate  status. Notice the  Thomas Jones  record, which has                         the  Lead  type in the  Type  column. Click the link in the  Contact  column in the row with the                          Thomas Jones  record. The   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads (CR301000)                     form for the record opens in a pop-up window. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads form, open the                          Duplicates  tab. Now on the  Duplicates  tab, you can view the identical contact                 details of the duplicate records and merge duplicates or link related records, as                 described in  Validating Records for Duplicates: To Validate a Lead for Duplicates. ]]></column>

 Acumatica ERP provides you with flexible tools for distributing the workload among responsible persons in the company. You can use assignment maps to indicate to the system how to assign records—such as leads, opportunities, or cases—to persons or groups of persons. This topic provides information about assigning leads to owners one by one or through mass processing.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Assign a lead manually to a particular owner
*In a lead class, specify how the system determines the default owner it specifies for new leads of the class
*Assign a selected group of leads to owners by using a lead assignment map

==Applicable Scenarios==
You may want to learn how to assign leads to owners in scenarios that include the following:[anchor|#_7165d0ed-fbf9-4bca-b563-a0155c7a9310]
*You have acquired a new lead and need to assign this lead to a particular person or a group of persons for nurturing.
*You have been requested to work with a lead and need to specify yourself as an owner.
*You have imported to the system a new batch of leads, such as a purchased list, and need to distribute these leads among the employees of the applicable department or group, such as a marketing department.

==Distribution of Leads Between Owners in Acumatica ERP==
In Acumatica ERP, you can easily base the rules for lead assignment on company policies because leads can be distributed among owners (individuals) or workgroups (groups of people) in many different ways, based on the settings and attributes of the lead records being distributed. You can distribute leads manually or automatically. 
You can manually assign leads individually or in groups. When you create a lead on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form or at any later time, you can select an owner in the '''Owner''' box of the Summary area. You can also manually change the owner of a lead that has been manually or automatically assigned. You can assign groups of leads that do not have owners specified by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_50_30_10|Assign Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR503010|CR503010]) mass processing form. On this form, you can assign selected leads or all leads that do not have owners, and the system uses the assignment map specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_10_10_00|Customer Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CR101000|CR101000]) form to determine the owners of the leads.{br}

You can cause leads to be automatically assigned to owners by specifying a setting for any lead class that determines how the default owner is assigned to new leads of the class. On the '''Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_70_00|Lead Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR207000|CR207000]) form for a lead class, based on the option you select in the '''Default Owner''' box, the system assigns one of the following as the default owner of a new lead of the class:[anchor|#_5513b980-d051-429a-bcad-f4bd0e0bfdba]
*The user that created the lead (''Creator'' option)
*A user determined by the assignment map you specify (''Assignment Map'' option)
*The owner specified for the contact or business account from which the lead was created (''From source entity'' option), if you created the lead in this way
{br}

If you want the system to distribute leads by using an assignment map, whether to assign the owner of leads of a particular class or to be used for mass-assignment of leads, you must perform two preliminary tasks. You can first create a company tree on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_40_61|Company Tree] ([~/?ScreenId=EP204061|EP204061]) form, as described in the following section. Then you can create the needed maps for the automatic assignment of leads by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_50_10|Assignment Maps] ([~/?ScreenId=EP205010|EP205010]) form.[anchor|#_f86d138a-4d4f-4eee-b2f3-2d13e51b348f]
==The Company Tree and Workgroups==
Maintaining and using a functional organizational chart in an ERP system can facilitate the assignment of work and approvals for optimal collaboration within teams and smoother workflows.
In Acumatica ERP, a company tree is a hierarchical structure that contains groups of persons, roles of persons, and chains of assignments and approvals. A company tree may include both an organizational chart of a company with different levels of management and a hierarchy of groups representing real business relations and functions.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_40_61|Company Tree] ([~/?ScreenId=EP204061|EP204061]) form, you can easily create various hierarchies of groups for approvals or assignments, and include the same persons or groups of persons in different workgroups. Thus, users can participate in multiple workflows. You can use approvals for cross-department projects, which have a manager and project participants that may belong to different company departments but be members of the same chain of approvals. We recommend using a company tree to speed and streamline your assignments and approvals.
==Distribution of Leads by Using Lead Classes==
As noted previously, when you create or modify a lead class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_70_00|Lead Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR207000|CR207000]) form, you can specify how the system automatically assigns the owner to newly created leads of the class. You do this by selecting the appropriate option in the '''Default Owner''' box on the '''Details''' tab ('''Data Entry Settings''' section). Based on the selected option selected for the lead class, when a lead class has been selected for a lead on the '''CRM Info''' tab ('''CRM''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form, the system determines the default owner of this lead and inserts the appropriate employee name in the '''Owner''' box in the Summary area of the form.{br}

In the '''Default Owner''' box of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_70_00|Lead Classes] form, you select one of the following options for the lead class:[anchor|#_62415367-6863-4b3f-bdc2-937212d338d9]
*''Creator'': When a lead of the class is created, the user who created the lead record is assigned as its owner by default.
*''Assignment Map'': When a lead of the class is created, based on the assignment map (which you must also select in the '''Assignment Map''' box for the class), the system determines the default owner or workgroup (or both) and inserts them on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] form. The system inserts the workgroup of the lead, if applicable, on the '''CRM Info''' tab ('''CRM''' section). If you are distributing leads based on assignment maps, you can use a different assignment map for each lead class, if needed.
*''From Source Entity'': When a lead of the class is created, if it is created from another entity, such as a contact, or business account, the lead inherits the owner and workgroup (if specified) from this contact or business account. This default owner is assigned if you create a lead from a contact on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) form or from a business account on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) form.

We recommend distributing leads by using lead classes because the system assigns a lead to an owner each time a new lead record is created.
==Distribution of Leads by Using Assignment Maps==
You can use the assignment map functionality to distribute leads automatically through the use of lead classes or manually when you mass-assign leads.[anchor|#_8681a850-8b58-4781-9eda-61e9dbae8c41]{br}

An assignment map is a set of steps, rules, and conditions that can be used for assigning a record or a number of records for processing to a particular person or a group of persons. An assignment map may include any number of rules, which are executed sequentially. Each rule in an assignment map includes conditions and actions to be performed if the conditions are met. You create assignment maps on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_50_10|Assignment Maps] ([~/?ScreenId=EP205010|EP205010]) form as follows: [anchor|#_9fd6b996-08b9-4cc7-9d4d-d794838bf0d6]
*On the '''Rules''' tree, you add new rules.
*On the '''Conditions''' tab, you add conditions that assignment criteria should meet.
*On the '''Rule Actions''' tab, you select an owner or a workgroup (or both).
{br}

Once a lead assignment map has been created, you can do any of the following:[anchor|#_b5efe1fd-82ff-488a-8a90-90db6f49e719]
*Specify the assignment map on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_70_00|Lead Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR207000|CR207000]) form for the lead class if you have selected ''Assignment Map'' in the '''Default Owner''' box on the '''Details''' tab: Each new lead of the class will be assigned to a default owner according to this map. A user can change the owner as needed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form.
*Specify the assignment map on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_10_10_00|Customer Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CR101000|CR101000]) form, in the '''Lead Assignment Map''' box of the '''General Settings''' tab ('''Assignment Settings '''section): Existing leads that do not have owners will be assigned to owners according to this map if you assign the leads by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_50_30_10|Assign Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR503010|CR503010]) mass processing form.
((({S:Warn}The assignment map specified for the applicable lead class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_70_00|Lead Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR207000|CR207000]) form overrides the assignment map specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_10_10_00|Customer Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CR101000|CR101000]) form. Leads of the class will be assigned to owners according to the assignment map from the lead class.
)))
==Execution Issues Related to a Lead Assignment Map==
If an assignment map contains errors (for example, a workgroup contains an employee who has quit the company and cannot be assigned to any records), and you have processed any leads that should be assigned according to this assignment map by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_50_30_10|Assign Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR503010|CR503010]) form, the system will list these errors in the '''Processing''' dialog box. You can view the error by clicking the More button on the '''Errors''' tile in this dialog box. In the '''Message''' column, the system displays the text of the error message.
==Notifications About Assigning a Lead to an Owner==
In Acumatica ERP, an administrator can set up email notifications on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_50|Business Events] ([~/?ScreenId=SM302050|SM302050]) form so that if you are assigned to a new lead, you receive a notification by email, by SMS, or in Acumatica mobile app. For details, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Customization\CG_GL_Items_BusinessEvents|Business Events].]]></column>

You can also manually         change the owner of a lead that has been manually or automatically assigned. You can assign         groups of leads that do not have owners specified by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR503010|CR503010]) Assign Leads (CR503010) mass processing form. On this form, you         can assign selected leads or all leads that do not have owners, and the system uses the         assignment map specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR101000|CR101000]) Customer Management Preferences (CR101000) form to determine         the owners of the         leads . You can cause leads to be automatically assigned to owners by specifying a setting for any         lead class that determines how the default owner is assigned to new leads of the class. On         the  Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR207000|CR207000]) Lead Classes         (CR207000) form for a lead class, based on the option you select in the  Default           Owner  box, the system assigns one of the following as the default owner of a         new lead of the class: The user that created the lead ( Creator  option) A user determined by the assignment map you specify ( Assignment Map              option) The owner specified for the contact or business account from which the lead was             created ( From source entity  option), if you created the lead in this way If you want the system to          distribute         leads  by using an assignment map, whether to assign the owner of leads of         a particular class or to be used for mass-assignment of leads, you must perform two         preliminary tasks. You          can          first create a company tree on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP204061|EP204061]) Company Tree (EP204061)         form, as described in the following         section.          Then you can create the needed maps for the automatic assignment of leads by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP205010|EP205010]) Assignment Maps (EP205010) form. The                  Company                 Tree  and Workgroups Maintaining                  and                 using  a functional organizational chart in an ERP system can                 facilitate the assignment of work and approvals for optimal collaboration within                 teams and smoother workflows. In  Acumatica ERP, a company tree is a hierarchical structure that contains groups of                  persons ,                 roles of persons, and chains of assignments and approvals. A company tree may                 include both an organizational chart of a company with different levels of                 management and a hierarchy of groups representing real business relations and                 functions . On the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP204061|EP204061]) Company Tree (EP204061) form,                 you can easily create                  various                 hierarchies  of groups for approvals or                 assignments, and include the same persons or groups of persons in different                 workgroups. Thus, users can participate in multiple workflows. You can use approvals                 for cross-department projects, which have a manager and project participants that                 may belong to different company departments but be members of the same chain of                 approvals. We recommend using a company tree to speed and streamline your                 assignments and approvals. Distribution of Leads by Using Lead Classes As noted previously, when you create or modify a lead class on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR207000|CR207000]) Lead Classes (CR207000) form, you can specify how the system         automatically assigns the owner to newly created leads of the class. You do this by         selecting the appropriate option in the  Default Owner  box on the            Details  tab ( Data Entry Settings  section).         Based on the selected option selected for the lead class, when a lead class has been         selected for a lead on the  CRM Info  tab ( CRM          section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads (CR301000) form, the system determines the         default owner of this lead and inserts the appropriate employee name in the            Owner  box in the Summary area of the form. In the  Default Owner  box of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR207000|CR207000]) Lead Classes form, you select one of the following options for the lead class: Creator : When a lead of the class is created, the user who created the lead           record is assigned as its owner by default. Assignment Map : When a lead of the class is created, based on the assignment map           (which you must also select in the  Assignment Map  box for the           class), the system determines the default owner or workgroup (or both) and inserts them on           the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads form. The system inserts the workgroup of the lead, if           applicable, on the  CRM Info  tab ( CRM            section). If you are distributing leads based on assignment maps, you can use a different           assignment map for each lead class, if needed. From Source Entity : When a lead of the class is created, if it is created from            another           entity, such as a contact, or business           account , the lead inherits the owner and           workgroup (if specified) from this contact or business account. This default owner is           assigned if you create a lead from a contact on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) Contacts (CR302000) form or from a business account on the               ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) Business Accounts (CR303000) form. We recommend distributing leads by using lead classes because the system assigns a lead to         an owner each time a new lead record is created. Distribution         of  Leads by Using Assignment Maps You can use the assignment map functionality to distribute leads automatically through the         use of lead classes or manually when you mass-assign leads. An assignment map is a set of steps, rules, and             conditions that can be used for assigning a record              or             a number of records  for processing to a particular              person              or a group of persons. An assignment map may include any number of rules, which are             executed sequentially.              Each             rule in an assignment map includes conditions and actions to be performed if the             conditions are met.  You create assignment maps on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP205010|EP205010]) Assignment Maps (EP205010) form as follows:                  On the  Rules  tree, you add new rules. On the  Conditions  tab, you add conditions that assignment                     criteria should meet. On the  Rule Actions  tab, you select an                      owner                     or a workgroup (or both). Once a lead assignment map has been created, you can do any of the following: Specify the assignment map on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR207000|CR207000]) Lead Classes           (CR207000) form for the lead class if you have selected  Assignment Map  in the              Default Owner  box on the  Details  tab: Each           new lead of the class will be assigned to a default owner according to this map. A user           can change the owner as needed on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads (CR301000)           form. Specify the assignment map on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR101000|CR101000]) Customer Management Preferences (CR101000) form, in           the  Lead Assignment Map  box of the  General             Settings  tab ( Assignment Settings  section): Existing           leads that do not have owners will be assigned to owners according to this map if you           assign the leads by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR503010|CR503010]) Assign Leads (CR503010) mass           processing form. The assignment map specified for          the         applicable  lead class on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR207000|CR207000]) Lead Classes         (CR207000) form overrides the assignment map specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR101000|CR101000]) Customer Management Preferences (CR101000) form.          Leads         of the class will be assigned to owners according to the assignment map from the lead         class. Execution Issues Related to a Lead Assignment Map If an assignment map contains errors (for example, a workgroup contains an employee who has         quit the company and cannot be assigned to any records), and you have processed any leads         that should be assigned according to this assignment map by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR503010|CR503010]) Assign Leads (CR503010) form, the system will list these errors         in the  Processing  dialog box. You can view the error by clicking the         More button on the  Errors          tile          in this dialog box . In the  Message  column, the         system displays the text of the error message.

==Story==
Suppose that you are Bill Owen, a new marketing manager of the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company, and you are performing several tasks related to assigning leads to the appropriate owner. First, you need to modify an existing lead class (the class for confectioneries) so that by default, when a new lead of the class is created, the system assigns the lead’s creator as its owner. Also, a new lead, ''Stanley Carson'', has been created in the system, and you want to manually assign this lead to you and to your workgroup. {br}

A number of leads whose companies can be classified as stores (including supermarkets) and food service companies (bakeries, cafes, or restaurants) have been imported into the system, and you want to distribute these leads between two workgroups of marketing employees as follows:[anchor|#_e0798017-41d6-4a7e-a20c-38f0f505480f]
*The ''Marketing Stores'' workgroup will be working with leads that represent supermarkets and other stores.
*The ''Marketing Food Services'' workgroup, to which your ''owen'' user account belongs, will be working with leads that represent restaurants, cafes, bakeries, and other food service companies.

The needed workgroups have been defined in the company tree and an assignment map has been created to assign leads to the needed workgroup; also, you have specified the needed configuration setting to cause the system to use this assignment map when you are mass-assigning leads. You will mass-assign leads by using this assignment map.
==Configuration Overview==
In the ''U100'' dataset, for the purposes of this activity, the following tasks have been performed:[anchor|#_98489720-14ad-46d0-aed9-fc4ec675c7fc]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Customer Management'' feature has been enabled. This feature provides the customer relationship management (CRM) functionality, including lead and customer tracking, as well as the handling of sales opportunities, contacts, marketing lists, and campaigns.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_40_61|Company Tree] ([~/?ScreenId=EP204061|EP204061]) form, the company tree has been configured and it includes the ''Marketing Supermarkets'' and the ''Marketing Food Services'' workgroups as well as the users in the Marketing department.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_50_10|Assignment Maps] ([~/?ScreenId=EP205010|EP205010]) form, the ''Lead Assignment Map'' has been created. According to the rule actions specified in the assignment map, the leads of the ''STORE'' class are assigned to the ''Marketing Supermarkets'' workgroup in the SweetLife marketing department, and the leads of the ''BAKERY'' and ''CAFE'' classes are assigned to the ''Marketing Food Services'' workgroup in the marketing department.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_10_10_00|Customer Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CR101000|CR101000]) form (in the '''Lead Assignment Map''' box of the '''Assignment Settings''' section of the '''General Settings''' tab), the lead assignment map has been specified. The system will use this assignment map during the process of mass-assigning leads.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_70_00|Lead Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR207000|CR207000]) form, the following lead classes have been created: ''STORE'' (for leads that are supermarkets and other stores), ''BAKERY'', ''CAFE'' (which includes leads that are restaurants and cafes), and ''SWEETSHOP'' (for leads that are confectioneries).
*A list of lead records that includes bakeries, cafes, restaurants, and supermarkets has been imported to the system through the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_36|Import by Scenario] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206036|SM206036]) form.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form, the following leads—which have been assigned to, respectively, the ''STORE'', ''BAKERY'', and ''CAFE'' lead classes—have been added to the system: ''Stanley Carson'', ''Douglas Keatinge'', and ''Duncan Saunders''.

==Process Overview==
In this activity, you will do the following: [anchor|#_df6cfa87-7cd6-4d3b-8fe1-8bc5587aee58]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_70_00|Lead Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR207000|CR207000]) form, specify how the system assigns the default owner of leads of a particular class
#Manually assign a particular lead to an owner by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form
#Assign selected leads to owners by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_50_30_10|Assign Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR503010|CR503010]) form

==System Preparation==
Before you start assigning leads to owners, you should do the following:[anchor|#_49408a70-7c4a-4268-a217-e2acaf2bf475]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as a marketing manager by using the following credentials:
#*Username: ''owen''
#*Password: ''123''
#Make sure that on the Company and Branch Selection menu, in the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, the ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center'' branch is selected.

==Step 1: Specifying a Default Owner for New Leads of a Lead Class==
You can modify the settings of a lead class to specify how the system assigns the default owner of a newly created lead of the class—that is, whether the default owner is the creator of the lead, a user determined by an assignment map that you specify (so that specific owners can be assigned), or the owner of the entity (such as a contact) from which the lead is created, if the lead was created in this way.{br}

In this step, you will specify the owner of a new lead of the ''SWEETSHOP'' class as its creator.{br}

To specify the default owner of an existing lead class and make sure the owner is assigned correctly to a new lead of the class, do the following:[anchor|#_a28ffbcf-851f-46fe-8f24-beaba475fd4e]
#Open the Lead Classes (CR2070PL) form.
#In the '''Class ID''' column, click the ''SWEETSHOP'' link to open the lead class record on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_70_00|Lead Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR207000|CR207000]) form.
#On the '''Details''' tab ('''Data Entry Settings''' section), in the '''Default Owner''' box, select ''Creator''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.
#Make sure that the option that you have just specified assigns new leads to owners correctly by doing the following:
##Open the Leads (CR3010PL) form.
##On the table toolbar, click '''New Record'''. A new lead record opens on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form.
##On the '''Contact Info''' tab, in the '''Contact''' section, specify the following settings:
##*'''First Name''': <tt>Sandra</tt>
##*'''Last Name''': <tt>Flynn</tt>
##*'''Company Name''': <tt>Crystal Sweet</tt>
##*'''Email''': <tt>s.flynn@crystalsweet.example.com</tt>
##Open the '''CRM Info''' tab.
##In the '''Lead Class''' box, select ''SWEETSHOP''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

You have specified how the system determines the default owner for leads of the ''SWEETSHOP'' lead class and then created a new lead to test the setting. The system has appropriately inserted the default owner for the new lead. Each time a user creates a lead of the ''SWEETSHOP'' class, the system will insert the employee name of the creator of the lead as the owner of the lead.
==Step 2: Assigning a Lead to an Owner Manually==
To assign a lead to an owner manually, do the following:[anchor|#_fa742785-635f-4638-890f-918dff014a89]
#Open the Leads (CR3010PL) form.
#In the '''Display Name''' column, click the ''Stanley.Carson'' link to open this lead record on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form.
#:((({S:Hint}To search for a record in a list or records, you can enter a text string in the Search box of the filtering area. The system will find all the records that match your search criteria and display these records in the table. For details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS_Searching_in_Acumatica_ERP_Mapref|Searching in Acumatica ERP].
)))
#In the '''Workgroup''' box on the '''CRM Info''' tab, select the ''Marketing Food Services'' workgroup.
#:((({S:Hint}If a workgroup is specified in the '''Workgroup''' box on the '''CRM Info''' tab, the list of the employees available for selection as the owner of this lead is limited to those included in the selected workgroup.
)))
#In the '''Owner''' box of the Summary area, select ''Bill Owen''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

You have assigned a lead to yourself and you can start working with this lead.
==Step 3: Assigning Selected Leads to Owners==
Suppose that the ''Douglas Keatinge'' and ''Duncan Saunders'' new leads have been added to the system and you need to assign these leads to owners.{br}

To mass-assign multiple selected leads to owners, do the following:[anchor|#_157bbfb8-a804-4c3c-b8df-06b8f140a5bc]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_50_30_10|Assign Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR503010|CR503010]) form.
#In the table, click the header of the '''Owner''' column.
#:((({S:Hint}If you need to change the order of columns in any table, you can drag a column by its header to the new place in the table.
)))
#In the Sorting and Filtering Settings dialog box, which opens, do the following to filter unassigned leads:
##Select the ''Is Empty'' filter condition.
## Click '''OK'''. The system closes the dialog box and applies the filter.
#In the unlabeled column, select the check boxes for the leads with the ''Douglas Keatinge'' and ''Duncan Saunders'' display names.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Process'''. The '''Processing''' dialog box opens, showing the progress and, as soon as the processing has completed, the results of assigning leads.
#:((({S:Warn}If an assignment map contains errors, the system will list these errors in the '''Processing''' dialog box. You can view the errors by clicking the More button on the '''Errors''' tile: In the '''Message''' column, the system displays the text of each applicable error message.
)))
#:((({S:Hint}In situations when you want to assign all unassigned leads to owners, you would not select unlabeled check boxes in the table; you would instead click the '''Process All''' button on the form toolbar. Based on the ''U100'' settings, all leads would be assigned to either the ''Marketing Supermarkets'' workgroup or ''Marketing Food Services'' workgroup.
)))
#Click '''Close''' to close the dialog box and return to the form. In the '''Owner''' column, you can see the name of the employee that the leads have been assigned to ''Joan Simpson''. In the '''Workgroup''' column, you can see the name of the workgroup: ''Marketing Supermarkets''.

You have assigned two leads to owners according to the rules specified in the lead assignment map.]]></column>

The  Marketing Food Services  workgroup, to which your  owen  user                     account belongs, will be working with leads that represent restaurants, cafes,                     bakeries, and other food service                     companies. The                  needed                  workgroups have been defined in the company tree and an assignment map has been                 created to assign leads to the needed workgroup; also, you have specified the needed                 configuration setting to cause the system to use this assignment map when you are                 mass-assigning leads. You will mass-assign leads by using this assignment map. Configuration Overview In                 the  U100  dataset , for the purposes of this                  activity ,                 the following tasks have been performed: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, the  Customer                         Management  feature has been enabled.                      This                     feature provides the customer relationship management (CRM) functionality,                     including lead and customer tracking, as well as the handling of sales                     opportunities, contacts, marketing lists, and campaigns. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP204061|EP204061]) Company Tree (EP204061) form, the                     company tree has been configured and it includes the  Marketing                         Supermarkets  and the  Marketing Food Services  workgroups as well                     as the users in the                      M arketing                     department. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP205010|EP205010]) Assignment Maps (EP205010) form, the  Lead Assignment                         Map  has been created. According to the                      rule                      action s  specified in the assignment map,                      the                     leads of the  STORE  class are assigned to the  Marketing                         Supermarkets  workgroup in the  SweetLife                     marketing  department, and the leads of the  BAKERY  and                          CAFE  classes are assigned to the  Marketing Food Services                      workgroup in the marketing department. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR101000|CR101000]) Customer Management Preferences (CR101000) form (in the  Lead                         Assignment Map  box of the  Assignment                         Settings  section of the  General Settings                      tab),                      the                      lead assignment map has been specified. The system will use this assignment map                     during the process of mass-assigning leads. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR207000|CR207000]) Lead Classes (CR207000) form, the                     following lead classes have been created:  STORE  (for leads that are                     supermarkets and other stores),  BAKERY ,  CAFE  (which includes leads                     that are restaurants and cafes), and  SWEETSHOP  (for leads that are                     confectioneries). A list of lead records that includes bakeries, cafes, restaurants, and                     supermarkets has been imported to the system through the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM206036|SM206036]) Import by Scenario (SM206036) form. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads (CR301000) form, the following                     leads—which have been assigned to, respectively, the  STORE ,                          BAKERY , and  CAFE  lead classes—have been added to the                     system:  Stanley Carson ,  Douglas Keatinge , and  Duncan                         Saunders . Process Overview In this                  activity,                 you will do the following:  On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR207000|CR207000]) Lead Classes (CR207000) form, specify how                      the system                     assigns the default owner of leads of a particular class Manually assign a particular lead to an owner by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads (CR301000) form Assign selected leads to owners by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR503010|CR503010]) Assign Leads                     (CR503010) form System Preparation Before you start assigning leads to owners, you should do the following: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as a marketing manager by using the following                         credentials: Username:  owen Password:  123 Make sure that on the Company and Branch Selection menu, in the top pane of the                          Acumatica ERP screen, the  SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center  branch is selected. Step 1: Specifying a                  Default                 Owner  for New Leads of a Lead                 Class You can modify the settings of a lead class to specify how the system assigns the                 default owner of a newly created lead of the class—that is, whether the                 default owner is the creator of the lead, a user determined by an assignment map                 that you specify (so that specific owners can be assigned), or the owner of the                 entity (such as a contact) from which the lead is created, if the lead was created                 in this way. In this step, you will specify the owner of a new lead of the  SWEETSHOP  class                 as its creator. To specify the default owner of an existing lead class and make sure the owner is                 assigned correctly to a new lead of the class, do the following: Open the Lead Classes (CR2070PL) form. In the  Class ID  column, click the  SWEETSHOP  link                     to open the lead class record on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR207000|CR207000]) Lead Classes (CR207000)                     form. On the  Details  tab ( Data Entry                         Settings  section), in the  Default Owner                      box, select  Creator . On the form toolbar, click  Save . Make sure that the option that you have just specified assigns new leads to                     owners correctly by doing the following: Open the Leads (CR3010PL) form. On the table toolbar, click  New Record . A new                             lead record opens on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads                             (CR301000) form. On the  Contact Info  tab, in the                                  Contact  section, specify the following                                 settings: First Name :                                      Sandra Last Name :                                      Flynn Company Name :  Crystal                                         Sweet Email :                                          s.flynn@crystalsweet.example.com Open the  CRM Info  tab. In the  Lead Class  box , select                                  SWEETSHOP . On the form toolbar, click  Save . You have specified                  how                 the system determines the default owner for leads  of the                      SWEETSHOP  lead class and then created a new lead to test the setting. The                 system has appropriately inserted the default owner for the new lead. Each time a                 user creates a lead of the  SWEETSHOP  class, the system will insert the                 employee name of the creator of the lead as the owner of the lead. Step 2: Assigning a Lead to an Owner Manually To assign a lead to an owner manually, do the following: Open the Leads (CR3010PL) form. In                     the  Display Name  column, click  the                          Stanley.Carson  link to open this lead record on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads (CR301000) form. To                          search for a record in a list or records, you can enter a                         text string in the Search box of the filtering area. The system will find                         all the records that match your search criteria and display these records in                         the table. For details, see  Searching in Acumatica ERP. In the  Workgroup  box on the  CRM                         Info  tab, select the  Marketing Food Services                          workgroup. If a workgroup is specified in                         the  Workgroup  box on the  CRM                             Info  tab, the list of the employees available for selection                         as the owner of this lead is limited to those included in the selected                         workgroup. In the  Owner  box of the Summary area, select                          Bill                         Owen . On the form toolbar, click  Save . You have assigned a lead to yourself and you can start working with this lead. Step 3: Assigning Selected Leads to Owners Suppose that the  Douglas Keatinge  and  Duncan Saunders  new leads have                 been added to the system and you need to assign these leads to owners. To mass-assign multiple selected leads to owners, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR503010|CR503010]) Assign Leads (CR503010) form. In the table, click the header of the  Owner  column. If you need to change the order of columns in any table, you can                         drag a column by its header to the new place in the table. In the                      Sorting                     and Filtering Settings  dialog box, which opens, do the                     following to filter unassigned leads: Select the  Is Empty  filter condition.  Click  OK . The system closes the dialog box and                             applies the filter. In the unlabeled column, select the check boxes for the leads with the                          Douglas Keatinge  and  Duncan Saunders  display names. On the form toolbar, click  Process . The                          Processing  dialog box opens, showing the progress                     and, as soon as the processing has completed, the results of assigning                         leads. If an assignment map contains errors, the                         system will list these errors in the  Processing                          dialog box. You can view the errors by clicking the More button on the                              Errors  tile: In the                              Message  column, the system displays the text of                         each                          applicable                          error message. In situations when you want to assign                         all unassigned leads to owners, you would not select unlabeled check boxes                         in the table; you would instead click the  Process All                          button on the form toolbar. Based on the                              U100                          settings , all leads                          would                          be assigned to either the  Marketing Supermarkets  workgroup or                              Marketing Food Services  workgroup. Click  Close  to close the dialog box and return to the                     form. In the  Owner  column, you can see the name of the                     employee that the leads have been assigned to  Joan Simpson . In the                          Workgroup  column, you can see the name of the                     workgroup:  Marketing Supermarkets . You have assigned two leads to owners according to the rules specified in the lead                 assignment map. ]]></column>

You can hide an activity from the Self-Service Portal users by selecting the '''Internal''' check box on '''Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_10|Activity] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306010|CR306010]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_20|Task] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306020|CR306020]), or [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_30|Event] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306030|CR306030]) form. The hidden activity will be available to only the internal Acumatica ERP users.
==Pinning of Emails and Activities==
In Acumatica ERP 2020 R2 and later versions, you can pin the most important emails and activities—such as tasks, notes, or phone calls—to the top of the activities list so that you can quickly access and keep track of them. Activity pins are supported for cases, opportunities, and leads. That is, on the '''Activities''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_00|Cases] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306000|CR306000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]), and [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) forms, you can select an activity that should be pinned to the top of the list and click the '''Pin/Unpin''' button to pin the activity to the top of the list. Once you have pinned an activity, it is moved to the top of the list and the Pin icon is shown in the '''Is Pinned''' column.{br}

You can also click a pinned activity and click the '''Pin/Unpin''' button to unpin the activity. If you unpinned an activity from the list, an icon is no longer shown in the '''Is Pinned''' column, and the activity is moved to the appropriate location based on the sorting settings.
==Tracking of Communication with Leads in Acumatica ERP==
Once a lead has been created in the system, you can create and track various activities related to this lead, including emails, phone calls, tasks, and events. (Depending on the lead processing workflow in your company, you may be the owner of the lead, but this is not required.) For each lead, you can create new activities, cancel or complete activities, and attach files or notes to activities. You can manage all activities associated with a lead on the '''Activities''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form. {br}

For details, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Mktg_Managing_Emails_Activities_Emails|Managing Emails and Activities: Emails] and [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Mktg_Managing_Emails_Activities_Activities|Managing Emails and Activities: Activities].
==The Activities Tab==
By using the '''Activities''' tabs on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_00|Cases] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306000|CR306000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_40_00|Marketing Lists] ([~/?ScreenId=CR204000|CR204000]), and [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_20_00|Marketing Campaigns] ([~/?ScreenId=CR202000|CR202000]) forms, you can create activities and associate them with the particular entity. The [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) forms also include an '''Activities''' tab on which you can view only activities associated with the project or task, respectively. {br}

All activities (including current, completed, and not-yet-started ones) related to the selected entity—that is, the lead, contact, business account, opportunity, case, marketing list, marketing campaign, project, or project task you are viewing—are listed on the '''Activities''' tab. You can view the details of the task, event, or activity by clicking the value in the '''Subject''' box, which is a link to the corresponding task, event, or activity. {br}

 The list of activities or tasks is presented in a tabular format. The column with the unlabeled header contains icons that indicate the type of the activity in each row. The following icons are used: [anchor|#ul_egv_q14_qk]
*[image:UserGuide/Images/Managing_Your_Tasks__Events__and_Activities_ask.png] is used for the ''Task'' activity type.
*[image:UserGuide/Images/Managing_Your_Tasks__Events__and_Activities_alendar.png] is used for the ''Event'' activity type.
*[image:UserGuide/Images/Managing_Your_Tasks__Events__and_Activities_mail.png] is used for the ''Email'' activity type.
*Custom icons for activities of other types can be used if they are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_10_20_00|Activity Types] ([~/?ScreenId=CR102000|CR102000]) form.

The table has a number of columns with icons as column headings. {br}

You can use the icons in the table rows in the following ways: [anchor|#_c8953c64-4b04-439b-a526-9f32e97f7600]
*To attach a file to an activity, click the Attach File icon ([image:UserGuide/Images/Managing_Your_Tasks__Events__and_Activities_lip.png]) in the row related to the activity, and the '''Upload File''' dialog box opens. (For detailed instructions on using this dialog box, see [HelpRoot_Interface\Attaching_Files_to_Record_Details|To Attach a File to a Record Detail].) Once you have attached a file, the File Attached icon ([image:UserGuide/Images/Managing_Your_Tasks__Events__and_Activities_ttachFile.png]) is instead displayed.
*To add a note to the activity, click the Attach Note icon ([image:UserGuide/Images/Managing_Your_Tasks__Events__and_Activities_heet.png]) in the row related to the activity. The '''Enter Record Note''' dialog box opens; for instructions on how to use this dialog box, see [HelpRoot_Interface\Attaching_Notes_to_Record_Details|To Attach a Note to a Record Detail]. Once you have attached a note, the Note Attached ([image:UserGuide/Images/Managing_Your_Tasks__Events__and_Activities_oteAttached.png]) icon is instead shown in the row. To read the note, click the icon.
*In the column with the Check Mark icon ([image:UserGuide/Images/Managing_Your_Tasks__Events__and_Activities_ick.png]) in the column header, note the green check mark if it appears. This check mark indicates that the related activity has been completed.
*Notice the column with the Exclamation Mark icon ([image:UserGuide/Images/Managing_Your_Tasks__Events__and_Activities_xclamation_sign.png]) in the column header. The icon in this row indicates the priority of the activity: 
**If the exclamation mark ([image:UserGuide/Images/Managing_Your_Tasks__Events__and_Activities_!.png]) appears, the priority level is high.
**If the blue arrow ([image:UserGuide/Images/Managing_Your_Tasks__Events__and_Activities_ow_priority.png]) is displayed, the priority level is low.
**If the column is empty, the priority level is normal.
*Note the column with the Reminder icon ([image:UserGuide/Images/Managing_Your_Tasks__Events__and_Activities_ell.png]) in the column header, which indicates whether a reminder has been configured for the activity. If this column is empty for a particular row, a reminder was not set for the activity. If a white bell ([image:UserGuide/Images/Managing_Your_Tasks__Events__and_Activities_white_bell.png]) is displayed in this column, a reminder has been configured for the activity.

Creation and Tracking of Tasks for an Entity You can create a task associated with any of these entities by clicking the  Add           Task  button on the table toolbar of  Activities  tab of         any of the following forms:  ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads (CR301000)  ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) Contacts (CR302000)  ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) Business Accounts (CR303000)  ([~/?ScreenId=CR308000|CR308000]) Mass Emails (CR308000)  ([~/?ScreenId=CR204000|CR204000]) Marketing Lists (CR204000)  ([~/?ScreenId=CR202000|CR202000]) Marketing Campaigns (CR202000)  ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) Opportunities (CR304000)  ([~/?ScreenId=CR304500|CR304500]) Sales Quotes (CR304500)  ([~/?ScreenId=CR306000|CR306000]) Cases (CR306000)  ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) Employees (EP203000)  ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000)  ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) Project Tasks (PM302000)  ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes (PM304500) When you click the button, the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR306020|CR306020]) Task (CR306020) form opens in a         pop-up window, where you can specify the needed details. By default, the system inserts your         employee ID in the  Owner  box of the  Details          tab, but you can reassign the task to another employee. When you save the task, the system         returns you to the form you added the activity from and adds a row with the  Task  type         to the  Activities  tab of the form. When you create a task, on the  Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR306020|CR306020]) Task form, you can set up a reminder for it (by selecting the            Reminder  check box) and specify on which day before the due date         the task owner should receive the reminder (in the  Remind At  box).          On         the specified date, the reminder will appear on the task owner’s  Acumatica ERP screen so that the creator or the owner can complete the task or change its         status. On the  Activities  tab, you can view the details of the task (or any         listed activity) by clicking the link in the  Summary          column          of the appropriate row , which opens the task on the form used to create         it (which varies depending on the activity type) in a pop-up window. Sharing of Lead-Related Tasks If you create tasks related to a lead, and then you create a contact or business account         for the lead or convert the lead to an opportunity, the system copies all the tasks (and         other activities) listed on the  Activities  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads form to the same tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) Contacts (CR302000),   ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) Business Accounts (CR303000), or   ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) Opportunities (CR304000)         form, respectively. Thus, the system preserves the history of tasks and other activities         created for the lead and copies this history to the entities associated with the lead. Tasks           that you create on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) Contacts,   ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) Business Accounts, and   ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) Opportunities forms are associated with only the entity (contact, business account, or opportunity)           for which they have been created. Task Management On the   ([~/?ScreenId=WZ202000|WZ202000]) Tasks (WZ202000) form, you can manage the tasks         of          the selected business process scenario. The scenario  is represented in a         tree format and consists of the tasks to be executed to complete a complicated process in            Acumatica ERP. For details, see  Managing Scenarios. By using the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP204040|EP204040]) Event and Task Categories (EP204040) form, you can create         a list of task categories and provide a color code for each category. If you do, when you         open the list of your tasks on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP404000|EP404000]) Tasks (EP404000) form, you will         see the tasks highlighted with colors corresponding to the categories.  ]]></column>

When your company is nurturing particular leads and contacts, you may want to send newsletters and promotional emails to lists of these contacts. This could be useful for leads with confirmed contact information; you may also want to use marketing lists to communicate with confirmed contacts that are not yet ready to buy any of the currently offered services or products but might be interested in future offers.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Create a static marketing list, which must be created and changed manually, and add members to this list
*Unsubscribe a member from the marketing list
*Create a dynamic marketing list, which can be automatically formed and updated based on rules that you specify

==Applicable Scenarios==
You may want to learn how to manage marketing lists in scenarios that include the following:[anchor|#_7165d0ed-fbf9-4bca-b563-a0155c7a9310]
*You have a list of leads with confirmed contact information and need to regularly promote or showcase the products or services your organization offers.
*You are ready to launch a marketing campaign and need to create a list with the select target audience to receive campaign materials.
*You need to reengage old contacts.
*You want to receive feedback from contacts on products or services that may be interesting to them.

==Marketing Lists in Acumatica ERP==
A marketing list in Acumatica ERP is a list of registered leads, contacts, business accounts, or employees. You can create as many marketing lists as you need. Based on a marketing list, you can create mailing lists for mass-mailing newsletters, special offers, or other information that is periodically sent to the leads or contacts.{br}

Managing marketing lists in Acumatica ERP includes the following tasks:[anchor|#_4c976b5e-8a63-49cd-be26-365fcaf4ade4]
*Creating a static marketing list
*Adding members to the marketing list manually
*Adding members to the marketing list by using an inquiry
*Uploading records from a Microsoft Excel file to be added as members of a marketing list
*Unsubscribing particular members from the marketing list
{br}

You can view and edit existing marketing lists and create new ones by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_40_00|Marketing Lists] ([~/?ScreenId=CR204000|CR204000]) form. On the '''List Members''' tab of this form, you can view or modify the members of a particular marketing list.{br}

Each marketing list in Acumatica ERP can be configured to be either dynamic or static, as described in the following sections.
==Static Marketing Lists==
A static marketing list is formed and updated manually, if needed, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_40_00|Marketing Lists] ([~/?ScreenId=CR204000|CR204000]) form. For a static marketing list, the '''Dynamic List''' check box is cleared on the '''Configuration Options''' tab. You include particular leads or contacts in a static marketing list by doing any of the following on the form:[anchor|#ul_er5_btr_l1b]
*On the '''List Members''' tab, clicking '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar and then adding the needed contact or lead in the row. This step can be repeated as needed.
*Using the '''Add Members''' dialog box, which opens if you click '''Add New Members''' on the toolbar of the '''List Members''' tab. In this dialog box, you can select list members from a specific data source, which can be either a different marketing list or a generic inquiry form that lists contact records. You can select a shared filter that is available for the specified inquiry form to be able to select members from only relevant records.
*Clicking '''Load Records from File''' on the '''List Members''' tab to upload a Microsoft Excel or a CSV file with a list of contacts.

Also, while you are viewing a particular lead, contact, or business account on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]), or [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) form, respectively, you can add this entity to an existing marketing list. To do this, on the '''Marketing Lists''' tab of the form (which displays the lists the lead, contact, or business account belongs to), you click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar and then you select the marketing list by its identifier in the row. You can repeat this step as needed to add the entity to multiple marketing lists.
==Dynamic Marketing Lists==
A dynamic marketing list is formed automatically according to a set of rules. To make a marketing list dynamic, you need to select the '''Dynamic List''' check box on the '''Configuration Options''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_40_00|Marketing Lists] ([~/?ScreenId=CR204000|CR204000]) form. To define the rules according to which the list will be automatically formed and updated, you do one of the following on the same tab:[anchor|#ul_n1r_q4m_l1b]
*Leave the '''Generic Inquiry''' box empty, and on the '''Selection Criteria''' tab, specify the necessary filter conditions to select list members from all leads, contacts, and employees defined in the system.
*In the '''Generic Inquiry''' box, specify a generic inquiry form that lists contact records; then in the '''Shared Filter to Apply''' box, you can select a shared filter that is available for the specified inquiry form. For details, see [HelpRoot_ReportingTools\SM__MNG_Managing_Generic_Inquiry|Managing Generic Inquiries].

The rules will be applied to the existing or newly added records, and the records that match the specified criteria will be automatically included in the list.
Although dynamic marketing lists are not generally modified manually, you can add a particular lead, contact, or business account to a marketing list while you are viewing the entity on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]), or [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) form. To do this, on the '''Marketing Lists''' tab of the form (which displays all of the lists the lead, contact, or business account belongs to), you click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar and then you select the marketing list by its identifier in the row. You can repeat this step as needed to add the entity to multiple marketing lists.
==Cancellation of a Member Subscription==
On some occasions, you might need to temporarily unsubscribe a particular lead or contact from a marketing list. If this is the case, you do not have to remove the record from the list of members; instead, you can do any of the following:[anchor|#_50de0434-fcd9-4e26-ac17-444272a0d385]
*Clear the check box in the '''Subscribed''' column for the particular lead or contact on the '''List Members''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_40_00|Marketing Lists] ([~/?ScreenId=CR204000|CR204000]) form populated with the details of this lead or contact.
*Clear the check box in the '''Subscribed''' column for the particular marketing list on the '''Marketing Lists''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]), or [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) form while you are viewing the particular lead, contact, or business account.

To renew the member’s subscription, you select the previously cleared check box.]]></column>

*Create a marketing campaign
*Move the marketing campaign through stages
*Track expenses related to the marketing campaign through integration with project accounting

==Marketing Campaigns in Acumatica ERP==
In Acumatica ERP you can track the leads, opportunities, revenue, and expenses associated with a marketing campaign; thus, you can analyze the results and evaluate the efficiency of this marketing campaign. {br}

When you acquire new leads and then create them on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form or import them into the system, you can select a marketing campaign as the source of the lead. You can send emails to generate interest among the existing leads and track these emails and activities related to nurturing the leads during the campaign. If a lead is converted to an opportunity and the opportunity has been won or lost, you will be able to track and evaluate the revenue of this marketing campaign. You can link a marketing campaign with a project and track expenses related to the marketing campaign. For details, see the following sections.
==Preparation of a Marketing Campaign==
In Acumatica ERP, you can create a new marketing campaign (such as an email campaign) or start tracking the progress of a campaign (such as a billboard advertisement campaign) that has already been launched. The data that you enter when you create a campaign can be used in reports.{br}

Before you start tracking the progress of a marketing campaign, you should do the following preparatory work:[anchor|#_0672199f-d94a-4a90-b681-b618099d1a54]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_25_00|Campaign Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR202500|CR202500]) form, define campaign classes to set up the types of campaigns your company uses; each campaign class may have a list of attributes that can be used for detailed reporting.
*Prepare a list of campaign members: You can select campaign members among leads, contacts, business accounts, and customers; also, you can select campaign members from any other entity that has contact information (for example, by creating a generic inquiry that collects contacts from invoices).
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_20_00|Marketing Campaigns] ([~/?ScreenId=CR202000|CR202000]) form, create a campaign and specify the necessary settings, such as the planned budget and the return on investment you expect to receive as a result of the campaign. This information may be useful when you analyze campaign results.

As a marketing campaign proceeds, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_20_00|Marketing Campaigns] ([~/?ScreenId=CR202000|CR202000]) form, you can select any of the following stages, which can be used in reports:[anchor|#_d90056e1-62ac-484c-9d6d-237c00e41038]
*''Planning'': You are preparing the marketing campaign.
*''Execution'': You have started sending emails to the campaign members and creating activities related to the campaign.
*''Completed'': The marketing campaign is over, and it is time to analyze the results of the marketing campaign.
*''Canceled'': You have canceled a new or ongoing marketing campaign before its completion.

==Tracking of Emails and Activities Associated with a Marketing Campaign==
In Acumatica ERP, you can keep track of emails and activities related to a marketing campaign as follows:[anchor|#_f6383507-64e2-403f-a240-78101241bff8]
*Associate various activities with the campaign, as described in [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Mktg_Managing_Emails_Activities_Mapref|Managing Emails and Activities]
*Associate generated or existing leads with the campaign by selecting the marketing campaign as the source of the lead in the '''Source Campaign''' box of the Summary area on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form
*Send individual emails to the campaign members, as described in [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Mktg_Managing_Emails_Activities_Mapref|Managing Emails and Activities]
*Send mass emails to the campaign members, as described in [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Mktg_Managing_Mass_Emails_Mapref|Managing Mass Emails]

==Marketing Campaign Statistics==
In Acumatica ERP, you can view the following marketing campaign statistics on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_20_00|Marketing Campaigns] ([~/?ScreenId=CR202000|CR202000]) form:[anchor|#ul_ipb_tn1_t1b]
*On the '''Campaign Details''' tab, the following values, which cannot be edited but may help you evaluate the effectiveness of an ongoing campaign: 
**'''Total Members''': The total number of members assigned to the campaign
**'''Members Contacted''': The number of campaign members that have been contacted and have activities associated with them
**'''Members Responded''': The total number of campaign members that have responded to the campaign
**'''Leads Generated''': The number of leads that have been created due to the campaign
**'''Leads Converted''': The number of leads converted to opportunities due to the campaign
**'''Opportunities''': The number of opportunities associated with the campaign
**'''Won Opportunities''': The number of opportunities associated with the campaign that have been eventually won
**'''Opportunities Value''': The total amount of the opportunities associated with the campaign
**'''Won Opportunities Value''': The total amount of the won opportunities associated with the campaign
*On the '''Members''' tab, the number of opportunities, activities, and emails related to the campaign and associated with a particular campaign member
*On the '''Generated Leads''' and '''Opportunities''' tabs, lists of all leads and opportunities that have this marketing campaign specified as their source campaign

You can generate campaign-related reports and use these reports to calculate the revenue affected by a campaign. For more information, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Marketing_Reports_Campaign_Metrics|Marketing Reports: Campaign Metrics].[anchor|#section_mdr_xjj_kdb]
==Integration with Project Accounting==
In Acumatica ERP, you can use the project accounting functionality to track the expenses and revenue related to a marketing campaign and associate a marketing campaign with projects if the ''Project Accounting'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. The system can treat a marketing campaign as a project and use the project budget tracking mechanism for tracking the campaign budget. For more information about project budgets, see [HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Budget_Mapref|Managing Project Budget].{br}

To be able to track campaign expenses, you need to create a specific project and, optionally, a project task dedicated to expense accounting of a marketing campaign. Also, billing and allocation rules should be configured for the project.{br}

A project can be associated with a marketing campaign through the '''Project Accounting Integration''' section on the '''Campaign Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_20_00|Marketing Campaigns] ([~/?ScreenId=CR202000|CR202000]) form. If needed, multiple campaigns may be associated with a single project.{br}

A previously defined project can also be associated with all the campaign-related activities, the opportunities that resulted from this campaign, and the resulting sales orders and invoices. These associations allow for accurate calculation of all expenses and revenue generated by the campaign.]]></column>

==Story==
Suppose that you are Bill Owen, a marketing manager of the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company. SweetLife management has decided to launch a marketing campaign that will promote online master classes focused on teaching the audience how to use juicers that the company sells. You need to create and plan the marketing campaign, and after the campaign has finished, change the stage of the campaign to ''Completed''.
==Configuration Overview==
In the ''U100'' dataset, for the purposes of this activity, the following tasks have been performed:[anchor|#_46190d94-ff0f-4815-b804-34038fc9d17c]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Customer Management'' feature has been enabled: Provides the customer relationship management (CRM) functionality, including lead and customer tracking, as well as handling of sales opportunities, contacts, marketing lists, and campaigns.
*The following leads have been created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form: ''Jonas Clayton'' and ''Douglas Keatinge''.
*A number of leads have been created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] form and assigned to Bill Owen. The '''My Leads''' shared filter tab has been created on the Leads (CR3010PL) form; this tab lists only the leads that are assigned to the currently signed-in user.
*The ''OFFER'' marketing list, which includes a number of leads (''Leslie Walker'', ''Leonard Hemmings'', ''Paul Mitchell'', ''Nicholas Langdon'', and ''Jacob Murray''), has been added to the system, as described in [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Mktg_Mng_Marketing_Lists_Create_Static_Mktg_List|Managing Marketing Lists: To Create a Static Marketing List].

==Process Overview==
In this activity, you will do the following on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_20_00|Marketing Campaigns] ([~/?ScreenId=CR202000|CR202000]) form:[anchor|#_883ceb30-0ff7-4dc7-893b-7b6002ebf179]
#Create a marketing campaign.
#Change the stage of the marketing campaign.

==System Preparation==
Before you start creating a marketing campaign, you should do the following:[anchor|#_49408a70-7c4a-4268-a217-e2acaf2bf475]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as Bill Owen, a marketing manager, by using the following credentials:
#*Username: ''owen''
#*Password: ''123''
#Make sure that on the Company and Branch Selection menu, in the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, the ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center'' branch is selected.

==Step 1: Creating a Marketing Campaign==
To create a marketing campaign, do the following:[anchor|#_fa742785-635f-4638-890f-918dff014a89]
#Open the Marketing Campaigns (CR2020PL) form.[anchor|#_3a0d9a08-3af9-4365-8c77-232d69ac6d0f]
#On the form toolbar, click '''New Record'''.
#In the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_20_00|Marketing Campaigns] ([~/?ScreenId=CR202000|CR202000]) form, which opens, do the following:
##In the '''Campaign Name''' box, type the name of the campaign: <tt>Juice Master Class</tt>.
##In the '''Campaign Class''' box, select the ''MASTERCLASS'' campaign class.
##In the '''Stage''' box, select ''Planning''.
##In the '''Owner''' box, select ''Bill Owen''.
#On the '''Campaign Details''' tab, specify the campaign properties as follows:
##In the '''Start Date''' box, specify 1/30/2020.

#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

You have created a marketing campaign. Now you can add members to this campaign.
==Step 2: Adding Individual Members to the Marketing Campaign==
To add members to the marketing campaign one by one, do the following:[anchor|#_644f9dfa-a783-4d36-ac73-b99621b2a609]
#While you are still viewing the ''Juice Master Class'' campaign on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_20_00|Marketing Campaigns] ([~/?ScreenId=CR202000|CR202000]) form, open the '''Members''' tab.
#On the table toolbar, click '''Add Row'''.
#In the '''Name''' box, select ''Jonas Clayton''. The system adds a row with the lead&rsquo;s data to the table.
#Repeat the previous two steps to add one more member, ''Douglas Keatinge'', to the marketing campaign.[anchor|#_fa0fd080-9f27-461a-b1c3-d64b8ca7022e]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

You have added two individual members to the marketing campaign one by one.
==Step 3: Adding Multiple Members to the Marketing Campaign by Using a Generic Inquiry==
Suppose that you plan to promote online master classes to the leads that have been assigned to you—that is, the leads for which ''Bill Owen'' is selected in the '''Owner''' box of the Summary area on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form.
To add multiple members to the marketing campaign by using a generic inquiry, do the following:[anchor|#_8f5aa1b0-92e0-4df8-bc57-8a3615514e7e]
#While you are still viewing the ''Juice Master Class'' campaign on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_20_00|Marketing Campaigns] ([~/?ScreenId=CR202000|CR202000]) form, open the '''Members''' tab.
#On the table toolbar, click '''Add New Members'''.
#In the '''Add Members''' dialog box, which opens, select multiple members as follows:
##In the '''Data Source''' box, select ''Inquiry''.
##In the '''Generic Inquiry''' box, select ''CR-Leads2018R1''. The table becomes populated with the list of leads that have been added to the system.
##In the '''Shared Filter to Apply''' box, select ''My Leads''. The table becomes populated with the list of leads that have been assigned to Bill Owen.
##:((({S:Hint} In the '''Add Members''' dialog box, you can select any shared filter that is available for the specified inquiry form to be able to select members from only the relevant records. For details, see [HelpRoot_ReportingTools\GI_Reusable_Filters_Mapref|Managing Advanced Filters]. You can also select members from a different marketing list, as described in the following step.
)))[anchor|#_5c8bfd5f-9f58-4e19-b313-6a6c2dc179cb]
##On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

You have added multiple members to the marketing campaign by using an inquiry.
==Step 4: Adding Multiple Members to the Marketing Campaign by Using a Marketing List==
Suppose that one more marketing campaign has already been launched: SweetLife offers citrus juicers at a special price to the leads with confirmed contact information to increase sales. These leads have been added to a marketing list, and you need to add members to the marketing campaign from this list.{br}

To add multiple members to the marketing campaign from the marketing list, do the following:[anchor|#_134496bd-6dd1-4df9-a503-d83710a3ee86]
#Open the Marketing Campaigns (CR2020PL) form.
#In the '''Campaign Name''' column, double-click ''Citrus Juicers Off '' to open the campaign on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_20_00|Marketing Campaigns] ([~/?ScreenId=CR202000|CR202000]) form.
#On the table toolbar of the '''Members''' tab, click '''Add New Members'''. The '''Add Members''' dialog box opens.
#In the '''Data Source''' box, select ''Marketing List''.
#In the '''Marketing List''' box, select ''OFFER''.
#In the lower part of the table, click '''Add All'''. The system closes the lookup table and adds the leads from the marketing list to the members of the marketing campaign.[anchor|#_09a0b327-54e9-4dfa-8165-b85c38f404a6]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

You have added members from the marketing list to the marketing campaign.
==Step 5: Changing the Stage of the Marketing Campaign==
Suppose that the ''Juice Master Class'' campaign has been launched and then completed.{br}

To change the stage of the marketing campaign, do the following:[anchor|#_157bbfb8-a804-4c3c-b8df-06b8f140a5bc]
#While you are still viewing the ''Juice Master Class'' campaign on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_20_00|Marketing Campaigns] ([~/?ScreenId=CR202000|CR202000]) form, in the '''Stage ''' box of the Summary area, select ''Execution''.
#Optional: On the '''Activities''' tab, add activities that are related to launching, executing, and completing the marketing campaign, as described in [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Mktg_Managing_Emails_Activities_Mapref|Managing Emails and Activities].
#In the '''Stage''' box of the Summary area, select ''Completed'' to record in the system that the marketing campaign has been completed.

Marketing and sales teams rapidly adjust their processes and optimally use collected data, striving for the most effective work approaches. As such, they need their CRM systems to be flexible enough to support adjustments in processes without lengthy, costly development being required. Acumatica ERP provides flexible tools that marketing and sales teams can use to implement and customize workflows in the system without coding.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Use the lead states in Acumatica ERP in your lead qualification workflow
*Qualify a lead and pass the marketing-qualified lead to a sales team for further qualification
*Disqualify a lead
*Reopen a disqualified lead

==Applicable Scenarios==
You may want to learn how to qualify leads in Acumatica ERP in scenarios that include the following:[anchor|#_7165d0ed-fbf9-4bca-b563-a0155c7a9310]
*A lead has contacted you and confirmed the intention to buy the company&rsquo;s products or services and you need to convert the lead to an opportunity.
*A lead has expressed no interest in your company&rsquo;s products or services, and you need to disqualify the lead.
*You have a list of cold leads (individuals or organizations who never contacted your organization or expressed any interest in your products or services) and you need to confirm these leads&rsquo; contact information and gauge their current interest in buying.
*You need to pass a marketing-qualified lead to the sales team for further qualification.
[anchor|#_97f55550-0e0d-43eb-86f4-5f64f14500c8]
==Lead Qualification Process==
Lead qualification is the process of determining a lead to be one of the following:[anchor|#_c04d365b-dbe7-421b-9110-6bb79bfc9f08]
*A prospect that fits your target customer profile and has a high chance to become a customer 
*An existing customer with interest in a product or service that this customer has not already purchased

When marketing personnel communicate with leads (for example, during marketing campaigns) and work on developing the leads’ interest in the company’s products or services, they establish qualification criteria, which show that some leads are interested to buy more than others. The particular lead qualification criteria vary for different companies and for different products or services. The number of leads that a marketing team passes to a sales team depends on many factors, such as the sales team’s requirements for leads or the number of the leads a sales team can handle.{br}

We recommend that marketing and sales teams work together to agree on the criteria of transferring leads from marketing to sales and regularly revise the criteria depending on company sales and other changing conditions. Based on this agreement, in Acumatica ERP, you can create your lead qualification workflow, which consists of stages: identifiable phases (which can be required or optional) in the workflow that relate to particular actions a marketing employee performs while qualifying each lead. Similarly, the lead proceeds through states—which are represented by statuses in the system—for each stage. The following sections describe this workflow and the ability to implement it in Acumatica ERP.[anchor|#_0a32f973-91f8-4cda-be45-7db55835b200]
==Lead Qualification Workflow==
CRM functional area in Acumatica ERP includes the lead qualification workflow that helps marketing and sales teams manage leads, add leads to marketing campaigns, qualify leads, associate multiple leads with the same business account and contact, return leads that require further nurturing to marketing and reopen a disqualified lead if needed. You can customize the workflow according to your company&rsquo;s lead qualification processes.{br}

The following diagram illustrates the lead qualification workflow.[anchor|#_10cdad58-0465-472e-a2a6-eb2703e2f8b6][anchor|#_55ca8389-2dff-43e2-87cf-9372b1c7a947][image:Shared/Images/diag_CRM_Lead_Qualification_Workflow.png|popup|Lead Qualification Workflow|480px]
In the lead qualification workflow, transitions between lead states are implemented as actions on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form. You can execute these actions by using the '''Actions''' menu on the form&rsquo;s toolbar. A lead state is displayed in the '''Status''' box of the Summary area on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] form. A system administrator can customize the workflow to define which states correspond to the ''Active'' (nurtured) state of the lead. A system administrator can also configure notifications related to lead states which the system will send users as soon as the lead state has been changed. (For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Using_Business_Events_Mapref|Using Business Events].)
==Lead Qualification as Performed by Marketing in Acumatica ERP==
When a lead is created in Acumatica ERP, a marketing team member can review and nurture the lead. The team member can then either disqualify the lead or accept and qualify the lead and pass this marketing-qualified lead (MQL) to a sales team for further qualification (if the MQL is not ready to make a purchase). If the MQL is ready to buy, the marketing team member can convert the lead to an opportunity and skip the stage of lead qualification by sales. {br}

A disqualified lead can be reopened if the lead starts showing interest in the company&rsquo;s products or services. Reopening the lead (rather than creating a new lead) helps you track the lead history and eliminate duplicates in the system.{br}

Lead qualification by a marketing team may include the following stages:[anchor|#_e09d35d2-6c4b-4853-a460-fbfe7352dac5]
*Starting the lead qualification process by clicking'''Actions''' > '''Open''' for the lead on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form
*Validating the lead for duplicates, as described in [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Mktg_Validating_Recs_Duplicates_Mapref|Validating Records for Duplicates]
*Assigning the lead to an owner, as described in [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Mktg_Assigning_Leads_To_Owners_Mapref|Assigning Leads To Owners]
*Nurturing the lead, as described in [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Mktg_Managing_Emails_Activities_Mapref|Managing Emails and Activities], [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Mktg_Mng_Marketing_Campaigns_Mapref|Managing Marketing Campaigns], and [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Mktg_Managing_Mass_Emails_Mapref|Managing Mass Emails]
*Passing the lead to the sales team by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Qualify''' for the lead on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] form
*Disqualifying the lead by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Disqualify''' for the lead on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] form
*Reopening a lead that has been disqualified by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Open''' for the lead on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] form
((({S:Hint}Any of the stages listed above may be skipped as needed, depending on the company&rsquo;s lead qualification processes for marketing.
)))
==Lead Qualification Workflow (Marketing)==
The following diagram illustrates the lead qualification workflow as performed by a marketing team.[anchor|#_27cdec43-cf3d-4d88-850f-bd2d1e5df45f][anchor|#_c3aaf376-8289-4f9c-a490-c87b346ca71e][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_CRM_Lead_Qualification_Marketing.png|popup|Lead Qualification Workflow (Marketing)|480px]
==Lead Scoring==
Lead scoring, that may be part of the lead qualification process, helps you quickly and accurately assign a value to each lead based on various criteria. If you know where exactly leads are in your sales funnel, you can save time on working with leads of poor quality, develop more effective follow-up, and thus increase your return on investment. Calculating the marketing lead score can be done by members of a marketing team or automatically. Marketing teams can automate lead scoring and rating by using marketing automation solutions, such as [http://www.hubspot.com/|HubSpot], and import marketing-qualified leads to Acumatica ERP.[anchor|#_7a8285b9-14d1-41c4-af04-3796806182e0]
==Lead Qualification States==
As a lead is being processed by marketing and sales teams, it progresses through various states. Each lead state is represented in the system by a status, which is displayed in the '''Status''' box in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form. Lead statuses are updated by the system, and the '''Status''' box is unavailable for editing. A user can initiate transitions between lead states—which causes the system to update the status accordingly—by performing actions on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] form.{br}

In Acumatica ERP, a lead can be assigned one of the following statuses:[anchor|#_3741180d-820f-4895-ad79-4571dffb788e]
*''New'': The lead has been created in the system, but no work has been done on it yet.
*''Open'': The lead is being qualified by the marketing team.
*''Sales-Ready'': The lead has been qualified by a marketing team as showing more interest in the organization&rsquo;s products or services than other leads.
*''Sales-Accepted'': The lead has been initially reviewed and accepted by the lead qualification team, and it is willing to communicate more with the sales team for further qualification.
*''Converted:'' The lead has been qualified and converted to an opportunity. Once a lead has this status, most of the boxes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] form are read-only; you can edit the value in only the '''Description''' box in the Summary area.
*''Disqualified'': The lead is showing no interest in the organization&rsquo;s products or is not reachable (for example, the contact information is not valid). This status may also be used for leads that are duplicates of more correct or detailed leads. For more information about finding duplicates among CRM records in Acumatica ERP, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Mktg_Validating_Recs_Duplicates_Mapref|Validating Records for Duplicates].

If a lead has the ''New'', ''Open'', ''Sales-Ready'', or ''Sales-Accepted'' status, the '''Active''' check box on the '''CRM Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] form is selected by default to indicate that the lead can be nurtured by a marketing or sales team. The system clears the check box if the lead has the ''Converted'' or ''Disqualified'' status.{br}

During lead qualification, some states may not be needed: For example, in a small company, the same team members might work with leads that are both ready for sales and accepted by sales, and thus one state could be used for leads that are turned over to sales, instead of two.[anchor|#_fca4253d-8515-4798-b62e-cd1a227904c7]
==Processing of a Lead Through States==
As you work with a lead on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form, you can select any of the following actions on the form toolbar to move a lead through states (which causes the system to change the statuses accordingly):[anchor|#_ab1c33e4-6cc7-4993-a2cb-28fa68e83835]
*'''Open''': Opens the '''Details''' dialog box, where you select the reason for opening the lead and confirm that you want the system to perform the action. The status of the lead will be changed to ''Open''. This action is available when the status of the lead record is ''New'', ''Sales-Ready'', ''Sales-Accepted'', ''Converted'', or ''Disqualified''.
*'''Qualify''': Opens the '''Details''' dialog box, where you select the reason for qualifying the lead and confirm that you want the system to perform the action. The status of the lead will be changed to ''Sales-Ready''. This action is available when the status of the lead record is ''New'' or ''Open''.
*'''Accept''': Opens the '''Details''' dialog box, where you select the reason for accepting the lead and confirm that you want the system to perform the action. The status of the lead will be changed to ''Sales-Accepted''. This action is available when the status of the lead is ''New'', ''Open'', or ''Sales-Ready''.
*'''Disqualify''': Opens the '''Details''' dialog box, where you select the reason for disqualifying the lead and confirm that you want the system to perform the action. The status of the lead will be changed to ''Disqualified''. This action is available if the status of the lead record is ''New'', ''Open'', ''Sales-Ready'', or ''Sales-Accepted''.
*'''Convert to Opportunity''': Opens the '''New Opportunity''' dialog box, where you can enter the initial data that is required to create an opportunity. By using that dialog box, you can create a new contact and business account for the lead, if needed, or review the basic settings of the existing ones. The action is available if the status of the lead record is ''New'', ''Open'', ''Sales-Ready'', or ''Sales-Accepted''.

A system administrator can configure notifications related to lead statuses. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Using_Business_Events_Mapref|Using Business Events].]]></column>

You can customize                 the workflow according to your company's lead qualification processes. The following diagram illustrates the lead qualification workflow. Lead Qualification Workflow In the lead qualification workflow, transitions between lead states are implemented                 as actions on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads (CR301000) form. You                 can execute these actions by using the  Actions  menu on the                 form's toolbar.

Lead statuses are                 updated by the system, and the  Status  box is unavailable for                 editing. A user can initiate transitions between lead states—which causes the                 system to update the status accordingly—by performing actions on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads form. In  Acumatica ERP, a                 lead can be assigned one of the following statuses: New : The lead has been created in the system, but no work has been done on it yet. Open : The lead is being qualified by the marketing team. Sales-Ready : The lead has been qualified by a marketing team as showing                      more                     interest in the organization's products or services than other                     leads.

This                     status may also be used for leads that are duplicates of more correct or                     detailed leads.  For more information about finding duplicates                     among CRM records in  Acumatica ERP, see  Validating Records for Duplicates. If a lead has the  New ,  Open ,  Sales-Ready , or  Sales-Accepted  status,                 the  Active  check box on the  CRM Info                  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads form is selected by default                 to indicate that the lead can                 be                  nurtured by a marketing or sales team.

The status of the lead will be changed to  Open . This                     action is available when the status of the lead record is  New ,                          Sales-Ready ,  Sales-Accepted ,  Converted , or                          Disqualified . Qualify : Opens the  Details  dialog box, where you                     select the reason for qualifying the lead and confirm that you want the system                     to perform the action. The status of the lead will be changed to                          Sales-Ready . This action is available when the status of the lead                     record is  New  or  Open . Accept : Opens the  Details  dialog box, where you                     select the reason for accepting the lead and confirm that you want the system to                     perform the action. The status of the lead will be changed to                          Sales-Accepted . This action is available when the status of the lead                     is  New ,  Open , or  Sales-Ready . Disqualify : Opens the  Details  dialog box, where                     you select the reason for disqualifying the lead and confirm that you want the                     system to perform the action. The status of the lead will be changed to                          Disqualified . This action is available if the status of the lead                     record is  New ,  Open ,  Sales-Ready , or                      Sales-Accepted . Convert to Opportunity : Opens the  New Opportunity                      dialog box, where you can enter the initial data that is required to create an                     opportunity. By using that dialog box, you can create a new contact and business                     account for the lead, if needed, or review the basic settings of the existing                     ones. The action is available if the status of the lead record is  New ,                          Open ,  Sales-Ready , or                          Sales- Accepted . A system administrator can configure notifications related to lead                  statuses .                 For more information, see                      Using Business Events. ]]></column>

Marketing and sales teams rapidly adjust their processes and optimally use collected data, striving for the most effective work approaches. As such, they need their CRM systems to be flexible enough to support adjustments in processes without lengthy, costly development being required. Acumatica ERP provides flexible tools that marketing and sales teams can use to implement and customize workflows in the system without coding.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Use the lead states in Acumatica ERP in your lead qualification workflow
*Convert a lead to an opportunity
*Disqualify a lead
*Return a lead to marketing for further nurturing
*Reopen a disqualified lead

==Applicable Scenarios==
You may want to learn how to qualify leads in Acumatica ERP in scenarios that include the following:[anchor|#_7165d0ed-fbf9-4bca-b563-a0155c7a9310]
*You have obtained a lead from marketing: The marketing team has qualified a lead as a marketing-qualified lead (MQL), and your manager has assigned the lead to you. You need to get in touch with the lead and find out (qualify) if the organization is interested in the product. If so, you need to convert the lead to an opportunity.
*A lead has contacted you and confirmed the intention to buy the company&rsquo;s products or services, and you need to convert the lead to an opportunity.
*A lead has expressed no interest in your company&rsquo;s products or services, and you need to disqualify the lead.
*You need to return a lead that is not yet ready to buy to marketing for further nurturing.
[anchor|#_605d6d63-31ab-402b-b588-cf997e475747]
==Lead Qualification Process==
Lead qualification is the process of determining a lead to be one of the following:[anchor|#_672dd86d-34dd-428d-883a-bcfed009bc30]
*A prospect that fits your target customer profile and has a high chance to become a customer 
*An existing customer with interest in a product or service that this customer has not already purchased

When marketing personnel communicate with leads (for example, during marketing campaigns) and work on developing the leads’ interest in the company’s products or services, they establish qualification criteria, which show that some leads are interested to buy more than others. The particular lead qualification criteria vary for different companies and for different products or services. The number of leads that a marketing team passes to a sales team depends on many factors, such as the sales team’s requirements for leads or the number of the leads a sales team can handle.{br}

We recommend that marketing and sales teams work together to agree on the criteria of transferring leads from marketing to sales and regularly revise the criteria depending on company sales and other changing conditions. Based on this agreement, in Acumatica ERP, you can create your lead qualification workflow, which consists of stages: identifiable phases (which can be required or optional) in the workflow that relate to particular actions a marketing employee performs while qualifying each lead. Similarly, the lead proceeds through states—which are represented by statuses in the system—for each stage. The following sections describe this workflow and the ability to implement it in Acumatica ERP.[anchor|#_738224c2-65ba-469a-b48c-4a14343ea0e5]
==Lead Qualification Workflow==
CRM functional area in Acumatica ERP includes the lead qualification workflow that helps marketing and sales teams manage leads, add leads to marketing campaigns, qualify leads, associate multiple leads with the same business account and contact, return leads that require further nurturing to marketing and reopen a disqualified lead if needed. You can customize the workflow according to your company&rsquo;s lead qualification processes.{br}

The following diagram illustrates the lead qualification workflow.[anchor|#_33e12896-fa13-4ac6-b81f-1364815969ee][anchor|#_4e366fde-b7f7-477f-8ca4-bb7615b39bfd][image:Shared/Images/diag_CRM_Lead_Qualification_Workflow.png|popup|Lead Qualification Workflow|480px]
In the lead qualification workflow, transitions between lead states are implemented as actions on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form. You can execute these actions by using the '''Actions''' menu on the form&rsquo;s toolbar. A lead state is displayed in the '''Status''' box of the Summary area on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] form. A system administrator can customize the workflow to define which states correspond to the ''Active'' (nurtured) state of the lead. A system administrator can also configure notifications related to lead states which the system will send users as soon as the lead state has been changed. (For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Using_Business_Events_Mapref|Using Business Events].)
==Lead Qualification as Performed by Sales in Acumatica ERP==
When a sales team starts working with a lead, the lead qualifier (for example, a telemarketer or a sales representative) can contact and qualify the MQL, and then record the results in the system. If a lead is not yet ready to buy, a sales manager can return the lead to the marketing team for further nurturing. If the lead confirms interest in the company&rsquo;s products or services, the lead qualifier qualifies the lead as sales-accepted (SAL) and the sales team can take further follow-up actions on the lead, such as converting the lead to an opportunity and creating a contact and a business account for the lead in the system. A lead converted to an opportunity becomes a sales-qualified lead (SQL).
Lead qualification by a sales team may include the following stages:[anchor|#_593218d0-da5e-46cd-8965-2c350e352a74]
*Validating the lead for duplicates, as described in [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Mktg_Validating_Recs_Duplicates_Mapref|Validating Records for Duplicates].
*Assigning the lead to an owner, as described in [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Mktg_Assigning_Leads_To_Owners_Mapref|Assigning Leads To Owners].
*Communicating with the lead, as described in [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Mktg_Managing_Emails_Activities_Mapref|Managing Emails and Activities] and [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Mktg_Managing_Mass_Emails_Mapref|Managing Mass Emails].
*Accepting the lead for follow-up actions by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Accept''' for the lead on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form.
*Creating a contact for the lead, as described in [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Sales_Creating_Contacts_Mapref|Creating Contacts].
*Creating a business account for the lead, as described in [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Sales_Creating_Bus_Accounts_Mapref|Creating Business Accounts].
*Converting the lead to an opportunity by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Convert to Opportunity''' for the lead on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] form. During this process, you specify basic settings for the opportunity, which will be created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) form, and create a contact and a business account for the lead if they have not yet been created.
*Returning the lead to the marketing team for further nurturing by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Open''' for the lead on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] form
*Disqualifying a lead by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Disqualify''' for the lead on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] form
*Reopening a lead that has been disqualified by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Open''' for the lead on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] form
((({S:Hint}Any of the stages listed above may be skipped as needed, depending on the company&rsquo;s lead qualification processes for sales.

==Lead Qualification Workflow (Sales)==
The following diagram illustrates the lead qualification workflow as performed by a sales team.[anchor|#_f1b7ab1b-46c4-4bef-9c8a-032d8e5155c2][anchor|#_8248f332-3d84-47cc-91fe-3c23e1afdf27][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_CRM_Lead_Qualification_Sales.png|popup|Lead Qualification Workflow (Sales)|480px][anchor|#_425dd423-3717-4ab6-b769-d62c5919f933]
==Lead Qualification States==
As a lead is being processed by marketing and sales teams, it progresses through various states. Each lead state is represented in the system by a status, which is displayed in the '''Status''' box in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form. Lead statuses are updated by the system, and the '''Status''' box is unavailable for editing. A user can initiate transitions between lead states—which causes the system to update the status accordingly—by performing actions on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] form.{br}

In Acumatica ERP, a lead can be assigned one of the following statuses:[anchor|#_5e1cf511-4526-4ba3-bc99-526663cadc82]
*''New'': The lead has been created in the system, but no work has been done on it yet.
*''Open'': The lead is being qualified by the marketing team.
*''Sales-Ready'': The lead has been qualified by a marketing team as showing more interest in the organization&rsquo;s products or services than other leads.
*''Sales-Accepted'': The lead has been initially reviewed and accepted by the lead qualification team, and it is willing to communicate more with the sales team for further qualification.
*''Converted:'' The lead has been qualified and converted to an opportunity. Once a lead has this status, most of the boxes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] form are read-only; you can edit the value in only the '''Description''' box in the Summary area.
*''Disqualified'': The lead is showing no interest in the organization&rsquo;s products or is not reachable (for example, the contact information is not valid). This status may also be used for leads that are duplicates of more correct or detailed leads. For more information about finding duplicates among CRM records in Acumatica ERP, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Mktg_Validating_Recs_Duplicates_Mapref|Validating Records for Duplicates].

If a lead has the ''New'', ''Open'', ''Sales-Ready'', or ''Sales-Accepted'' status, the '''Active''' check box on the '''CRM Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] form is selected by default to indicate that the lead can be nurtured by a marketing or sales team. The system clears the check box if the lead has the ''Converted'' or ''Disqualified'' status.{br}

During lead qualification, some states may not be needed: For example, in a small company, the same team members might work with leads that are both ready for sales and accepted by sales, and thus one state could be used for leads that are turned over to sales, instead of two.[anchor|#_f0db9847-18e7-4e05-9cf9-e7deaaa9e10e]
==Processing of a Lead Through States==
As you work with a lead on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form, you can select any of the following actions on the form toolbar to move a lead through states (which causes the system to change the statuses accordingly):[anchor|#_74e01c24-02e5-4d89-bdb7-b1656c9632f3]
*'''Open''': Opens the '''Details''' dialog box, where you select the reason for opening the lead and confirm that you want the system to perform the action. The status of the lead will be changed to ''Open''. This action is available when the status of the lead record is ''New'', ''Sales-Ready'', ''Sales-Accepted'', ''Converted'', or ''Disqualified''.
*'''Qualify''': Opens the '''Details''' dialog box, where you select the reason for qualifying the lead and confirm that you want the system to perform the action. The status of the lead will be changed to ''Sales-Ready''. This action is available when the status of the lead record is ''New'' or ''Open''.
*'''Accept''': Opens the '''Details''' dialog box, where you select the reason for accepting the lead and confirm that you want the system to perform the action. The status of the lead will be changed to ''Sales-Accepted''. This action is available when the status of the lead is ''New'', ''Open'', or ''Sales-Ready''.
*'''Disqualify''': Opens the '''Details''' dialog box, where you select the reason for disqualifying the lead and confirm that you want the system to perform the action. The status of the lead will be changed to ''Disqualified''. This action is available if the status of the lead record is ''New'', ''Open'', ''Sales-Ready'', or ''Sales-Accepted''.
*'''Convert to Opportunity''': Opens the '''New Opportunity''' dialog box, where you can enter the initial data that is required to create an opportunity. By using that dialog box, you can create a new contact and business account for the lead, if needed, or review the basic settings of the existing ones. The action is available if the status of the lead record is ''New'', ''Open'', ''Sales-Ready'', or ''Sales-Accepted''.

A system administrator can configure notifications related to lead statuses. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Using_Business_Events_Mapref|Using Business Events].]]></column>

Lead Qualification as Performed by Sales in  Acumatica ERPWhen a sales team starts working with a lead, the lead qualifier (for example,          a         telemarketer  or a sales representative) can         contact and qualify the          MQL ,         and then record the results in the system. If a lead is not yet ready to buy, a sales         manager can return the lead to the marketing team for further nurturing. If the lead         confirms          interest          in the company's products or services, the lead qualifier qualifies the lead as         sales-accepted (SAL) and the sales team can take further follow-up actions on the lead, such         as converting the lead to an opportunity and creating a contact and a business account for         the lead in the system. A lead converted to an opportunity becomes a sales-qualified lead         ( SQL ). Lead qualification by a sales team may include the following stages: Validating the lead for duplicates, as described in  Validating Records for Duplicates.

In  Acumatica ERP, a                 lead can be assigned one of the following statuses: New : The lead has been created in the system, but no work has been done on it yet. Open : The lead is being qualified by the marketing team. Sales-Ready : The lead has been qualified by a marketing team as showing                      more                     interest in the organization's products or services than other                     leads. Sales-Accepted : The lead has been initially reviewed and accepted by the                      lead                     qualification team, and it is                      willing to                     communicate more  with the sales team for further                     qualification.

This                     status may also be used for leads that are duplicates of more correct or                     detailed leads.  For more information about finding duplicates                     among CRM records in  Acumatica ERP, see  Validating Records for Duplicates. If a lead has the  New ,  Open ,  Sales-Ready , or  Sales-Accepted  status,                 the  Active  check box on the  CRM Info                  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads form is selected by default                 to indicate that the lead can                 be                  nurtured by a marketing or sales team.  The system clears the                 check box if the lead has the  Converted  or  Disqualified  status. During                 lead qualification, some states may not be needed: For example, in a small company,                 the same team members might work with leads that are both ready for sales and                 accepted by sales, and thus one state could be used for leads that are turned over                 to sales, instead of two.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Qualifying Leads (Sales): To Disqualify a          Lead The following activity demonstrates how to disqualify a lead in  Acumatica ERP. The following activity is             based on the  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system             settings have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the             activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100              dataset to its initial state. Story Suppose that you are Bill Owen, a marketing manager of the  SweetLife Fruits & Jams company. You have launched an advertising campaign to promote a new series of                     commercial juicers. The audience is a group of leads that have shown interest in                     these juicers. During the campaign, you have sent emails with the product                     descriptions and a survey to gauge the audience's interest in the products.                     Joahn Livier, the head of the client services department at the Snow Park                     Restaurant, responded to your survey that the company is no longer interested in                     commercial juicers.Thus, you need to disqualify the                          Joahn                          Livier  lead. Configuration Overview For the purposes of this activity, the following tasks have been performed: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, the                              Customer Management  feature has been enabled.

As you work with prospective customers, you need to create business accounts in the system, which can later be extended to customer accounts. (They can also be extended to vendor accounts if your company purchases some products or services from the company.) This topicprovides information about creating business accounts in Acumatica ERP.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Become familiar with ways of creating business accounts
*Learn about the synchronization of settings in leads, contacts, and business accounts
*Create a business account manually
*Specify a primary contact for the business account
*Create a business account by using the Acumatica ERP mobile app

==Applicable Scenarios==
You may want to learn how to create business accounts in scenarios that include the following:[anchor|#_7165d0ed-fbf9-4bca-b563-a0155c7a9310]
*An employee of your company has contacted the lead and confirmed the contact information and the interest in company&rsquo;s products or services, and you need to convert a lead to an opportunity.
*You have been assigned to the lead whose contact information and interest in company&rsquo;s products or services has been confirmed, and you need to convert a lead to an opportunity.

==Business Accounts in Acumatica ERP==
In Acumatica ERP, a business account is a record on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) form that represents a legal entity (a company or a person) that your company has relations with or deals with; it is generally created in the system when your company is marketing its products or services to the business account. This business account can later be converted to a customer (or to a vendor; a business account can be converted to both a customer and a vendor if you sell products or services to this account and buy products or services from it). {br}

A lead and a contact (or multiple leads and contacts) in the system—which are created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form and the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) form, respectively—may be associated with a business account. To create a business account, you need to specify a contact for this account. If the needed contact has already been created in the system, you can create a business account and associate the contact with the account. If the needed contact has not been created in the system, the system will create it when you are creating the business account. When you are creating a new business account based on a lead that exists in the system, the system automatically copies the contact information specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] form from the lead to the business account.
==Creation of Business Accounts in Acumatica ERP==
The broader process of creating a business account in Acumatica ERP, which is maintained on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) form, consists of the following steps:[anchor|#_4e7804f4-968e-480e-bc09-5bbebd408d09]
#Optional: If your are creating a business account based on an existing lead, validating this lead for duplicates. For details, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Mktg_Validating_Recs_Duplicates_Mapref|Validating Records for Duplicates].
#Creating the business account (from a lead, contact, through lead conversion to an opportunity, or manually)
#Optional: Creating a contact associated with the business account
#Specifying a primary contact for the business account

You can create a business account in any of the following ways:[anchor|#_b0e1d1fa-ffd9-44ed-a54c-3ee0ca6f4be0]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form when you convert the lead selected on the form to an opportunity: You click '''Actions''' > '''Convert to Opportunity''' on the form toolbar. In the '''New Opportunity''' dialog box, which opens, you specify the opportunity and business account settings. You then click '''Create''' or '''Create and Review''' to create the opportunity and business account. For detailed instructions, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Sales_Qualifying_Leads_by_Sales_To_Convert_a_Lead_To_Opportunity|Qualifying Leads (Sales): To Convert a Lead to an Opportunity].
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) form if you create a business account associated with the lead or opportunity selected on the form: You click '''Actions''' > '''Create Account''' on the form toolbar. In the '''New Account''' dialog box, which opens, you specify the basic business account and contact settings, and then you click '''Create''' or '''Create and Review''' to create the business account.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) form if you create a business account associated with the contact selected on the form: You do this by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Create Account''' on the form toolbar. In the '''New Account '''dialog box, which opens, you specify the business account settings and click '''Create''' or '''Create and Review''' to create the business account.
*Directly on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) form: In this case, you add a new record and manually enter the settings of the new business account.
*Directly by using the Acumatica mobile app. For detailed instructions, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Sales_Creating_Bus_Accounts_Create_Account_MobApp|Creating Business Accounts: To Create a Business Account by Using the Acumatica Mobile App].

Regardless of how you create the business account, you select a business account class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] form or in one of the dialog boxes mentioned above, which causes the system to insert default settings for the business account, easing the process of content creation. (For details, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Classes_Mapref|Configuring Classes in CRM].){br}

Once a business account has been created, you can associate one or multiple leads or contacts with the business account and select a primary contact for it, as described in the following section.
==Creation of Contacts Associated with a Business Account==
When you create a business account on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) form by specifying the business account and contact settings in the in the '''New Account''' dialog box, the system also creates a contact and associates this contact with the business account. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) form, you can view and modify the address details of the contact on the '''Details''' tab and view the contact settings of the contact on the '''Contacts''' tab. On the '''Contacts''' tab, you can also create as many contacts associated with the business account as needed. {br}

We recommend that you specify a primary contact associated with the business account, as described in the following section.
==Primary Contact for a Business Account==
In Acumatica ERP, you can specify a primary contact for a business account. A primary contact is the contact whose contact and address settings the system uses as the default contact for the associated records and documents that have contact settings on them, such as an opportunity created for the business account on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) form, thus ensuring that the contact who officially represents the business is used in these records. A primary contact gives you the following abilities:[anchor|#_2c7ef1a3-43f9-4e2b-800d-b63c38ddce4b]
*Quickly add to the system the contact information of a business and the official representative of this business
*Easily differentiate between the contact information of the business and the official representative of this business
*View the contact information of both the business and the official representative of this business on the same tab (the '''General''' tab) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) form.

Only one primary contact can be selected for a business account. On the '''General''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] form, you can specify or change the primary contact. On the '''Contacts''' tab of this form, you can select any contact associated with the business account as the primary one by clicking the contact and then clicking the '''Set as Primary''' button on the table toolbar.This causes the system to select the check box in the '''Primary''' column for the new primary contact and to populate the UI elements in the '''Primary Contact''' section of the '''General''' tab with the settings of the new primary contact.{br}

For an existing contact on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) form, if you clear the value in the '''Business Account''' box, the system displays a warning about the possibility of changing the primary contact for the account. If you proceed with clearing the '''Business Account''' box for the contact—thus deleting the link between the contact and the business account—on the '''Details''' and '''Contacts''' tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] form, the system clears all settings related to the primary contact.[anchor|#_a8fc282f-d24d-498b-88f4-5200ac7e9723]
==Synchronization of Settings in Leads, Contacts, and Business Accounts==
In Acumatica ERP, you can easily synchronize the contact-related settings of a lead with the same settings in the contact and business account related to that lead. With this synchronization turned on, changes to the contact information of any of these entities causes the settings in the related entities to be updated as well.((({S:Hint}The synchronization or overriding of settings applies to all the settings on the '''Contact Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form, all the settings on the '''Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) form, and the contact and address settings (of the primary contact of the business account) on the '''General''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) form. 
)))
You can synchronize contact information in leads, contacts, and business accounts by using the '''Override''' check box on the '''Contact Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) form as follows:[anchor|#_f581e50f-6009-4121-81d8-06a8d3331367]
*If the check box is cleared and the business account related to the contact has not been converted to a customer or a vendor yet, the contact information of the contact on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] form is synchronized with the contact information of the related lead and business account on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] and [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] forms, respectively, and can be updated in both directions. That is, if you update the contact and address settings on any of these forms, the settings will be also updated on the related forms.
*If the check box is selected, the contact information for the selected contact on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] form can differ from the contact information of the related lead and business account on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] and [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] forms. If contact information is updated on any of these forms, the changes are not related on the other forms.

==Extension of a Business Account to a Customer or a Vendor==
When a prospective customer has purchased products or services from your company, you can easily extend it (that is, convert it) to be a customer in Acumatica ERP, so that you don’t need to enter the same data again. It also may happen that a business account becomes a vendor of certain products or services, and you can extend the business account to be a vendor. (A business account can be extended to be both a customer and a vendor, or just one of these.) {br}

You can extend a business account to a customer account or a vendor account by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Extend to Customer''' or by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Extend to Vendor''' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) form. The system opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form or the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form, respectively, with the appropriate details copied from the business account. On the form, you add the financial settings and additional settings (such as billing address) that may be used in Acumatica ERP documents of the customer or vendor. You then click '''Save & Close''' on the form toolbar to save the customer or vendor record and return to the business account record you were viewing; this record is maintained in the system.]]></column>

Creating the business account           ( from a           lead, contact,            through           lead           conversion            to an opportunity,  or manually) Optional: Creating a contact associated with the business account Specifying a primary contact for the business account You         can create a business account in any of the following ways: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads (CR301000) form when you convert the lead           selected on the form to an opportunity: You click  Actions Convert to Opportunity  on the form toolbar. In the  New Opportunity  dialog           box, which opens, you specify the opportunity and business account settings. You then           click  Create  or  Create and Review  to create           the opportunity and business account. For detailed instructions, see  Qualifying Leads (Sales): To Convert a Lead to an Opportunity. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads or   ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) Opportunities (CR304000)           form if you create a business account associated with the lead or opportunity selected on           the form: You click  Actions Create Account  on the form toolbar. In the  New Account  dialog box,           which opens, you specify the basic business account and contact settings, and then you           click  Create  or  Create and Review  to create           the business account. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) Contacts (CR302000) form if you create a business account           associated with the contact selected on the form: You do this by clicking  Actions Create Account  on the form toolbar. In the  New Account  dialog box,           which opens, you specify the business account settings and click              Create  or  Create and Review  to create the           business account. Directly on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) Business Accounts (CR303000) form: In this case, you add a           new record and manually enter the settings of the new business account. Directly by using the  Acumatica mobile app. For detailed instructions, see  Creating Business Accounts: To Create a Business Account by Using the Acumatica Mobile App. Regardless of how you create the business account, you select a business account class on         the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) Business Accounts form or in one of the dialog boxes mentioned above,         which causes the system to insert default settings for the business account, easing the         process of content creation.         ( For         details , see  Configuring Classes in CRM.) Once a business account has been created, you can associate one or multiple leads or         contacts with the business account and select a primary contact for it, as described in the         following section. Creation of Contacts Associated with a Business Account When you create a business account on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads (CR301000) or             ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) Contacts (CR302000) form by specifying the business account and         contact settings in the in the  New Account  dialog box, the system         also creates a contact and associates this contact with the business account. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) Business Accounts (CR303000) form, you can view and modify the address details of         the contact on the  Details  tab and view the contact settings of the         contact on the  Contacts  tab. On the  Contacts          tab, you can also create as many contacts associated with the business account as needed.  We recommend that you specify a primary contact associated with the business         account ,          as described in the following section. Primary Contact for a Business Account In  Acumatica ERP, you can specify a primary contact for a business account. A primary contact is the         contact whose contact and address settings the system uses as the default contact for the         associated records and documents that have contact settings on them, such as an opportunity         created for the business account on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) Opportunities (CR304000) form,         thus ensuring that  the         contact who officially represents the business  is used in these records. A         primary contact gives you the following abilities: Quickly add to the system the contact information of a business and the official           representative of this business Easily differentiate between the contact information of the business and the official           representative of this business View the contact information of both the business and the official representative of           this business on the same tab (the  General  tab) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) Business Accounts (CR303000) form. Only one primary contact can be selected for a business account.          On         the  General  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) Business Accounts form, you can         specify or change the primary contact. On the  Contacts  tab of this         form, you can select any contact associated with the business account as the primary one by         clicking the contact and then clicking the  Set as Primary  button on         the table toolbar. This          causes the system to select the check box in the  Primary  column for         the new primary contact and to populate the UI elements in the  Primary           Contact  section of the  General  tab with the settings of         the new primary contact. For         an existing contact on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) Contacts (CR302000) form, if         you clear the value in the  Business Account  box, the system displays         a warning about the possibility of changing the primary contact for the account.          If you proceed with clearing the  Business Account          box for the contact—thus deleting the link between the contact and the business         account—on the  Details  and  Contacts  tabs         of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) Business Accounts form, the system clears all settings          related         to the primary contact. Synchronization of Settings in Leads, Contacts, and Business                  Accounts In  Acumatica ERP, you can easily synchronize the contact-related settings of a lead with the same                 settings in the contact and business account related to that lead. With this                 synchronization turned on, changes to the contact information of any of these                 entities causes the settings in the related entities to be updated as well. The synchronization or overriding of settings applies to all the                     settings on the  Contact Info  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads (CR301000) form, all the settings on                     the                          Details                      tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) Contacts (CR302000) form, and the                     contact and address settings (of the primary contact of the business account) on                     the  General  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) Business Accounts (CR303000) form.                      You can synchronize contact information in leads, contacts, and business accounts by                 using the  Override  check box on the  Contact                     Info  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) Contacts                 (CR302000) form as                  follows: If the check box is cleared and the business account related to the contact has                     not been converted to a customer or a vendor yet, the contact information of the                     contact on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) Contacts form is synchronized                     with the contact information of the related lead and business account on the                           ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads and   ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) Business Accounts forms, respectively, and can be                     updated in both directions. That is, if you update the contact and address                     settings on any of these forms, the settings will be also updated on the related                     forms. If the check box is selected, the contact information for the selected contact                     on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) Contacts form can differ from the                     contact information of the related lead and business account on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads and   ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) Business Accounts forms. If contact information is                     updated on any of these forms, the changes are not related on the other                     forms. Extension of a Business Account to a Customer or a Vendor When a prospective customer has purchased products or services from your company, you can         easily extend it (that is, convert it) to be a customer in  Acumatica ERP, so that you don’t need to enter the same data again. It also may happen that a business         account becomes a vendor of certain products or services, and you can extend the business         account to be a vendor. (A business account can be extended to be both a customer and a         vendor, or just one of these.)  You can extend a business account to a customer account or a vendor account by clicking  Actions Extend to Customer  or by clicking  Actions Extend to Vendor  on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) Business Accounts (CR303000) form. The         system opens the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000) form or the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors (AP303000) form, respectively, with the appropriate         details copied from the business account. On the form, you add the financial settings and         additional settings (such as billing address) that may be used in  Acumatica ERP documents of the customer or vendor. You then click  Save &           Close  on the form toolbar to save the customer or vendor record and return to         the business account record you were         viewing;          this record is maintained in the system . ]]></column>

*Become familiar with ways of creating contacts
*Learn about the synchronization of settings in leads, contacts, and business accounts
*Learn about address validation and enrichment through third-party providers

==Applicable Scenarios==
You may want to learn how to create contacts in scenarios that include the following:[anchor|#_7165d0ed-fbf9-4bca-b563-a0155c7a9310]
*An employee of your company has contacted a lead and confirmed the contact information and the interest in company&rsquo;s products or services, and you need to convert the lead to an opportunity.
*You have been assigned to a lead whose contact information and interest in the company&rsquo;s products or services has been confirmed.

==Contacts in Acumatica ERP==
In Acumatica ERP, a contact is a record on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) form that represents a person and that can be associated with a variety of entities in the system. When you create a contact record, you enter the settings related to the information you have obtained, such as the person’s name, address, email address, and phone number.{br}

If you have created a lead in the system before you create the related contact, you specify the lead’s basic contact information on the '''Contact Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form. When you create a contact for this lead, the system copies the contact information of the lead to the associated contact.
==Contact Creation in Acumatica ERP==
In Acumatica ERP, you can create contacts in multiple ways depending on your company’s business processes and maintain them on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) form. If you use customer relationship management (CRM) functionality and you are processing a lead for which the contact information and interest in buying the company's products or services have been confirmed, you can convert the lead to an opportunity, which may involve the creation of a business account and a contact for this lead. You can also create a contact manually if needed. 
Any contact can be associated with one lead or multiple leads and with only one business account. You can synchronize contact information in the associated lead, contact, and business account to keep your data consistent and reliable. You can also easily navigate between the associated contacts, leads, and business accounts. For more information on business accounts, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Sales_Creating_Bus_Accounts_Mapref|Creating Business Accounts].
Contact creation in Acumatica ERP may consist of the following steps:[anchor|#_4e7804f4-968e-480e-bc09-5bbebd408d09]
#Optional: Validating an individual lead for duplicates. For details, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Mktg_Validating_Recs_Duplicates_Mapref|Validating Records for Duplicates].
#Creating a contact (through lead conversion or manually)

In Acumatica ERP, you can create a contact in any of the following ways:[anchor|#_43dd371a-c4e0-4e8f-be8e-e643467001a3]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form when you convert the lead selected on the form to an opportunity: You click '''Actions''' > '''Convert to Opportunity''' on the form toolbar. In the '''New Opportunity''' dialog box, which opens, you specify the opportunity and business account settings. (The system automatically inserts the basic settings for the contact based on the settings of the lead, but you can override any of them.) You then click '''Create''' or '''Create and Review''' to create the opportunity and contact. For detailed instructions, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Sales_Qualifying_Leads_by_Sales_To_Convert_a_Lead_To_Opportunity|Qualifying Leads (Sales): To Convert a Lead to an Opportunity].
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads], [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]), or [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]), or [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) forms if you create a contact associated with the entity selected on the form: You click '''Actions''' > '''Create Contact''' on the form toolbar. In the '''New Contact''' dialog box, which opens, you specify the basic contact settings (additional settings can be specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] form), and then you click '''Create''' or '''Create and Review''' to create the contact.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] form if you specify the settings of the primary contact when you create a business account for the selected lead or opportunity: You do this by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Create Account''' on the form toolbar. In the '''New Account''' dialog box, which opens, you specify the basic business account and contact settings, and click '''Create''' or '''Create and Review''' to create the business account and contact. 
*Directly on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) form: In this case, you add a new record and manually enter the settings of the new contact.
*By creating a contact from the Acumatica add-in for Outlook, based on the details of the selected email recipient or sender: For detailed instructions, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Sales_Creating_Contacts_Create_Contact_Acu_AddIn|Creating Contacts: To Create a Contact by Using the Acumatica Add-In for Outlook]
*Directly by using the Acumatica ERP mobile app: For detailed instructions, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Sales_Creating_Contacts_Create_Contact_MobApp|Creating Contacts: To Create a Contact by Using the Acumatica Mobile App].

Regardless of how you create the contact, you select a contact class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] form or in one of the dialog boxes mentioned above, which causes the system to insert default settings for the contact, easing the process of content creation. (For details, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Classes_Mapref|Configuring Classes in CRM].){br}

The [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] form contains the complete settings of the contact, which you can view and edit. On the '''Activities''' tab of this form, you can create and work with all the activities related to the contact, including planned, current, and completed activities. For details, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Mktg_Managing_Emails_Activities_Mapref|Managing Emails and Activities].[anchor|#_1fdbd9e0-46ca-4e2f-880a-12630828014b]
==Synchronization of Settings in Leads, Contacts, and Business Accounts==
In Acumatica ERP, you can easily synchronize the contact-related settings of a lead with the same settings in the contact and business account related to that lead. With this synchronization turned on, changes to the contact information of any of these entities causes the settings in the related entities to be updated as well.((({S:Hint}The synchronization or overriding of settings applies to all the settings on the '''Contact Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form, all the settings on the '''Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) form, and the contact and address settings (of the primary contact of the business account) on the '''General''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) form. 
)))
You can synchronize contact information in leads, contacts, and business accounts by using the '''Override''' check box on the '''Contact Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) form as follows:[anchor|#_41e27111-e7cf-4ff0-b606-ff0d04eeeb6f]
*If the check box is cleared and the business account related to the contact has not been converted to a customer or a vendor yet, the contact information of the contact on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] form is synchronized with the contact information of the related lead and business account on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] and [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] forms, respectively, and can be updated in both directions. That is, if you update the contact and address settings on any of these forms, the settings will be also updated on the related forms.
*If the check box is selected, the contact information for the selected contact on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] form can differ from the contact information of the related lead and business account on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] and [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] forms. If contact information is updated on any of these forms, the changes are not related on the other forms.

==Contact Relations with Acumatica ERP Entities==
Once a contact has been defined in the system on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) form, it can be associated with any of the following entities in Acumatica ERP:[anchor|#_7bdb7908-16d6-4387-ac07-8c91c3253aef]
*Leads: A lead or multiple leads can be associated with a contact. On the '''Leads''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] form, you can see the list of leads associated with the contact.
*Business accounts: In the '''Business Account''' box in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] form, an associated business account may be specified for a contact. Multiple contacts can be associated with one business account, but only one primary contact can be selected for an account. For details, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Sales_Creating_Bus_Accounts_Mapref|Creating Business Accounts].
*Marketing lists: A contact may be added to a marketing list and subscribed to newsletters and other mailings. On the '''Marketing Lists''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] form, you can see all marketing lists in which the contact is included. For more information about marketing lists, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Mktg_Mng_Marketing_Lists_Mapref|Managing Marketing Lists].
*Marketing campaigns: On the '''Campaigns''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] form, you can view a list of all completed, ongoing, and planned marketing campaigns in which the contact is involved. For details about campaigns in Acumatica ERP, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Mktg_Mng_Marketing_Campaigns_Mapref|Managing Marketing Campaigns].
*Opportunities: The '''Opportunities''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] form lists all opportunities linked to the contact.
*Cases: The '''Cases''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] form contains a list of all cases associated with the contact.
*Users: A contact may be associated with an external user that may have access to the system. You can use the '''User Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] form to view and edit information about the user account associated with the contact.
*Employees: When the employee record is created and saved in the system, the system creates a contact for this employee and associates this employee record with this contact record. You can see the link to the associated contact on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form, in the '''Contact Info''' section on the '''General Info''' tab.

In Acumatica ERP, an opportunity represents a potential sale to a new or existing customer. If you have a contact who is interested in your quote and displays an intention to buy as soon as possible, the contact can be regarded as a qualified opportunity. For this contact, you can immediately create an opportunity by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) form.{br}{TOC}
==Specifying Contact Information==
As a rule, when you create an opportunity, you specify the relevant contact information for it. In Acumatica ERP, you can do this by selecting an existing business account or contact record in the '''Business Account''' or '''Contact''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] form. If no such record exists in the system, you can create a new business account or contact on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) form, respectively, and then associate it with the opportunity. For a faster option, you can instead enter basic contact information on the fly by using the '''Contact Info''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] form.{br}

If you select a business account or contact in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] form, the contact information is copied to the '''Contact Info''' tab from the account or contact settings. This information is displayed as read-only by default, but it can be modified once you select the '''Override''' check box on this tab.((({S:Warn}If you modify the contact or address details for a contact or business account by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] form, the changes will not be reflected on the information displayed on the '''Contact Info''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] form.

If you have specified basic contact information on the fly by using the '''Contact Info''' tab, you can create a regular contact record based on this information by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Create Contact''' on the form toolbar. The system automatically associates the created contact with the opportunity.{br}

To be able to further process the opportunity, you need to specify a business account. You can create a new business account by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Create Account''' on the form toolbar. If you select the '''Link Contact to Account''' check box in the '''New Account''' dialog box (which opens), the contact record associated with the opportunity will also be associated with the new business account.
==Creating Sales Orders, Invoices, and Emails==
The system uses the contact information specified on the '''Contact Info''' tab when it generates new documents—such as sales orders, invoices, or emails—related to the opportunity. For a sales order created from the opportunity, the billing settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form are populated based on this information. Similarly, the financial settings specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form for an invoice created from the opportunity are based on the contact information of the opportunity. If you create an email activity by using the '''Activities''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] form, the email address specified on the '''Contact Info''' tab (if any) is populated in the '''To''' box of the created email.
==Preserving Opportunity-Related Contact Information==
If you select a different business account or contact for the opportunity, the system will ask you whether you want to replace the contact information specified on the '''Contact Info''' tab with the new information. You can preserve the previously specified information; in this case, the '''Override''' check box will become selected on the '''Contact Info''' tab to indicate that this information differs from that of the contact or business account selected in the Summary area.
==Validating Addresses==
If the ''Address Validation Integration'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form and an address validation provider is configured on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_30_00|Address Providers] ([~/?ScreenId=CS103000|CS103000]) form, you can use the '''Validate Addresses''' menu command on the '''Actions''' menu on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] form. When you click this menu command, the addresses specified for the document are validated through integration with a specialized third-party software or service.{br}

If the specified address has been validated, the '''Validated''' check box on the '''Contact Info''' tab is selected. This check box appears only if the ''Address Validation Integration'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Opportunity-Related Contact Information In  Acumatica ERP, an opportunity represents a potential sale to a new or existing customer. If you have a         contact who is interested in your quote and displays an intention to buy as soon as         possible, the contact can be regarded as a qualified opportunity. For this contact, you can         immediately create an opportunity by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) Opportunities (CR304000)         form. Specifying Contact Information As a rule, when you create an opportunity, you specify the relevant contact information for         it. In  Acumatica ERP, you can do this by selecting an existing business account or contact record in the            Business Account  or  Contact  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) Opportunities form. If no such record exists in the system, you can create a         new business account or contact on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) Business Accounts (CR303000) or             ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) Contacts (CR302000) form, respectively, and then associate it         with the opportunity. For a faster option, you can instead enter basic contact information         on the fly by using the  Contact Info  tab on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) Opportunities form. If you select a business account or contact in the Summary area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) Opportunities form, the contact information is copied to the            Contact Info  tab from the account or contact settings. This         information is displayed as read-only by default, but it can be modified once you select the            Override  check box on this tab. If you modify the contact or address details for a contact or business account by using         the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) Contacts or   ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) Business Accounts form, the changes         will not be reflected on the information displayed on the  Contact           Info  tab on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) Opportunities form. Creating New Contacts and Business Accounts If you have specified basic contact information on the fly by using the  Contact           Info  tab, you can create a regular contact record based on this information by         clicking  Actions Create Contact  on the form toolbar. The system automatically associates the created contact         with the opportunity. To be able to further process the opportunity, you need to specify a business account. You         can create a new business account by clicking  Actions Create Account  on the form toolbar. If you select the  Link Contact to Account  check         box in the  New Account  dialog box (which opens), the contact record         associated with the opportunity will also be associated with the new business account. Creating Sales Orders, Invoices, and Emails The system uses the contact information specified on the  Contact           Info  tab when it generates new documents—such as sales orders, invoices,         or emails—related to the opportunity. For a sales order created from the opportunity,         the billing settings on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form are populated         based on this information. Similarly, the financial settings specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form for an invoice created from the opportunity         are based on the contact information of the opportunity. If you create an email activity by         using the  Activities  tab on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) Opportunities form,         the email address specified on the  Contact Info  tab (if any) is         populated in the  To  box of the created email. Preserving Opportunity-Related Contact Information If you select a different business account or contact for the opportunity, the system will         ask you whether you want to replace the contact information specified on the            Contact Info  tab with the new information. You can preserve the         previously specified information; in this case, the  Override  check         box will become selected on the  Contact Info  tab to indicate that         this information differs from that of the contact or business account selected in the         Summary area. Validating Addresses If the  Address Validation Integration  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form and an address validation provider         is configured on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS103000|CS103000]) Address Providers (CS103000) form, you can use the            Validate Addresses  menu command on the            Actions  menu on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) Opportunities form.

==Specifying Shipping Information==
When you create an opportunity on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) form, the system checks the availability of the following information and populates the '''Shipping Info''' tab with the first data it finds, in the specified order of priority:[anchor|#_9c37723a-4a50-4275-9cc6-e28d4b60ca15]
#The location specified for the opportunity
#The default location of the specified business account
#The main contact information and address of the specified business account
#The contact information and address of the specified contact
#The contact information specified on the '''Contact Info''' tab

The shipping information specified on the '''Shipping Info''' tab is displayed as read-only by default. If you select the '''Override Shipping Info''' check box on this tab, you can modify the shipping information. Each time you modify the shipping information, applicable taxes are automatically recalculated for the document.{br}

If the '''Override Shipping Info''' check box is selected and you change the business account specified in the Summary area of the form, the system brings up a dialog box with a question whether you want the specified shipping information to be replaced with the information of the new business account. You can choose to preserve the previously specified information; in this case, the '''Override Shipping Info''' check box remains selected on the '''Shipping Info''' tab to indicate that this information differs from that of the contact, business account, or location selected in the Summary area.((({S:Warn}If you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]), or [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_10|Account Locations] ([~/?ScreenId=CR303010|CR303010]) form to modify the contact or address details for the contact, business account, or location specified for an opportunity, the changes will not be reflected on the information displayed on the '''Shipping Info''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] form.

==Shipping Information in Quotes, Sales Orders, and Invoices==
The shipping information specified for an opportunity is transferred to a sales order, invoice, or quote that you create based on that opportunity.{br}

If a primary quote exists for an opportunity, the shipping information specified for the primary quote is synchronized with the shipping information specified for the opportunity.{br}

If you modify the shipping information specified for an opportunity that is already linked with a sales order, invoice, or non-primary quote, the changes will not be reflected on the information in the linked document. Similarly, changes in the shipping information specified for a sales order, invoice, or non-primary quote are not reflected on the information in the linked opportunity.
==Validating Addresses==

An opportunity, when processed by a salesperson, progresses through various stages. At any particular stage, there is a certain probability, however low, that the sale can be successfully closed. This enables you to estimate future sales revenue at any time. The accuracy of revenue estimation heavily depends on the correct identification of the opportunity stage and on the accuracy of the related probability.{br}

An administrator uses the '''Stages''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_90_00|Opportunity Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR209000|CR209000]) form to set up opportunity stages and their probabilities. The full list of opportunity stages is shared by all opportunity classes. When setting up a particular opportunity class, an administrator selects the '''Active''' check box for the opportunity stages that need to be included in this class and clears for the opportunity stages that are not intended for this class. If the check box is cleared for a stage that has been used in any opportunity of the class, this stage becomes excluded from the list of available stages for opportunities of the class (but it still will be shown in reports). For each opportunity class, at least one stage should be active.{br}

The system offers a predefined list of opportunity stages, which includes the following options:[anchor|#ul_bjj_2px_nz]
*''Prospect'': The contact associated with the opportunity is a known prospect but it is not clear whether they are interested in the offered products or services.
*''Nurture'': Information about the prospect&rsquo;s interest in products and services is being collected.
*''Qualification'': The prospect&rsquo;s interest in purchasing particular products or services is being determined.
*''Development'': The prospect&rsquo;s requirements, budget, and time frame are being clarified.
*''Solution'': A solution is under development.
*''Proof'': A concept is ready and pending approval.
*''Negotiation'': A proposal has been prepared or a contract is ready to be signed.
*''Won'': The deal has been successfully closed.

To reflect a sales process established in the company, an administrator can modify the list by adding new stages or by removing unnecessary ones, which will affect all existing opportunity classes. For each new stage, an identifier, name, probability percentage, and sort order should be specified.

In Acumatica ERP, a sales quote represents a formal offer made to a particular customer based on an opportunity; the sales quote includes a list of products offered at specific prices. For one opportunity, users can create any number of quotes, each of which can be printed or emailed to the specified customer for review. When the customer accepts the offer, the user can create a sales order and then an invoice based on the quote.{br}

Sales quote functionality becomes available in the system if the ''Sales Quotes'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}{TOC}
==Creation of Sales Quotes==
A user can start creating a sales quote in any of the following ways:[anchor|#ul_mvv_xgq_ncb]
*By clicking '''Create Quote''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) form
*By clicking '''Create Quote''' on the table toolbar of the '''Quotes''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] form
*By clicking '''Add New Record''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_45_00|Sales Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304500|CR304500]) form
*By selecting an existing quote and then invoking the '''Copy Quote''' action, which is available on the '''Quotes''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] form and on the '''Actions''' menu on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_45_00|Sales Quotes] form; in this case, a copy of the selected quote is created

==Primary Quotes==
If one quote or multiple quotes are created for an opportunity, one of the quotes must be marked as the primary quote, which a user can do either during the creation of a quote or by applying the '''Mark as Primary''' action to a selected quote.{br}

An opportunity uses the primary quote as the source of the following settings: the list of products, the currency and the currency rate, the location, the contact information, and the tax and discount details. If a user marks a different quote as the primary quote for the opportunity, these settings are changed in the opportunity to those of the new primary quote.
==Sales Quote Activities==
On the '''Activities''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_45_00|Sales Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304500|CR304500]) form, a user can create activities associated with the selected quote.

When the customer accepts the offer, the user can create a sales order and     then an invoice based on the quote.

The person recording a new case uses the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_00|Cases] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306000|CR306000]) form, which holds a wide variety of information related to each case, such as the following: [anchor|#ul_ekl_g23_vm]
*Basic information: This information includes the customer, the contact, the case class, the status of the case, the subject and description of the case, and the date the case is reported.
*Ownership details: The case can be assigned to both a workgroup and an individual owner within the group.
*Contract or default contract: Contract cases require specifying the contract on entry, and standalone cases require specification of the customer and the customer&rsquo;s case class, which determines the default contract.
*Timing information: The person working on the case can enter an estimate of the time to be spent on the case. Actual hours spent (broken down into work hours, overtime hours, billable work hours, and billable overtime hours) can be recorded later.
*Severity and priority: The severity assigned to the case may also relate to a time requirement—the reaction time and service level agreements defined by the case class. Generally, priorities are used to escalate the processing of the cases. If you assign a color code to each priority level, the cases will be displayed on the user dashboard highlighted according to their priorities.
*Related cases and relations: A case might have other related cases. It might also have employees and customers assigned who take part in making decisions concerning the case.

As a rule, each case will go through multiple stages, which might include the following: [anchor|#ul_lyb_k23_vm]
*Case creation by users responsible for case entry.
*Assignment (either manually or through assignment rules) to a specific workgroup and a user within it.
*Creation, by the user to whom the case is assigned, of tasks, events, and other activities that the user or others must complete.
*Approval of the case&rsquo;s resolution through the company&rsquo;s internal processes, if applicable.
*Escalation of the case if it is overdue. Escalation makes the case visible to workgroups higher in the company tree.
*Release of the case activities, the case itself, or both.
*Billing of the cases or contracts. Standalone cases are billed once they&rsquo;re released, while contract cases are billed in bulk once it&rsquo;s time to issue an invoice for the contract.
*Closing of the case, which occurs after it is billed.

To change the status of a case, you click the corresponding action button on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_00|Cases] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306000|CR306000]) form; the system opens the '''Details''' dialog box so you can provide the details to be used for the change. A case status reflects where the case is within its processing cycle. If users consistently and appropriately use statuses, you can get meaningful statistics on cases when you generate performance reports and inquiries. {br}

Out of the box, the following statuses are available for a case:[anchor|#ul_vyb_k23_vm]
*''New'': The case is new. A case with this status can have the ''Unassigned'' or ''Opened on Portal'' value in the '''Reason''' box.
*''Open'': The case is open. A case with this status can have the following values in the '''Reason''' box: ''In Process'', ''Updated'', ''In Escalation'', or ''Pending Closure''.
*''Pending Customer'': The case waits for feedback from customer. A case with this status can have the following values in the '''Reason''' box: ''More Info Requested'', ''Waiting Confirmation'', or ''Pending Closure''.
*''Closed'': The case is finally closed. A case with this status can have the following values in the '''Reason''' box: ''Resolved'', ''Rejected'', ''Canceled'', ''Abandoned'', or ''Duplicate''.

==Billing==
Cases are billed in accordance with the specific contract or the default contract associated with the case class. Activities can be billable or not billable; this should be specified for the case class using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_60_00|Case Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR206000|CR206000]) form. {br}

See [HelpRoot_CRM\CR__con_Case_Billing|Case Billing] for more details. 
==Related Cases==
A case may be related to other cases. For example, a case might be set so it cannot be resolved until another case, known as a &ldquo;blocker&ldquo; case, is resolved. Note, though, that the relations between cases are intended only for informational purposes and are not enforced on the system level.{br}

On the '''Related Cases''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_00|Cases] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306000|CR306000]) form you can specify the relations between cases. There are four types of relations between cases:[anchor|#ul_yyb_k23_vm]
*'''Blocks''': The case blocks the current case. In other words, the current case cannot be closed before the related blocker case.
*'''Depends On''': The case depends on the current case. In other words, the current case depends on the case and can, but may not, be closed before closing the case.
*'''Related''': There is a &ldquo;peer&ldquo; relation between the case with this relation and the current case.
*'''Duplicate Of''': The current case is a replica of the case with this relation.

In Acumatica ERP, users involved in case processing can create and track billable activities of various types, such as phone calls, emails, and notes. Then customers can be billed for the time that employees spent on case processing, based on the released activities associated with the case. Note that activities that are also associated with project tasks may have to be approved before they can be released.{br}{TOC}
==Case Billing Settings==
Whether and how a case should be billed depends on the settings of the case class that this case belongs to. Case classes are configured on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_60_00|Case Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR206000|CR206000]) form.{br}

 In Acumatica ERP, only cases marked as billable can be billed. (A case is billable if the '''Billable''' check box is selected for it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_00|Cases] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306000|CR306000]) form.) You can configure a case class so that all newly created cases of this class are marked as billable by default. {br}

 Acumatica ERP supports two modes of case billing: ''per case'' and ''per activity''. You can select the appropriate mode for a specific case class in the '''Billing Mode''' drop-down list, which is available only if the ''Time Reporting on Activity'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form (if the feature is disabled, the ''per case'' billing mode is automatically assigned to every new case class). Also, for a case class, you can specify specific labor items that will be used as sources of General Ledger accounts to be used for transactions; for details, see [HelpRoot_Projects\Non_Stock_Item_Projects_GeneralInfo|Labor Items: General Information].{br}

For a case whose class has the ''per case'' billing mode:[anchor|#ul_l4p_4k4_jm]
*You can bill only if the case is closed. If any activity related to the case has not been completed yet (and approved, if approval is required), you cannot release the case.
*You can release such cases for billing either one at a time from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_00|Cases] form or in batches from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_50_70_00|Release Cases] ([~/?ScreenId=CR507000|CR507000]) form.
*The invoice total includes the total number of billable hours that have been reported for the activities associated with this case. However, you can manually override this number on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_00|Cases] form (if the ''Time Reporting on Activity'' feature is disabled, this is the only way you can report time spent on a case); in this case, the customer is billed based on the time that you specify.
*If the case is associated with a contract, you can enable case counting in the '''Case Billing Settings''' section ('''Summary''' tab) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CT_20_20_00|Contract Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=CT202000|CT202000]) form. With case counting, you can bill your customer only for the number of cases associated with the contract. The billable hours reported for the case will also be billed.
*You can use direct billing, which means that the customer associated with the case is invoiced directly without any contract involved. To use direct billing, clear the '''Require Contract''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_60_00|Case Classes] form.

For a case whose class has the ''per activity'' billing mode:[anchor|#ul_osr_ql4_jm]
*You can bill the customer for separate activities when the case is not yet closed. This mode may be useful when the case cannot be closed by the end of the billing period, although you need to invoice the customer for the services already rendered.
*The case cannot be marked as billable, and it cannot be released for billing. You can release only related activities from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_70_20|Release Time Activities] ([~/?ScreenId=EP507020|EP507020]) form. See the sections below for more information on billable activities. 
*The case should always be associated with a contract so that related activities can be billed according to the costs defined by this contract.

==Billable Case Activities==
A case is usually billed on the basis of activities that are associated with this case and marked as billable. If there are any tasks or events associated with the case, then the activities related to these tasks and events are billed as activities related to the case.{br}

Activities must be completed and approved (if required) before they can be released. For each billable activity, its owner should register the time spent on it and specify the billable time.
==Case Activity Billing==
Each activity should be assigned to an owner—that is, an employee who will take all necessary actions to complete the activity. You can release a completed and approved (if required) activity for billing in one of the following ways:[anchor|#ul_opd_fv4_jm]
*By releasing a time card on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_50_10|Release Time Cards] ([~/?ScreenId=EP505010|EP505010]) form if the owner of the activity uses time cards.
*By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_70_20|Release Time Activities] ([~/?ScreenId=EP507020|EP507020]) form.
*By releasing the related case if it is billed on a ''per-case'' basis.

When a contract-related case is released for billing, the contract usage data is updated. You can view the resulting data on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CT_30_30_00|Contract Usage] ([~/?ScreenId=CT303000|CT303000]) form. For more information on how contract-related cases are billed, see [HelpRoot_ContractManagement\AR__con_Contract_Billing|Contract Billing].{br}

To view the invoices that were generated during direct billing, use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form. {br}

Also, a project transaction may be created during direct billing if any of the case activities is associated with a project. (Alternatively, the same project transaction may be generated during the release of the time card that includes the case activity, if the time card is released before the case is billed. For details about time card release, see [HelpRoot_Organization\EP__con_Time_Sheet_Processing|Time Cards].) Such project transactions can be used for tracking the project costs. (For more information about project cost tracking, see [HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Budget_GeneralInfo|Managing Project Budget: General Information].){br}

You can also view the data on the resulting customer transactions by using the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\AR_65_20_00|Customer History] ([~/?ScreenId=AR652000|AR652000]) report.

The steps below describe how to create a billable activity associated with a lead record; for other types of records, the procedure is the same other than the form you navigate to in Step 1. 
==Before You Proceed==
The ''Time Reporting on Activity'' feature must be enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form; otherwise, you will not be able to track time spent on an activity and bill the customer based on this time.{br}

You should also make sure that appropriate activity types and earning types are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_10_20_00|Activity Types] ([~/?ScreenId=CR102000|CR102000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_10_20_00|Earning Types] ([~/?ScreenId=EP102000|EP102000]) forms, respectively.{br}

Finally, if you want to associate activities with certain projects and project tasks, make sure that the ''Project Accounting'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form; if the feature is disabled, the system will use the non-project code by default, and you will skip Steps 15 and 16 of the procedure.

In Acumatica ERP, you can release billable cases either one at a time from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_00|Cases] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306000|CR306000]) form or in batches from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_50_70_00|Release Cases] ([~/?ScreenId=CR507000|CR507000]) form.
==Before You Proceed==
Make sure that the case you want to release is marked as billable. A case is billable if the '''Billable''' check box is selected for it on the '''Additional Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_00|Cases] form. Only cases that use the ''Per Case'' billing mode can be marked as billable. Because the billing mode is a setting of the case class, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_60_00|Case Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR206000|CR206000]) form, make sure that the case class of this case has the ''Per Case'' billing mode. (If it does not, you might need to either edit the existing class or create a new class and assign the new class to the case.) For details, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CR__HOW_To_Create_a_Case_Class|To Create a Case Class].{br}

You can release only closed cases, so you should also make sure that the case you want to release has been closed.{br}

Also, all billable activities associated with the case should be assigned the ''Complete'' status (and approved, if approval is required).

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[To Release a Case In  Acumatica ERP, you can release billable cases either one at a time from the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR306000|CR306000]) Cases (CR306000) form or in batches from the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR507000|CR507000]) Release Cases (CR507000) form. Before You Proceed Make sure that the case you want to release is marked as billable. A case is billable                 if the  Billable  check box is selected for it on the                      Additional Info  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR306000|CR306000]) Cases form. Only cases that use the  Per Case  billing mode can be marked as                 billable. Because the billing mode is a setting of the case class, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR206000|CR206000]) Case Classes (CR206000) form, make sure that the case class of                 this case has the  Per Case  billing mode. (If it does not, you might need to                 either edit the existing class or create a new class and assign the new class to the                 case.) For details, see  To Create a Case Class. You can release only closed cases, so you should also make sure that the case you                 want to release has been closed. Also, all billable activities associated with the case should be assigned the                      Complete  status (and approved, if approval is required). To Release an Individual Case Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR306000|CR306000]) Cases (CR3060PL) form.  On an appropriate filter tab, click the case that you want to release. The   ([~/?ScreenId=CR306000|CR306000]) Cases (CR306000) form opens. The form is filled in with the data of the selected case. On the form toolbar, click  Actions Release .

The integration of Acumatica ERP with HubSpot gives you the ability to synchronize data between the two systems. You synchronize data by using integration scenarios. For information on how to prepare these integration scenarios, see [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__mng_Configuring_Import_Scenarios|Configuring Import Scenarios] and [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__mng_Configuring_Export_Scenarios|Configuring Export Scenarios].{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#_03d66f00-8327-439d-bee6-cc5296903032]
*Configure the ''HubSpot Enhanced Provider'' data provider
*Configure the ''HubSpot'' data provider
*Synchronize different entities between the systems
*Configure automation schedules that will run synchronization processes
*Resolve synchronization issues

==Data Providers==
When creating or modifying an integration scenario, you need to specify an appropriate data provider. For the synchronization of data between Acumatica ERP and HubSpot, you can use one of the following built-in data providers: [anchor|#_f45695c8-cb2f-4601-af6e-bb421b26ef30]
*''HubSpot'': This data provider is based on a specific built-in provider type: ''HubSpot Provider''. By using this data provider, you can export leads from Acumatica ERP to HubSpot for nurturing and then import the leads back to Acumatica ERP for further processing.
*:For details about how to configure the ''HubSpot'' data provider, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CR__HOW_To_Configure_HubSpot_Provider|Integration with Hubspot: To Configure the HubSpot Data Provider].
*''HubSpot Enhanced Provider'': This data provider is based on the ''HubSpot Enhanced'' provider type, which supports both the use of the OAuth protocol and the HubSpot API key for authorization in HubSpot. By using this data provider, you can synchronize contacts, leads, business accounts, and marketing lists between the two systems. 
*:For more information about the ''HubSpot Enhanced Provider'' data provider, see [HelpRoot_CRM\config_HubSpot_Enhanced_Provider|Integration with HubSpot: Enhanced HubSpot Data Provider].

==Configuration Flow of Data Synchronization Between Acumatica ERP and HubSpot==
To configure synchronization of data between Acumatica ERP and HubSpot by using the ''HubSpot Enhanced Provider'' data provider, you should do the following:[anchor|#_223fcbbb-50f8-4e37-842f-0b46c2b9f99f]
#Configure the ''HubSpot Enhanced Provider'' data provider on the '''Parameters''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_15|Data Providers] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206015|SM206015]) form so that it connects to HubSpot. For instructions, see [HelpRoot_CRM\config_HubSpot_Implem_Activity_EnhancedProvider|Integration with HubSpot: To Configure the HubSpot Enhanced Data Provider].
#Prepare integration scenarios that use the ''HubSpot Enhanced Provider'' data provider for the entity types whose data need to be synchronized between the systems, and start the synchronization processes.
#:For details, see [HelpRoot_CRM\config_HubSpot_Implem_Activity_Sync_Leads|Integration with HubSpot: To Synchronize Leads], [HelpRoot_CRM\config_HubSpot_Implem_Activity_Sync_Contacts|Integration with HubSpot: To Synchronize Contacts], [HelpRoot_CRM\config_HubSpot_Implem_Activity_Sync_Accounts|Integration with HubSpot: To Synchronize Accounts], and [HelpRoot_CRM\config_HubSpot_Implem_Activity_Sync_Marketing_Lists|Integration with HubSpot: To Synchronize Marketing List].
#Configure automation schedules that will run the needed import and export scenarios at the specified time intervals, as described in [HelpRoot_CRM\config_HubSpot_Implem_Activity_Schedule_Sync|Integration with HubSpot: To Schedule Synchronization Processes].

==HubSpot Integration Limitations==
The solution for the synchronization of data between Acumatica ERP and HubSpot has the following limitations:[anchor|#_bf8b27de-f658-4421-bd9f-62cd14e4b5d2]
*Only one instance of HubSpot may be synchronized with an Acumatica ERP instance.
*If multiple data providers use the ''HubSpot Enhanced'' provider type, an error will occur when a user attempts to use any of them.

The Acumatica ERP and HubSpot systems process data changes differently depending on in which system the changes have been made. In this topic, you will read about the data flow between the Acumatica ERP and HubSpot.
==Data Changes Made in Acumatica ERP==
After you make a change to a record in Acumatica ERP (for example, deleting a contact), Acumatica ERP queries HubSpot via the REST API and checks whether the matching entity in HubSpot has been modified. (The import and export scenarios in Acumatica ERP define the matching rules for records.){br}

If the matching record in HubSpot has not been modified or does not exist, Acumatica ERP updates it or creates a new record in HubSpot. If the matching record has been changed in HubSpot, Acumatica ERP checks which of the systems is the master system and uses the master system&rsquo;s data to update the corresponding record in the other system. The master system is defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\HS_20_50_20|HubSpot Sync] ([~/?ScreenId=HS205020|HS205020]) form.{br}

In the diagram below, you can see the process of synchronizing the data changes that were made in Acumatica ERP with the data in HubSpot. [anchor|#_fece74ba-fa01-4c49-9c11-71a6b537e3c2][anchor|#_04f0722b-cedd-46e4-9410-fbafa11528ec][image:UserGuide/Images/CRM_HubSpot_Acumatica_to_HubSpot_Flow.png|popup|The data flow of changes made in Acumatica ERP|450px]
==Data Changes Made in HubSpot==
After you make a change to a record in HubSpot, the system triggers a webhook notification if the webhook notifications have been configured. (A HubSpot administrator needs to configure webhook notifications for a HubSpot object event in advance.) If the webhook notifications have not been configured, Acumatica ERP can get information on the changes in HubSpot by periodically polling it via REST API. (The polling interval setting is located in the ''HubSpot Enhanced Provider'' data provider settings in Acumatica ERP.){br}

When Acumatica ERP receives a notification about the change, the system checks if any change has been made to the matching record in Acumatica ERP. If no change has been made or no matching record exists, Acumatica ERP updates the record or creates a new one. If the record has been changed in both systems, Acumatica ERP checks which system is the master system and uses the master system data to update the corresponding record in the other system.{br}

In HubSpot, contact objects are used to represents both contacts and leads. If a contact is a lead, it is indicated by the lead status. In Acumatica ERP, there is a separate entity for leads, which can be converted to contacts, opportunities, or accounts.{br}

If you decide to synchronize both Acumatica ERP leads and Acumatica ERP contacts with HubSpot, you to need to correctly specify whether a contact in HubSpot is a lead or a contact in Acumatica ERP in the related integration scenarios. Otherwise, you may end up in a situation in which one contact in HubSpot synchronizes to both a lead and a contact in Acumatica ERP. {br}

The appropriate source restriction and field mapping settings of lead and contact import and export scenarios define whether a HubSpot contact synchronizes to a lead or a contact in Acumatica ERP.
==Example of Integration Scenario Settings==
 Acumatica ERP contains preconfigured integration scenarios to which the ''Lead Status'' custom field has been added. This field can be used to distinguish leads and contacts. If the Lead Status of the record is ''Converted'', the record is a contact. Otherwise it is a lead.{br}

The following settings have been preconfigured for ''HubSpot Enhanced Provider'' data provider:[anchor|#_d14253c9-4537-47dc-ab17-eb7e785132fa]
#On the '''Source Restriction''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) form, for the ''Import Contacts From Hubspot'' import scenario, the following settings have been specified:
#*'''Active''': Selected
#*'''Field Name''': ''Lead Status''
#* '''Condition''': ''Equals''
#* '''Value''': ''CONNECTED''
#:These settings specify that only HubSpot contacts that have the ''Connected'' lead status are imported as contacts.
#For the ''Import Leads From Hubspot'' import scenario, the following settings have been specified:
#*'''Active''': Selected
#*'''Field Name''': ''Lead Status''
#* '''Condition''': ''Does Not Equal''
#* '''Value''': ''CONNECTED''
#:These settings specify that only HubSpot contacts that do not have the ''Connected'' lead status are imported as leads.
#On the '''Source Restriction''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_70_25|Export Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM207025|SM207025]) form, for the ''Export Leads to HubSpot Realtime'' export scenario, the following settings have been specified:
#*'''Active''': Selected
#*'''Source Object''': ''Lead Summary''
#* '''Field Name''': ''Status''
#* '''Condition''': ''Does Not Equal''
#* '''Value''': ''Converted''
#:These settings specify that converted leads are not exported as leads because they are exported as contacts.
#On the '''Mapping''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_70_25|Export Scenarios] form, for the ''Export Contacts to HubSpot Realtime'' export scenario, the following settings have been specified:
#*'''Active''': Selected
#*'''Source Object''': ''Contact Summary''
#* '''Field/Action Name''': ''=&rsquo;CONNECTED&rsquo;''
#* '''Target Field/Value''': ''Lead Status (hs&#95;lead&#95;status)''
#:These settings specify that during the export of contacts from Acumatica ERP, the lead status of the HubSpot contacts is set to ''Connected''.

Similarly, you can configure other integration scenarios that you plan to use for HubSpot integration.]]></column>

Step: Configuring the HubSpot Data Provider On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM206015|SM206015]) Data Providers (SM206015) form, select the                          HubSpot  provider. On the  Parameters  tab, specify the following settings:                          Hapikey : Your HubSpot API key PortalID : Hub ID HubSpotList : The name of the list to be used for synchronization                             between  Acumatica ERP and HubSpot (if no such list exists yet, it will be created                             automatically during the first export or import) On the  Schema  tab, click  Fill Schema                         Objects  and then  Fill Schema                         Fields . You can deactivate some of the HubSpot utility                         fields that you are not going to use in your integration                     scenario.  On the form toolbar, click  Save  to save your                     changes. ]]></column>

*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_25_00|Campaign Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR202500|CR202500])

==Use of Attributes==
For each class, you can define a list of attributes to gather class-specific information about the records that belong to that class.{br}

The [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_00|Cases] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306000|CR306000]), and [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_20_00|Marketing Campaigns] ([~/?ScreenId=CR202000|CR202000]) forms have tabs reserved for attributes. If you select a class when creating a new record, the attributes of that class appear on the respective tab of the entry form.((({S:Hint}To keep classification meaningful, you should always enter proper values for attributes, both for those marked as required and for optional ones.
)))
If you specify values for the attributes of a business account and then convert the business account to a customer or vendor account, the resulting account retains these attributes. If the customer or vendor class to which the resulting account belongs also has attributes specified, these attributes are added to the list of attributes of the resulting account.{br}

You can use attributes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_50_15|Approval Maps] ([~/?ScreenId=EP205015|EP205015]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_50_10|Assignment Maps] ([~/?ScreenId=EP205010|EP205010]) forms to specify the criteria for assigning records to the appropriate owners.{br}

For more information about the use of attributes in Acumatica ERP, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Attributes|Attributes].
==Example of Lead Classes and Attributes==
Consider an example that uses classes and attributes for leads. ((({S:Hint}Attributes and classes are used similarly for leads, contacts, opportunities, business accounts, cases, and marketing campaigns.
)))
Imagine that you sell two products, one for resale by retailers and the other for direct corporate use. You handle many leads and would like to divide them into groups based on whether they are related to a retail store or to a corporation. You can create two classes for these leads: [anchor|#_2e586e63-b4a3-4346-8f0c-80098ecb69e4]
*One class, called ''Retail'', for leads associated with retail stores of various sizes: This class might contain an attribute called '''Size''' with the values ''Small'', ''Midsize'', and ''Big'' corresponding to the store size, as well as other attributes to give you additional information about these stores.
*Another class, called ''Corporate'', for leads associated with organizations that are final consumers: Because some organizations may be tax-exempt, you might define an attribute called '''Tax Status''' with two possible values, ''Tax-exempt'' and ''Taxable''. Another attribute, '''Company Type''', might have such values as ''Corporation'', ''Hospital'', ''University'', and ''School''.

When you enter a new lead on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form, you should select a lead class on the '''CRM Info''' tab. Once the class is selected, its attributes appear on the '''Attributes''' tab. After that you can enter specific attribute values for the lead.

 Acumatica ERP gives you the ability to distribute the workload among employees. You can use assignment maps to assign records, such as leads or cases, to the appropriate users. This topic describes the general rules that you can follow when creating assignment maps.{br}

In Acumatica ERP, it&rsquo;s easy to base assignment rules on company policies because records can be distributed among workgroups or individual employees in an almost unlimited number of ways, based on the properties and attributes of the records being distributed. For example, leads can be distributed by location: leads with postal codes starting with ''94'' can go to Workgroup 1, leads with postal codes starting with ''95'' can go to Workgroup 2, and so on. As another example, distribution of cases based on geographical territories can be determined by phone area codes. Records can also be distributed alphabetically or by another condition, or they can be distributed by multiple criteria, based on the values of properties and attributes of the record. {br}

You create the maps for automatic assignment of records by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_50_10|Assignment Maps] ([~/?ScreenId=EP205010|EP205010]) form. If you want to use workgroups in an assignment map, before you start creating the map, make sure that all workgroups involved in the processing of the records are represented on the company tree. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_40_61|Company Tree] ([~/?ScreenId=EP204061|EP204061]) form, you can add the required workgroups and specify their members and default owners. For more information on the company tree, see [HelpRoot_Organization\EP__con_Company_Organizational_Chart|Company Tree and Workgroups]. {br}{TOC}
==Assignment Rules==
An assignment map may include any number of rules, which are executed sequentially. A rule in an assignment map includes conditions and actions to be performed if the conditions are met.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_50_10|Assignment Maps] form, in the '''Rules''' pane, you create a list of rules. For each rule, you specify conditions for executing the rule. If a condition or rule is no longer required in an assignment map, you can temporarily deactivate it by clearing the '''Active''' check box in the settings of that condition or rule on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_50_10|Assignment Maps] form. A deactivated rule is marked with the '''(Inactive)''' prefix in the '''Rules''' pane.
==Assignment Conditions==
To use record properties and attributes in assignment conditions on the '''Conditions'''tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_50_10|Assignment Maps] form, you should first select the types of records.{br}

Conditions, which are specified for each rule, are based on the values of the properties and attributes of the records. The properties are specified on the data entry form used to create the record. For the classes that are used to group the records, particular attributes can be configured; users can specify the attribute values for the individual records (such as leads) on the data entry form used to create the records.{br}

If your company&rsquo;s policies require that all records of a particular type (such as cases) should be distributed, then before you start creating an assignment map, you should draw a diagram for your conditions to ensure that they are complete. Consider the previous example of assignment rules based on the first two digits of the postal code: If you expect most leads to have postal codes starting with ''94'' and ''95'', do not forget to add a rule for distributing leads whose postal codes start with numbers other than ''94'' or ''95''. {br}

Rules should divide records of a particular type into non-intersecting sets. If rules allowed the same records to be assigned to two or more groups, all assignments would be performed in the workgroup or individual employee that is mentioned higher in the list of rules, and the records would never reach the second workgroup or employee. 
==Rule Application==
Once the assignment maps are created, you can select the default maps for cases, leads, contacts, business accounts, and opportunities by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_10_10_00|Customer Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CR101000|CR101000]) form. These maps are used during the mass assignment processes that you can perform through the following forms:[anchor|#ul_jqc_hgw_q3]
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_50_30_10|Assign Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR503010|CR503010])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_50_30_11|Assign Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR503011|CR503011])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_50_33_10|Assign Business Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR503310|CR503310])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_50_31_10|Assign Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR503110|CR503110])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_50_32_10|Assign Cases] ([~/?ScreenId=CR503210|CR503210])

Once a record is assigned to a workgroup, the default owner of the group is assigned as the owner of the item. If no owner is specified for the group, the record is considered to be assigned to the workgroup. Members of the same workgroup can view records assigned to the group or to an employee from the group.{br}

You can change the owner of the record manually by using the entry form for that record.
