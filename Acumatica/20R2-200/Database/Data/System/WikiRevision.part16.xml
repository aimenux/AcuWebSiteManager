These are the steps required to configure and implement the Advanced Management Edition modules. The manufacturing modules are integrated with the distribution, finances, and CRM modules. For example:
*Sales Orders create demand for and consume production.
*Purchase Orders provide supply to production.
*Inventory items are used to define the bills of materials for the products produced. Production orders consume and produce inventory.
*Inventory items are used in estimates and the product configurator.
*Estimates and product configurations can be used in CRM opportunities, sales quotes, sales orders, and production orders.

Production transactions generate financial transactions indirectly through the Inventory module or directly in production management.{br}

Before you start implementing the manufacturing functionality in Acumatica ERP, you need to prepare the system—that is, specify the general settings that will be used by particular manufacturing processes—as described in this topic.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Enable the needed set of features before you start implementing manufacturing
*Specify the required settings to prepare the system for implementing manufacturing
*Create stock items involved in manufacturing

==Applicable Scenarios==
You configure general settings for manufacturing in either or bothof the following cases:[anchor|#_7165d0ed-fbf9-4bca-b563-a0155c7a9310]
*When you are initially implementing Acumatica ERP and the ''Manufacturing'' feature is included in your license
*When you have purchased the ''Manufacturing'' feature, and you need to configure manufacturing in the existing Acumatica ERP system

==Prerequisites==
Before you start preparing the system to implementing manufacturing, you should make sure that the following criteria have been met:[anchor|#_65d9b147-f854-4845-907e-53bd3383928d]
#The general ledger functionality has been configured, as described in [HelpRoot_Implement\config_GL_Generalinfo|General Ledger: General Information].
#Order and inventory management functionality have been configured. For details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\config_InvMgmt_Basic_Implem_Activity|Order Management with Inventory Configuration: Implementation Activity].
#For integration with projects, the project management functionality has been configured, as described in [HelpRoot_Projects\config_Project_Basic_GeneralInfo|Project Basic Configuration: General Information].

==System Preparation for Manufacturing Implementation==
To implement the general configuration of manufacturing in Acumatica ERP, you perform the following steps:[anchor|#_abf24b25-ed60-4500-b22c-18208a979188]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you make sure that the ''Manufacturing'' feature and all nested features that you will use in your system are enabled.
#:((({S:Warn}In a production environment, after the features are enabled, you have to activate the Acumatica ERP license by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_15_10|Activate License] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201510|SM201510]) form. Each particular feature may be subject to additional licensing; please consult the Acumatica ERP sales policy for details.
)))
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_10_10|Numbering Sequences] ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) form, you create the numbering sequences for manufacturing batches and entities.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) form, you specify the number of decimal places for quantities and for prices and costs.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_20_25_00|Chart of Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=GL202500|GL202500]) form, you create the GL accounts to be used in manufacturing processes.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) form, you create the posting classes to be used for the inventory items involved in manufacturing.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_15_00|Availability Calculation Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201500|IN201500]) form, you specify the availability calculation rules for the stock items to be involved in manufacturing.
#If the ''Inventory Replenishment'' feature (in the ''Inventory and Order Management'' group of features) is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_88_00|Replenishment Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208800|IN208800]) form, you create replenishment classes for items to be manufactured and purchased. If the feature is disabled, you specify replenishment settings for item classes, stock items, or both.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form, you define the warehouses and locations that will be involved in manufacturing.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form, you create the item classes that will provide the default settings for the stock items involved in manufacturing.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, you create the stock items to be used in manufacturing.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form, for items involved in manufacturing that can be stored in multiple warehouses, you specify the item settings that are specific to a particular warehouse.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form, you specify the needed setting for employees that will be involved in production.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form, you configure the sales order types that will be used in production management.

==Posting Settings==
A variety of GL accounts must be created in the system on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_20_25_00|Chart of Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=GL202500|GL202500]) form and then specified on the forms that provide posting settings for transactions related to manufacturing processes. You need to create specific GL accounts and specify them in the system as follows:[anchor|#_aad30699-0ead-43d1-a823-1eaf0c912ee7]
*You need to create the Work in Progress (WIP) account and the WIP Variance account, which are required for users to create production orders. The accounts should then be specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) form for the posting class; if posting classes are not used, the accounts should be specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_10_20_00|Production Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AM102000|AM102000]) form. For more information about posting classes, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Posting_Classes_GeneralInfo|Posting Classes: General Information].
*You need to create a specific Labor account for labor expenses to be reported. Then you create a labor code by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_65_00|Labor Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AM206500|AM206500]) form and specify the corresponding account in the settings of this code. Labor codes are required when you create work centers on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_70_00|Work Centers] ([~/?ScreenId=AM207000|AM207000]) form. If indirect time will be reported according to the manufacturing processes of your organization, you can also create a GL account for indirect labor expense or you can use the same account as you use for direct labor. If you create a separate GL account for indirect labor expense, you also need to create a separate labor code.
*If overhead, tooling, machine, or scrap costs are to be charged to production orders then you need to create a separate expense account to track each of these types of costs. The forms where you cpesify these accounts are the following:
**[HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_25_00|Overhead] ([~/?ScreenId=AM202500|AM202500]): On this form, you specify the overhead GL account for each overhead.
**[HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_45_00|Machines] ([~/?ScreenId=AM204500|AM204500]): On this form, you specify a GL account used for machine costs.
**[HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_55_00|Tools] ([~/?ScreenId=AM205500|AM205500]): On this form, you specify a GL account used for tool costs.
**[HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_21_10_00|Reason Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS211000|CS211000]): On this form, you create a reason code specifically for scrap and specify the GL account that will be used for scrap costs.

==Warehouse Settings==
You need to define each warehouse and its locations where the stock items involved in manufacturing will be stored by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form. You may use an existing warehouse or create a separate one.{br}

You define a warehouse involved in manufacturing as follows:[anchor|#_1d98962d-5fcf-4650-9338-8d4c1b19cd7f]
#On the '''Location Table''' tab, you define the locations that will be involved in manufacturing as follows:
#*For each warehouse location that is used for planning purposes within material requirements planning (MRP), you select the '''MRP''' check box.
#*For each location used for storing materials, you select the '''Sales Allowed''' and '''Assembly Allowed''' check boxes to indicate that this location can be used to issue items to production orders.
#*For each location used for storing manufactured items, you select the '''Receipts Allowed''' and '''Assembly Allowed''' check boxes to indicate that this location can be used to receive items from production orders.
#On the '''GL Accounts''' tab, you specify the '''Work in Progress''' and '''WIP Variance''' accounts.
#In the '''General''' section of the '''Manufacturing''' tab, you select check boxes for the entities or documents to indicate which supply and demand are considered for this warehouse during material requirements planning. We recommend that all check boxes be selected in a production system.

For more information about warehouses and warehouse locations, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Warehouses_GeneralInfo|Warehouses: General Information] and [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Warehouse_Locations_GeneralInfo|Warehouse Locations and Single-Step Transfers: General Information].
==Availability Calculation Settings==
For each item to be added to manufacturing transactions, you need to specify whether it will be available for issuing. For this purpose, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_15_00|Availability Calculation Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201500|IN201500]) form, you create or modify an availability calculation rule, in which you also select or clear check boxes for plan types related to manufacturing. You can include or deduct the quantities of items added to production orders in the available quantities of items.{br}

For details about availability calculation, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Availability_Calculation_Rules_GeneralInfo|Availability Calculation Rules: General Information].
==Replenishment Settings==
To indicate that a stock item is manufactured and must be included in material requirements planning, you specify replenishment settings as follows:[anchor|#_f541be44-647a-401c-8d65-d22e2e850579]
*If you use the replenishment functionality in Acumatica ERP—that is, the ''Inventory Replenishment'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form—on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_88_00|Replenishment Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208800|IN208800]) form, you create two replenishment classes: one with a source of ''Purchase'' and another for a source of ''Manufacturing'', because these are the two key source types material requirements planning will use. Then you will specify the appropriate replenishment class, which depends on whether the item will be manufactured or purchased, in the replenishment settings of particular item classes, items, or both.
*If the ''Inventory Replenishment'' feature is disabled, you select the needed replenishment source in the '''Replenishment Source''' box of the '''General Settings''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) for the item class or in the '''Source''' box on the '''Manufacturing''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form for the item.

==Settings of Items Involved in Manufacturing==
Items involved in manufacturing can be purchased (these items are usually components used in the production process) or manufactured (these items are usually the finished goods to be sold to customers). To provide default settings for groups of similar items, you create item classes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form. For each item class, you specify the following settings:[anchor|#_22536e35-0318-453c-82d8-8fece5eea892]
*The posting class with the Work in Progress and WIP Variance GL accounts specified
*The default warehouse where the items of the class will be stored
*The availability calculation rule, which provides information for calculating the availability of items involved in manufacturing
*Replenishment settings that indicate if items of the class will be produced or purchased

For more information about item classes, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Item_Classes_GeneralInfo|Item Classes for Stock Items: General Information].{br}

Then on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, you create stock items; this process unfolds somewhat differently depending on whether the item is manufactured or purchased. For items being manufactured, you perform the following general steps:[anchor|#_c3777d49-4b53-4072-9c9a-0239a3dc85ad]
#You select an item class that was created for items being manufactured.
#If the ''Inventory Replenishment'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, on the '''Replenishment Info''' tab, you make sure that a replenishment class with the ''Manufacturing'' replenishment source has been added, and you specify the value of the '''Safety Stock''' box. This will set a certain level of inventory in the system to be planned for within material requirements planning.
#If the ''Inventory Replenishment'' feature is disabled, in the '''Replenishments''' section of the '''Manufacturing''' tab, you make sure that the ''Manufacturing'' replenishment source is specified, and you add the value in the '''Safety Stock''' box.
#In the '''General''' and '''Scheduling''' sections of the '''Manufacturing''' tab, you specify the needed settings.

For items being purchased, you perform the following general steps:[anchor|#_70624eba-4174-491c-a939-08904ec076c7]
#You select an item class that was created for items being purchased.
#On the '''Vendor Details''' tab, you specify the vendors from which the item will be purchased and make sure that the lead time is specified. The specification of the lead time is important so that during the material requirements planning process, personnel can consider this time when planning the supply.
#On the '''Warehouse Details''' tab, you make sure that at least one warehouse is specified.
#On the '''Price/Cost Info''' tab, specify the cost as follows, depending on the valuation method: For items with the ''Standard'' method, specify the cost in the '''Pending Cost''' box; for items with all other methods, specify the cost in the '''Last Cost''' box.
#If the ''Inventory Replenishment'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form, on the '''Replenishment Info''' tab, you make sure that a replenishment class with the ''Purchase'' replenishment source has been added.
#If the ''Inventory Replenishment'' feature is disabled, in the '''Replenishments''' section of the '''Manufacturing''' tab, you make sure that the ''Purchase'' replenishment source is specified.
#In the '''General''' and '''Scheduling''' sections of the '''Manufacturing''' tab, you specify the needed settings.

For each item that has warehouse-specific settings, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form, you also need to do the following:[anchor|#_68f0a291-e151-4d27-bb58-4d50d6ce528b]
#You make sure that warehouse locations are specified in the '''Default Receipt To''' and '''Default Issue From''' boxes, to make data entry easier for users.
#If an item cost depends on the warehouse where the item is stored, on the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab, you enter a warehouse-specific cost for the item.
#If the ''Inventory Replenishment'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form, on the '''Replenishment Info''' tab, you make sure that the replenishment class and the replenishment source are specified correctly.
#If the ''Inventory Replenishment'' feature is disabled, in the '''Replenishments''' section of the '''Manufacturing''' tab, you make sure that the needed replenishment source is specified in the '''Source''' box.

==Settings of Employees Involved in Manufacturing==
To record the labor expenses for employees involved in manufacturing, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form, you select the '''Production Employee''' check box on the '''General Info''' tab.{br}

If you want to post labor transactions by using the employee cost, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_99_00|Labor Cost Rates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209900|PM209900]) form, you create the needed cost rates and then specify a cost rate for each employee involved in manufacturing.
==Settings of Sales Documents==
If the business process of your organization involves users creating production orders directly from sales orders, you must configure this functionality for each order type you use as follows: On the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form, you select either or both of the following check boxes: '''Allow Production Orders - Approve''' (which provides users with the ability to create production orders that have the ''Approved'' status from sales orders) and '''Allow Production Orders - Hold''' (which provides users with the ability to create production orders that have the ''On Hold'' status from sales orders) .{br}

Order types that typically used to create production orders are ''SO'' (a regular sales order), ''TR'' (a transfer order), and ''QT'' (a quote). For quotes, you can also select the '''Allow Estimating''' check box to allow estimate entries. ((({S:Warn}We do not recommend that you select this check box for other order types because estimates may include non-inventory items that cannot be shipped or issued.

Order and inventory management functionality have been configured. For details, see  Order Management with Inventory Configuration: Implementation Activity. For integration with projects, the project management functionality has been configured, as           described in  Project Basic Configuration: General Information. System Preparation for Manufacturing Implementation To implement the general configuration of manufacturing in  Acumatica ERP, you perform the following steps: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, you make sure that the              Manufacturing  feature and all nested features that you will use in your system           are enabled. In a production environment, after the features are enabled, you have to             activate the  Acumatica ERP license by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201510|SM201510]) Activate License (SM201510) form.             Each particular feature may be subject to additional licensing; please consult the  Acumatica ERP sales policy for details. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) Numbering Sequences (CS201010) form, you create the           numbering sequences for manufacturing batches and entities. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) Companies (CS101500) form, you specify the           number of decimal places for quantities and for prices and costs. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL202500|GL202500]) Chart of Accounts (GL202500) form, you create the GL           accounts to be used in manufacturing processes. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) Posting Classes (IN206000) form, you create the           posting classes to be used for the inventory items involved in manufacturing. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201500|IN201500]) Availability Calculation Rules (IN201500) form, you specify the availability           calculation rules for the stock items to be involved in manufacturing. If the  Inventory Replenishment  feature (in the  Inventory and Order             Management  group of features) is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features           form, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN208800|IN208800]) Replenishment Classes (IN208800) form, you create           replenishment classes for items to be manufactured and purchased. If the feature is           disabled, you specify replenishment settings for item classes, stock items, or both. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses (IN204000) form, you define the           warehouses and locations that will be involved in manufacturing. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000) form, you create the item           classes that will provide the default settings for the stock items involved in           manufacturing. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form, you create the           stock items to be used in manufacturing. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details (IN204500) form, for items involved           in manufacturing that can be stored in multiple warehouses, you specify the item settings           that are specific to a particular warehouse. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) Employees (EP203000) form, you specify the           needed setting for employees that will be involved in production. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form, you configure the           sales order types that will be used in production management. Posting Settings A variety of GL accounts must be created in the system on the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL202500|GL202500]) Chart of Accounts (GL202500) form and then specified on the forms         that provide posting settings for transactions related to manufacturing processes. You need         to create specific GL accounts and specify them in the system as follows: You need to create the Work in Progress (WIP) account and the WIP Variance account,           which are required for users to create production orders. The accounts should then be           specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) Posting Classes (IN206000) form for the           posting class; if posting classes are not used, the accounts should be specified on the               ([~/?ScreenId=AM102000|AM102000]) Production Preferences (AM102000) form. For more information about posting           classes, see  Posting Classes: General Information. You need to create a specific Labor account for labor expenses to be reported. Then you           create a labor code by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM206500|AM206500]) Labor Codes (AM206500) form and           specify the corresponding account in the settings of this code. Labor codes are required           when you create work centers on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM207000|AM207000]) Work Centers (AM207000) form. If           indirect time will be reported according to the manufacturing processes of your           organization, you can also create a GL account for indirect labor expense or you can use           the same account as you use for direct labor. If you create a separate GL account for           indirect labor expense, you also need to create a separate labor code. If overhead, tooling, machine, or scrap costs are to be charged to production orders           then you need to create a separate expense account to track each of these types of costs.           The forms where you cpesify these accounts are the following:  ([~/?ScreenId=AM202500|AM202500]) Overhead (AM202500): On this form, you specify the overhead               GL account for each overhead.  ([~/?ScreenId=AM204500|AM204500]) Machines (AM204500): On this form, you specify a GL account               used for machine costs.  ([~/?ScreenId=AM205500|AM205500]) Tools (AM205500): On this form, you specify a GL account               used for tool costs.  ([~/?ScreenId=CS211000|CS211000]) Reason Codes (CS211000): On this form, you create a reason code               specifically for scrap and specify the GL account that will be used for scrap               costs. Warehouse Settings You need to define each warehouse and its locations where the stock items involved in         manufacturing will be stored by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses         (IN204000) form. You may use an existing warehouse or create a separate one. You define a warehouse involved in manufacturing as follows: On the  Location Table  tab, you define the locations that will be           involved in manufacturing as follows: For each warehouse location that is used for planning purposes within material               requirements planning (MRP), you select the  MRP  check box. For each location used for storing materials, you select the  Sales                 Allowed  and                  Assembly                 Allowed  check boxes to indicate that this location               can be used to issue items to production orders. For each location used for storing manufactured items, you select the                  Receipts Allowed  and                  Assembly                 Allowed  check boxes to indicate that this location               can be used to receive items from production orders. On the  GL Accounts  tab, you specify the  Work in             Progress  and  WIP Variance  accounts. In the  General  section of the              Manufacturing  tab, you select check boxes for the entities or           documents to indicate which supply and demand are considered for this warehouse during           material requirements planning. We recommend that all check boxes be selected in a           production system. For more information about warehouses and warehouse locations, see  Warehouses: General Information and  Warehouse Locations and Single-Step Transfers: General Information. Availability Calculation Settings For each item to be added to manufacturing transactions, you need to specify whether it         will be available for issuing. For this purpose, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201500|IN201500]) Availability Calculation Rules         (IN201500) form, you create or modify an availability calculation rule, in which you also         select or clear check boxes for plan types related to manufacturing. You can include or         deduct the quantities of items added to production orders in the available quantities of         items. For details about availability calculation, see  Availability Calculation Rules: General Information. Replenishment Settings To indicate that a stock item is manufactured and must be included in material requirements         planning, you specify replenishment settings as follows: If you use the replenishment functionality in  Acumatica ERP—that is, the  Inventory Replenishment  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form—on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN208800|IN208800]) Replenishment Classes (IN208800) form, you create two replenishment           classes: one with a source of  Purchase  and another for a source of              Manufacturing , because these are the two key source types material requirements           planning will use. Then you will specify the appropriate replenishment class, which           depends on whether the item will be manufactured or purchased, in the replenishment           settings of particular item classes, items, or both. If the  Inventory Replenishment  feature is disabled, you select the needed           replenishment source in the  Replenishment Source  box of the              General Settings  tab on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000) for the item class or in the              Source  box on the  Manufacturing  tab of the               ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form for the            item . Settings of Items Involved in Manufacturing Items involved in manufacturing can be purchased (these items are usually components used         in the production process) or manufactured (these items are usually the finished goods to be         sold to customers). To provide default settings for groups of similar items, you create item         classes on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000) form. For each item         class, you specify the following settings: The posting class with the Work in Progress and WIP Variance GL accounts specified The default warehouse where the items of the class will be stored The availability calculation rule, which provides information for calculating the           availability of items involved in manufacturing Replenishment settings that indicate if items of the class will be produced or           purchased For more information about item classes, see  Item Classes for Stock Items: General Information. Then on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form, you create stock         items; this process unfolds somewhat differently depending on whether the item is         manufactured or purchased. For items being manufactured, you perform the following general         steps: You select an item class that was created for items being manufactured. If the  Inventory Replenishment  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, on the  Replenishment             Info  tab, you make sure that a replenishment class with the              Manufacturing  replenishment source has been added, and you specify the value of           the  Safety Stock  box. This will set a certain level of inventory in           the system to be planned for within material requirements planning. If the  Inventory Replenishment  feature is disabled, in the              Replenishments  section of the              Manufacturing  tab, you make sure that the  Manufacturing            replenishment source is specified, and you add the value in the  Safety             Stock  box. In the  General  and  Scheduling  sections of           the  Manufacturing  tab, you specify the needed settings. For items being purchased, you perform the following general steps: You select an item class that was created for items being purchased. On the  Vendor Details  tab, you specify the vendors from which the           item will be purchased and make sure that the lead time is specified. The specification of           the lead time is important so that during the material requirements planning process,           personnel can consider this time when planning the supply. On the  Warehouse Details  tab, you make sure that at least one           warehouse is specified. On the  Price/Cost Info  tab, specify the cost as follows,           depending on the valuation method: For items with the  Standard  method, specify the           cost in the  Pending Cost  box; for items with all other methods,           specify the cost in the  Last Cost  box. If the  Inventory Replenishment  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features form, on the  Replenishment Info  tab,           you make sure that a replenishment class with the  Purchase  replenishment source has           been added. If the  Inventory Replenishment  feature is disabled, in the              Replenishments  section of the              Manufacturing  tab, you make sure that the  Purchase            replenishment source is specified. In the  General  and  Scheduling  sections of           the  Manufacturing  tab, you specify the needed settings. For each item that has warehouse-specific settings, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details (IN204500) form, you also need to do the         following: You make sure that warehouse locations are specified in the  Default Receipt             To  and  Default Issue From  boxes, to make data entry           easier for users. If an item cost depends on the warehouse where the item is stored, on the              Price/Cost Information  tab, you enter a warehouse-specific cost           for the item. If the  Inventory Replenishment  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features form, on the  Replenishment Info  tab,           you make sure that the replenishment class and the replenishment source are specified           correctly. If the  Inventory Replenishment  feature is disabled, in the              Replenishments  section of the              Manufacturing  tab, you make sure that the needed replenishment           source is specified in the  Source  box. Settings of Employees Involved in Manufacturing To record the labor expenses for employees involved in manufacturing, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) Employees (EP203000) form, you select the            Production Employee  check box on the  General           Info  tab. If you want to post labor transactions by using the employee cost, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM209900|PM209900]) Labor Cost Rates (PM209900) form, you create the needed cost rates and then         specify a cost rate for each employee involved in manufacturing. Settings of Sales Documents If the business process of your organization involves users creating production orders         directly from sales orders, you must configure this functionality for each order type you         use as follows: On the  General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form, you select either or both of the         following check boxes:  Allow Production Orders - Approve  (which         provides users with the ability to create production orders that have the  Approved          status from sales orders) and  Allow Production Orders - Hold  (which         provides users with the ability to create production orders that have the  On Hold          status from sales orders) . Order types that typically used to create production orders are  SO  (a regular sales         order),  TR  (a transfer order), and  QT  (a quote). For quotes, you can also         select the  Allow Estimating  check box to allow estimate          entries .  We do not recommend that you select this check box for other order         types because estimates may include non-inventory items that cannot be shipped or         issued. ]]></column>

)))
==Story==
Suppose that based on requests from customers, SweetLife Fruit & Jams has decided to assemble customized juicers. The company has organized a work center where workers assemble juicers from parts bought from the Sqeezo Inc. vendor.{br}

As an implementation manager, you need to prepare the system for the specification of manufacturing-specific settings.
==Process Overview==
In this activity, to prepare the system for the implementation of manufacturing functionality, you will do the following:[anchor|#_4627635a-8297-4447-bdf7-c85e8e5095f2]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_10_10|Numbering Sequences] ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) form, you will make sure that the numbering sequences for manufacturing batches and entities have been created.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_20_25_00|Chart of Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=GL202500|GL202500]) form, you will make sure that the GL accounts required for manufacturing processes have been created.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) form, you will make sure that a posting class that will provide posting settings to the items involved in manufacturing has been created.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form, you will make sure that the warehouse and locations to be involved in manufacturing have been created and defined properly.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_15_00|Availability Calculation Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201500|IN201500]) form, you will make sure that the availability calculation rule that will be used for calculating availability of items involved in manufacturing has been created.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_88_00|Replenishment Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208800|IN208800]) form, you will make sure that the replenishment class for items being manufactured has been created.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form, you will make sure that the item classes that will provide default settings for items involved in manufacturing have been created and defined properly.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, you will create a stock item for a juicer, which will be assembled.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, you will create a stock item for a juicer part, which will be purchased.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form, you will specify the appropriate setting for an employee that will be involved in manufacturing.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form, you will review the settings of the SO order type and configure the ''TR'' and ''QT'' order types, which will be involved in the manufacturing processes.

==System Preparation==
Before you start specifying the general settings to prepare the system for manufacturing implementation, you perform the following instructions:[anchor|#_66136f24-26b7-403f-a132-a6e8362839fa]
#Sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded; you need to sign in as a system administrator with the ''gibbs'' username and ''123'' password.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, enable the following features:
#*''Manufacturing''
#* ''Material Requirements Planning''
#* ''Product Configurator''
#* ''Estimating''
#* ''Advanced Planning and Scheduling''
#* ''Engineering Change Control''
#* ''Manufacturing Data Collection''

==Step 1: Reviewing Numbering Sequences==
In a production system, you would need to create all of the numbering sequences that will be used in the system for manufacturing batches and entity identifiers. These numbering sequences have been defined in the U100 dataset for simplicity; you will verify that they have been created and review the settings of one of the numbering sequences. Do the following:[anchor|#_fa742785-635f-4638-890f-918dff014a89]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_10_10|Numbering Sequences] ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) form.
#In the '''Numbering ID''' box of the Summary area, click the selector button.
#In the lookup table that opens, make sure that the following predefined numbering sequences exist in the list:
#*''AMBATCH''
#* ''AMBOM''
#* ''AMCOST''
#* ''AMDIS''
#* ''AMECO''
#* ''AMECR''
#* ''AMEST''
#* ''AMFCST''
#* ''AMMATL''
#* ''AMMPS''
#* ''AMPROD''
#* ''AMWIP''
#* ''AMVSHIP''
#Select ''AMBOM'' (which is the numbering sequence created for numbering bills of material), and review its settings as follows:
##In the Summary area, the '''Manual Numbering''' check box is cleared, which means that bills of material will be numbered automatically.
##The value in the '''Start Number''' column of the only row is ''BOM000001'', which is the number of the first bill of material.

These numbering sequences will be specified on the appropriate forms so that they can be used during the manufacturing processes.
==Step 2: Reviewing the GL Accounts==
In a production system, you would need to create the GL accounts that will be used in manufacturing; these accounts have been predefined in the ''U100'' dataset for simplicity. In this step, you will verify that these accounts have been created. Do the following:[anchor|#_157bbfb8-a804-4c3c-b8df-06b8f140a5bc]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_20_25_00|Chart of Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=GL202500|GL202500]) form.
#Make sure that the following accounts are listed in the table:
#*''12400 - Work in Progress''
#* ''51000 - Accrued COGS - Direct Labor Costs''
#* ''51050 - Accrued COGS - Fixed Overhead Costs''
#* ''51060 - Accrued COGS - Fixed Machine Costs''
#* ''51070 - Accrued COGS - Fixed Tool Costs''
#* ''51100 - Accrued COGS - Indirect Labor Costs''
#* ''51150 - Accrued COGS - Variable Overhead Costs''
#* ''51500 - COGS - WIP Inventory Variance''
#* ''51600 - COGS - Scrap Expense''

These accounts will be specified on the appropriate forms so that they can be used during the manufacturing processes.
==Step 3: Reviewing a Posting Class==
In a production system, you would need to create the posting class that will be used in manufacturing. This posting class has been predefined in the ''U100'' dataset for simplicity. In this step, you will verify that this posting class has been created as follows:[anchor|#_9dcdc588-da5d-4559-bf7d-06a1db8dafc4]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) form.
#In the '''Class ID''' box of the Summary area, select ''MFGI''.
#On the '''Posting Settings''' tab, make sure that ''Inventory Item'' is selected in the '''Use WIP Account From''' and '''Use WIP Variance Account From''' boxes. This means that the system will copy these accounts from the inventory item that is involved in a transaction, and the accounts can be changed on the item level if necessary.
#On the '''GL Accounts''' tab, make sure that in the '''Work in Progress''' account box, ''12400 - Work in Progress'' is selected.
#In the '''WIP Variance Account''' box, make sure that ''51500 - COGS - WIP Inventory Variance'' is selected.

==Step 4: Reviewing Warehouse and Location Settings==
In a production system, you would need to create a warehouse and its locations that will be dedicated to manufacturing or specify manufacturing-related settings for an existing warehouse and its locations. In the ''U100'' dataset, a separate warehouse has been created and all required settings have been specified. In this step, you will review the settings for this predefined warehouse and its locations. Do the following:[anchor|#_8e2a7358-b2c6-44fb-898c-1bf0503de722]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form.
#In the '''Warehouse ID''' box of the Summary area, select ''WORKHOUSE''.
#In the '''Branch''' box, make sure that ''SWEETEQUIP'' is selected.
#On the '''Location Table''' tab, do the following:
##In the '''MRP''' column, make sure that the check box is selected for each location.
##In the row with the ''MTL'' location (which will be used for storing materials), make sure that the following check boxes are selected:
##*'''Include in Qty Available'''
##* '''Sales Allowed'''
##* '''Transfers Allowed'''
##:((({S:Warn}The '''Assembly Allowed''' check box, which must be selected for locations involved in production, is not displayed because the ''Kit Assembly'' feature is disabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form for the U100 dataset. This check box is selected by default.
)))
##In the row with the ''MG'' location (which will be used for storing manufactured items), make sure that the following check boxes are selected:
##*'''Include in Qty Available'''
##* '''Receipts Allowed'''
##* '''Transfers Allowed'''
#:((({S:Warn}The '''Assembly Allowed''' check box, which must be selected for locations involved in production, is not displayed because the ''Kit Assembly'' feature is disabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form for the U100 dataset. This check box is selected by default.
)))
#On the '''GL Accounts''' tab, do the following: 
##Make sure that in the '''Work in Progress''' account box, the ''12400 - Work in Progress'' account is selected.
##In the '''WIP Variance Account''' box, make sure that the ''51500 - COGS - WIP Inventory Variance'' account is selected.
#On the '''Manufacturing''' tab, make sure that all check boxes are selected in the '''General''' section.
#In the '''Warehouse ID''' box of the Summary area, select ''EQUIPHOUSE'' (this location is not involved in manufacturing).
#On the '''Location Table''' tab, make sure that the check box in the '''MRP''' column is cleared for all rows.
#On the '''Manufacturing''' tab, make sure that all check boxes are cleared in the '''General''' section.
#:The ''WHOLESALE'' and ''RETAIL'' warehouses have similar settings to those specified for ''EQUIPHOUSE'', because they too are not involved in manufacturing.

==Step 5: Reviewing Availability Calculation Rules==
In a production system, you would need to create an availability calculation rule that will include additional settings related to documents used in manufacturing processes. This availability calculation rule has been predefined in the ''U100'' dataset for simplicity. In this step, you will review settings of the rule. Do the following:[anchor|#_c3d5be39-b896-4d05-a50b-7d01dd6a02bf]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_15_00|Availability Calculation Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201500|IN201500]) form.
#In the '''Availability Calculation Rule''' box, select ''MFGITEMS''.
#Make sure that the following check boxes are selected:
#*'''Deduct Qty. on Issues'''
#* '''Deduct Qty. on Sales Prepared'''
#* '''Deduct Qty. Shipped'''
#* '''Deduct Qty. Allocated'''
#* '''Deduct Qty. on Production Demand Prepared'''
#* '''Deduct Qty. on Production Demand'''
#* '''Deduct Qty. on Production Allocated'''
#* '''Include Qty. on Receipts'''
#* '''Include Qty. on PO Receipts'''
#:With these settings, the quantities of items that are issued, shipped, allocated to sales orders, and allocated to production orders will be deducted from the available quantity; the quantities of items that are included in inventory and PO receipts will be added to the available quantity.

==Step 6: Reviewing Replenishment Classes==
If in a production system the ''Inventory Replenishment'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you would need to create replenishment classes that will be used for items being manufactured. These replenishment classes have been predefined in the ''U100'' dataset for simplicity. In this step, you will review the settings of the replenishment classes. Do the following:[anchor|#_72643367-0dee-42f8-a89a-759177d2c61f]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_88_00|Replenishment Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208800|IN208800]) form.
#Make sure that the class with the ''Manufacturing'' replenishment source in the '''Replenishment Source''' column is displayed in the table. This class will be used for items to be manufactured.
#Make sure that the class with the ''Purchase'' replenishment source is displayed in the table. This replenishment class will be used for items to be purchased.

==Step 7: Reviewing Item Classes==
In a production system, you would need to create one or multiple items classes that will provide default settings to newly created items involved in manufacturing. Two item classes have been predefined in the ''U100'' dataset for simplicity. In this step, you will review settings of the item classes. Do the following:[anchor|#_0262bfe2-af68-460b-b5a3-69195a95e688]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form.
#In the '''Item Class Tree''' of the left pane, select ''JUICERCFG''. This item class provides default settings for new configurable juicer items.
#On the '''General Settings''' tab, do the following:
##In the '''General Settings''' section, make sure that the '''Stock Item''' check box is selected.
##In the '''Posting Class''' box, make sure that ''MFGI'' is selected.
##In the '''Default Warehouse''' box, make sure that ''WORKHOUSE'' is selected.
##In the '''Availability Calculation Rule''' box, make sure that ''MFGITEMS'' is selected.
##In the '''Unit of Measure''' section, make sure that the '''Divisible Unit''' check boxes are cleared. This means that the system will operate with only integer quantities of items in transactions and documents.
#On the '''Replenishment Settings''' tab, make sure that a row with the ''PRODUCTION'' replenishment class has been added.
#:This indicates that items of the class will be manufactured.
#In the '''Item Class Tree''', select ''JCRCFGPRT''. This item class provides default settings for new part items for configurable juicers.
#On the '''General Settings''' tab, do the following:
##In the '''General Settings''' section, make sure that the '''Stock Item''' check box is selected.
##In the '''Posting Class''' box, make sure that ''MFGI'' is selected.
##In the '''Default Warehouse''' box, make sure that ''WORKHOUSE'' is selected.
##In the '''Availability Calculation Rule''' box, make sure that ''MFGITEMS'' is selected.
##In the '''Unit of Measure''' section, make sure that the '''Divisible Unit''' check boxes are cleared. This means that the system will operate with only integer quantities of items in transactions and documents.
#On the '''Replenishment Settings''' tab, make sure that the row with the ''PURCHASE'' replenishment class has been added.
#:This indicates that items of the class will be purchased.

==Step 8: Creating a Stock Item Being Manufactured==
You will create a stock item for a juicer that makes juice from soft fruits and berries. Do the following:[anchor|#_1f2ad718-481b-4432-8345-149b92d57ae1]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form.[anchor|#_1e1b0740-19c1-43eb-9267-5cd0ce367ecc]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record'''.

You have prepared the system for the implementation of manufacturing functionality.]]></column>
			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[System Preparation for Manufacturing Implementation: Implementation Activity In the following implementation activity, you will learn how to prepare the system                 for specifying manufacturing-specific settings. The following activity is             based on the  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system             settings have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the             activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100              dataset to its initial state. Story Suppose that based on requests from customers, SweetLife Fruit & Jams has decided                 to assemble customized juicers. The company has organized a work center where                 workers assemble juicers from parts bought from the Sqeezo Inc. vendor. As an implementation manager, you need to prepare the system for the specification of                 manufacturing-specific settings. Process Overview In this activity, to prepare the system for the implementation of manufacturing                 functionality, you will do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) Numbering Sequences (CS201010) form, you will                     make sure that the numbering sequences for manufacturing batches and entities                     have been created. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL202500|GL202500]) Chart of Accounts (GL202500) form, you will                     make sure that the GL accounts required for manufacturing processes have been                     created. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) Posting Classes (IN206000) form, you will                     make sure that a posting class that will provide posting settings to the items                     involved in manufacturing has been created. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses (IN204000) form, you will                     make sure that the warehouse and locations to be involved in manufacturing have                     been created and defined properly. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201500|IN201500]) Availability Calculation Rules (IN201500) form, you will make sure that                     the availability calculation rule that will be used for calculating availability                     of items involved in manufacturing has been created. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN208800|IN208800]) Replenishment Classes (IN208800) form, you will                     make sure that the replenishment class for items being manufactured has been                     created. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000) form, you will                     make sure that the item classes that will provide default settings for items                     involved in manufacturing have been created and defined properly. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form, you will                     create a stock item for a juicer, which will be assembled. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form, you will                     create a stock item for a juicer part, which will be purchased. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) Employees (EP203000) form, you will                     specify the appropriate setting for an employee that will be involved in                     manufacturing. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form, you will                     review the settings of the SO order type and configure the  TR  and                          QT  order types, which will be involved in the manufacturing                     processes. System Preparation Before you start specifying the general settings to prepare the system for                 manufacturing implementation, you perform the following instructions: Sign in to a company with the  U100  dataset preloaded; you need to                         sign in as a system administrator with the  gibbs  username and                              123  password. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, enable the following                             features: Manufacturing Material Requirements Planning Product Configurator Estimating Advanced Planning and Scheduling Engineering Change Control Manufacturing Data Collection Step 1: Reviewing Numbering Sequences In a production system, you would need to create all of the numbering sequences that                 will be used in the system for manufacturing batches and entity identifiers. These                 numbering sequences have been defined in the U100 dataset for simplicity; you will                 verify that they have been created and review the settings of one of the numbering                 sequences. Do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) Numbering Sequences (CS201010) form. In the  Numbering ID  box of the Summary area, click the                     selector button. In the lookup table that opens, make sure that the following predefined                     numbering sequences exist in the list: AMBATCH AMBOM AMCOST AMDIS AMECO AMECR AMEST AMFCST AMMATL AMMPS AMPROD AMWIP AMVSHIP Select  AMBOM  (which is the numbering sequence created for numbering bills                     of material), and review its settings as follows: In the Summary area, the  Manual Numbering  check                             box is cleared, which means that bills of material will be numbered                             automatically. The value in the  Start Number  column of the only                             row is  BOM000001 , which is the number of the first bill of                             material. These numbering sequences will be specified on the appropriate forms so that they can                 be used during the manufacturing processes. Step 2: Reviewing the GL Accounts In a production system, you would need to create the GL accounts that will be used in                 manufacturing; these accounts have been predefined in the  U100  dataset for                 simplicity. In this step, you will verify that these accounts have been created. Do                 the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL202500|GL202500]) Chart of Accounts (GL202500) form. Make sure that the following accounts are listed in the table: 12400 - Work in Progress 51000 - Accrued COGS - Direct Labor Costs 51050 - Accrued COGS - Fixed Overhead Costs 51060 - Accrued COGS - Fixed Machine Costs 51070 - Accrued COGS - Fixed Tool Costs 51100 - Accrued COGS - Indirect Labor Costs 51150 - Accrued COGS - Variable Overhead Costs 51500 - COGS - WIP Inventory Variance 51600 - COGS - Scrap Expense These accounts will be specified on the appropriate forms so that they can be used                 during the manufacturing processes. Step 3: Reviewing a Posting Class In a production system, you would need to create the posting class that will be used                 in manufacturing. This posting class has been predefined in the  U100  dataset                 for simplicity. In this step, you will verify that this posting class has been                 created as follows: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) Posting Classes (IN206000) form. In the  Class ID  box of the Summary area, select                          MFGI . On the  Posting Settings  tab, make sure that  Inventory                         Item  is selected in the  Use WIP Account From  and                          Use WIP Variance Account From  boxes. This means that                     the system will copy these accounts from the inventory item that is involved in                     a transaction, and the accounts can be changed on the item level if                     necessary. On the  GL Accounts  tab, make sure that in the                          Work in Progress  account box,  12400 - Work in                         Progress  is selected. In the  WIP Variance Account  box, make sure that  51500                         - COGS - WIP Inventory Variance  is selected. Step 4: Reviewing Warehouse and                  Location                 Settings In a production system, you would need to create a warehouse and its locations that                 will be dedicated to manufacturing or specify manufacturing-related settings for an                 existing warehouse and its locations. In the  U100  dataset, a separate                 warehouse has been created and all required settings have been specified. In this                 step, you will review the settings for this predefined warehouse and its locations.                 Do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses (IN204000) form. In the  Warehouse ID  box of the Summary area, select                          WORKHOUSE . In the  Branch  box, make sure that  SWEETEQUIP  is                     selected. On the  Location Table  tab, do the following: In the  MRP  column, make sure that the check box                             is selected for each location. In the row with the  MTL  location (which will be used for storing                             materials), make sure that the following check boxes are selected: Include in Qty Available Sales Allowed Transfers Allowed The  Assembly                 Allowed  check box, which must be selected for locations involved in             production, is not displayed because the  Kit Assembly  feature is disabled on the                   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form for the U100 dataset.             This check box is selected by default. In the row with the  MG  location (which will be used for storing                             manufactured items), make sure that the following check boxes are                                 selected: Include in Qty Available Receipts Allowed Transfers Allowed The  Assembly                 Allowed  check box, which must be selected for locations involved in             production, is not displayed because the  Kit Assembly  feature is disabled on the                   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form for the U100 dataset.             This check box is selected by default. On the  GL Accounts  tab, do the following:  Make sure that in the  Work in Progress  account                             box, the  12400 - Work in Progress  account is selected. In the  WIP Variance Account  box, make sure that                             the  51500 - COGS - WIP Inventory Variance  account is                             selected. On the  Manufacturing  tab, make sure that all check boxes                     are selected in the  General  section. In the  Warehouse ID  box of the Summary area, select                          EQUIPHOUSE  (this location is not involved in manufacturing). On the  Location Table  tab, make sure that the check box                     in the  MRP  column is cleared for all rows. On the  Manufacturing  tab, make sure that all check boxes                     are cleared in the  General  section. The                              WHOLESALE  and  RETAIL  warehouses have similar settings to                         those specified for  EQUIPHOUSE , because they too are not involved in                         manufacturing. Step 5: Reviewing Availability Calculation Rules In a production system, you would need to create an availability calculation rule                 that will include additional settings related to documents used in manufacturing                 processes. This availability calculation rule has been predefined in the  U100                  dataset for simplicity. In this step, you will review settings of the rule. Do the                 following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201500|IN201500]) Availability Calculation Rules (IN201500) form. In the  Availability Calculation Rule  box, select                          MFGITEMS . Make sure that the following check boxes are selected: Deduct Qty. on Issues Deduct Qty. on Sales Prepared Deduct Qty. Shipped Deduct Qty. Allocated Deduct Qty. on Production Demand Prepared Deduct Qty. on Production Demand Deduct Qty. on Production Allocated Include Qty. on Receipts Include Qty. on PO Receipts With these settings, the quantities of items that are issued, shipped,                         allocated to sales orders, and allocated to production orders will be                         deducted from the available quantity; the quantities of items that are                         included in inventory and PO receipts will be added to the available                         quantity. Step 6:                  Reviewing                 Replenishment Class es If in a production system the  Inventory Replenishment  feature is enabled on                 the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, you would need to create                 replenishment classes that will be used for items being manufactured. These                 replenishment classes have been predefined in the  U100  dataset for                 simplicity. In this step, you will review the settings of the replenishment classes.                 Do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN208800|IN208800]) Replenishment Classes (IN208800) form. Make sure that the class with the  Manufacturing  replenishment source in                     the  Replenishment Source  column is displayed in the                     table. This class will be used for items to be manufactured. Make sure that the class with the  Purchase  replenishment source is                     displayed in the table. This replenishment class will be used for items to be                     purchased. Step 7: Reviewing Item Classes In a production system, you would need to create one or multiple items classes that                 will provide default settings to newly created items involved in manufacturing. Two                 item classes have been predefined in the  U100  dataset for simplicity. In this                 step, you will review settings of the item classes. Do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000) form. In the  Item Class Tree  of the left pane, select                          JUICERCFG . This item class provides default settings for new                     configurable juicer items. On the  General Settings  tab, do the following: In the  General Settings  section, make sure that                             the  Stock Item  check box is selected. In the  Posting Class  box, make sure that                                  MFGI  is selected. In the  Default Warehouse  box, make sure that                                  WORKHOUSE  is selected. In the  Availability Calculation Rule  box, make                             sure that  MFGITEMS  is selected. In the  Unit of Measure  section, make sure that                             the  Divisible Unit  check boxes are cleared. This                             means that the system will operate with only integer quantities of items                             in transactions and documents. On the  Replenishment Settings  tab, make sure that a row                     with the  PRODUCTION  replenishment class has been added. This indicates                         that items of the class will be manufactured. In the  Item Class Tree , select  JCRCFGPRT . This                     item class provides default settings for new part items for configurable                     juicers. On the  General Settings  tab, do the following: In the  General Settings  section, make sure that                             the  Stock Item  check box is selected. In the  Posting Class  box, make sure that                                  MFGI  is selected. In the  Default Warehouse  box, make sure that                                  WORKHOUSE  is selected. In the  Availability Calculation Rule  box, make                             sure that  MFGITEMS  is selected. In the  Unit of Measure  section, make sure that                             the  Divisible Unit  check boxes are cleared. This                             means that the system will operate with only integer quantities of items                             in transactions and documents. On the  Replenishment Settings  tab, make sure that the row                     with the  PURCHASE  replenishment class has been added. This indicates                         that items of the class will be purchased. Step 8: Creating a Stock Item Being Manufactured You will create a stock item for a juicer that makes juice from soft fruits and                 berries. Do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form. On              the form toolbar, click  Add New Record . In the  Inventory ID  box of the Summary area, type                          CFJSOFT . In the  Description  box, type  A configurable                         juicer for soft fruit, vegetables, and berries . In the  Item Class  box of the  General                         Settings  tab ( Item Defaults  section),                     select  JUICERCFG . The system copies the settings of the item class into                     the following boxes of the section: Type :  Finished Good Valuation Method :  Average Posting Class :  MFGI Default Warehouse :  WORKHOUSE On the  Replenishment Info  tab, make sure that the row                     with the  PRODUCTION  replenishment class has been copied from the item                     class. In the  Safety Stock  column,                      type                          20 . On the  Manufacturing  tab, specify the following: In the                                  Dflt                                  Mark For  box of the  General                              section, select  Production . Select the                                  Make                                 to Order  Item  check box. Make sure that the  MRP Item  check box is                             selected. In the  Source  box of the                                  Replenishments  section, make sure that                                  Manufacturing  is selected and the value of the                                  Safety Stock  box has been copied from the                                  Replenishment Info  tab. In the  Scheduling  section, make sure that the                                  Check for Material Availability  check box is                             selected. On the form toolbar, click  Save . You will specify other item settings when configuring particular manufacturing                 processes. Step 9: Creating a Stock Item for a Component Being Purchased You will create a stock item for a component of a configurable juicer: a grating disc                 with medium peeling, which will be purchased from the Sqeezo Inc. vendor. Do the                 following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form. On              the form toolbar, click  Add New Record . In the  Inventory ID  box of the Summary area, type                          GRDISC03 . In the  Description  box, type  Grating disc for                         medium peeling (for configurable juicers) . In the  Item Class  box on the  General                         Settings  tab ( Item Defaults  section),                     select  JCRCFGPRT . The system copies the settings of the item class into                     the following boxes of the section: Type :  Finished Good Valuation Method :  Average Posting Class :  MFGI Default Warehouse :  WORKHOUSE In the  Default Issue From  box of the  Warehouse                         Defaults  section, select  MTL  (which is the location where                     components for juicers will be stored). In the  Default Receipt To  box, select  MAIN  (which                     is the receiving location for all items in the  WORKHOUSE  warehouse). On the  Vendor Details  tab, do the following: On the table toolbar, click  Add Row . In the  Vendor ID  column of the row, select                                  JALOOZA . Make sure that the lead time is specified in the  Lead Time                                 (Days)  column. On the  Warehouse Details  tab, make sure that a row for                          WORKHOUSE  has been added. In the  Last Cost  box of the  Price/Cost                         Info  tab, type  39.90 . On the form toolbar, click  Save . Step 10: Selecting Employees Involved in Production Three employees will be involved in juicer assembly: two workers and one manager. You                 will mark one of these employees, Carlos Cruz, as being involved in production. Do                 the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) Employees (EP203000) form. In the  Employee ID  box of the Summary area, select                          EP00000027, Carlos Cruz . In the  Employee Settings  section on the                          General Info  tab, select  Production                         Employee  check box. For the other two employees, Casey Burrows and Gladys Peters, the                      Production Employee  check box has already been                 selected. Step 11: Configuring Sales Order Types You will review the settings of the  SO  order type and configure the  TR                  and  QT  order types, which will be used in manufacturing processes. Do the                 following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form. In the  Order Type  box of the Summary area, select                          SO . In the  General Settings  section of the  General                         Settings  tab, make sure that the following check boxes are                         selected: Allow Production Orders - Approved Allow Production Orders - Hold Allow Production Entry MTO Order In the  Order Type  box, select  TR . In the  General Settings  section of the  General                         Settings  tab, select the following check boxes: Allow Production Orders - Approved Allow Production Orders - Hold Allow Production Entry MTO Order In the  Order Type  box, select  QT . In the  General Settings  section of the  General                         Settings  tab, select the following check boxes: Allow Production Entry Allow Estimating You have prepared the system for the implementation of manufacturing                 functionality. ]]></column>

The production management functionality supports the backflushing of both materials and labor. The defaults are defined in the bill of material using [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_80_00|Bill of Material] ([~/?ScreenId=AM208000|AM208000]) which defaults for each operation from the work center settings when creating the bill. Flexibility is provided by configuring backflushing for only specific materials and/or operations. The configuration of backflushing starts with the work center.
*You can check the Backflush Materials and/or Backflush Labor for a work center by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_70_00|Work Centers] ([~/?ScreenId=AM207000|AM207000]) form to provide default values for operations added to a bill of material.
*When you add an operation to the bill of material you can select or clear the backflush option for labor and/or material.
*When you add the materials for an operation you can select or clear the backflush option for any material.

When you report production for an operation by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_10_00|Labor] ([~/?ScreenId=AM301000|AM301000]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_20_00|Move] ([~/?ScreenId=AM302000|AM302000]) form and a quantity is entered, the following occurs:
*Any materials where the backlashed flag is checked will be issued to the production order from the warehouse/location specified in the material line or if empty from the default issue from warehouse/location. The [HelpRoot_Manufacturing\AM_PM_BinLocations|How Warehouse Locations Are Selected] topic explains how locations are determined.
*If there are prior operations with backflush checked for materials, the quantity to issue is calculated as the difference between the actual quantity reported at that operation and this operation multiplied by the quantity per. This can result is a negative issue if the prior operation had material issued.
*If there are prior operations with the backflush labor checked the labor amount will be adjusted if necessary to agree with the quantity reported at the current operation vs. the quantity previously reported.

The purpose of the recalculations is to reconcile any quantity differences between the current operation and any prior operations and adjust the costs charged to the production order accordingly.{br}

If you decide to backflush materials, please note the following:
*The process creates a Materials batch on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_00_00|Materials] ([~/?ScreenId=AM300000|AM300000]) form, which is automatically released.
*It cannot issue more materials than what is on hand in a location unless negative inventories are allowed.
*The locations are determined according the rules specified in [HelpRoot_Manufacturing\AM_PM_BinLocations|How Warehouse Locations Are Selected].

==What is Backflushing?==
Backflushing is a method for issuing materials and/or labor to production orders at the point that production of a specific operation is reported. This is commonly referred to as ''&ldquo;postproduction issuing&ldquo;'', vs. ''&ldquo;preproduction issuing&ldquo;'' where materials are pulled from stores and issued to production orders prior to the start of an operation and labor is directly reported for each operation.{br}

Material and labor costs are flushed backwards through operations to assign costs to products based on the quantity of product produced at the operations. The result is that detailed tracking of costs is eliminated. This can represent a time savings over the traditional method of a) issuing component parts one at a time, b) reporting operation labor or quantities, and c) returning any unused components, one at a time, back into inventory.{br}

Additionally, backflushing can ensure that the full cost of production is recognized when the final operation is reported and the finished product is received into inventory. The backflushing process will adjust the materials consumed and/or labor reported for any operations where the full amount has not been posted. The receipt cost of the product can be more representative and/or variances are minimized.
==When is Backflushing Appropriate?==
#In operations where scrap is common in the finished item and you continue to produce until you have a good quantity equal to the ordered quantity. You would report both the good quantity and scrap quantity to ensure the proper quantities of materials and labor.
#Only certain milestone operations are reported and prior operations are backflushed to account for the labor cost. Or inspection operations are performed by sampling.
#Operations are performed for multiple production orders at the simultaneously or in a continuous run such as cleaning, painting, plating, etc. where it would be difficult to post labor to individual orders. Similarly, there may be production areas or lines where multiple operators work on whatever item appears at their work station such as filling, testing, packing, or assembly and do not report their time against specific orders.
#There are floor stock items, such as lubricants, labels, hardware, wiring, packing materials, etc., in the bill of material whose costs are not significant. An expense issue is performed periodically to reconcile the on hand balance to the physical inventory.
#When you use point-of-use materials, backflushing simplifies the issuing process and makes it easier to perform counts on the point-of-use materials. If you were to preproduction issue these materials you would need to reconcile the inventory balances with any orders that had quantities staged to the production area but not yet consumed, however, if by backflushing you should have a system-to-actual-count match after each production posting.
#In very long production runs (days or weeks) where preproduction posting takes the materials out of the on-hand inventory balance days or weeks before they are being used and puts the dollar value into a WIP account for the production order. You also may have situations where you do not have enough of the raw materials for the entire production run, however, more will be arriving during the run.
#When you are using bulk materials such as bar stock, roll stock, sheet goods, and dry goods or liquids in bulk containers, where the exact quantity cannot be picked. For example, if you need 1000 linear feet of material that comes in bulk rolls of 300 linear feet, preproduction issuing of 1000 even though the material handler delivered 1200 causes a confusing inventory situation, and issuing the entire 1200 would require you to reverse issue 200 when you return the remainder.

==When is Backflushing Not Appropriate?==
#The amount of labor applied to an operation can have variances from one production run to another. The labor amount may represent a significant cost of the product.
#When employees are accountable for the product being produced and traceability is desired.
#Lot and/or serialized materials must be verified and recorded as being issued. Although backflushing can automatically issue lot- or serial-tracked items it is generally not recommended.
#Materials consumption is variable or there is significant waste of a particular material.
#Material substitutions are common and allowed during the production process.
#Labor transactions by employee need to be reconciled to time and attendance for payroll purposes or a shop data collection system is used.
((({S:Warn}When you have materials stored in multiple physical bin locations there is guarantee material was picked from the backflush location.

By-products are secondary products from the manufacturing process for the primary product.((({S:Hint}If you are going to use lot control for by-products and you are going to backflush them, you must set up the lot class for sequential issue.
)))
If you do not wish to have a cost for the by-product credited to the primary product cost, then set the valuation method of the by-product to ''Standard Cost'' and set a standard cost of zero or make sure not to do any receipts for the by-product with a cost for average, FIFO, or specific cost.{br}{TOC}
==Setting up the Bill of Material for By-Products==
Any material component with a negative quantity required is considered a by-product. The cost of a by-product is credited to the cost of the primary product if the by-product has a cost. For example:
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!'''Component'''
! '''Qty Required'''
! '''Unit Cost'''
|- 
| CHEMCOMP1
| .05 Liters
| 1.00
|- 
| CHEMCOMP2
| .06 Liters
| 1.00
|- 
| CHENBYPROD1
| -.01 Liters
| 1.00
|}
The material cost per liter is $1.00: (.05 x $1.00) + (.06 x $1.00) + (-.01 x $1.00).
==By-Products and Production Orders== When a production order is created, any items with a negative quantity per unit required will have the by-product flag checked. Similarly, you must enter a negative quantity per unit required for a by-product you add to a production order manually. 
The cost of the by-product, if any, is calculated and deducted from the planned material and total cost of the production order when creating the production order. The by-product flag on the production details is used when creating a materials batch to indicate that this item will be received into inventory. An Inventory Receipt transaction is created to receive the by-product into inventory.{br}

The receipt cost of a by-product is determined using the Item Warehouse cost; this is the same method used to determine the cost of all materials. The by-product is not credited with any of the production costs. This is generally accepted method for handling by-products.{br}

''When compared to the main products, because they are deemed to have no influence on reported financial results, by-products do not receive allocations of joint costs. By-products also by convention are not inventoried, but the NRV from by-products is typically recognized as other income or as a reduction of joint production processing costs when the by-product is produced. A by-product can be useful and marketable or it can be considered waste.''((({S:Hint}This information has been copied from the following sources:[anchor|#_16667c08-e181-460f-aef9-52736bd3790a]

The cost of a by-product is credited to the cost of the primary product if the by-product has a cost.  For example: Component Qty Required Unit Cost CHEMCOMP1 .05 Liters 1.00 CHEMCOMP2 .06 Liters 1.00 CHENBYPROD1 -.01 Liters 1.00 The material cost per liter is $1.00:  (.05 x $1.00) + (.06 x $1.00) + (-.01 x $1.00). By-Products and Production Orders  When a production order is created,       any items with a negative quantity per unit required will have the by-product flag checked.       Similarly, you must enter a negative quantity per unit required for a by-product you add to a       production order manually.  The cost of the by-product, if any, is calculated and deducted         from the planned material and total cost of the production order when creating the         production order. The by-product flag on the production details is used when creating a         materials batch to indicate that this item will be received into inventory. An Inventory         Receipt transaction is created to receive the by-product into inventory. The receipt         cost of a by-product is determined using the Item Warehouse cost; this is the same method         used to determine the cost of all materials. The by-product is not credited with any of the         production costs. This is generally accepted method for handling by-products. When compared to the main products, because they are deemed to have no influence on           reported financial results, by-products do not receive allocations of joint costs.           By-products also by convention are not inventoried, but the NRV from by-products is           typically recognized as other income or as a reduction of joint production processing           costs when the by-product is produced. A by-product can be useful and marketable or it can           be considered waste.

The bill of material structure has been completely redesigned. In prior releases of the Manufacturing Edition each bill of material header and details records had '''Effective Start Date''' and '''Effective End Date''' columns that were controlled by the application. With revisions, the start and end dates for the bill of material header are informational only and can be maintained by the user without restrictions. As a result of this new design revision is now a required field. 
==Advantages of Using Revisions for Bills of Material==
The advantages of this change include:[anchor|#_8147a0d8-9da0-4f29-9a7a-26ddd6b3144a]
*The most recent active revision is the default for production orders and MRP planning. The ''Effective Start Date'' and ''Effective End Date'' for material records are still available and are used to determine which components are selected for orders and planning based on the order or operation start date.
*:((({S:Warn}The most recent revision is the first revision sorted descending.
)))
*Better synchronization with external PDM systems and drawings.
*Revision is now a required entry and the option to ''Track Revision History'' is removed.
*User control of which bills are active and available for use.
*Only bills of material revisions ''On Hold'' can be updated.
**A revision can have a status of ''Hold'', ''Active'', or ''Archived''.
**The revision status can be changed at any time.
**Multiple revisions can be active at the same time.
*Creating a new revision of a bill copies the entire bill including all attributes, notes, and attachments. The copy is based on the most recently created revision.
*A revision can be deleted only when it is not the source for a production order, product configuration, or referenced on a bill of material or production material.

==Archiving Bills of Material==
Archiving a bill of material sets the '''End Date''' to the current business date and removes it from the boxes used to select bills of material in other modules. You can select the '''Hold''' check box for a revision with a status of ''Archived'' to make it editable again. Once edited, clearing the '''Hold''' check box changes the status to ''Active''.
==Form and Report Changes==
The '''Revision ID''' has been added as a required entry, selection, or column to the following forms and reports.[anchor|#_ae30f38d-939b-481b-85a7-4559870ad559]

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
''Waste'' is a loss of materials inputted into the production process and is specified by the '''Scrap Factor''' assigned to the material in the bill of material. For example, during the cutting of a material 5% waste is expected. The quantity, and resultant total cost, of a material required is scaled up by the scrap factor. The wasted material does not have value although some costs may be recovered if the waste can be recycled such as metal filings, wood chips, and plastics.{br}

By-products are also production output and are typically treated as ''waste'' because production costs are not allocated to them. They can, however, have a standard cost which is used to credit the production order with their value when received into inventory.{br}

''Scrap'' is a loss from production output; that is the item being produced does not meet its specifications. In this case, the scrap can have a value representing the accrued production costs. The item may be reworked to meet specifications, sold as-is at a discounted price, used as input to another process, or discarded.{br}{TOC}
==Options for Scrap Accounting ==
There are the following methods available to account for the cost of production scrap (for details, see [HelpRoot_Manufacturing\AM_Scrap_Processing_Configuration|Scrap Processing Configuration]):
*'''No Action''': The cost of scrap remains in the production order and no scrap transaction is generated
*'''Write-off''': The cost is written off and charged to an expense account
*'''Quarantine''': The scrap is received into inventory to a quarantined location and dispositioned later
((({S:Hint}The '''Include Scrap in Completions''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_10_20_00|Production Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AM102000|AM102000]) form is still used to determine if an operation is closed automatically. The receipt cost calculation ignores the total scrap for all scrap that has been written off and will not include those quantities in the receipt cost calculation. If scrap is not written off, then the scrap quantity is included or excluded based on the setting.
)))
In the latter two methods, the cost of the scrap is the accrued production cost which debits the scrap expense account and credits the work in process account of the production order. If the quarantine option is used, the inventory on hand balance is adjusted at the quarantine warehouse and location; the ''Ext. Cost'' is the calculated scrap cost.{br}

Negative scrap, typically to correct a transaction, is permitted and the transactions have the opposite effect.{br}

The actual transactions are generated on the following forms:
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_80_00|WIP Adjustment] ([~/?ScreenId=AM308000|AM308000]): On this form, a GL transaction is generated to credit the production order WIP account and debit the Scrap Expense account specified by the reason code. The WIP adjustment is recorded on the '''Production Order Events''' tab.
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_30_00|Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=IN303000|IN303000]): Additionally, if the scrap action is '''Quarantine''', an inventory adjustment is created and released. The GL transaction created by the adjustment debits the Inventory account and credits the Scrap Expense account.
*:((({S:Warn} If the stock item has a valuation method of standard cost, then an inventory account is posted at standard cost and the standard cost adjustment is generated for the difference; the credit for scrap expense is the actual cost.
)))
((({S:Warn}The costs calculated for negative scrap may differ from the original transaction if additional costs have been posted to the operations used to calculate the cost.
)))
==Impact on Inventory Valuation==
If you choose to use the scrap action of '''Quarantine''' the inventory adjustment will update the current cost. ((({S:Warn}For this reason we recommend that you either create a separate warehouse, or select the '''Cost Separately''' check box for the warehouse location, for the quarantined inventory to ensure the scrap cost does not affect the cost of accepted inventory when the item valuation method is ''FIFO'' or ''Average Cost''.
)))
If the item valuation method is ''Standard'', you select the '''Override Standard Cost''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form. If the item valuation method is ''Specific'', then you can use the same warehouse however, the last cost and average cost values will still include the scrap cost adjustment.
==Scrap Cost Calculation==
The scrap cost calculations are dependent on the costing method specified for the production order.{br}

'''Actual Costing Method'''{br}

To calculate the actual cost of scrap, the cost of each production operation is calculated. The cost of the scrap includes the actual costs for the current operation for which scrap is reported plus the estimated costs of prior operations. The estimated costs for prior operations is the sum of actual plus planned costs to account for materials, labor, and other costs not reported; that is a material was not issued to a prior operation so its planned unit cost will be factored into the operation cost totals.{br}

The WIP balance for each operation is the total actual costs posted minus the ''MFG to Inventory'' (that is, the total costs of receipts to inventory) totals. The formula used for calculation of each operation is the following:{{{{AMProdOper.WIPBalance / (AMProdOper.QtyComplete + AMProdOper.QtyScrapped - 
AMProdItem.QtyComplete) * AMMTran.QtyScrapped
}}}}
{{AMProdOper.QtyComplete}} includes the adjusted amount for transaction move quantity or scrap.{br}

'''Estimated or Standard Costing Method'''{br}

The only difference between these costing methods and the ''Actual'' costing method is these methods will factor in the planned costs to the WIP Balance for missing costs; such as labor or materials overhead that have not been reported. For example, all of the materials needed to produce the item at an operation were not issued.
==Processing Scrap in Production Transactions==
You can enter the scrapped quantity to both the labor and move transactions.{br}

When the ''Qty Scrapped'' is not 0 and the scrap action is not ''No Action'', a WIP adjustment transaction is created for the scrap cost.[anchor|#_c8d1c084-f35a-4698-9ab6-7cb0884cdf22]
*The ''Orig Batch Nbr'' and ''Orig Doc Type'' link back to the source transaction.
*The reason code entered determines the Scrap Expense account and subaccount.
*The table with details include the production order values for the operation, scrap quantity, and any inventory adjustment created.
*The scrap warehouse and scrap location are defaulted from the production order.

A GL transaction is created when the WIP adjustment is released to post to the scrap expense production order WIP account.{br}

If the scrap action is ''Quarantine'' you must enter the move or labor transaction on a separate line and select the '''Is Scrap''' check box. This is required in order to specify the scrap warehouse, location, and if required, the lot/serial number.
==Reporting Options==
To create an inquiry or report for the scrap activity the {{AMTran}} Data Access Class will have the {{DocType}} set to ''W'' and the {{TranType}} set to either of the following:[anchor|#_5208e065-f4fb-4d18-85a3-c5c69f5d0fdd]

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Handling Production Scrap and Waste Waste  is a loss of materials inputted into the production process and is specified by         the  Scrap Factor  assigned to the material in the bill of material.         For example, during the cutting of a material 5% waste is expected. The quantity, and         resultant total cost, of a material required is scaled up by the scrap factor. The wasted         material does not have value although some costs may be recovered if the waste can be         recycled such as metal filings, wood chips, and plastics. By-products are also production output and are typically treated as  waste  because         production costs are not allocated to them. They can, however, have a standard cost which is         used to credit the production order with their value when received into inventory. Scrap  is a loss from production output; that is the item being produced does not         meet its specifications. In this case, the scrap can have a value representing the accrued         production costs. The item may be reworked to meet specifications, sold as-is at a         discounted price, used as input to another process, or discarded. Options for Scrap Accounting  There are the following methods available to account for the cost of production scrap (for         details, see  Scrap Processing Configuration): No Action : The cost of scrap remains in the production order and           no scrap transaction is generated Write-off : The cost is written off and charged to an expense           account Quarantine : The scrap is received into inventory to a quarantined           location and dispositioned later The  Include Scrap in Completions  check box on the             ([~/?ScreenId=AM102000|AM102000]) Production Preferences (AM102000) form is still used to determine if an operation         is closed automatically. The receipt cost calculation ignores the total scrap for all scrap         that has been written off and will not include those quantities in the receipt cost         calculation. If scrap is not written off, then the scrap quantity is included or excluded         based on the setting. In the latter two methods, the cost of the scrap is the accrued production cost which debits the scrap expense account and credits the work in process account of the production order.  If the quarantine option is used, the inventory on hand balance is adjusted at the quarantine warehouse and location; the  Ext. Cost  is the calculated scrap cost. Negative scrap, typically to correct a transaction, is permitted and the transactions have the opposite effect. The actual transactions are generated on the following forms:  ([~/?ScreenId=AM308000|AM308000]) WIP Adjustment (AM308000): On this form, a GL transaction is generated           to credit the production order WIP account and debit the Scrap Expense account specified           by the reason code. The WIP adjustment is recorded on the  Production Order             Events  tab.  ([~/?ScreenId=IN303000|IN303000]) Adjustments (IN303000): Additionally, if the scrap           action is  Quarantine , an inventory adjustment is created and           released. The GL transaction created by the adjustment debits the Inventory account and           credits the Scrap Expense account.  If the stock item has a             valuation method of standard cost, then an inventory account is posted at standard cost             and the standard cost adjustment is generated for the difference; the credit for scrap             expense is the actual cost. The costs calculated for negative scrap may differ from the original         transaction if additional costs have been posted to the operations used to calculate the         cost. Impact on Inventory Valuation If you choose to use the scrap action of  Quarantine  the inventory         adjustment will update the current cost.  For this reason we recommend that you either create a separate         warehouse, or select the  Cost Separately  check box for the warehouse         location, for the quarantined inventory to ensure the scrap cost does not affect the cost of         accepted inventory when the item valuation method is  FIFO  or  Average         Cost . If the item valuation method is  Standard , you select the  Override           Standard Cost  check box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details         (IN204500) form. If the item valuation method is  Specific , then you can use the same         warehouse however, the last cost and average cost values will still include the scrap cost         adjustment. Scrap Cost Calculation The scrap cost calculations are dependent on the costing method specified for the         production order. Actual Costing Method To calculate the actual cost of scrap, the cost of each production operation is calculated.         The cost of the scrap includes the actual costs for the current operation for which scrap is         reported plus the estimated costs of prior operations. The estimated costs for prior         operations is the sum of actual plus planned costs to account for materials, labor, and         other costs not reported; that is a material was not issued to a prior operation so its         planned unit cost will be factored into the operation cost totals. The WIP balance for each operation is the total actual costs posted minus the  MFG to           Inventory  (that is, the total costs of receipts to inventory) totals. The formula used         for calculation of each operation is the following: AMProdOper.WIPBalance / (AMProdOper.QtyComplete + AMProdOper.QtyScrapped - 
AMProdItem.QtyComplete) * AMMTran.QtyScrapped AMProdOper.QtyComplete  includes the adjusted amount for transaction move         quantity or scrap. Estimated or Standard Costing Method The only difference between these costing methods and the  Actual  costing method is         these methods will factor in the planned costs to the WIP Balance for missing costs; such as         labor or materials overhead that have not been reported. For example, all of the materials         needed to produce the item at an operation were not issued. Processing Scrap in Production Transactions You can enter the scrapped quantity to both the labor and move transactions. When the  Qty Scrapped  is not 0 and the scrap action is not  No Action , a WIP         adjustment transaction is created for the scrap cost. The  Orig Batch Nbr  and  Orig Doc Type  link back to the source           transaction. The reason code entered determines the Scrap Expense account and subaccount. The table with details include the production order values for the operation, scrap           quantity, and any inventory adjustment created. The scrap warehouse and scrap location are defaulted from the production order. A GL transaction is created when the WIP adjustment is released to post to the scrap         expense production order WIP account. If the scrap action is  Quarantine  you must enter the move or labor transaction on a         separate line and select the  Is Scrap  check box. This is required in         order to specify the scrap warehouse, location, and if required, the lot/serial number. Reporting Options To create an inquiry or report for the scrap activity the  AMTran  Data         Access Class will have the  DocType  set to  W  and the            TranType  set to either of the following: XSW : Scrap Write-Off XSQ : Scrap Quarantine ]]></column>

==Reason Codes==
Reason codes created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_21_10_00|Reason Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS211000|CS211000]) form specify the GL account and subaccount to be used for the scrap expense. A reason code is required when reporting scrap if the scrap action is ''Write-off'' or ''Quarantine''. The usage of the reason code must be ''Production Scrap''. The '''Combine Sub. From''' box determines masks for reason code, stock item, posting class, or warehouse. You can create multiple reason codes for scrap with the same or different GL accounts and subaccounts.
==Scrap Action==
The scrap action determines how scrap is processed. The default actions are set on the following forms:[anchor|#_91ef5c51-c966-4de1-9151-5246a459ebcf]
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_70_00|Work Centers] ([~/?ScreenId=AM207000|AM207000])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_80_00|Bill of Material] ([~/?ScreenId=AM208000|AM208000]), which inherits the action from the work center
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_90_00|Production Order Details] ([~/?ScreenId=AM209000|AM209000]), which inherits the actions from the bill of material when the production order is created.

The labor and move transactions inherit the values from the production order operation and can be overriden.{br}

In the following table, you can see the list of scrap actions with descriptions.[anchor|#_dc29b5f8-ba25-419c-83e1-c4951a08b192]

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
A new method to calculate requirements for inventory items has been added. This enhancement affects all forms and processes where material quantities are calculated; bills of material, production orders, MRP, estimates, and options for product configurations.
==Quantity Round Up==
On the '''Manufacturing''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, the '''Forecast Round Up''' check box has been replaced with the '''Quantity Round Up''' check box, which is cleared by default.{br}

The purpose is to round up any calculations of the quantity required to the next integer value. This is particularly useful for inventory items stocked in units without decimals such as ''Each'' or ''Unit''. The round up is applied to the unit of measure specified for the requirement; that is, if the base stocking unit is ounce and pound is specified as the unit of measure for a production order, then the requirement is rounded up the next pound.
==Batch Size==
The batch size is also used in calculating the quantity required for inventory items. Previously, all material requirements were specified as per unit of the parent item. With the batch size supported, now the quantity required can be calculated as per lot size of the parent. As with quantity round up, batch size is used on all calculations of inventory quantities required.{br}

The ''lot size'' term refers to the quantity of the parent inventory item being produced. The parent lot size is set on the '''Manufacturing''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form and can be overridden on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form. The lot size becomes the default for MRP planned orders and production orders and is used in the cost roll process of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_50_80_00|Cost Roll] ([~/?ScreenId=AM508000|AM508000]) form. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_30_00|Estimate] ([~/?ScreenId=AM303000|AM303000]) form, the '''Order Qty''' on the '''Totals''' tab is used as the lot size.{br}

The quantity to produce is the lot size for production orders and the materials required are calculated on that basis. Changing the quantity to produce recalculates the requirements.{br}

Batch size settings are the following:[anchor|#_d2252371-6c6a-4687-94aa-e349f9ebb114]
*Batch Size of One (1): The quantity required of a component is per unit of the parent inventory item. This is the default value.
*Batch Size of Zero (0): The quantity required is fixed regardless of the parent lot size.
*Batch Size Greater than One (1): The quantity required is divided by the batch size.

==Added Calculation Columns==

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[How Batch Sizes and Quantity Round Up are Used A new method to calculate requirements for inventory items has been added. This enhancement         affects all forms and processes where material quantities are calculated; bills of material,         production orders, MRP, estimates, and options for product configurations. Quantity Round Up On the  Manufacturing  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form, the  Forecast Round           Up  check box   has been replaced with the  Quantity Round           Up  check box, which is cleared by default. The purpose is to round up any calculations of the quantity required to the next integer         value. This is particularly useful for inventory items stocked in units without decimals         such as  Each  or  Unit . The round up is applied to the unit of measure specified         for the requirement; that is, if the base stocking unit is ounce and pound is specified as         the unit of measure for a production order, then the requirement is rounded up the next         pound. Batch Size The batch size is also used in calculating the quantity required for inventory items.         Previously, all material requirements were specified as per unit of the parent item. With         the batch size supported, now the quantity required can be calculated as per lot size of the         parent. As with quantity round up, batch size is used on all calculations of inventory         quantities required. The  lot size  term refers to the quantity of the parent inventory item being         produced. The parent lot size is set on the  Manufacturing  tab of the             ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form and can be overridden on the             ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details (IN204500) form. The lot size becomes the         default for MRP planned orders and production orders and is used in the cost roll process of         the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM508000|AM508000]) Cost Roll (AM508000) form. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM303000|AM303000]) Estimate         (AM303000) form, the  Order Qty  on the  Totals          tab is used as the lot size. The quantity to produce is the lot size for production orders and the materials required         are calculated on that basis. Changing the quantity to produce recalculates the         requirements. Batch size settings are the following: Batch Size of One (1): The quantity required of a component is per unit of the parent           inventory item. This is the default value. Batch Size of Zero (0): The quantity required is fixed regardless of the parent lot           size. Batch Size Greater than One (1): The quantity required is divided by the batch           size. Added Calculation Columns In the following table, you can view columns that have been added where appropriate to         assist users in visualizing the effect of the batch size and quantity round up         functionality. Element Description Total Qty (Operations) The  Quantity to Produce  value in a production order for                 an operation less accumulated scrap (if the  Include Scrap in                   Completions  check box is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM102000|AM102000]) Production Preferences (AM102000) form). Qty Remaining (Operations) Calculated as  Total Qty  minus  Qty                   Complete Total Required The quantity of a material required based on the  Batch                   Size  and  Quantity Round Up  values. Qty Remaining (Materials) Calculated as  Total Required  minus  Qty                   Actual . Total Quantity Required Examples The examples below show the effect of the batch size and quantity round up functionality.         The same material requirement is used. Inventory ID Qty Required Batch Size Total Qty Required With Qty Round Up Order Qty COMPSTD 0.700 1 7.000 7.000 10.000 COMPSTD 0.700 0 0.700 1.000 10.000 COMPSTD 0.700 2 3.500 4.000 10.000 COMPSTD 0.700 1 17.500 18.000 25.000 COMPSTD 0.700 0 0.700 1.000 25.000 COMPSTD 0.700 2 8.750 9.000 25.000 Forms Modified In this section, you can find the list of boxes that have been added to forms. Some of the         new boxes are hidden by default but can be added by using the column selector for each         table.

==General Information==
Almost all of the master data is related to bills of material functionality consisting of the bills of material for each assembly and their supporting data such as work centers, tools, machines, and overhead. For details, see [HelpRoot_Manufacturing\AM_Import_BOM|Importing Bills of Material Master Data].{br}

Data providers and import scenarios are provided for each of the following; the provider and scenario have the same name and all use Excel as the provider type. The sample Excel files are provided at the end of this topic. You should import your data in the same order as in the following table.[anchor|#_7592d914-ec16-49ad-9c3a-c43218692348]

Additionally, you must specify BOM preferences on the BOM Preferences () form and enter the following required data first in order to import work centers.
==Required Data==
The following data is required even if you do not intend to include labor and indirect costs for your bills of material and to post them to production orders:
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_90_00|Work Calendar] ([~/?ScreenId=CS209000|CS209000]): Defines the hours available per day and is used to calculate both fixed and variable lead times in MRP and Production Management. You enter the calendar to use for shifts of a work center, for fixed lead times in Production Preferences, and for purchasing in MRP Preferences.
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_50_00|Shifts] ([~/?ScreenId=AM205000|AM205000]): Machines are used to factor labor rates.
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_65_00|Labor Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AM206500|AM206500]): Define the GL accounts and subaccounts for direct and indirect labor expense.

Data providers and import scenarios are not supplied for ''Shifts'', ''Labor Codes'', or ''Overhead'' since most users will have only a few of each. If you need to create one, then enter one of each type on the appropriate form and export the data to Excel. You then can use that spreadsheet to create the data provider and import scenario since it will have all of the columns available and the correct values for drop-down lists and check boxes. In Acumatica ERP, you enter the drop-down list caption and not codes and either ''True'' (selected) or ''False'' (cleared) for check boxes. Your reseller can assist you in creating data providers and import scenarios.
==Optional Data==
The following data are completely optional:
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_55_00|Tools] ([~/?ScreenId=AM205500|AM205500]): Can be entered as an additional cost element in a bill of material
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_45_00|Machines] ([~/?ScreenId=AM204500|AM204500]): Can be entered as an additional cost element for work centers
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_25_00|Overhead] ([~/?ScreenId=AM202500|AM202500]): Can be entered as an additional cost element for both work centers and bills of material.

Once you have entered the required and optional data the next step is to create or import your work centers. In bills of material, components, as wells as tools, are tied to operations and operations require a work center.
==Importing Machines, Tools, or Work Centers ==
The import scenarios for the following entities will default values for required form elements not supplied or left blank in the spreadsheet. To override the default value, specify a value in the spreadsheet.

In this topic, you will read about importing master data related to bills of material.{br}{TOC}
==Importing Bills of Material==
''Steps'', ''Tools'', ''Reference Designators'', and ''Overhead'' data are not included in the ''Import BOM'' provider or scenario but can be added if desired.((({S:Hint}The keys to the bill of master data are ''BOMID'' and ''RevisionID'' and both are required. Additionally, the ''Hold'' column should be specified as either ''True'' or ''False''.
)))
==BOM ID==
BOM ID is up to 15 alphanumeric characters in length and its length is defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_10_10|Numbering Sequences] (CS201010 form. You can use manual or automatic numbering. For the automatic numbering you can use an alphabetic prefix; that is, to use a start number like BOM00000. If you have an external PDM or drawing system, you might want to synchronize the data between the external system and Acumatica ERP by using the same identity scheme. Keep in mind however that the BOM ID must be unique; that is, the same BOM ID cannot be used for another inventory id or warehouse.((({S:Warn}Note the following:[anchor|#_99a88032-2c7a-4715-b2d3-7eed29fff7a4]
*If you use automatic numbering for the BOM ID, then rerunning the import for the same data will create another bill of material with a different BOM ID. For this reason, we recommend that you select the '''Manual Numbering''' check box for the initial load. Generate in your spreadsheet a BOM ID conforming to the numbering sequence you plan to use and after your final import you can set the ''Last Number'' to the appropriate value. The values in the '''BOM ID''' and '''Revision''' columns should be the same for each line associated with a particular bill or material.
*This import scenario cannot be used to update existing bills of material so if a bill of material was imported incorrectly then you should delete it by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_80_00|Bill of Material] ([~/?ScreenId=AM208000|AM208000]) form. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_36|Import by Scenario] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206036|SM206036]) form, use the ''TOGGLE ACTIVATION'' and ''TOGGLE PROCESSING'' buttons to clear the '''Active''' and '''Processed''' check boxes respectively for all rows and then find the lines that need to be imported and select the '''Active''' check box for all of lines of a bill of material.
)))
==Effective Start Date==
The effective start date of a new bill of material is the system date and cannot be overridden on the form but it can be included in the import data. The import mapping defaults the element to the current Acumatica ERP business date using the {{@Today}} parameter because all key fields must be specified on an import scenario.
==Inventory Subitems==
By default, the subitem elements are inactive in the both the data provider and import scenario. If you are using subitems, then select the '''Active''' boxes in both the provider and import scenario. The following elements are related to subitems:[anchor|#_28d9b066-3de7-4e35-8a43-f4b84f018126]
*''Subitem'': The subitem ID for the assembly in the BOM Summary area
*''Matl Subitem'': The subitem for the material on the Materials area.

On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM206036|SM206036]) Import by Scenario (SM206036) form, use the  TOGGLE ACTIVATION  and  TOGGLE PROCESSING  buttons to       clear the  Active  and  Processed  check boxes       respectively for all rows and then find the lines that need to be imported and select the         Active  check box for all of lines of a bill of material. Effective Start Date The effective start date of a new bill of material is the system date and cannot be overridden     on the form but it can be included in the import data. The import mapping defaults the element     to the current  Acumatica ERP     business date using the  @Today  parameter because all key fields must be     specified on an import scenario. Inventory Subitems By default, the subitem elements are inactive in the both the data provider and import     scenario. If you are using subitems, then select the  Active  boxes in both     the provider and import scenario. The following elements are related to subitems: Subitem : The subitem ID for the assembly in the BOM Summary area Matl Subitem : The subitem for the material on the Materials area. Required Fields In the following table, you can find the fields that must be filled on import. Target Object Filed / Action Name BOM Summary BOM ID BOM Summary Inventory ID BOM Summary Subitem (only if enabled) BOM Summary Warehouse Operations Open Nbr Operations Work Center Operations You can clear the  Active  check box for this          field in the import scenario to copy it from the work center Operation Description Operations You can clear the  Active  check          box for this field in the import scenario to copy it from the work center Backflush Labor (Default to Flash if null) Materials If there are no materials for an operation, all          materials columns need to be blank in the row.

Lead times are used to indicate when an action needs to take place.

)))
There can be multiple work calendars each with different time zones, working hours, and exceptions. An exception would be making a calendar holiday a non-working day or the reverse of making a weekend date a working day.{br}{TOC}
==Lead Time Components==
Your lead time should account for the total time it takes when you recognize a demand to the when the item is available to be shipped. This would include the time necessary to review requirements, source and select how it will be acquired (for example, do you find potential suppliers and get quotes, or does engineering need to review it?), prepare a requisition if necessary, obtain approval, create the order, send it to supplier or plant, vendor/factory production time, transport time from supplier/plant to distribution point, receiving and inspection.{br}

The purpose of a lead time is to provide you with sufficient time to source purchased items or to start and complete production processes in order to satisfy customer demand. Padding lead times with excessive days may lead to placing or starting orders too far in advance and do not necessarily improve on-time delivery or completion performance.
==How Manufacturing Uses Calendars with Lead Times==
There are multiple forms (listed below) where you select a working calendar to use. When computing dates, the appropriate calendar is used.
*Bill of Material
**[HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_70_00|Work Centers] ([~/?ScreenId=AM207000|AM207000]): The calendar is used to determine the working days available hours each day and is used when calculating operation planned start and completion dates for variable lead times.
*Production Management
**[HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_10_20_00|Production Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AM102000|AM102000]): You can specify a global calendar to use to fixed manufacturing lead times and indicate if you will set manufacturing fixed lead times to be hours or days.
**[HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_15_00|Production Order Maintenance] ([~/?ScreenId=AM201500|AM201500]): You can decide whether to use fixed manufacturing days for an individual production order
*Material Requirements Planning
**[HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_10_00_00|MRP Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AM100000|AM100000]): A calendar is specified to be used for purchase orders.

==Purchase Lead Times==
Purchase lead time are always fixed and not variable by order quantity so you should set them based on a typical order size. The lead times for items having a replenishment source of Purchasing use the lead time from the default vendor location which can be adjusted for a specific item and warehouse. If an item does not have a default vendor the lead time from the Manufacturing tab is used. For example, the lead time for a vendor location is 10 calendar days but certain items may need additional 5 days or require 5 less days. The MRP Regeneration process uses the purchase lead time to calculate the action date; if the action date is not a working day in the purchase palendar, the action date is moved back to the first working day. The vendor lead time and purchase calendar are used for all purchase orders, including those created by the Critical Materials process in production management, is set on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_10_00_00|MRP Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AM100000|AM100000]) form.
==Manufacturing Lead Times==
In both MRP and production management, you can choose to use fixed or variable lead times. When using fixed lead times, you must specify a work calendar to use so that dates will only fall on a working day. If you use variable lead times, then both will use the routing operation times in hours to calculate the planned starting and ending dates. With fixed lead times used for production orders, all operations will start or end on the corresponding start or end dates for the production order. Operation lead times include the following elements:
*''Queue'': This is the fixed wait time in hours before an operation can start. Typically, you would use this as an allowance for printing paperwork (drawings, work instructions), pulling parts from the stock room, issuing parts, and obtaining tooling and jigs.
*:((({S:Warn}Currently this element is not used.
)))
*''Setup Time'': This is a fixed time element for setting up the operation.
*''Run Time'': The time is multiplied by the remaining quantity to produce and is used when the work center '''Basis for Capacity''' is set to ''Crew Size''.
*''Machine Time'': The time is multiplied by the remaining quantity to produce and is used when the work center '''Basis for Capacity''' is set to ''Machines''.
*''Move'': This is a fixed element after operation completes before it is available at the next operation. The default move time is set in production preferences but it can be changed in production details.
*:((({S:Warn}Currently this element is not used.
)))

The operation times are calculated and converted to days, hours, and minutes as follows:{br}

{{{{Set Up Hours + ((Qty to Produce * Run Time) / Run Units)
}}}}{br}

{{{{Set Up Hours + ((Qty to Produce * Machine Time) / Machine Units)
}}}}{br}

If ''Run Units'' or ''Machine Units'' are zero, then the hours are zero.{br}

The work calendar hours for each work center are then used to calculate the operation start and end dates based solely the number of hours required in each work center. An internal timer is used to determine the relative time at each operation as follows:
*Capacity is assumed to infinite
*''Crew Size'' and ''Number of Machines'' are not used.
*'''Work Center Efficiency''' is not used
*Only the total working hours in a work center; that is, if the work hours are 8 am to 5pm with an unpaid break time of 1 hour, then 8 hours are available that day regardless of the time of day.
*Only the first row from the '''Work Center Shifts''' tab is used

==Example==
Assume the production order starts on Monday and there are 8 working hours in each work center Monday through Friday. The order has three operations and the total fixed and variable time for each operation is 6 hours.
*Operation 1 starts on 00:00 relative time on Monday and completes at 06:00 on Monday.
*Operation 2 starts at 06:00 relative time on Monday and consumes the remaining 2 hours for today and runs from 00:00 to 04:00 relative time on Tuesday.
*Operation 3 starts at 04:00 relative time on Tuesday and consumes the remaining 4 hours available that day and runs on Wednesday 00:00 to 02:00.

If the order started on a Friday and Saturday and Sunday are non-working days, then the Operation would not complete until the next Monday.]]></column>

The costing of item you make is more complex and detailed than items you buy. You not only have the cost of the materials bought to make an item but also the cost of labor, factory overhead, machinery and/or tooling used in production. And there may be sub-assemblies produced and stored that are input to final assembly of the finished goods items you sell.{br}

Manufacturing costings starts with defining the labor rates for each work center, labor cost rates for production employees if labor is to be entered, overhead rates and application methods, rates for machines and tools used in production. These costs are defined in the Bill of Material module which is the foundation for all other manufacturing modules.{br}

When you create a bill of material you are also creating the planned or standard cost of the item being produced. Once the bill of material is complete, and the bills for any sub-assemblies needed for the final assembly, a cost roll process on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_50_80_00|Cost Roll] ([~/?ScreenId=AM508000|AM508000]) form is used to roll up these costs.
*If the valuation method for the item is ''Standard'', you can update the pending cost of the item and then use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_20_00|Update Standard Costs] ([~/?ScreenId=IN502000|IN502000]) form to apply the new cost.
*When a production order is created, the cost roll is again used to create the planned production costs.
*When production transactions are entered, a cost is applied and posted to the work in process account.
*When production is completed, a costing production receipt is calculated for the value of inventory received. For details, see [HelpRoot_Manufacturing\AM_PM_ProdOrdCosting|Costing Production Receipts].

==Cost Elements Used in Manufacturing==
Costs are broken down into the following on bills of materials, estimates, and production orders:
*'''Materials''': The value of the components used to make the stock item. These can be both stock items and non-stock items. For stock items the planned cost is obtained from the '''Price/Cost''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form. For production transactions the actual cost is updated when the inventory issue transaction is processed and released.
*'''Labor''': The value of labor issued or planned to be issued to make the stock item. Planned labor is calculated based on the run units, run time, and work center standard cost. Actual labor is either calculated based on the work center standard cost or the employee cost rate. If labor is backflushed, the time is calculated automatically based on the quantity reported and costed using the work center standard cost.
**'''Fixed Labor:''' if the cost of setup for an operation. Setup is always posted to actual costs when the first quantity is reported for an operation
**'''Variable Labor:''' This is the costs calculated for run units and times
*'''Overhead:''' The value of overhead rates applied to operations and materials. For actual overhead, it is applied only when a quantity is reported for an operation.
**'''Fixed Overhead:''' This represents an amount charged regardless of lot or order size. The the overhead type is ''Fixed''
** '''Variable Overhead:''' This represents overhead calculated on the basis of labor, machines, or quantity.
*'''Subcontract:''' This represent the cost of materials provided to and purchased from a vendor for performing the work.
*'''Machine:''' This is the cost of running a machine for an operation.
*'''Tools:''' This is the cost of tools consumed at an operation.

You may have a need to have some or all of your production processes contracted out to vendors. If could be for a process that you cannot perform in house such as plating or heat treating. You could use a contract manufacturer or subcontractor when your own capacity is not available or if the contractor does repacking operations for you such as creating variety or gifts packs from multiple products. In some industries, contract manufacturing is pretty common: circuit boards; food and beverage; pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, and cosmetics; or aerospace and defense.{br}{TOC}
==Determining Your Needs==
These are some of the questions to ponder:
#Do the contractors hold inventory for you?
#How will you determine when or if to replenish the inventory at the contractor(s)?
#Will you be supplying some of the components?
##By transferring from your inventory?
##By placing purchase orders with delivery to the contractor?
#Are services included in the purchase price of the product received by you or are there separate charges for product and labor?
#What visibility do you need for work being performed by the contractor?

For the purposes of this article we will use the term ''contractor'' to refer to someone who is performing production work on your behalf and the term ''vendor'' when referring to someone you buy from for any materials you supply to the contractor. Of course, the contractor is a vendor also since you are buying services or product from them.
==Inventory Visibility and Replenishment==
If you are supplying components, either by transferring from your inventory or by purchasing to the contractor location, you can create a warehouse for contractor or use a warehouse location. Regardless a transfer or purchase receipt will need to be performed to update the on hand balances. If you are sending out items to be processed (such as painting or coating) then you may opt to track them using the production order.{br}

'''Warehouse Location'''{br}

All inventory in warehouse locations is considered as on hand for availability, inventory replenishment, and/or MRP calculations unless excluded. This may not be an issue if component inventory is only held at the contractor.{br}

If you create a purchase order to replenish inventory at the contractor you will need to ensure that you specify the correct warehouse location for the purchase receipt when notified.{br}

For transfers within a warehouse only one-step transfer types are allowed. There is no tracking of the in transit inventory. This may not be an issue with contractors nearby your location.{br}

You can use the standard inventory inquiries and reports to view the inventory by location within a warehouse.{br}

'''Separate Warehouse'''{br}

A separate warehouse may offer greater flexibility in some ways. You can use the inventory one-step transfer but you may also use the inventory two-step transfer if tracking the in transit inventory is desired. Additionally, a separate warehouse allows you to use a Sales Order transfer order type. The transfer order moves through the same processes as sales orders to prepare shipments and shipment paperwork, including carrier labels, and to collect freight/landed costs.{br}

With a separate warehouse you can use Inventory Replenishment and/or MRP to maintain any desired inventory levels at the contractor warehouse. You can also decide to exclude this warehouse completely from MRP.{br}

'''Tracking Inventory Using Production Orders'''{br}

If you are purchasing a service to perform an operation on material you supply for each production order (for example, sending out an item to be powder coated) it may suffice to track the status using a production order. You would issue the materials from your inventory to the production order. The production order operation indicates the inventory issued, the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_20_00|Inventory Allocation Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) form would show the inventory issued under the '''Work in Process''' column, and the production order holds the materials issued value.((({S:Hint}Vendor shipments created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_31_00_00|Vendor Shipments] (AM31000) form can be used to transfer the production item and the components you are supplying to the vendor without having to create a separate warehouse or warehouse location. If you do stock items at a vendor warehouse in advance of production then a separate warehouse or stock location is recommended.
)))
==Stock and Non-Stock Items==
You would create an inventory item to recognize the cost of an item being produced and returned to you. For example, the contractor is filling containers you have supplied with materials they supply; you will be billed for the cost of the materials in the container and labor applied to create the product. Remember that the cost of vendor supplied materials should reflect the added value and not include the cost of materials you provided; those materials costs are recognized when you issue them to the production order.{br}

The inventory item would be used to purchase the service and its receipt would serve as a signal to complete the operation. You can use a stock or non-stock inventory item for the services cost.{br}

'''Stock Item'''{br}

The advantages of using a stock item are the following:[anchor|#_66bb504c-0fb9-4d05-a388-e4d6743dcb40]
*Purchase orders for a stock item are allocated to the production order and are changed to stock allocations when received. The [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_55_00|Unreleased Material Allocations] ([~/?ScreenId=AM305500|AM305500]) form can be used to issue the allocated stock items.
*Stock item can use any valuation method and may better reflect the purchase cost of the service.
*Stock items can be planned by MRP.
*Transport costs can be applied to the unit costs of services received.

'''Non-Stock Inventory Item'''{br}

You can also create a non-stock item to recognize costs for services that are separately billed or when services are the only charge. Non-stock inventory items can only use standard cost valuation. You can use a different non-stock item for each contractor service charge or use the same item for each service charge. If you use the same item set the standard cost equal to 1.00 and use the quantity required column on the bill of materials for the contractor amount. For example, the contractor charges .53 per piece for one item and 1.23 for another; you would set the quantity required to .53 and 1.23 respectively. Non-stock items cannot be allocated to a production order and must be issued or backflushed in order to post the cost at standard cost. You can decide if a purchase order receipt is required for the non-stock item or not. Requiring a receipt allows the matching of the receipt to the vendor bill.
==Generated Transactions for Non-Stock Items Used for Services==
If you use non-stock items for materials used in outside processing, and according to business processes of your organization costs of these items must be accrued, you select the '''Accrue Cost''' check box on the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. With this check box selected and when the '''Require Receipt''' check box is selected on the '''General Settings''' tab of the same form, the system posts costs of materials when receiving the items to the warehouse of your organization and releasing a production order to the Expense Accrual account. Transactions generated on the inventory receipt release are listed in the following table.[anchor|#_1d4d0ee5-24fb-4f5b-9f37-f6bcd9723a1c]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%"

If the '''Accrue Cost''' check box is selected on the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab and the '''Require Receipt''' check box is cleared on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form for the non-stock item used for outside services, then you create the AP bill with this non-stock item. When you release the AP bill, the transactions listed in the following table are generated.[anchor|#_4b03581e-57fb-4b8d-9b37-93c643e99407]

When you issue or backflush the non-stock item for a production order, transactions listed in the following table are generated.[anchor|#_9de972d3-9a1a-4979-8791-2b7cf367f235]

If the '''Accrue Cost''' check box is cleared on the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form, the amounts are posted to the Expense account instead of the Expense Accrual account.((({S:Warn}In the previous versions of Acumatica ERP Manufacturing Edition, we recommended that when using non-stock items for materials in outside processing you specify the same account for the Expense Accrual GL account and Expense GL account. This ensured the proper accounting. By using the same account for both the expense and accrual the amounts will offset; the Work in Process account specified in the production order will hold the expense of outside services to include in the product cost.
)))
==Bills of Material==
Because you can have more than one bill of material for a stock item, you can have a bill for in-house production and a different bill for the contractor.{br}

'''Work Centers'''{br}

Typically, you would want to post the contractor costs to the production order by issuing the inventory item. With the work center for the contractor(s) you can apply additional costs not covered by the purchase order such as overhead.{br}

When creating the work center, you should set the Standard Cost to zero so as not to add labor costs when reporting operation completions. The setup time can be use to indicate a fixed time required for the subcontract operation or if the time varies, use the run time.{br}

'''Backflushing'''{br}

Unless you need to do specific issues of lots or serial numbers, we would recommend backflushing the materials consumed or produced by the contractor. If you are using a stock inventory item for the service cost, process the purchase order receipt before issuing or backflushing the material to update the average or FIFO cost. If you are using a non-stock item and the services cost is different than planned, issue the non-stock item for the quantity needed to reflect the cost.
==Set Up Outside Process==
The enhanced outside process features can be used with both bills of material and estimates. DO the following to set up the outside process:
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_10_10|Numbering Sequences] ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) form, create a numbering sequence] to use for vendor shipments and enter it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_10_20_00|Production Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AM102000|AM102000]) form. On the same form you can specify settings for processing vendor shipments in the '''Vendor Shipment Settings''' section.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_70_00|Work Centers] ([~/?ScreenId=AM207000|AM207000]) form, create or modify work centers and select the '''Outside Process''' check box. The '''Mass Update''' button on the '''Where Used''' tab can be used to select or clear the '''Outside Process''' check box for some or all bills of material operations using the work center. However, it cannot update the material lines.
#Add stock items or non-stock items you will use to pay the vendor for their services.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_80_00|Bill of Material] ([~/?ScreenId=AM208000|AM208000]) form, create or modify the bill of material for the item being produced for each material used for the outsource operation as follows:
##Select the '''Material Type''' of ''Subcontract'' and enter the appropriate '''Subcontract Source'''.
##Enter the appropriate vendor information on the '''Outside Process''' tab of the operation.
##Specify the warehouse if different from the bill of material warehouse from which you will issue the ''Ship to Vendor'' materials.
#If you have an existing production created before step 2, you can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_90_00|Production Order Details] ([~/?ScreenId=AM209000|AM209000]) from to setup the outside process operations.

==Process Flow==
The process flow is the following:
#Create a the production order in either of the following forms:
#*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_15_00|Production Order Maintenance] ([~/?ScreenId=AM201500|AM201500])
#*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_40_00_00|MRP Display] ([~/?ScreenId=AM400000|AM400000])
#*[HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000])
#*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_51_00_00|Create Production Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=AM510000|AM510000])
#Create the purchase order to pay the vendor for the service. You can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_50_00|Create Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) form to create one or more purchase orders for one or more production orders, the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_40_10_00|Critical Materials] ([~/?ScreenId=AM401000|AM401000]) form, or the '''Create PO''' action on the '''Outside Process''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_90_00|Production Order Details] ([~/?ScreenId=AM209000|AM209000]) form for a single production order and purchase order. Any of these methods create an allocation from the purchase order to the production order. You can view the created purchase by clicking the '''Allocations''' button for the material line on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_90_00|Production Order Details] form.
#Release the production order by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_15_00|Production Order Maintenance] ([~/?ScreenId=AM201500|AM201500]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_50_00_00|Release Production Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=AM500000|AM500000]) form.
#Issue any materials required for the operations you perform prior to the outside process step that are not marked for backflush from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_15_00|Production Order Maintenance] form or by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_00_00|Materials] ([~/?ScreenId=AM300000|AM300000]) form.
#Enter any required move or labor transactions you perform in house prior to the outside process step on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_20_00|Move] ([~/?ScreenId=AM302000|AM302000]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_10_00|Labor] ([~/?ScreenId=AM301000|AM301000]) forms .
#Enter the vendor shipments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_31_00_00|Vendor Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=AM310000|AM310000]) form.
#Print the pick list by using the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\AM_64_40_00|Vendor Shipment Pick List] ([~/?ScreenId=AM644000|AM644000]) report.
#Enter any required lot or serial numbers for the production item and materials and confirm the vendor shipment. This will issue the ''Ship to Vendor'' materials and update the subcontract actual cost.
#On the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\AM_64_20_00|Vendor Shipment Packing List] ([~/?ScreenId=AM642000|AM642000]) form, print the pick lists that will accompany the items being sent to vendor.
#Receive the purchase order used to pay the vendor for the outside service. This will update the subcontract actual cost with the actual purchase cost.
#Issue any materials needed for the remaining operations
#Complete the remaining operations for the production order using Move or Labor transactions.
#Review the production order variances and resolve any discrepancies
#Close the production order individually or by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_50_60_00|Close Production Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=AM506000|AM506000]) form.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Outside Processing You may have a need to have some or all of your production processes contracted out to         vendors. If could be for a process that you cannot perform in house such as plating or heat         treating. You could use a contract manufacturer or subcontractor when your own capacity is         not available or if the contractor does repacking operations for you such as creating         variety or gifts packs from multiple products. In some industries, contract manufacturing is         pretty common: circuit boards; food and beverage; pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, and         cosmetics; or aerospace and defense. Determining Your Needs These are some of the questions to ponder: Do the contractors hold inventory for you? How will you determine when or if to replenish the inventory at the contractor(s)? Will you be supplying some of the components? By transferring from your inventory? By placing purchase orders with delivery to the contractor? Are services included in the purchase price of the product received by you or are there           separate charges for product and labor? What visibility do you need for work being performed by the contractor? For the purposes of this article we will use the term  contractor  to refer to someone         who is performing production work on your behalf and the term  vendor  when referring         to someone you buy from for any materials you supply to the contractor. Of course, the         contractor is a vendor also since you are buying services or product from them. Inventory Visibility and Replenishment If you are supplying components, either by transferring from your inventory or by         purchasing to the contractor location, you can create a warehouse for contractor or use a         warehouse location. Regardless a transfer or purchase receipt will need to be performed to         update the on hand balances. If you are sending out items to be processed (such as painting         or coating) then you may opt to track them using the production order. Warehouse Location All inventory in warehouse locations is considered as on hand for availability, inventory         replenishment, and/or MRP calculations unless excluded. This may not be an issue if         component inventory is only held at the contractor. If you create a purchase order to replenish inventory at the contractor you will need to         ensure that you specify the correct warehouse location for the purchase receipt when         notified. For transfers within a warehouse only one-step transfer types are allowed. There is no         tracking of the in transit inventory. This may not be an issue with contractors nearby your         location. You can use the standard inventory inquiries and reports to view the inventory by location         within a warehouse. Separate Warehouse A separate warehouse may offer greater flexibility in some ways. You can use the inventory         one-step transfer but you may also use the inventory two-step transfer if tracking the in         transit inventory is desired. Additionally, a separate warehouse allows you to use a Sales         Order transfer order type. The transfer order moves through the same processes as sales         orders to prepare shipments and shipment paperwork, including carrier labels, and to collect         freight/landed costs. With a separate warehouse you can use Inventory Replenishment and/or MRP to maintain any         desired inventory levels at the contractor warehouse. You can also decide to exclude this         warehouse completely from MRP. Tracking Inventory Using Production Orders If you are purchasing a service to perform an operation on material you supply for each         production order (for example, sending out an item to be powder coated) it may suffice to         track the status using a production order. You would issue the materials from your inventory         to the production order. The production order operation indicates the inventory issued, the             ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) Inventory Allocation Details (IN402000) form would show the inventory         issued under the  Work in Process  column, and the production order         holds the materials issued value. Vendor shipments created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM310000|AM310000]) Vendor Shipments (AM31000)         form can be used to transfer the production item and the components you are supplying to the         vendor without having to create a separate warehouse or warehouse location. If you do stock         items at a vendor warehouse in advance of production then a separate warehouse or stock         location is recommended. Stock and Non-Stock Items You would create an inventory item to recognize the cost of an item being produced and         returned to you. For example, the contractor is filling containers you have supplied with         materials they supply; you will be billed for the cost of the materials in the container and         labor applied to create the product. Remember that the cost of vendor supplied materials         should reflect the added value and not include the cost of materials you provided; those         materials costs are recognized when you issue them to the production order. The inventory item would be used to purchase the service and its receipt would serve as a         signal to complete the operation. You can use a stock or non-stock inventory item for the         services cost. Stock Item The advantages of using a stock item are the following: Purchase orders for a stock item are allocated to the production order and are changed           to stock allocations when received. The   ([~/?ScreenId=AM305500|AM305500]) Unreleased Material Allocations (AM305500) form           can be used to issue the allocated stock items. Stock item can use any valuation method and may better reflect the purchase cost of the           service. Stock items can be planned by MRP. Transport costs can be applied to the unit costs of services received. Non-Stock Inventory Item You can also create a non-stock item to recognize costs for services that are separately         billed or when services are the only charge. Non-stock inventory items can only use standard         cost valuation. You can use a different non-stock item for each contractor service charge or         use the same item for each service charge. If you use the same item set the standard cost         equal to 1.00 and use the quantity required column on the bill of materials for the         contractor amount. For example, the contractor charges .53 per piece for one item and 1.23         for another; you would set the quantity required to .53 and 1.23 respectively. Non-stock         items cannot be allocated to a production order and must be issued or backflushed in order         to post the cost at standard cost. You can decide if a purchase order receipt is required         for the non-stock item or not. Requiring a receipt allows the matching of the receipt to the         vendor bill. Generated Transactions for Non-Stock Items Used for Services If you use non-stock items for materials used in outside processing, and according to         business processes of your organization costs of these items must be accrued, you select the            Accrue Cost  check box on the  Price/Cost           Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form. With         this check box selected and when the  Require Receipt  check box is         selected on the  General Settings  tab of the same form, the system         posts costs of materials when receiving the items to the warehouse of your organization and         releasing a production order to the Expense Accrual account. Transactions generated on the         inventory receipt release are listed in the following table.  Account Source of Account Debit Credit Expense Accrual account Item Amount 0.00 PO Accrual account Item 0.00 Amount If the  Accrue Cost  check box is selected on the            Price/Cost Information  tab and the  Require           Receipt  check box is cleared on the  General Settings          tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items form for the non-stock item used for outside         services, then you create the AP bill with this non-stock item. When you release the AP         bill, the transactions listed in the following table are generated.  Account Source of Account Debit Credit Expense account Item Amount 0.00 AP account Item 0.00 Amount When you issue or backflush the non-stock item for a production order, transactions listed         in the following table are generated.  Account Source of Account Debit Credit Work in Process account Item Amount 0.00 Expense Accrual account Item 0.00 Amount If the  Accrue Cost  check box is cleared on the  Price/Cost           Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items form, the amounts are         posted to the Expense account instead of the Expense Accrual account. In the previous versions of  Acumatica ERP Manufacturing Edition, we recommended that when using non-stock items for materials in outside processing you         specify the same account for the Expense Accrual GL account and Expense GL account. This         ensured the proper accounting. By using the same account for both the expense and accrual         the amounts will offset; the Work in Process account specified in the production order will         hold the expense of outside services to include in the product cost. Bills of Material Because you can have more than one bill of material for a stock item, you can have a bill         for in-house production and a different bill for the contractor. Work Centers Typically, you would want to post the contractor costs to the production order by issuing         the inventory item. With the work center for the contractor(s) you can apply additional         costs not covered by the purchase order such as overhead. When creating the work center, you should set the Standard Cost to zero so as not to add         labor costs when reporting operation completions. The setup time can be use to indicate a         fixed time required for the subcontract operation or if the time varies, use the run         time. Backflushing Unless you need to do specific issues of lots or serial numbers, we would recommend         backflushing the materials consumed or produced by the contractor. If you are using a stock         inventory item for the service cost, process the purchase order receipt before issuing or         backflushing the material to update the average or FIFO cost. If you are using a non-stock         item and the services cost is different than planned, issue the non-stock item for the         quantity needed to reflect the cost. Set Up Outside Process The enhanced outside process features can be used with both bills of material and         estimates. DO the following to set up the outside process: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) Numbering Sequences (CS201010) form, create a numbering           sequence] to use for vendor shipments and enter it on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM102000|AM102000]) Production Preferences           (AM102000) form. On the same form you can specify settings for processing vendor shipments           in the  Vendor Shipment Settings  section. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM207000|AM207000]) Work Centers (AM207000) form, create or modify work centers           and select the  Outside Process  check box. The  Mass             Update  button on the  Where Used  tab can be used to           select or clear the  Outside Process  check box for some or all bills           of material operations using the work center. However, it cannot update the material           lines. Add stock items or non-stock items you will use to pay the vendor for their           services. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM208000|AM208000]) Bill of Material (AM208000) form, create or modify the bill of           material for the item being produced for each material used for the outsource operation as follows: Select the  Material Type  of  Subcontract  and enter the               appropriate  Subcontract Source . Enter the appropriate vendor information on the  Outside                 Process  tab of the operation. Specify the warehouse if different from the bill of material warehouse from which               you will issue the  Ship to Vendor  materials. If you have an existing production created before step 2, you can use the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM209000|AM209000]) Production Order Details (AM209000) from to setup the outside process operations. Process Flow The process flow is the following: Create a the production order in either of the following forms:  ([~/?ScreenId=AM201500|AM201500]) Production Order Maintenance (AM201500)  ([~/?ScreenId=AM400000|AM400000]) MRP Display (AM400000)  ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000)  ([~/?ScreenId=AM510000|AM510000]) Create Production Orders (AM510000) Create the purchase order to pay the vendor for the service. You can use the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) Create Purchase Orders (PO505000) form to create one or more purchase           orders for one or more production orders, the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM401000|AM401000]) Critical Materials (AM401000)           form, or the  Create PO  action on the  Outside             Process  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM209000|AM209000]) Production Order Details (AM209000) form for a           single production order and purchase order. Any of these methods create an allocation from           the purchase order to the production order. You can view the created purchase by clicking           the  Allocations  button for the material line on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM209000|AM209000]) Production Order Details form. Release the production order by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM201500|AM201500]) Production Order Maintenance (AM201500) or               ([~/?ScreenId=AM500000|AM500000]) Release Production Orders (AM500000) form. Issue any materials required for the operations you perform prior to the outside process           step that are not marked for backflush from the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM201500|AM201500]) Production Order Maintenance form or by           using the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM300000|AM300000]) Materials (AM300000) form. Enter any required move or labor transactions you perform in house prior to the outside           process step on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM302000|AM302000]) Move (AM302000) or   ([~/?ScreenId=AM301000|AM301000]) Labor (AM301000) forms . Enter the vendor shipments on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM310000|AM310000]) Vendor Shipments (AM310000) form.

A planning bill of material, sometimes referred to as a ''Pseudo Bill'', is a grouping of operations and materials used in MRP for planning purposes. They are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_80_00|Bill of Material] ([~/?ScreenId=AM208000|AM208000]) form exactly the same way as a production bill. You can choose to designate any bill of material for an item as the planning bill or create a new unique bill. If you do not have a planning bill, then the default bill of material is used for planning. There are no restrictions on using the same bill of material as both the default and planning bill.{br}{TOC}
==Why Use a Planning Bill?==
Planning bills are most often used to help forecast or master schedule products that have many options where the final configuration is not determined until an order is received. Usually, a planning bill flattens out the multiple level bill of material to a single level bill; that is, the subassembly bills are removed and their key components made components of the planning bill. Alternatively, you could create a planning stock item and construct a planning bill with its components the actual items you sell making each component a phantom if you only want to see their components in MRP and not the assembly.{br}

A manufacturer of desktop computers may have multiple product lines with hundreds of combination of options for processors, memory, storage, monitors, etc. Some of the options may be available across multiple product lines. In order to compress the order to ship lead time, it is desirable to have the components already in stock. Rather than attempt to forecast each product model for every variant, it more feasible to create a pseudo inventory item that will never be sold and construct a planning bill of material with the component options expressed in quantities represented by their past usage.{br}

For example, each desktop computer model can have a 500GB or 1TB capacity disk drive and 60% of the customer select the 1TB disk drive. A planning bill could look like this:
===Planning Bill of Material for All Desktop Computers===
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!'''Component'''
! '''Quantity Required'''
|- 
| DiskDrive-1TB
| .6
|- 
| DiskDrive-500GB
| .4 
|}
You would create a forecast or MPS for the planning stock item to drive out the requirements to make or purchase the disk drives. Similarly, you would add other components to the planning bills in their percentages.
==Managing MRP with Planning Bills==
It&rsquo;s important to consider that both the planning item and stock items are driving down component demand. The planning bill is intended to represent anticipated sales in the future so as to make or buy the necessary components in a timely manner. When you enter the sales orders or production orders for the items to be sold, they will drive component demand also.
*As customer orders are received, you should reduce the forecast or MPS for the planning item so as not to overstate the component demand. You can use the Planning Horizon setting in MRP Preferences to specify when to ignore forecasts and use just actual demand. For example, you expect customers to typically place orders 2 weeks in advance of anticipated ship dates; therefore, you would set the forecast '''Planning Horizon''' or MPS '''Time Fence''' to 14 days.
*You should review the actual component usage and periodically adjust their percentages in the planning bill.

This is not a complete list of all of the Data Access Classes (DAC) used by the Manufacturing forms for Acumatica ERP. All DAC and the underlying database tables start with AM; for example {{JAMS.AM.AMBatch}} is the DAC and {{AMBatch}} is the table.{br}

All columns added to Acumatica ERP forms as a customization are stored in extension tables. The name of an extension table is {{<base table>AMExtension}}; such as {{InventoryItemAMExtension}}. Each added column has ''AM'' as the prefix, such as {{AMBOMID}}. For example, if you wanted to get a list of the bills of material by a warehouse you would access the {{PX.Objects.IN.INItemSite}} DAC and use the {{AMBOMID}} column.{br}{TOC}

'''Using Configuration Results in a Report'''{br}

For example, to produce a query of all sales order lines with a configured item you can use {{AMConfigurationResults}} and link it to {{SOLine}} by using the following: {{OrdTypeRef = OrderType}}, {{OrdNbrRef = OrderNbr}}, and {{OrdLineRef = LineNbr}}.{br}

Getting a list of the options selected for a configuration result is a bit more complex. Link the data as follows:
*{{AMConfigResultsOption}} to {{AMConfigurationResults}} by using {{ConfigResultsId}}
*{{AMConfigResultsOption}} to {{AMConfigResultsFeature}} by using {{ConfigResultsId}}, {{FeatureLineNbr}}. Use the Included flag to get only the options that were selected.
*{{AMConfigResultsFeature}} to {{AMConfigurationFeature}} by using {{ConfigurationID}}, {{Revision}}, and {{AMConfigResultsFeature}}{{FeatureLineNbr = AMConfigurationFeature.LineNbr}} to get the {{FeatureID}}

'''Joining Configuration Results to Sales and CRM Documents'''{br}

For sales orders, you use the following:
*{{AMConfigurationResults}} to {{SOLine}}
**{{ordTypeRef}} to {{orderType}}
**{{ordNbrRef}} to {{orderNbr}}
**{{ordLineRef}} to {{LineNbr}}

For CRM opportunities or CRM quote, you use the following:((({S:Warn}The products table is linked to the {{CRQuote}} by the {{QuoteID}} because the details are contained in the opportunity.
)))
*{{AMConfigurationResults}} to {{CROpportunityProducts}}
**{{OpportunityQuoteID}} to {{QuoteID}}
**{{OpportunityLineNbr}} to {{LineNbr}}

Attributes created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_50_00|Attributes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) form are used for multiple purposes in Acumatica ERP. In many cases they eliminate for customizing forms and when attached to a record, for example, a stock item record, they are automatically available for use in inquiries. You can use attributes in manufacturing forms as well.
==Using Attributes in Bills of Material and Production Orders ==
Attributes can be attached to bills of material header and/or operations and are copied onto the production order when the order is created. Attributes can be specified for each production order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_11_00|Production Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=AM201100|AM201100]) form. Attributes can also be added to a production order manually by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_15_00|Production Order Maintenance] ([~/?ScreenId=AM201500|AM201500]) form.{br}

Attributes created at the BOM level become order level attributes for the production order. If an order level attribute is enabled for data entry it is available when reporting all operations of the production order. For example, you could create a required attribute for a quality control check for all operations or to record a process value.{br}

If enabled attribute values can be entered for the production order and operation when you enter a move or labor transaction by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_PM_ProdAttributes|Production Attribute Entry] form. If an attribute is marked as ''Transaction Required'', it must be entered. The attribute values entered during production reporting are specific to the transaction.
==Using Attributes in Product Configurator==
Attributes have the following purposes in the product configurator:[anchor|#_f5590dce-4151-41bd-850e-0a5983cdc233]
*They can be used to collect data used in formulas to calculate the quantity required for an option. For example, calculating the quantity required based on an attribute value for length.
*They can be used to capture a value used in production. For example, the text for printing or engraving on a custom piece.
*They can be used to with rules to include or exclude features and options.

Attributes and their values used on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_60_00|Configuration Entry] ([~/?ScreenId=AM306000|AM306000]) form are copied to the production order created as view only.]]></column>

This features provides the ability to have work centers automatically substituted during production order creation based on the warehouse used for production. It can eliminate the need to have warehouse specific bills of material. A company may have multiple production facilities where an item can be made. The components use to make the end item are the same, although they may have different costs, and the production process is the same but the production facilities have different labor and overhead rates.{br}

To use this feature, you must have the ''Multiple Warehouse'' feature enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
==Substituting Work Centers==
The substitution of work centers is controlled by the '''Substitute Work Centers''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_11_00|Production Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=AM201100|AM201100]) form. Substitutes for each work center are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_70_00|Work Centers] ([~/?ScreenId=AM207000|AM207000]) form.{br}

If the order type allows substitute work centers, then during production order creation or change of warehouse, and the order is in a planned status the process will look at the current work centers. If the current work center warehouse used for the production order does not match the warehouse for the production order the substitute logic will try to find a substitute from the work center substitute work centers tab were the warehouse on the substitute tab matches the current production warehouse.{br}

When substituted the work center description can replace the operation description based on the setting on the work center.{br}

The Bills of Material part of the Acumatica ERP Manufacturing edition is the foundation for all of the other parts of the edition. A ''bill of material'', or product structure, is a list of the production operations required to build a single level assembly or subassembly. Bills of material become hierarchical when a subassembly is used as a component in another assembly or subassembly. The complete structure, from finished goods down through each subassembly down to raw materials, is referred to a multilevel bill of material.{br}

For each operation in a bill of material you specify the operation times (queue, setup, labor, machine, and move), the materials or components required, the machines available to use, and any tooling. Each element of a bill of material has an associated cost and these cost elements are rolled up level by level to calculate the total cost of the finished good. The rolled up cost becomes the standard or planned cost to produce an item.{br}

In the topics describing bills of material, you create work centers, work calendars, shifts, labor codes, overhead rates, machine, and tools. A work center has a defined capacity which is used by scheduling processes in the Material Requirements Planning and Production Management parts of Manufacturing edition to determine when an operation must be started and when it will be completed and when the materials will need to be issued.{br}

{br}{TOC}
==Key Features==[anchor|#_082b32f7-98f9-4482-b9a0-9b419022df99]
*BOM / Routing Maintenance: The BOM / Routing provides the ability to directly update the bills of material and routing information by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_80_00|Bill of Material] ([~/?ScreenId=AM208000|AM208000]) form.
*Planning Bills of Material: This process facilitates the forecast, or master production schedule, of product families and/or to order assemblies where the specific configuration is not known until you receive the customer order. For details, see [HelpRoot_Manufacturing\AM_PlanningBills|Planning Bills of Material].
*Activity Based Costing: The system provides a means to provide detailed costing well beyond the cost of the raw materials and labor. Tools costs can be consumed based on usage setup through the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_55_00|Tools] ([~/?ScreenId=AM205500|AM205500]) form. User-defined overhead costs can be setup through the [https://help-2020r1.acumatica.com/(W(9))/Wiki/ShowWiki|Overhead] (AM202500) form. These costs can be accrued at a fixed rate, by labor hour and by the quantity completed. The overhead costs can be associated to a specific product (BOM / routing) or they can be tied to a work center. You are not limited to a finite number of overhead IDs. The user can set up as many or as few as they want.
*Alternate BOM / Routing: Too often in manufacturing systems, the systems will only support a single bill of material for a finished good product. To setup alternate bills of material, you often had to set up multiple inventory items. Manufacturing edition provides you with the ability to set up a single finished good item (or subassembly) and create alternate BOMs and routings for that same product. A good use of this is in a situation where the manufacturer has multiple sites. However, they make the same product at the sites. All too often, the different sites have different machinery, work centers, shifts, costs, etc. The system allows you to set up a specific bill of material / routing for each site.
*Backflushing: The production transactions can backflush labor and materials and is controlled by the bills of material. By selecting the operations and materials that need to be backflushed this provides the user more control in how and what is being costed.
*:((({S:Warn}The system will backflush lot- and serial-tracked items based on the usage parameters.
)))
*By-Products Support: By-products are entered as negative materials on the BOM. These materials will be received into inventory at the cost specified on the BOM or at the standard cost if that is what is being used. By-products can be setup to backflush automatically or can be received by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_00_00|Materials] ([~/?ScreenId=AM300000|AM300000]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_50_30_00|Release AM Documents] ([~/?ScreenId=AM503000|AM503000]) forms.
*Phantoms: ''Phantom'' items can be entered on the BOM. They are referred to as phantoms because they show up on the BOM but disappear when a production order is created. Only manufactured items with a BOM can become phantoms.
*:Several advantages to phantoms in the system include the following: 
**Ability to be a true phantom or subassembly
**Phantoms can be stocked
**Multilevel phantoms are supported
**Changes to a phantom such as components or quantities when made at the BOM level are carried through the system
*Production Steps: Specific steps can be defined at the operation level. Steps are the instructions of what needs to be done for the operation. This allows for full documentation when added with any additional notes of the production process.
*Revision Tracking: A complete revision history of a BOM can be maintained. Multiple revisions can be saved to the revision history tables which provides the ability for the information from the past production BOM to be referenced instead of the most current revision.
*Shifts: Multiple shift operations are supported through this application through the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_50_00|Shifts] ([~/?ScreenId=AM205000|AM205000]) form. You can create as many shifts as is needed together with the following information:
**Work centers that are available
**Number of people or machines
**Efficiency factors
**Working times by shift
**Shift differential

This is where the production order needs can be defined for your inventory     items to become that finished good. What this section will cover: We will discuss the key features of the Bills of Material part. Relationship to other  Acumatica ERP      functional areas Key Features BOM / Routing Maintenance: The BOM / Routing provides the ability to directly update the      bills of material and routing information by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM208000|AM208000]) Bill of Material      (AM208000) form. Planning Bills of Material: This process facilitates the forecast, or master production      schedule, of product families and/or to order assemblies where the specific configuration is      not known until you receive the customer order. For details, see  Planning Bills of Material. Activity Based Costing: The system provides a means to provide detailed costing well beyond      the cost of the raw materials and labor. Tools costs can be consumed based on usage setup      through the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM205500|AM205500]) Tools (AM205500) form. User-defined overhead costs can be      setup through the  Overhead Overhead (AM202500) form. These costs can be accrued at      a fixed rate, by labor hour and by the quantity completed. The overhead costs can be associated      to a specific product (BOM / routing) or they can be tied to a work center. You are not limited      to a finite number of overhead IDs. The user can set up as many or as few as they want. Alternate BOM / Routing: Too often in manufacturing systems, the systems will only support a      single bill of material for a finished good product. To setup alternate bills of material, you      often had to set up multiple inventory items. Manufacturing edition provides you with the      ability to set up a single finished good item (or subassembly) and create alternate BOMs and      routings for that same product. A good use of this is in a situation where the manufacturer has      multiple sites. However, they make the same product at the sites. All too often, the different      sites have different machinery, work centers, shifts, costs, etc. The system allows you to set      up a specific bill of material / routing for each site. Backflushing: The production transactions can backflush labor and materials and is      controlled by the bills of material. By selecting the operations and materials that need to be      backflushed this provides the user more control in how and what is being costed. The       system will backflush lot- and serial-tracked items based on the usage parameters. By-Products Support: By-products are entered as negative materials on the BOM. These      materials will be received into inventory at the cost specified on the BOM or at the standard      cost if that is what is being used. By-products can be setup to backflush automatically or can      be received by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM300000|AM300000]) Materials (AM300000) or   ([~/?ScreenId=AM503000|AM503000]) Release AM Documents (AM503000) forms. Phantoms:  Phantom  items can be entered on the BOM. They are referred to as phantoms      because they show up on the BOM but disappear when a production order is created. Only      manufactured items with a BOM can become phantoms. Several advantages to phantoms in the       system include the following:  Ability to be a true phantom or subassembly Phantoms can be stocked Multilevel phantoms are supported Changes to a phantom such as components or quantities when made at the BOM level are        carried through the system Production Steps: Specific steps can be defined at the operation level. Steps are the      instructions of what needs to be done for the operation. This allows for full documentation      when added with any additional notes of the production process. Revision Tracking: A complete revision history of a BOM can be maintained. Multiple      revisions can be saved to the revision history tables which provides the ability for the      information from the past production BOM to be referenced instead of the most current      revision. Shifts: Multiple shift operations are supported through this application through the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM205000|AM205000]) Shifts (AM205000) form. You can create as many shifts as is needed together      with the following information: Work centers that are available Number of people or machines Efficiency factors Working times by shift Shift differential Relationship to Other Functional Areas Area Usage Inventory > Manufacturing Creation of a bill of material will fill in the  Primary BOM ID          box on the  Manufacturing  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form.

In this topic, you will find answers to the frequently asked questions about bills of material.{br}{TOC}
==How do I set up inventory items to be able to use a bill of material?==
The parent item must be a stock item. Materials, aka components, can be stock or non-stock.
==What should I use for the BOM ID?==
The BOM ID can be up to 15 characters. The numbering sequence specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_10_10_00|BOM Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AM101000|AM101000]) form defines the format of the BOM ID. As with all numbering sequences in Acumatica ERP, you may have different sequences by branch. You may choose auto-numbering or manual entry. Some may prefer to use the inventory id as the BOM ID when the inventory ID is less than 15 characters.((({S:Hint}When importing bills of material, generate a sequence in your import data to reflect the format of the ''BOM ID'' and check the ''Manual Numbering'' box in the numbering sequence. Prior to 2018R2, also uncheck '''Track Revision History''' in BOM Preferences. This way if you find a bill to be incorrect you can simply delete it and reimport using the same ''BOM ID'', otherwise it will assign a new number. With Track Revision History checked, bills of materials are not physically deleted; the end date is set to today instead. For 2018R2, a bill of material revision can be deleted as long as it&rsquo;s not referenced.
)))
==How many bills of material can an inventory item have?==
As many as you want but only one can be the default bill of material specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form for the item–warehouse pair. If you desire to have multiple bills of material for a warehouse because of alternate production methods, you might consider using manual numbering and use a suffix to indicate the alternate.{br}

You can also have multiple active revisions for a bill of material.
==How should I number the operations?==
You should provide for the insertion of new operations. They are sorted as text and not numbers; such as 00030, 020, 10 not 10, 020, 00030. Tips for creating operation numbers are the following:[anchor|#_eae1caac-cda6-4929-93ce-800092d8aea4]
*Do not use leading spaces
*Typically, a sequence of 010, 020, or 100, 110 or 0010, 0020, 0100 are used.
((({S:Hint}The operation numbers are regenerated when a production order is created from the bill to provide for the insertion of operations for a phantom. The numbering starts with 0010 and increments by 10.
)))
Operation numbers may be changed at any time.
==Where do the unit costs for materials in a bill come from?==
The [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form is the source for the cost when you add an inventory item to a bill or production order. The cost used is dependent on the item's valuation method. Unit costs can be manually entered or updated by the cost roll process on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_50_80_00|Cost Roll] ([~/?ScreenId=AM508000|AM508000]) form. When you add a new material the unit cost defaults from the settings of the item–warehouse pair according to the item's valuation method as follows:[anchor|#_a0efbca1-9503-488e-946b-333cb49edfa0]
*Average or FIFO: Average cost
*:((({S:Warn}If the average cost is zero, then the last cost is used.
)))
*Standard: Standard cost
*Specific: Last cost

For existing materials, the cost roll process can be used to update the unit costs if desired. When production orders are created, the cost roll process obtains the current cost for materials.
==How does the Cost Roll Process Calculate Costs?==

*If ''Batch Size'' is not zero (0) then Qty Required &#42; (1 + ''Scrap Factor'') &#42; (''Lot Size'' / ''Batch Size'')

)))

In all cases, the quantity will be rounded up if the ''Quantity Round Up'' is selected on the '''Manufacturing''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form.{br}

A reference designator identifies a component on drawings or work instructions. The designator may also be used as a reference to a list of components used multiple times on a drawing like a fastener. In electronics manufacturing they are often used to indicate the position of a component on a circuit board.

The cost roll process, performed by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_50_80_00|Cost Roll] ([~/?ScreenId=AM508000|AM508000]) form, is used to update the cost of assemblies. When assemblies use the ''Standard'' inventory valuation method, after the process completes, you can use the process to update the pending cost for all or selected assemblies. Before performing the cost roll process, you should review the pending or standard cost of any purchased items with the ''Standard'' valuation method that are used in bills of material.{br}

Typically, standard costs are updated on an annual basis but they can be updated at any time. In this topic, you will read about processes related to updating standard costs of items used in bills of material.
==Updating Pending Standard Costs of Purchased Components==
Before you roll up the costs of assemblies, you need to update the costs of components used in their bills of material. The is no automated process to do this but you can create a Generic Inquiry to export the purchase order history to analyze and calculate a new cost that could be imported to update the pending costs. The [HelpRoot_Manufacturing\AM_Tables|Using Manufacturing Data in Inquiries and Reports] topic lists the DACs or tables used by the manufacturing forms if you just want to select only items used in a bill.{br}

You can also update the pending cost for a item using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form.
==Previewing Cost Changes==
If you wish to review the component cost changes, before updating their standard costs, run the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_61_75_00|Standard Cost Change Preview] ([~/?ScreenId=IN617500|IN617500]) report.
==Rolling Up the Assembly Costs==
You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_50_80_00|Cost Roll] ([~/?ScreenId=AM508000|AM508000]) form with level set to ''Multi''. You make sure to check the appropriate options to '''Include Fixed Costs''' and '''Include Material Scrap Factors''' if they are used. When the cost roll is completed, on the form toolbar, click '''Update Pending'''to update the pending costs for all assemblies.{br}

You can select the '''Use Pending Standard for Purchased Items''' check box if you have not yet update your standard cost for components. This will use the component pending costs instead of their standard costs.{br}

You can perform the cost roll and update pending multiple times.
==Updating Standard Costs==
The process of updating standard costs for inventory items, which is run on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_20_00|Update Standard Costs] ([~/?ScreenId=IN502000|IN502000]), moves the pending cost to the standard cost and zeros out the pending cost. The process creates an adjustment batch on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_30_00|Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=IN303000|IN303000]) form to update the Inventory and Standard Cost Revaluation GL accounts.{br}

Inventory is always revalued when you run the update standard costs process. However, you might want to revalue inventory without updating the current costs of the items to the next pending cost. In this case, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_20_00|Update Standard Costs] form, you can select the '''Revalue Inventory''' check box. With the check box selected, the form shows all the standard items that have cost layers at the warehouse selected in the '''Warehouse''' box. If you run the update process, inventory will be revalued with the current cost, but the current cost will not be updated with the pending cost for the processed items.]]></column>

| Define the numbering sequences for bills of material and engineering change control
| [anchor|#_b04ab447-b9e1-466f-ac42-6f047c9a4607]
#Create a numbering sequence for the bill of material ID (BOM ID) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_10_10|Numbering Sequences] ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) form.
#Specify the sequence on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_10_10_00|BOM Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AM101000|AM101000]) form. Decide if automatic or manual numbering will be used and if you will use different sequences for each branch.
#If the functionality of engineering change control (ECC) is used, also create the numbering sequences for engineering change requests (ECR) and engineering change orders (ECO).

|- 
| 2
| Specify the default revision identifier
| You specify the identifier of the default revision in the '''Default Revision''' box of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_10_10_00|BOM Preferences] form. The identifier can be any alphanumeric string but a unique numbering or text should be used to define new revisions. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Manufacturing\AM_BOM_Revisions|Bill of Material Revisions].
|-

| Determine if duplicate materials will be allowed in the BOM and its operations
| In the '''Duplicates on BOM''' and '''Duplicates on Operation''' boxes of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_10_10_00|BOM Preferences] form, select one of the following values:[anchor|#_9b1472e6-b7df-4a13-9ec2-5b81b945b6b3]
*Allow
*Warn
*Not Allow

|- 
| 4
| Define a work calendar
| Use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_90_00|Work Calendar] ([~/?ScreenId=CS209000|CS209000]) form to define the available hours for the manufacturing floor.
|- 
| 5
| Define shifts
| Use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_50_00|Shifts] ([~/?ScreenId=AM205000|AM205000]) form to define the shifts and their differentials compared to base pay. Some shifts can work at different rates such as overtime or holiday pay. At least one shift is required for each work center.
|- 
| 6
| Define labor codes
| Use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_65_00|Labor Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AM206500|AM206500]) form to define the labor codes needed for costing and optionally labor entry. You must at least define a labor code with the ''Direct'' type.
|- 
| 7
| Define work centers
| Use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_70_00|Work Centers] ([~/?ScreenId=AM207000|AM207000]) form to define the areas where work will be performed. Normally these are areas of a warehouse intended to be used in the production processing such as assembly, cutting, painting, and testing. These can also be used to track outside processing. These track standard labor rates (optional), overheads (optional) and machines (optional). At least one work center is required.
|- 
| 8
| Determine labor posting methods
| Decide if you intend to post labor by backflush or by having your employees report their time against production orders. Backflush of labor posts the planned operation time at the work center standard rate to a production order automatically when an operation/work center has been passed in sequence or completed. Actual time is reported in production management by the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_10_00|Labor] ([~/?ScreenId=AM301000|AM301000]) form using either the employee rate or work center rate. Both methods can be used. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Manufacturing\AM_PROD_BFlush|Backflushing Concepts] and [HelpRoot_Manufacturing\AM_PM_ReportingLabor|Labor Reporting].
|- 
| 9
| Determine other BOM cost drivers
| These are different ways that add planned cost to a bill of material and inevitably, actual cost to a production order. These costs are posted when a quantity is reported or backflushed at a production order operation.[anchor|#_ca69de01-a5e2-4f29-b052-91b8d17931ad]

| Determine material issue methods
| Decide if you will report material issues to production orders by backflush or actual material pick quantities. Backflush of material issues the planned quantity at the actual of the stock or non-stock items to the production orders automatically when an operation/work center has been passed in sequence or completed. Actual material is reported via production management on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_00_00|Materials] ([~/?ScreenId=AM300000|AM300000]) form. Both methods can be used. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Manufacturing\AM_PROD_BFlush|Backflushing Concepts].
|- 
| 11
| Determine manufacturing warehouses
| Make sure that warehouses needed to produce, issue and receive stock items are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form.
|- 
| 12
| Determine inventory items to be manufactured or purchased.
| Manufactured or purchased items will need to be defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. In the ''Source'' column of the '''Replenishment Info''' tab, select ''Manufacturing'' for items that will be defined as a BOM. For items that must be purchased, ''Purchase'' or ''Transfer'' must be selected in this column.
|- 
| 13
| Determine if scrap will be required for material requirements calculations
| A scrap factor can be defined on materials that will increase the amount of material needed to fulfill the quantity required. This is defined in decimal form and is a percentage increase in required amount. <tt>1</tt> represents 100%, <tt>.5</tt> equals 50% and, <tt>0</tt> is 0%. Create reason codes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_21_10_00|Reason Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS211000|CS211000]) form if scrap will be written-off or quarantined. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Manufacturing\AM_Scrap|Handling Production Scrap and Waste].
|- 
| 14
| Determine the lot size for manufactured stock items
| Use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form to specify the lot size. The lot size is used to allocate fixed cost elements, such as setup and fixed overhead during cost update.

*Full Regeneration (FRG)
**A FRG can be scheduled to run in the middle of the night when most of the office personnel are not in the office. The FRG wipes out all the existing MRP data and pulls all the data in from across the system. It then replans what materials are required either to be produced or purchased.
**In Acumatica ERP, you can set up automated processing for most processing forms instead of initiating the processing manually. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Scheduled_Processing|Scheduled Processing].
*Suggested Replenishment Orders
**MRP generates planned orders to balance demand with supply. From MRP you convert the planned orders into actual purchase, transfer, and production orders.

This topic addresses the common question about the Material Requirements Planning processes.{br}{TOC}
==When should MRP be run?==
Generally, MRP should be run before each business day after all sales and purchase orders have been entered and after all transaction affecting inventory have been posted. Since this is a very resource dependent process, it should be run so as not to conflict with database maintenance processes.
==What is the Difference between the ''MRP Display'' and the ''MRP Exceptions''?==[anchor|#_bb96659f-a72d-4594-9057-4c3b1ade92dd]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_40_00_00|MRP Display] ([~/?ScreenId=AM400000|AM400000]) form, a list of suggested supply orders (aka planned orders) that need to be converted to actual purchase, production, or transfer orders is displayed.
*The primary use of MRP exceptions, displayed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_40_30_00|MRP Exceptions] ([~/?ScreenId=AM403000|AM403000]) form, is to execute the recommended actions on existing actual supply orders to meet requirements. This includes the following:
**Expediting or de-exediting existing purchase and production orders to meet demand;
**Canceling supply orders that are no longer needed;
**Transferring inventory from one warehouse to another to meet demand;
**Reviewing sales, purchase, and production orders that on hold and thus ignored by MRP;
**As a list of late purchase and production orders.

It is commonly the first thing a planner or buyer will look at, particularly for expedites, before looking at the new planned orders.
==Which Items are planned?==
All stock items with the '''MRP Item''' box selected on the '''Manufacturing''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. MRP plans at the item–warehouse level; that is, only supply and demand for the stock item and warehouse combination are used. However, if there is a demand for an item and warehouse and there is supply in another warehouse, an MRP exception of the ''Transfer Available'' type is generated on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_40_30_00|MRP Exceptions] ([~/?ScreenId=AM403000|AM403000]) form.{br}

Stock items with the status of ''Inactive'' or ''Marked for Deletion'' are never planned.
==How does MRP determine which components are used?==
For production orders, the materials details with a quantity remaining are always used.{br}

For planned orders the default planning bill and its most recent active revision are used; if a planning bill is not specified, then the default bill is used. For MPS orders, the bill specified on the MPS order is used. Additionally, the ''Effective Start Date'' and ''Effective End Date'' specified for each material line in the specified parent bill of material is used to determine if a component is effective on the planned order or planned operation start date.{br}

For 2019R1, the active bill of material selected is based on the effective dates of the bill revision. For example, if a revision exists for a future start date it will be used for planned orders with a start date on or after this date. It is possible also to have a bill of material effective between a range of dates.
==In what sequence does MRP plan?==
MRP plans top down; it uses the bill of material low level code to determine what items to plan first. The first items planned have a low level code of zero. If a planned order is generated for a manufactured item, then a requirement is inserted for each of the stock items components as specified in its default bill of material on the '''Manufacturing''' of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form. If there is no planning bill of material specified, then the default bill of material is used.{br}

The process continues down through the low level codes doing the same gross to net calculations at each level.
==What dates does MRP use for supply and demand orders?==[anchor|#_23e0f737-311a-4359-83e7-80ecd577647e]
*Sales order line '''Ship On''' date (including transfers). The sales order defaults this as the Requested On date minus the lead days for this customer (delivery settings).
*Purchase order line '''Promised '''date
*Production order '''End Date''' for supply
*Production order '''Start Date''' or operation '''Start Date''' for the materials required. The same logic is used for MPS and MRP planned orders.

==What data does MRP use and what data can be excluded?==[anchor|#_51719b16-f5bc-4fec-a0b5-94f32722796a]
*Forecasts
*Sales Orders, including open transfer orders
*Shipments not released
*Inventory On Hand
*MPS Orders
*Production Orders
*Purchase Orders

By specifying preferences on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_10_00_00|MRP Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AM100000|AM100000]) form, you can decide if sales order on hold, purchase orders on hold, and/or production orders on hold are included or not. An ''Exception Message'' is generated for each order on hold and should be reviewed after running MRP.{br}

You can clear the check boxes above on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form to exclude selected data. If all are cleared, the warehouse is excluded completely.
==How do allocations impact MRP?==
The current process of regenerating MRP uses all the allocation details records, as shown on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_20_00|Inventory Allocation Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) form. It does not matter if the allocation records are included in supply or deducted from demand on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_15_00|Availability Calculation Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201500|IN201500]) because MRP needs to see all supply and demand. There are exceptions:[anchor|#_1c18a2aa-af3b-41b8-9d52-aca3efb23da7]
*The settings specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_10_00_00|MRP Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AM100000|AM100000]) form for ''Include Orders on Hold'' are used.
*Supply and demand for production orders with a status of ''Completed'' are ignored.
*Inactive stock items are excluded from planning.

==How is inventory on hand calculated?==
For each warehouse, it is the on hand balance of any warehouse location where the '''MRP''' box is selected.((({S:Warn}If the '''MRP''' box is cleared for a warehouse location, then any production orders with this location as the planned receipt location are also excluded from MRP.
)))
==Are non-stock items planned?==
No, they are not inventoried.
==How does MRP determine if an item is manufactured or purchased?==
The source of an item is specified in the '''Replenishment Source''' box on the '''Manufacturing''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form.
==How Should Purchased Items be Set Up?==
MRP uses settings specified either on the '''Replenishment Info''' tab or on the '''Manufacturing''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form depending of whether the ''Inventory Replenishment'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]): If the feature is enabled, then settings specified on the '''Replenishment Info''' tab are used. You can override replenishment settings specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items]form with the settings specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form. The following settings are used:[anchor|#_9ddb786b-ccbf-49be-b506-6a92d98d483e]
*''Safety Stock or Reorder Point'': The value used is determined by the value of ''Stocking Method'' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_10_00_00|MRP Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AM100000|AM100000]) form. If you have multiple warehouses, you should only set these values on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] form.

The vendor details for the default vendor from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form, unless overridden on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] form, are used as follows:[anchor|#_d141e4a7-100f-4a90-9485-a7e45fbeebf5]
*''Add Lead Time (Days)'': This is used to adjust the default vendor lead time
*''Min. Order Qty'': This becomes the minimum order quantity for the planned orders.
*''Lot Size'': The planned orders are rounded up to the nearest multiple of lot size. If demand is 37 and the min is 20 and the lot size is 5, then the planned order quantity will be 40.
*''Max. Order Qty'': The planned order quantity cannot be greater than the maximum. Multiple planned orders will be created to cover the demand.
((({S:Warn}If an item does not have a default vendor, then the values are taken from the '''Manufacturing''' tab.
)))
==How are forecasts used?==
A forecast, created by using the [https://help-2020r1.acumatica.com/(W(11))/Wiki/ShowWiki|Forecast] (AM202000) form, is due on their start date. If the start date is earlier than the business date plus the '''Planning Horizon''' specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_10_00_00|MRP Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AM100000|AM100000]) form, the forecast record is updated to clear the '''Active''' box on the forecast record.{br}

If the forecast has the '''Dependent''' box selected, then sales orders with a promise date between the '''Begin Date''' and '''End Date''' of every forecast are automatically reduced by the sales order line open quantity. For example, if the forecast is 200 for 9/1 to 9/30, then all sales orders with a promise dates between 9/1 and 9/30 have a total open quantity of 150, the remaining forecast of 50 is used.
==Are forecasts customer specific?==
Yes, you can reference a customer on a forecast and that forecast is only consumed by only sales orders for that customer. You should not mix both customer specific and non-specific forecasts for an inventory item because sales orders for that customer will net against both. You could however increase the non-specific forecast to include the customer specific forecast.
==How are grace days used?==
For each demand date, MRP determines if a supply order within the grace days can fully satisfy the demand. The grace days are specified in the '''Grace Period''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_10_00_00|MRP Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AM100000|AM100000]) form. If the demand is no fully satisfied by supply orders with the grace days, then a planned order is created to satisfy the remaining demand. The following table shown an example of using the grace period.[anchor|#_ec1d2c09-424f-4a2d-bd01-437715c26d33]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!'''Date'''
! '''Demand (-) or Supply (+) Qty'''
! '''Projected On Hand'''
|- 
| October 6th
| -10 Production Material
| -10
|- 
| October 10th
| -10 Production Material
| -20
|- 
| November 9th
| 40 Purchase Order
| 20
|}
In the above example, if the ''Grace Period'' is '''30''' calendar days, then the purchase order supply due on November 9th only satisfies the demand of October 10th and a planned order will be created to satisfy the demand of October 6th. If the ''Grace Period'' is '''90''' days, then both demands are fully satisfied by the Purchase Order supply and no planned order is created.{br}

The logic does not apply when a supply order due date is earlier than the demand date and it satisfies all demands because there is no need to create a planned order.{br}

You should consider your demand and supply patterns, supply lead times, and minimum order quantities to determine an appropriate value for ''Grace Period''.{br}

Regardless of the Grace Period setting, exceptions messages are always generated to expedite or defer supply orders. The generation of exception messages is controlled by the MRP preferences for '''Days Before''' and '''Days After'''.
==What are suggested values for Days Before and Days After?==
First, both values must be less than or equal to the '''Grace Days'''. The greater the values, less exception messages are generated, however reviewing the exception messages helps to ensure that supply orders are will be received in time. You should consider your lead times and if your suppliers, either your own manufacturing or your vendors, can adapt to your new due dates. You have to consider also the number of times you have to ask your suppliers to change their promise dates.[anchor|#_606e0649-5584-4cb0-9c48-d0bdc5c4e458][anchor|#_e76d008f-cec4-4cf9-a90c-65d154cc0501][image:UserGuide/Images/MFG__MRP_Days_Before_and_After.PNG|popup|Selection of a demand require date|300px][anchor|#_65b7056d-f3cc-45f0-ad13-12d1d160821e]
*''Days Before'': If most of your lead times are a week or less, then 7 days would be appropriate. You would want your vendor to defer a delivery when demand changes to a later date. If your lead times are larger, then you need to consider how often you want to ask your vendors to adjust their promise dates.
*''Days After'': This is the more critical value since a late delivery from a supplier impacts your ability to manufacture and/or ship to customers. A value of 2 to 5 days is suggested.

==How Can I Consolidate Planned Orders?==
The ''Group Planning'' number of days provides you with ability to specify how planned orders are grouped for consolidation when you select them on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_40_00_00|MRP Display] ([~/?ScreenId=AM400000|AM400000]) form. The first planned order selected is the starting date and is assigned a ''Group Nbr'' of 1. Then any planned orders with a required date with the group planning days are assigned the to group 1. The next planned order, for the same item, or planned order for a new item are assigned ''Group Nbr'' of 2.]]></column>
			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[MRP FAQ This topic addresses the common question about the Material Requirements Planning     processes. When should MRP be run? Generally, MRP should be run before each business day after all sales and purchase orders have     been entered and after all transaction affecting inventory have been posted. Since this is a     very resource dependent process, it should be run so as not to conflict with database     maintenance processes. What is the Difference between the  MRP Display  and the  MRP     Exceptions ? On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM400000|AM400000]) MRP Display (AM400000) form, a list of suggested supply orders           (aka planned orders) that need to be converted to actual purchase, production, or transfer           orders is displayed. The primary use of MRP exceptions, displayed on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM403000|AM403000]) MRP Exceptions           (AM403000) form, is to execute the recommended actions on existing actual supply orders to           meet requirements. This includes the following: Expediting or de-exediting existing purchase and production orders to meet               demand; Canceling supply orders that are no longer needed; Transferring inventory from one warehouse to another to meet demand; Reviewing sales, purchase, and production orders that on hold and thus ignored by               MRP; As a list of late purchase and production orders. It is commonly the first thing a planner or buyer will look at, particularly for expedites,     before looking at the new planned orders. Which Items are planned? All stock items with the  MRP Item  box selected on the            Manufacturing  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form. MRP plans at the item–warehouse level; that is, only supply and         demand for the stock item and warehouse combination are used. However, if there is a demand         for an item and warehouse and there is supply in another warehouse, an MRP exception of the            Transfer Available  type is generated on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM403000|AM403000]) MRP Exceptions         (AM403000) form. Stock items with the status of  Inactive  or  Marked for Deletion  are never     planned. How does MRP determine which components are used? For production orders, the materials details with a quantity remaining are always used. For planned orders the default planning bill and its most recent active revision are used; if     a planning bill is not specified, then the default bill is used. For MPS orders, the bill     specified on the MPS order is used. Additionally, the  Effective Start Date  and       Effective End Date  specified for each material line in the specified parent bill of     material is used to determine if a component is effective on the planned order or planned     operation start date. For 2019R1, the active bill of material selected is based on the effective dates of the bill     revision. For example, if a revision exists for a future start date it will be used for planned     orders with a start date on or after this date. It is possible also to have a bill of material     effective between a range of dates. In what sequence does MRP plan? MRP plans top down; it uses the bill of material low level code to determine what items to     plan first. The first items planned have a low level code of zero. If a planned order is     generated for a manufactured item, then a requirement is inserted for each of the stock items     components as specified in its default bill of material on the       Manufacturing  of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details     (IN204500) form. If there is no planning bill of material specified, then the default bill of     material is used. The process continues down through the low level codes doing the same gross to net     calculations at each level. What dates does MRP use for supply and demand orders? Sales order line  Ship On  date (including transfers). The sales order defaults this as      the Requested On date minus the lead days for this customer (delivery settings). Purchase order line  Promised  date Production order  End Date  for supply Production order  Start Date  or operation  Start Date  for the materials      required. The same logic is used for MPS and MRP planned orders. What data does MRP use and what data can be excluded? Forecasts Sales Orders, including open transfer orders Shipments not released Inventory On Hand MPS Orders Production Orders Purchase Orders By specifying preferences on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM100000|AM100000]) MRP Preferences (AM100000) form, you can         decide if sales order on hold, purchase orders on hold, and/or production orders on hold are         included or not. An  Exception Message  is generated for each order on hold and should         be reviewed after running MRP. You can clear the check boxes above on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses     (IN204000) form to exclude selected data. If all are cleared, the warehouse is excluded     completely. How do allocations impact MRP? The current process of regenerating MRP uses all the allocation details records, as shown on     the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) Inventory Allocation Details (IN402000) form. It does not matter if the     allocation records are included in supply or deducted from demand on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201500|IN201500]) Availability Calculation Rules (IN201500) because MRP needs to see all supply and     demand. There are exceptions: The settings specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM100000|AM100000]) MRP Preferences (AM100000) form for  Include             Orders on Hold  are used. Supply and demand for production orders with a status of  Completed  are ignored. Inactive stock items are excluded from planning. How is inventory on hand calculated? For each warehouse, it is the on hand balance of any warehouse location where the       MRP  box is selected. If the  MRP  box is cleared for a warehouse location, then any     production orders with this location as the planned receipt location are also excluded from     MRP. Are non-stock items planned? No, they are not inventoried. How does MRP determine if an item is manufactured or purchased? The source of an item is specified in the  Replenishment Source  box on     the  Manufacturing  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details     (IN204500) form. How Should Purchased Items be Set Up? MRP uses settings specified either on the  Replenishment Info  tab or         on the  Manufacturing  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form depending of whether the            Inventory Replenishment  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000): If the feature is enabled, then         settings specified on the  Replenishment Info  tab are used. You can         override replenishment settings specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Itemsform with the settings specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details         (IN204500) form. The following settings are used: Safety Stock or Reorder Point : The value used is determined by the value of              Stocking Method  on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM100000|AM100000]) MRP Preferences (AM100000) form. If you           have multiple warehouses, you should only set these values on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details form. The vendor details for the default vendor from the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form, unless overridden on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details form, are used as follows: Add Lead Time (Days) : This is used to adjust the default vendor lead time Min. Order Qty : This becomes the minimum order quantity for the planned           orders. Lot Size : The planned orders are rounded up to the nearest multiple of lot size.           If demand is 37 and the min is 20 and the lot size is 5, then the planned order quantity           will be 40. Max. Order Qty : The planned order quantity cannot be greater than the maximum.           Multiple planned orders will be created to cover the demand. If an item does not have a default vendor, then the values are taken         from the  Manufacturing  tab. How are forecasts used? A forecast, created by using the  Forecast Forecast (AM202000) form, is due on their start         date. If the start date is earlier than the business date plus the  Planning           Horizon  specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM100000|AM100000]) MRP Preferences (AM100000) form, the         forecast record is updated to clear the  Active  box on the forecast         record. If the forecast has the  Dependent  box selected, then sales orders with         a promise date between the  Begin Date  and  End           Date  of every forecast are automatically reduced by the sales order line open         quantity. For example, if the forecast is 200 for 9/1 to 9/30, then all sales orders with a         promise dates between 9/1 and 9/30 have a total open quantity of 150, the remaining forecast         of 50 is used. Are forecasts customer specific? Yes, you can reference a customer on a forecast and that forecast is only consumed by only         sales orders for that customer. You should not mix both customer specific and non-specific         forecasts for an inventory item because sales orders for that customer will net against         both. You could however increase the non-specific forecast to include the customer specific         forecast. How are grace days used? For each demand date, MRP determines if a supply order within the grace days can fully         satisfy the demand. The grace days are specified in the  Grace Period          box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM100000|AM100000]) MRP Preferences (AM100000) form. If the demand is no fully         satisfied by supply orders with the grace days, then a planned order is created to satisfy         the remaining demand. The following table shown an example of using the grace period. Date Demand (-) or Supply (+) Qty Projected On Hand October 6th -10 Production Material -10 October 10th -10 Production Material -20 November 9th 40 Purchase Order 20 In the above example, if the  Grace Period  is  30  calendar days, then the         purchase order supply due on November 9th only satisfies the demand of October 10th and a         planned order will be created to satisfy the demand of October 6th. If the  Grace           Period  is  90  days, then both demands are fully satisfied by the Purchase Order         supply and no planned order is created. The logic does not apply when a supply order due date is earlier than the demand date and         it satisfies all demands because there is no need to create a planned order. You should consider your demand and supply patterns, supply lead times, and minimum order         quantities to determine an appropriate value for  Grace Period . Regardless of the Grace Period setting, exceptions messages are always generated to         expedite or defer supply orders. The generation of exception messages is controlled by the         MRP preferences for  Days Before  and  Days After . What are suggested values for Days Before and Days After? First, both values must be less than or equal to the  Grace Days . The         greater the values, less exception messages are generated, however reviewing the exception         messages helps to ensure that supply orders are will be received in time. You should         consider your lead times and if your suppliers, either your own manufacturing or your         vendors, can adapt to your new due dates. You have to consider also the number of times you         have to ask your suppliers to change their promise dates. Selection of a demand require date Days Before : If most of your lead times are a week or less, then 7 days would be           appropriate. You would want your vendor to defer a delivery when demand changes to a later           date. If your lead times are larger, then you need to consider how often you want to ask           your vendors to adjust their promise dates. Days After : This is the more critical value since a late delivery from a supplier           impacts your ability to manufacture and/or ship to customers. A value of 2 to 5 days is           suggested. How Can I Consolidate Planned Orders? The  Group Planning  number of days provides you with ability to specify how planned         orders are grouped for consolidation when you select them on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM400000|AM400000]) MRP Display (AM400000) form. The first planned order selected is the         starting date and is assigned a  Group Nbr  of 1. Then any planned orders with a         required date with the group planning days are assigned the to group 1. The next planned         order, for the same item, or planned order for a new item are assigned  Group Nbr  of         2. ]]></column>

!width="20%" ! Step
!width="80%" ! Description
|- 
| Initialization
| The first step the FRG performs is an Initialization phase. Certain variables are initialized. A connection is made to the database. Parameters are read from the MRP Setup.
|- 
| Set Low Level Codes
| The first step is to set the low level codes of all the Inventory Items. This allows MRP to process the highest level items that may generate demand for the lower items.
|- 
| First Pass
| 
First Pass is the information-gathering phase. The MRP Processor will go out and bring together all the various supplies and demands for inventory.{br}

First Pass first gathers current inventory values, what the current quantity on hand is. The safety stock is removed from this value; MRP treats safety stock as if those quantities were not available.{br}

First Pass then determines where it will get future supplies. This may be Finished Good Items on Open Production Orders or it may Open Purchase Orders. It will then look at demands from Sales Orders, Shippers, and Material Requirements on Purchase Orders.{br}

First Pass will process the Master Planning Schedule (MPS). It first updates the MPS information. Those MPS records that fall outside of the MPS Time Fence are marked as inactive. In addition, existing Production Orders may consume the MPS. The Production Order can consume the MPS even though that Production Order is completed and closed. A Production Order will consume the MPS based on the scheduled End Date of the Production Order.
|- 
| Forecasts
| Forecasts are processed as each level is processed. Therefore, if the Forecast is dependent, ALL requirements may consume the Forecast. This allows the user to not only Forecast at the Sales Order level, but also Forecast at Lower Levels.
|- 
| Adjust Quantities
| 
The next step is to reconcile existing supplies with existing demands at each level. If we have a sales order for 100 units and a production order that is making 100 units in time, then MRP does not have to plan anything for that sales order.{br}

The key to this routine is that to remember MRP is extremely date sensitive. In other words, in the above example, if that production order was not going to make those units for another 60 days then MRP does need to plan something else for that sales order so that it ships in time. MRP uses the ''Grace Period'' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_10_00_00|MRP Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AM100000|AM100000]) form to determine if that supply can be used for the current demand.
|- 
| Blowdown
| 
Once all the existing data is reconciled, the Blowdown routine will now plan MRP orders. This routine is looking at all demand items that are not being supplied in time for the level being processed. These are being planned out. If a Reorder Qty is set for an Inventory Item, MRP will plan its orders in multiples of that reorder quantity. If the item is a manufactured item, MRP will explode through its Bill of Material and create more requirements for its materials that will be processed at a lower level.{br}

The key to this phase is to plan accurate Action dates. The system will calculate Cumulative Lead Times so that if a Sales Order needs to ship on March 22nd, that means the Production Order must be created on March 10th. This also means that the Purchase Order for the raw material that we do not have needs to be placed by March 5th. During this phase, MRP is writing all of its requirements to the MRP details table. The details are reviewed by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_40_00_00|MRP Display] ([~/?ScreenId=AM400000|AM400000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_40_30_00|MRP Exceptions] ([~/?ScreenId=AM403000|AM403000]) forms.
|- 
| Completion
| 
Finally, once all of the requirements are planned, all the data is brought together into the MRP plan table. This table is used so you can view all of the requirements for an item using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_40_40_00|Detail Inquiry] ([~/?ScreenId=AM404000|AM404000]) form{br}

The first section provides brief description of an idea to be detailed in the topic. Usually 3-5 phrases, the last paragraph should clearly list what details are described in the sections of the topic.

If a Reorder Qty is set for an          Inventory Item, MRP will plan its orders in multiples of that reorder quantity. If the item          is a manufactured item, MRP will explode through its Bill of Material and create more          requirements for its materials that will be processed at a lower level. The key to this phase is to plan accurate Action dates. The system will calculate          Cumulative Lead Times so that if a Sales Order needs to ship on March 22nd, that means the          Production Order must be created on March 10th. This also means that the Purchase Order for          the raw material that we do not have needs to be placed by March 5th. During this phase,          MRP is writing all of its requirements to the MRP details table. The details are reviewed          by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM400000|AM400000]) MRP Display (AM400000) and   ([~/?ScreenId=AM403000|AM403000]) MRP Exceptions          (AM403000) forms. Completion Finally, once all of the requirements are planned, all the data is brought together into          the MRP plan table. This table is used so you can view all of the requirements for an item          using the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM404000|AM404000]) Detail Inquiry (AM404000) form The first section provides brief description of an idea to be detailed in the topic.          Usually 3-5 phrases, the last paragraph should clearly list what details are described in          the sections of the topic.  ]]></column>

Both create demand and are planned by MRP. Both are exploded down through their bills of material to create ''dependent ''demand for their components. How are they different? The key difference is the source.[anchor|#_5a2ad6e2-9072-4f84-9f3f-db6365a10eef]
*A forecast predicts future demand (orders) that will be placed by customers. A Forecast is a demand item and sales orders typically consume the forecast.
*The Master Production Schedule (MPS) is a proposed build schedule. It is a planned production schedule that identifies what is being planned to be built in the coming weeks. An MPS can be consumed like a forecast, however an MPS is a planned supply item and it is consumed by a Production Order, a supply item.

When do you use a MPS instead of a Forecast? The answer is whose forecast is it? If it is coming from sales identifying what they expect to ship, use Forecasts. If Production is stating that this is what they need to produce, use the MPS.{br}

Both forecasts and master production schedules are used to build inventory in anticipation of customer orders and drive down through the bills of materials to create dependent demand for the materials required to build the products. Forecasts or master schedules are especially important when the cumulative lead times from raw materials to finished products are longer than your customers are willing to wait. Even in a make to order environment there may be long lead components that must be sourced and stocked in order to meet customer expectation of delivery.{br}

Forecasted demand may be highly seasonal whereas a master production is typically constructed to smooth production; e.g. build stock when demand is low to cover higher demand in future periods. A master production schedule is a statement of production that should take into consideration forecasts, sales order backlog, desired inventory levels, storage constraints, and production resources.{br}{TOC}
==Creating Forecasts==
Forecasts can be generated from historical data by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_50_20_00|Generate Forecast] ([~/?ScreenId=AM502000|AM502000]) form or manually entered or adjusted using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_20_00|Forecast] ([~/?ScreenId=AM202000|AM202000]) form. When marked as dependent, sales orders reduce or consume the forecast.
==Creating a Master Production Schedule==
You can think of MPS orders as firm planned orders and they are treated the same as production orders in MRP; that is, MRP will generate a defer, expedite, or cancel exception when MPS orders are not in synch with demand. MPS orders are entered using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_10_00|Master Production Schedule] ([~/?ScreenId=AM201000|AM201000]) form. You can create a Production Order from an MPS Order and similar to forecasts, when marked as dependent, creating a production order reduces or consume an MPS Order.
==Safety Stocks and Reorder Points==
Forecasts are inevitably incorrect because of the nature of customer orders. Build schedules may not be executed as planned because of supply or production disruptions. Safety stocks and/or reorder points can be used to buffer demand and supply variability. The [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_85_00|Calculate Replenishment Parameters] ([~/?ScreenId=IN508500|IN508500]) form can be used to calculate safety stocks and reorder point based on the desired service level, seasonality model, and demand forecast model. Generally, you would set a safety stock or reorder point for the finished goods and not at the component level; an exception would be components used as spare or service items. The added safety stock or reorder point for the finished goods drives down into component demand during MRP regeneration on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_50_50_00|Regenerate MRP] ([~/?ScreenId=AM505000|AM505000]) form.{br}

You should take into consideration demand that triggers MRP replenishment is due on the date the projected on hand balance drops below the safety stock or reorder point and this may not provide sufficient lead time. Additionally, unlike forecasts safety stocks or reorder points are not consumed by sales orders. When possible, a forecast or MPS is a better solution since both represent future demand.]]></column>

!width="54%" ! Description
|- 
| 1
| Determine the forecast numbering sequence
| Use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_10_10|Numbering Sequences] ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) form to define the numbering sequences for forecasts.
|- 
| 2
| Determine the MPS type numbering sequences
| Use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_10_10|Numbering Sequences] ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) form to define the numbering sequences for MPS types.
|- 
| 3
| Determine days before/days after window
| This is an allowable time frame of a supply item fulfilling a demand item within MRP without producing exception messages. Supply items are events that bring inventory into a warehouse, that is a purchase order or production order. A demand item is an event that takes inventory from a warehouse, that is a sales order or a forecast. A supply item&rsquo;s required date that occurs within this range for a demand item action date should not present exception messages and are considered a valid supply item to fulfill a demand item. Supply items that fall outside of this range may generate a MRP exception message.
|- 
| 4
| Specify the planned order type (6.xx and later only)
| An order type with a function of planned is required. You defined order types by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_11_00|Production Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=AM201100|AM201100]) form.
|- 
| 5
| Specify the grace period
| This is the amount in days after a supply item&rsquo;s promise date it can be used to satisfy demands. Any supply item that does not fall within this range (''Demand Action Date'' to ''Demand Action Date'' plus ''Grace Period in Days'') will be considered invalid and the MRP tickler screen will plan another supply item to fulfill the demand item.
|- 
| 6
| Select the stocking method
| This determines the value MRP uses to trigger replenishment if the projected quantity available falls below this value either the safety stock or reorder point.
|- 
| 7
| Specify the purchase calendar
| Use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_90_00|Work Calendar] ([~/?ScreenId=CS209000|CS209000]) form to define the calendar MRP uses to calculate action and promise dates from vendor lead times.
|- 
| 8
| Determine the planning horizon
| MRP will plan only those forecasts that are planned to start beyond this amount of days after today. This is commonly referred to as the Demand Time Fence.
|- 
| 9
| Determine MPS types
| Use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_30_00|MPS Type] ([~/?ScreenId=AM203000|AM203000]) form to create MPS types and assign the same or different numbering sequences for each type.
|- 
| 10
| Determine the MPS time fence
| MRP will plan only those master production schedules that are planned to start beyond this amount of days after today.
|- 
| 11
| Determine if on hold orders are included.
| Sales orders, purchase orders, and/or production orders on hold, or for sales orders on credit hold, should be included for the calculation of necessary demand and supply for items in the system. If they are not included, then an MRP exception is generated for each order on hold on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_40_30_00|MRP Exceptions] ([~/?ScreenId=AM403000|AM403000]) form.
|- 
| 12
| Determine if fixed or variable lead times will be used to calculate planned manufacturing order dates.
| If variable, the operation time elements are planned quantity are used but it will add extra time to the MRP Regeneration process. An item&rsquo;s fixed ''Manufacturing Lead Time'' is defined either on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form. See [HelpRoot_Manufacturing\AM_LeadTimeCalc|Lead Time Concepts] for more information on how fixed and variable lead times are used.
|- 
| 13
| Determine the stock items to be included in MRP
| Navigate to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form, '''Manufacturing''' tab. By default, all items are included for MRP, clear check boxes for any of those that you wish to not plan.
|- 
| 14
| Determine warehouses to include in MRP
| Navigate to [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form, '''Manufacturing''' tab. By default, all features are included for MRP, clear check boxes for any of those that you wish to not plan. You can define whether forecasts, MPS, Sales Orders, Production Orders, Purchase Orders, Inventory On Hand, and/or Shipments are used in each warehouse for planning.
|- 
| 15
| Determine locations to include in MRP
| Navigate to [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] form, '''Locations''' tab. By default, all locations are included for MRP, clear check boxes for any of those that you wish to exclude. For example, defective stock or returns waiting disposition.
|- 
| 16
| Create replenishment classes
| If the ''Inventory Replenishment'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_88_00|Replenishment Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208800|IN208800]) form to define replenishment classes with sources of ''Purchased'', ''Manufacturing'', and ''Transfer''. The replenishment classes are assigned to stock items and to warehouse stock items.
|- 
| 17
| Specify replenishment settings for stock items
| Define the replenishment settings on the '''Replenishment Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form. Make sure to fill in a Replenishment Class and Seasonality in order to define the safety stock. 
|- 
| 18
| Determine MRP settings per stock item
| This is used to determine the lowest allowable level of quantity. MRP Display will suggest more if the quantity is below this level. This can be defined either on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] form. Use the '''Manufacturing''' tab to define the settings for Minimum and Maximum order quantities.
|- 
| 19
| Determine MPS dependencies
| MPS can be dependent of actual production orders or not. If they are dependent, the MPS quantity is reduced by creating a production order.
|- 
| 20
| Determine forecast dependencies
| A forecast can be independent or consumed by sales orders.
|- 
| 21
| Determine MRP schedule run times
| Determine the days and time that MRP can be scheduled to run. This is managed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_20|Automation Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=SM205020|SM205020]) form.

No. Task Description 1 Determine the forecast numbering sequence Use the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) Numbering Sequences (CS201010) form to define the         numbering sequences for forecasts. 2 Determine the MPS type numbering sequences Use the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) Numbering Sequences (CS201010) form to define the         numbering sequences for MPS types. 3 Determine days before/days after window This is an allowable time frame of a supply item fulfilling a demand item within MRP         without producing exception messages. Supply items are events that bring inventory into a         warehouse, that is a purchase order or production order. A demand item is an event that         takes inventory from a warehouse, that is a sales order or a forecast. A supply item's         required date that occurs within this range for a demand item action date should not present         exception messages and are considered a valid supply item to fulfill a demand item. Supply         items that fall outside of this range may generate a MRP exception message. 4 Specify the planned order type (6.xx and later only) An order type with a function of planned is required. You defined order types by using                 the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM201100|AM201100]) Production Order Types (AM201100) form. 5 Specify the grace period This is the amount in days after a supply item's promise date it can be used to                 satisfy demands. Any supply item that does not fall within this range ( Demand                   Action Date  to  Demand Action Date  plus  Grace Period in Days )                 will be considered invalid and the MRP tickler screen will plan another supply item                 to fulfill the demand item. 6 Select the stocking method This determines the value MRP uses to trigger replenishment if the projected quantity                 available falls below this value either the safety stock or reorder point. 7 Specify the purchase calendar Use the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS209000|CS209000]) Work Calendar (CS209000) form to define the         calendar MRP uses to calculate action and promise dates from vendor lead times. 8 Determine the planning horizon MRP will plan only those forecasts that are planned to start beyond this amount of         days after today. This is commonly referred to as the Demand Time Fence. 9 Determine MPS types Use the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM203000|AM203000]) MPS Type (AM203000) form to create MPS types and assign                 the same or different numbering sequences for each type. 10 Determine the MPS time fence MRP will plan only those master production schedules that are planned to start beyond                 this amount of days after today. 11 Determine if on hold orders are included. Sales orders, purchase orders, and/or production orders on hold, or for sales orders                 on credit hold, should be included for the calculation of necessary demand and                 supply for items in the system. If they are not included, then an MRP exception is                 generated for each order on hold on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM403000|AM403000]) MRP Exceptions (AM403000)                 form. 12 Determine if fixed or variable lead times will be used to calculate planned         manufacturing order dates. If variable, the operation time elements are planned quantity are used but it will add                 extra time to the MRP Regeneration process. An item's fixed  Manufacturing Lead                   Time  is defined either on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items                 (IN202500) or   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details (IN204500) form. See                    Lead Time Concepts for more information on how fixed and variable                 lead times are used. 13 Determine the stock items to be included in MRP Navigate to the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form,           Manufacturing  tab. By default, all items are included for MRP, clear         check boxes for any of those that you wish to not plan. 14 Determine warehouses to include in MRP Navigate to   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses (IN204000) form,           Manufacturing  tab. By default, all features are included for MRP,         clear check boxes for any of those that you wish to not plan. You can define whether         forecasts, MPS, Sales Orders, Production Orders, Purchase Orders, Inventory On Hand, and/or         Shipments are used in each warehouse for planning. 15 Determine locations to include in MRP Navigate to   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses form,           Locations  tab. By default, all locations are included for MRP, clear         check boxes for any of those that you wish to exclude. For example, defective stock or         returns waiting disposition. 16 Create replenishment classes If the  Inventory Replenishment  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, use the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN208800|IN208800]) Replenishment Classes (IN208800) form to define replenishment classes with         sources of  Purchased ,  Manufacturing , and  Transfer . The replenishment         classes are assigned to stock items and to warehouse stock items. 17 Specify replenishment settings for stock items Define the replenishment settings on the  Replenishment Info  tab         of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form. Make sure to fill in a         Replenishment Class and Seasonality in order to define the safety stock.  18 Determine MRP settings per stock item This is used to determine the lowest allowable level of quantity. MRP Display will         suggest more if the quantity is below this level. This can be defined either on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items or   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details         form. Use the  Manufacturing  tab to define the settings for Minimum         and Maximum order quantities. 19 Determine MPS dependencies MPS can be dependent of actual production orders or not. If they are dependent, the         MPS quantity is reduced by creating a production order. 20 Determine forecast dependencies A forecast can be independent or consumed by sales orders. 21 Determine MRP schedule run times Determine the days and time that MRP can be scheduled to run. This is managed on the            ([~/?ScreenId=SM205020|SM205020]) Automation Schedules (SM205020) form. ]]></column>

We highly recommend setting up an automation schedule to run MRP regeneration daily during the evening or early morning so the results will be available for the planners and buyers are the start of their work day. You should set it to run after all other scheduled processes that impact supply and demand are run to ensure the MRP process has the most up to date data. Examples of automated processes that affect MRP are the following:[anchor|#_88760bf4-24df-40c5-ae2a-13c00bf26b2b]
*Any process that changes the on hand balance of inventory items such as counts, adjustments, purchase receipts, sales order shipments, production reporting, etc.
*Any process that creates demand or supply orders or updates these orders to change quantities or dates such as importing sales orders.
*Inventory Replenishment processes that calculate safety stock and/or reorder points.
*Release of batches or documents that were held during the day such as invoices.

You can create an automation schedule either on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_50_50_00|Regenerate MRP] ([~/?ScreenId=AM505000|AM505000]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_20|Automation Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=SM205020|SM205020]) form.]]></column>

The production management functionality is used to control and track the transformation of raw materials and component parts into finished items and sub-assemblies. It is the execution module in the manufacturing suite.{br}

The primary features of production management are described briefly in this topic.
==Easy Entry of the Production Order==
Production orders can be created by using forms related to material requirements planning, sales orders, estimate, and the production management itself. A production order is an authorization to make the product, it collects the cost of materials, labor, overhead and other costs, and receipts the finished product into inventory. Materials and labor can be directly issued to production orders and/or backflushed at count points.
==Quick Release==
The [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_50_00_00|Release Production Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=AM500000|AM500000]) form provides a means to quickly release all the planned production orders and print the corresponding paperwork. A printed production ticket can be used by plant personnel to prepare and record material and tooling issues; as work instructions for production employees; to record operation labor, completed, and scrap quantities; and to identify the product being produced as work travels through the production process.
==Alternate BOMs and Routing / Revisions==
The user can specify right on the production order what BOM / Routing to use. Therefore, if there is another BOM or Routing that can be used for this Inventory item, the user can specify that alternate on the production order. By default, the primary BOM will be used. In addition, if the user wants to specify to produce to a prior revision of the BOM or routing, they may specify that revision number on the '''References''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_15_00|Production Order Maintenance] ([~/?ScreenId=AM201500|AM201500]) form.
==Scheduling==
Production orders can be scheduling infinitely backwards and forward using the operation cycle times, or if the ''Advanced Planning and Scheduling'' (APS) feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, finite forward and backwards.
==Event History==
The system maintains a complete event history of the production order; from how the order was created, to when it was closed and every step in between. The user can then review the '''Event History''' tab to see what actions have taken place against the production order. Posting events create inventory, labor, and/or cost batches which can be drilled down and traced into the general ledger.
==Easy Release of Materials==
Materials can be released on multiple ways. The [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_00_00|Materials] ([~/?ScreenId=AM300000|AM300000]) form provides you with ability to manually release materials. The [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_00_10|Materials Wizard] ([~/?ScreenId=AM300010|AM300010]) form provides you with ability to select multiple production orders and release all the required materials. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_50_30_00|Release AM Documents] ([~/?ScreenId=AM503000|AM503000]) form, you can release balanced production transaction batches. Materials may be backflushed into the production order. Materials may also be issued based on a purchase receipt which can be seen on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_55_00|Unreleased Material Allocations] ([~/?ScreenId=AM305500|AM305500]) form.
==Easy Posting of Production Operation Labor and Completions==
Employees can easily post their labor and quantities completed or scrap using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_10_00|Labor] ([~/?ScreenId=AM301000|AM301000]) form. Alternatively, with backflushing enabled for an operation, only count point operations can be reported either by labor or move transactions. If desired, Acumatica ERP integration scenarios can be used to import labor and move transactions.]]></column>

In this topic, you will read about item allocation in production management.{br}

In the following diagram, you can see the general concept of allocating items.[anchor|#_9fbb4398-ce2f-4fb4-b4a2-84e7a39a8dea][anchor|#_376295a1-59f9-40f8-9515-2a054882b07e][image:UserGuide/Images/MfgPlanTypes.png|popup|Allocations for production|350px]{br}{TOC}
==Allocating Purchase Orders to Production Orders==
'''Using Critical Materials Process or Checking Mark for PO'''{br}

When you create purchase orders by using processes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_40_10_00|Critical Materials] ([~/?ScreenId=AM401000|AM401000]) or the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_50_00|Create Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) form, an allocation is created from the PO to the production material line. The purchase order line created will be ''Goods for MFG'' for stock items or ''Non-Stock for MFG'' for non-stock items. Once the purchase order is created the allocations on the production order materials line are updated. The supply allocation type depends on the status of the purchase order:[anchor|#_2be5e83b-2d29-4cff-b8dd-7ab3e0a6e5c9]
*''Purchase for Prod. Prepared:'' When the purchase order does not have a status of ''Open''.
*''Purchase for Production:'' When the purchase order is status is ''Open''.

Changing the status or changing the hold flag will change the allocation type. The demand for production orders for purchased items is shown as ''Production to Purchase''. When the purchase order is received the demand allocation is updated to ''Production Allocated'' for the quantity received.{br}

'''Using APS Scheduling'''{br}

If the ''Advanced Planned and Scheduling'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, when you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_50_10_00|Rough Cut Planning] ([~/?ScreenId=AM501000|AM501000]) form to process production orders, available purchase orders will be allocated. The allocation type will be the same as above.((({S:Warn}The line type of the purchase order is not updated when the line is allocated to a production order.
)))
==Allocating Stock Items to Production Orders==
You can manually allocate available items or remove an allocation to a production order by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_90_00|Production Order Details] ([~/?ScreenId=AM209000|AM209000]) form. The demand allocation is ''Production Allocated''.((({S:Danger}Currently, you cannot allocate a specific lot- or serial-tracked item.
)))((({S:Warn}Allocations are only removed when the actual quantity issued is equal to the quantity required or when the production order is closed. Completing a production order does not relieve the allocations because the material has not been fully issued. If you need to close a production order short (you were going to make 10 but because of a shortage you could only make 8), then reduce the ''Qty to Produce'' and then close the order.
)))
'''Allocating Production Orders to Sales Orders'''{br}

If the production order is created from the sales order it creates a ''SO to Production'' demand allocation. When the production order is created the supply allocation depends on the status of the production order:[anchor|#_a3750cc7-d8f6-46fb-ba85-e488a13c40f3]
*''Production for SO Prepared:'' The production order has a status of ''Planned'' or has been placed ''On Hold''.
*''Production for SO:'' The production order is has a status of ''Released'' or ''In Process'' and is not ''On Hold''.

When the production move creates an inventory receipt the ''SO to Production'' allocation is decreased and the ''SO Allocated'' increased. If the inventory item is lot or serial tracked, the lot or serial number is allocated to the sales order line.{br}

'''Allocating Production Orders to Other Production Orders'''{br}

When you create linked production orders by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_40_10_00|Critical Materials] ([~/?ScreenId=AM401000|AM401000]) form, the subassemblies are allocated as ''Production Allocated''. The supply allocations are dependent on the status of the created production order:[anchor|#_5b074c86-5c60-4b5a-81f6-9f2d8f04ecc0]
*''Production for Prod. Prepared:'' The production order has a status of ''Planned'' or has been placed ''On Hold''.
*''Production for Production:'' The production order is has a status of ''Released'' or ''In Process'' and is not ''On Hold''.

'''MRP and Allocations'''{br}

The process of regenerating MPR performed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_50_50_00|Regenerate MRP] ([~/?ScreenId=AM505000|AM505000]) form has been modified to use the allocation details for planning regardless of availability calculation rules specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_15_00|Availability Calculation Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201500|IN201500]) form.]]></column>

Allocating Stock Items to Production Orders You can manually allocate available items or remove an allocation to a production order by         using the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM209000|AM209000]) Production Order Details (AM209000) form. The demand allocation is            Production Allocated . Currently, you cannot allocate a specific lot- or serial-tracked     item. Allocations are only removed when the actual quantity issued is equal to     the quantity required or when the production order is closed. Completing a production order does     not relieve the allocations because the material has not been fully issued. If you need to close     a production order short (you were going to make 10 but because of a shortage you could only     make 8), then reduce the  Qty to Produce  and then close the order. Allocating Production Orders to Sales Orders If the production order is created from the sales order it creates a  SO to Production      demand allocation. When the production order is created the supply allocation depends on the     status of the production order: Production for SO Prepared:  The production order has a status of  Planned  or      has been placed  On Hold . Production for SO:  The production order is has a status of  Released  or  In       Process  and is not  On Hold . When the production move creates an inventory receipt the  SO to Production  allocation     is decreased and the  SO Allocated  increased. If the inventory item is lot or serial     tracked, the lot or serial number is allocated to the sales order line. Allocating Production Orders to Other Production Orders When you create linked production orders by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM401000|AM401000]) Critical Materials         (AM401000) form, the subassemblies are allocated as  Production Allocated . The supply         allocations are dependent on the status of the created production order: Production for Prod. Prepared:  The production order has a status of  Planned  or      has been placed  On Hold . Production for Production:  The production order is has a status of  Released  or        In Process  and is not  On Hold . MRP and Allocations The process of regenerating MPR performed on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM505000|AM505000]) Regenerate MRP (AM505000)         form has been modified to use the allocation details for planning regardless of availability         calculation rules specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201500|IN201500]) Availability Calculation Rules (IN201500)         form. ]]></column>

When you receive items from a production order by using the labor or move transactions, an inventory receipt is created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) form to debit the inventory account and subaccount and to credit the work in process (WIP) account/subaccount.[anchor|#_fb18eecd-1495-43f3-a793-ce2addaaf351]
*If the stock item being received has a valuation method of ''Standard Cost'', then the receipt cost is quantity received multiplied by the standard cost for the stock item and warehouse.
*For ''FIFO'', ''Average'', and ''Specific'' valuation methods, the receipt cost is calculated depending on the costing method selected for the production order.

You can read more about the costing and valuation methods in [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Item_Costs_and_Valuation_Methods|Item Costs and Valuation Methods].{br}{TOC}
==Costing Methods==
Production orders support two costing methods and the default method for new production orders is defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_10_20_00|Production Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AM102000|AM102000]) form. The ''Actual'' method uses only the actual WIP balance to calculate the cost; the ''Estimated'' method combines actual and planned costs to cater to situations where material and labor transactions are not always reported before the inventory is receipted from the production order.
==Actual Costing Method==
The calculated unit cost for the manufacturing to inventory transactions, such as inventory receipts, will be the WIP balance divided by the quantity completed, including scrap if the option to include scrap is used. There will be no planned cost estimating calculated into the unit cost of the production receipt. When using this method, the WIP Balance is zeroed after each receipt and there will never be a WIP Balance on the production order when the order is completed. This method may be appropriate when:[anchor|#_9053c4f3-b54a-4d8e-bb3d-f02cbe07d26f]
*More or less material is used based on testing the process; for example, add salt to taste or add calcium until the Ph value equals to a particular value.
*A different material is added or substituted based on availability or inspection; for example, a repair order when parts need to be replaced.
*Labor times are estimated or unknown until the work is performed.

==Actual Cost Examples==
'''Example 1'''{br}

Production order to produce 10 units currently has an actual WIP Total of $100 with zero completed units (MFG to Inventory is zero). A user creates a move transaction to complete 5 units into inventory. The total cost for the transaction will be $100 with a calculated unit cost of 100 / 5 = $20 each.{br}

After the move transaction another $70 is added to the production order making the actual WIP Total $170 and a WIP Balance of $70. A user creates a move transaction for the final 5 units. The move transaction is for a total of $70 with a calculated unit cost of 70 / 5 = $14 each. The order is complete with a WIP Total of $170, WIP Balance of zero, and MFG to Inventory of $170.{br}

Receipt cost summary:[anchor|#_64205f07-71e6-47e9-94b0-126bd96aacf8]
#$20.00
#$14.00

'''Example 2'''{br}

Production order to produce 10 units currently has an actual WIP Total of $0 with zero completed units (MFG to Inventory is zero). A user creates a move transaction to complete 5 units into inventory. The total cost for the transaction will be $0 with a calculated unit cost of 0 / 5 = $0 each.{br}

After the move transaction the first costs are added to the production order totaling $170 making the WIP Total $170 and a WIP Balance of $170. A user creates a move transaction for the final 5 units. The move transaction is for a total of $170 with a calculated unit cost of 170 / 5 = $34 each. The order is complete with a WIP Total of $170, WIP Balance of zero, and MFG to Inventory of $170.{br}

'''Example 3'''{br}

Production order to produce 10 units currently has an actual WIP Total of $170 with zero completed units (MFG to Inventory is zero). A user creates a move transaction to complete the full 10 units into inventory. The total cost for the transaction will be $170 with a calculated unit cost of 170 / 10 = $17 each. The order is complete with a WIP Total of $170, WIP Balance of zero, and MFG to Inventory of $170.{br}

Receipt Cost Summary[anchor|#_e99bbcff-cbc3-4ac8-a44f-a2c0f801365f]
#$170.00
((({S:Warn}[anchor|#_aad71b60-5785-464f-b0b8-84ef071e70b0]
#Accurate costs with the cost method of '''Actual''' therefore are dependent on the reporting of all required transactions before inventory is received from production. Costs are also affected if materials are set to backflush and negative inventory balances are not allowed; the materials that are short will '''NOT''' be issued. Because the receipt costs are calculated based on the WIP balance at the time of the receipt, this may have an undesired impact on your costs when the units are issued or shipped.
#Transactions created and processed by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_80_00|WIP Adjustment] ([~/?ScreenId=AM308000|AM308000]) form adjust the WIP balance and will be included in the cost of any receipt posted after the adjustment.
)))
Production order variances are still calculated for each cost element in order to provide a means to measure performance.
==Estimated Costing Method==
The estimated costing method uses a combination of actual and planned costs. Very often in manufacturing the actual product flows through production processes faster than the transactions to track it are reported. For example, employees might indicate the labor hours and materials used on the production tickets which are then collected at the end of their shift and reviewed by a supervisor who then submits them for data entry. The product may have already been packed, moved into inventory, and shipped before the actual labor and materials have been posted. Without having the actual labor and materials reported the value in WIP is understated and doing a receipt without these costs will result in an understated receipt cost.{br}

In order to minimize the impact of understated costs, the labor and move transactions calculate a receipt cost based on the labor and materials actual hours and quantities plus the difference between and planned and actual labor hours and quantities. Additionally, machine, tooling, and overhead costs are also calculated and applied. The can result in a WIP balance that is only resolved when the production order is financially closed even for stock items using ''FIFO'', ''Average'', or ''Specific Cost'' valuation methods.{br}

If you are using ''Standard Cost'' valuation method for your assemblies, then the receipt cost is always the current standard cost and any rate or usage variances are applied as a WIP Variance when the production order is financially closed.
==Updating Planned Costs==
If you are aware of significant labor, material, or other costs changes since the production order was created, you can use the ''Calculate Planned Cost'' action on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_15_00|Production Order Maintenance] ([~/?ScreenId=AM201500|AM201500]) form if the order has a status of ''Planned'' or the order is on ''Hold ''and has a status of ''Released'' or ''In-Process''.
==Impact of Using Estimated Costs==
There are a few issues with using the combination of planned and actual costs that you need to be aware of. The planned costs are calculated using the current values at the time the production order is created and costs may change. Actual costs are determined at the time the materials, labor, or move batch is released and processed by the system. For example, the cost layer to use for FIFO valuation materials is determined when the Inventory Issue batch is released, not when it is created.{br}

There are other examples of cost differences between planned and actual costs:[anchor|#_ae155664-e4f9-4f1f-8ed6-9b79b05b7792]
*A purchase receipt may change the average or last cost of a stock item component or the standard cost has been updated.
*Planned Labor is calculated using work center standard rates and you report labor using employee rates that are different.
*Rate changes were made work center, overhead, machine and/or tooling after the production order planned costs were calculated.

Differences between the planned unit costs and actual unit costs are considered ''Rate Variances''. Differences between planned quantities and actual quantities are ''Usage Variances''.
==How Does Scrap Affect Cost?==
Scrap affects the cost calculations for all valuation methods except Standard Cost. If the '''Include Scrap in Completions''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_10_20_00|Production Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AM102000|AM102000]) form, the receipt cost will be divided by the completed units to calculate the unit cost. For example, the production order called for 10 units to be produced, the WIP Balance is $100.00 without any variances, and a receipt of 9 units completed and 1 scrap is entered:[anchor|#_70288b87-d276-43ab-bd7a-d1710dc59a45]
*With ''Include Scrap in Completions'' '''checked''', the unit cost is $11.11 ($100.00 / 9 Units completed), the production order status is set to ''Completed'', and WIP is credited for the $100.00.
*With ''Include Scrap in Completions'' '''unchecked''', the unit is $10.00 because only 9 units were completed, the production order status remains ''In Process'', and WIP is credited for $90.00.

There is no separate accounting entry generated by reporting scrap, the only impact is how the receipt cost is calculated.{br}

If there are yield variances you can report the difference as a scrap amount if the '''Include Scrap in Completions''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_10_20_00|Production Preferences] form. Scrap quantities can be positive (added to quantity completed) or negative (subtracted from quantity completed). For example, if the planned quantity to produce was 500 units but the actual yield was 510 units, you can enter -10 as scrap.((({S:Warn}If you have already expensed the cost of scrap, then total scrap is ignored since the WIP Balance was already reduced by the scrap expense. See [HelpRoot_Manufacturing\AM_Scrap|Handling Production Scrap and Waste] for more information.
)))
==Rate Variances vs. Usage Variances==
Rate variances will not create a production order variance, the full value of WIP is credited at production completion if the actual quantity completed equals the quantity to produce. If you do a partial receipt, you may get a different cost for each receipt depending on when labor and material are posted to the production order.{br}

Usage variances, however, can result in a production order variance and WIP balance at completion. Usage variances are created in the following cases:[anchor|#_fd9fb3ae-20ab-4595-8250-a91f9289ffaf]
#There is a difference between the planned and actual labor hours.
#There is a difference between planned and actual material issue quantities

Any WIP balance for completed production orders is relieved when production orders are (financially) closed which creates a credit or debit to the WIP Variance account. The unit cost of completed items is not changed during the financial close.
==Receipt Cost Calculations==
The receipt cost calculation for assemblies having a valuation method other than Standard Cost compares the planned quantities of labor and materials at planned costs to the actual quantities of labor and materials at actual cost. The calculations are performed for each operation and summarized. The cost calculations are not complex but they are very detailed to ensure a representative cost for receipts. They consider not only the actual costs posted but also the costs that should have been posted when an operation or material issue has not been reported.{br}

Before calculating the operation costs, the final operation production quantity (including scrap if configured in production preferences) is used if necessary to adjust prior operation completion quantities if they are less. For example, given this routing and operation 0030 is the last operation and you report a quantity completed of 6:[anchor|#_81c9772a-4e94-44c3-a2d5-6aac3c38262f]

|- 
| 0020
| 4
| 6: The operation actual completion quantity is made equal to the last operation completed quantity,
|- 
| 0030
| 6
| 6
|}
==Labor Cost Calculation==
Labor costs are calculated for each operation by using the following formula, if the actual labor hours are less than planned labor hours.{{{{Actual labor amount + (Planned - Actual labor hours) * Work center standard rate
}}}}
==Materials Cost Calculation==
Material costs are calculated for each material item by using the following formula, if the actual quantity issued is less than the planned quantity to issue.{{{{actual material cost + (planned quantity - actual quantity) * planned unit cost
}}}}
==Machine and Tools Cost Calculations==
These costs are always backflushed according to the actual quantity completed at each operation or, if necessary, by the adjusted quantity completed.
==Fixed Overhead Cost Calculation==
If not already calculated, the fixed overhead is calculated for each operation.
==Variable Overhead Cost Calculation==
Similar to labor and materials cost calculations, the variable overhead is calculated according to the actual quantity completed at each operation or, if necessary, by the adjusted quantity completed.
==Updating Production Orders to Recognize All Costs==
If labor and/or material usage variances should be included in the production receipt or completion costs and not as a variance, by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_90_00|Production Order Details] ([~/?ScreenId=AM209000|AM209000]) form you can update the production order operations and materials planned hours and quantities to be the actual hours and quantities before performing a receipt.]]></column>
			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Costing Production Receipts When you receive items from a production order by using the labor or move transactions, an     inventory receipt is created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) Receipts (IN301000) form     to debit the inventory account and subaccount and to credit the work in process (WIP)     account/subaccount. If the stock item being received has a valuation method of  Standard Cost , then the      receipt cost is quantity received multiplied by the standard cost for the stock item and      warehouse. For  FIFO ,  Average , and  Specific  valuation methods, the receipt cost is      calculated depending on the costing method selected for the production order. You can read more about the costing and valuation methods in  Item Costs and Valuation Methods. Costing Methods Production orders support two costing methods and the default method for new production orders     is defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM102000|AM102000]) Production Preferences (AM102000) form. The  Actual  method uses     only the actual WIP balance to calculate the cost; the  Estimated  method combines actual     and planned costs to cater to situations where material and labor transactions are not always     reported before the inventory is receipted from the production order. Actual Costing Method The calculated unit cost for the manufacturing to inventory transactions, such as inventory     receipts, will be the WIP balance divided by the quantity completed, including scrap if the     option to include scrap is used. There will be no planned cost estimating calculated into the     unit cost of the production receipt. When using this method, the WIP Balance is zeroed after     each receipt and there will never be a WIP Balance on the production order when the order is     completed. This method may be appropriate when: More or less material is used based on testing the process; for example, add salt to taste      or add calcium until the Ph value equals to a particular value. A different material is added or substituted based on availability or inspection; for      example, a repair order when parts need to be replaced. Labor times are estimated or unknown until the work is performed. Actual Cost Examples Example 1 Production order to produce 10 units currently has an actual WIP Total of $100 with zero     completed units (MFG to Inventory is zero). A user creates a move transaction to complete 5     units into inventory. The total cost for the transaction will be $100 with a calculated unit     cost of 100 / 5 = $20 each. After the move transaction another $70 is added to the production order making the actual WIP     Total $170 and a WIP Balance of $70. A user creates a move transaction for the final 5 units.     The move transaction is for a total of $70 with a calculated unit cost of 70 / 5 = $14 each. The     order is complete with a WIP Total of $170, WIP Balance of zero, and MFG to Inventory of     $170. Receipt cost summary: $20.00 $14.00 Example 2 Production order to produce 10 units currently has an actual WIP Total of $0 with zero     completed units (MFG to Inventory is zero). A user creates a move transaction to complete 5     units into inventory. The total cost for the transaction will be $0 with a calculated unit cost     of 0 / 5 = $0 each. After the move transaction the first costs are added to the production order totaling $170     making the WIP Total $170 and a WIP Balance of $170. A user creates a move transaction for the     final 5 units. The move transaction is for a total of $170 with a calculated unit cost of 170 /     5 = $34 each. The order is complete with a WIP Total of $170, WIP Balance of zero, and MFG to     Inventory of $170. Receipt cost summary: $0.00 $34.00 Example 3 Production order to produce 10 units currently has an actual WIP Total of $170 with zero     completed units (MFG to Inventory is zero). A user creates a move transaction to complete the     full 10 units into inventory. The total cost for the transaction will be $170 with a calculated     unit cost of 170 / 10 = $17 each. The order is complete with a WIP Total of $170, WIP Balance of     zero, and MFG to Inventory of $170. Receipt Cost Summary $170.00 Accurate costs with the cost method of  Actual  therefore are dependent on the       reporting of all required transactions before inventory is received from production. Costs are       also affected if materials are set to backflush and negative inventory balances are not       allowed; the materials that are short will  NOT  be issued. Because the receipt costs are       calculated based on the WIP balance at the time of the receipt, this may have an undesired       impact on your costs when the units are issued or shipped. Transactions created and processed by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM308000|AM308000]) WIP Adjustment (AM308000)       form adjust the WIP balance and will be included in the cost of any receipt posted after the       adjustment. Production order variances are still calculated for each cost element in order to provide a     means to measure performance. Estimated Costing Method The estimated costing method uses a combination of actual and planned costs. Very often in     manufacturing the actual product flows through production processes faster than the transactions     to track it are reported. For example, employees might indicate the labor hours and materials     used on the production tickets which are then collected at the end of their shift and reviewed     by a supervisor who then submits them for data entry. The product may have already been packed,     moved into inventory, and shipped before the actual labor and materials have been posted.     Without having the actual labor and materials reported the value in WIP is understated and doing     a receipt without these costs will result in an understated receipt cost. In order to minimize the impact of understated costs, the labor and move transactions     calculate a receipt cost based on the labor and materials actual hours and quantities plus the     difference between and planned and actual labor hours and quantities. Additionally, machine,     tooling, and overhead costs are also calculated and applied. The can result in a WIP balance     that is only resolved when the production order is financially closed even for stock items using       FIFO ,  Average , or  Specific Cost  valuation methods. If you are using  Standard Cost  valuation method for your assemblies, then the receipt     cost is always the current standard cost and any rate or usage variances are applied as a WIP     Variance when the production order is financially closed. Updating Planned Costs If you are aware of significant labor, material, or other costs changes since the production     order was created, you can use the  Calculate Planned Cost  action on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM201500|AM201500]) Production Order Maintenance (AM201500) form if the order has a status of  Planned  or the     order is on  Hold  and has a status of  Released  or  In-Process . Impact of Using Estimated Costs There are a few issues with using the combination of planned and actual costs that you need to     be aware of. The planned costs are calculated using the current values at the time the     production order is created and costs may change. Actual costs are determined at the time the     materials, labor, or move batch is released and processed by the system. For example, the cost     layer to use for FIFO valuation materials is determined when the Inventory Issue batch is     released, not when it is created. There are other examples of cost differences between planned and actual costs: A purchase receipt may change the average or last cost of a stock item component or the      standard cost has been updated. Planned Labor is calculated using work center standard rates and you report labor using      employee rates that are different. Rate changes were made work center, overhead, machine and/or tooling after the production      order planned costs were calculated. Differences between the planned unit costs and actual unit costs are considered  Rate      Variances . Differences between planned quantities and actual quantities are  Usage      Variances . How Does Scrap Affect Cost? Scrap affects the cost calculations for all valuation methods except Standard Cost. If the       Include Scrap in Completions  check box is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM102000|AM102000]) Production Preferences (AM102000) form, the receipt cost will be divided by the completed     units to calculate the unit cost. For example, the production order called for 10 units to be     produced, the WIP Balance is $100.00 without any variances, and a receipt of 9 units completed     and 1 scrap is entered: With  Include Scrap in Completions checked , the unit cost is $11.11 ($100.00 / 9 Units completed), the production order      status is set to  Completed , and WIP is credited for the $100.00. With  Include Scrap in Completions unchecked , the unit is $10.00 because only 9 units were completed, the production order      status remains  In Process , and WIP is credited for $90.00. There is no separate accounting entry generated by reporting scrap, the only impact is how the     receipt cost is calculated. If there are yield variances you can report the difference as a scrap amount if the       Include Scrap in Completions  check box is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM102000|AM102000]) Production Preferences form. Scrap quantities can be positive (added to quantity completed)     or negative (subtracted from quantity completed). For example, if the planned quantity to     produce was 500 units but the actual yield was 510 units, you can enter -10 as scrap. If you have already expensed the cost of scrap, then total scrap is     ignored since the WIP Balance was already reduced by the scrap expense. See  Handling Production Scrap and Waste for more information. Rate Variances vs. Usage Variances Rate variances will not create a production order variance, the full value of WIP is credited     at production completion if the actual quantity completed equals the quantity to produce. If you     do a partial receipt, you may get a different cost for each receipt depending on when labor and     material are posted to the production order. Usage variances, however, can result in a production order variance and WIP balance at     completion. Usage variances are created in the following cases: There is a difference between the planned and actual labor hours. There is a difference between planned and actual material issue quantities Any WIP balance for completed production orders is relieved when production orders are     (financially) closed which creates a credit or debit to the WIP Variance account. The unit cost     of completed items is not changed during the financial close. Receipt Cost Calculations The receipt cost calculation for assemblies having a valuation method other than Standard Cost     compares the planned quantities of labor and materials at planned costs to the actual quantities     of labor and materials at actual cost. The calculations are performed for each operation and     summarized. The cost calculations are not complex but they are very detailed to ensure a     representative cost for receipts. They consider not only the actual costs posted but also the     costs that should have been posted when an operation or material issue has not been     reported. Before calculating the operation costs, the final operation production quantity (including     scrap if configured in production preferences) is used if necessary to adjust prior operation     completion quantities if they are less. For example, given this routing and operation 0030 is     the last operation and you report a quantity completed of 6: Operation Actual Completed Quantity Adjusted Completed Quantity 0010 10 N/A quantity is greater than 0030 0020 4 6: The operation actual completion quantity is made equal to the last operation         completed quantity, 0030 6 6 Labor Cost Calculation Labor costs are calculated for each operation by using the following formula, if the actual     labor hours are less than planned labor hours. Actual labor amount + (Planned - Actual labor hours) * Work center standard rate Materials Cost Calculation Material costs are calculated for each material item by using the following formula, if the     actual quantity issued is less than the planned quantity to issue. actual material cost + (planned quantity - actual quantity) * planned unit cost Machine and Tools Cost Calculations These costs are always backflushed according to the actual quantity completed at each     operation or, if necessary, by the adjusted quantity completed. Fixed Overhead Cost Calculation If not already calculated, the fixed overhead is calculated for each operation. Variable Overhead Cost Calculation Similar to labor and materials cost calculations, the variable overhead is calculated     according to the actual quantity completed at each operation or, if necessary, by the adjusted     quantity completed. Updating Production Orders to Recognize All Costs If labor and/or material usage variances should be included in the production receipt or     completion costs and not as a variance, by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM209000|AM209000]) Production Order Details (AM209000)     form you can update the production order operations and materials planned hours and quantities     to be the actual hours and quantities before performing a receipt. ]]></column>

Sometimes the products you produce need to be issued out of inventory and disassembled to salvage their components. The item may be obsolete, returned non-functional from a customer, have appearance flaws that would not be accepted. or maybe purchased just for the value of a component. The disassembly process allow users to manage and track the disassembly process of a product, capture related costs, and put the usable component parts back into inventory. Defective or non-recoverable components can be scrapped. Disassemble type production orders are used to capture the costs incurred and a single-step disassembly transaction, which can be processed by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_15_00|Disassembly] ([~/?ScreenId=AM301500|AM301500]) form, used to record the inventory issue, scrap, and component returns to stock.{br}{TOC}
==Features==
The following features are provided:[anchor|#_bdace115-3982-4c3a-add1-00d958453482]
*Generates an issue transaction for the item being disassembled and a receipt for the components salvaged.
*Allows for scrap of disassembled component materials.
*Create a new disassemble production order based on disassemble order type.
*Create a disassembly transaction directly on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_15_00|Disassembly] ([~/?ScreenId=AM301500|AM301500]) form (and select a disassembly production order) or on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_15_00|Production Order Maintenance] ([~/?ScreenId=AM201500|AM201500]) form.
*The source for materials to be returned by the disassemble process can be a bill of material or copied from another production order.
*Disassembly entry allows for batch correction (reverse previous disassembly entry).
*By-products not supported for disassemble orders.
*Allows actual labor entry.
*Copies predefined attributes from the order type, bill of material, and source production orders to the disassemble orders.
*Allow for entry of attribute values for disassembly transactions.
*Allows for override of the unit cost of materials returned to stock.

==Processing Disassemble Production Orders==
Although production orders are used for disassembly the processing steps have been simplified.[anchor|#_57c9f9f6-dee8-420f-9786-d4bceea69645]
*A disassembly transaction is performed in a single step. The item to disassembly is issued from inventory and the salvaged components received into inventory.
*The ''Release Materials'' and ''Auto Create Linked Orders'' actions are cannot be used for disassemble production orders.
*The disassembly transaction will generate Inventory Issues and Receipt for the ''Disassembly ''transaction and Inventory Adjustments for ''Correction ''transactions.
*Disassemble production orders can be selected only on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_15_00|Disassembly] ([~/?ScreenId=AM301500|AM301500]) form. (On this form, only disassemble orders can be selected).
*Move and material transactions are not required and the forms do not allow the selection of disassemble production orders.
*Configuration entry performed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_60_00|Configuration Entry] ([~/?ScreenId=AM306000|AM306000]) form cannot be run for disassembly production orders. However, you can disassemble a configured item by using the production order that made it as the source.
*Labor transactions do allow selection of disassembly order types, but restrict entry to any quantity related fields. Disassembly orders do not require operations. Unlike Move/Labor transactions which are operation specific, the disassembly entry does not provide an entry for operation number for the production item.
*Disassemble orders use the same production order status codes (for details, see [HelpRoot_Manufacturing\AM_PM_PROD_ORDER_STATUS|Production Order Statuses]) as regular orders.

==Configuration Requirements==
The disassembly process is the part of production management. Before you can use the process the you must create a production order type with the ''Disassemble'' function on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_11_00|Production Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=AM201100|AM201100]) form.[anchor|#_cb5ae424-fb40-4764-b992-aca5dd9bc15d]
*The order type can use a different numbering sequence and GL accounts.
*Define the following on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_10_20_00|Production Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AM102000|AM102000]) form:

==Accounting==
The costing method for disassemble production order is ''Actual''. Any difference between the value of inventory issued and returned or scrap is booked to WIP Variance account when the production order is closed. When releasing the disassembly transaction the following accounting entries are generated:[anchor|#_e123ffba-cad5-4d56-8f75-c24e3330e8d3]
*Credit Inventory and debit Work in Process account for the cost of the item being disassembled.
*Debit Inventory and credit Work in Process for the component returned to stock.
*Credit Work in Process and debit the scrap expense account for components scrapped.
*Credit Work in Process and debit the inventory account for components scrapped.
*Debit Work in Process and credit the expense accounts for labor, overhead, tools, and/machines.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Disassembly Process Sometimes the products you produce need to be issued out of inventory and disassembled to     salvage their components. The item may be obsolete, returned non-functional from a customer,     have appearance flaws that would not be accepted. or maybe purchased just for the value of a     component. The disassembly process allow users to manage and track the disassembly process of a     product, capture related costs, and put the usable component parts back into inventory.     Defective or non-recoverable components can be scrapped. Disassemble type production orders are     used to capture the costs incurred and a single-step disassembly transaction, which can be     processed by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM301500|AM301500]) Disassembly (AM301500) form, used to record the     inventory issue, scrap, and component returns to stock. Features The following features are provided: Generates an issue transaction for the item being disassembled and a receipt for the      components salvaged. Allows for scrap of disassembled component materials. Create a new disassemble production order based on disassemble order type. Create a disassembly transaction directly on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM301500|AM301500]) Disassembly (AM301500)      form (and select a disassembly production order) or on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM201500|AM201500]) Production Order Maintenance      (AM201500) form. The source for materials to be returned by the disassemble process can be a bill of material      or copied from another production order. Disassembly entry allows for batch correction (reverse previous disassembly entry). By-products not supported for disassemble orders. Allows actual labor entry. Copies predefined attributes from the order type, bill of material, and source production      orders to the disassemble orders. Allow for entry of attribute values for disassembly transactions. Allows for override of the unit cost of materials returned to stock. Processing Disassemble Production Orders Although production orders are used for disassembly the processing steps have been     simplified. A disassembly transaction is performed in a single step. The item to disassembly is issued      from inventory and the salvaged components received into inventory. The  Release Materials  and  Auto Create Linked Orders  actions are cannot be used      for disassemble production orders. The disassembly transaction will generate Inventory Issues and Receipt for the        Disassembly  transaction and Inventory Adjustments for  Correction       transactions. Disassemble production orders can be selected only on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM301500|AM301500]) Disassembly      (AM301500) form. (On this form, only disassemble orders can be selected). Move and material transactions are not required and the forms do not allow the selection of      disassemble production orders. Configuration entry performed on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM306000|AM306000]) Configuration Entry (AM306000) form cannot      be run for disassembly production orders. However, you can disassemble a configured item by      using the production order that made it as the source. Labor transactions do allow selection of disassembly order types, but restrict entry to any      quantity related fields. Disassembly orders do not require operations. Unlike Move/Labor      transactions which are operation specific, the disassembly entry does not provide an entry for      operation number for the production item. Disassemble orders use the same production order status codes (for details, see  Production Order Statuses) as regular orders. Configuration Requirements The disassembly process is the part of production management. Before you can use the process     the you must create a production order type with the  Disassemble  function on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM201100|AM201100]) Production Order Types (AM201100) form. The order type can use a different numbering sequence and GL accounts. Define the following on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM102000|AM102000]) Production Preferences (AM102000) form: The  Disassembly Numbering Sequence  for the disassembly        transactions. The optional  Default Disassembly Order Type . You may want to create a separate bill of material for disassembly production orders     otherwise you may be adding additional costs for operations marked for backflush. Alternatively,     remove the unnecessary operations, clear backflush, and/or set their run and machine times to     zero. Accounting The costing method for disassemble production order is  Actual . Any difference between     the value of inventory issued and returned or scrap is booked to WIP Variance account when the     production order is closed. When releasing the disassembly transaction the following accounting     entries are generated: Credit Inventory and debit Work in Process account for the cost of the item being      disassembled. Debit Inventory and credit Work in Process for the component returned to stock. Credit Work in Process and debit the scrap expense account for components scrapped. Credit Work in Process and debit the inventory account for components scrapped. Debit Work in Process and credit the expense accounts for labor, overhead, tools,      and/machines. ]]></column>

A rework or repair order can be used to issue an existing item from inventory, do something to it, and return it to stock with the same or different inventory id. There are a number of reasons why this may be necessary:[anchor|#_3cbfca90-bd15-4b94-967d-d43532a13e26]
*The item is an old revision and needs to be upgraded.
*A component from a supplier was found to be defective and needs to be replaced.
*It was returned by a customer or someone else and needs to be inspected and repaired if necessary.
*It can be converted into a different item that someone wants.
*You want to disassemble it for it&rsquo;s parts and dispose it.

==Create a Repair/Rework Bill of Material==
If you frequently do repair work for your customers you might create a repair bill of material for the stock item. You would list the operations to be performed and if required, any materials always used in the process. By having a special bill of material you can also add notes, attach procedures, or add attributes to the bill that will be copied to the production order based on the production order type settings specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_11_00|Production Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=AM201100|AM201100]) form.
==Create a Production Order Type==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_11_00|Production Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=AM201100|AM201100]) form, you create an order type for repair and rework orders to help identify them and to use different settings, such as:[anchor|#_72550456-28db-453c-9f2e-280d42ae524e]
*Numbering Sequence
*WIP and WIP Variance Accounts (only if Posting Class is not used)
*Default Costing Method
*Copy Notes Settings
*Data Entry Settings

==Create the Production Order==
To start you need to create a production order for the item you plan to receive into inventory. If the item has a bill of material you can decide if you want to use an existing bill, either the default or a special repair bill, to start and then amend it as necessary by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_90_00|Production Order Details] ([~/?ScreenId=AM209000|AM209000]) form. You delete unneeded operations with their materials; change, delete, or add materials; modify overhead and/or tools as required. Be sure to review the backflush check boxes for an operation or material and clear them when necessary.{br}

Alternatively, you can remove the ''BOM ID'' on the '''References''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_15_00|Production Order Maintenance] ([~/?ScreenId=AM201500|AM201500]) form. If you do this, you will need to create at least one operation in order to report the quantity completed and issue materials. The first material to add is the inventory item to issue to the production order which can be the same as the item being reworked.{br}

If known if advance, you can add other materials to the details or simply issue them as needed during the rework process; there is no restriction on materials being issued that are not in the production details. If some materials are recoverable and are known in advance, make the quantity required a negative and a receipt will be created to return the item to inventory when you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_00_10|Materials Wizard] (opened from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_00_00|Materials] ([~/?ScreenId=AM300000|AM300000]) form) to create a materials batch.((({S:Warn}Whether or not you use an existing bill of material or manually enter the production details you will need to add the item being issued from inventory for repair and this can be the same item you will return to stock or dispose. Although you cannot specify an inventory item as a component of itself in a bill of material because it would cause a circular reference in MRP Regeneration or the Cost Roll process, you can do this for a production order.
)))
If you are using posting classes defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) form to specify default WIP and WIP Variance accounts, you can override these settings on the '''References''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_15_00|Production Order Maintenance] form.
==Returning Materials to Stock==
If there are components that are removed and can be used elsewhere or need to be returned to vendor, you can enter a negative quantity on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_00_00|Materials] ([~/?ScreenId=AM300000|AM300000]) form. The cost of an item returned to stock is dependent on the ''Default Returns Cost'' settings for warehouses. If the materials need further processing (inspection, disposal, repair, return to vendor, etc.), you should indicate a warehouse bin location that is not included in the quantity available calculations and excluded from MRP.{br}

The cost of materials returned to stock will credit the work in process account specified on the production order and debit the inventory account associated with each inventory item.
==Returning Materials to Vendors==
After returning the item to stock, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form to create a vendor return. For more information about vendor returns, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\OrderMgmt_Purchase_Return_Original_Cost_GeneralInfo|Purchase Returns at the Original Cost: General Information] and [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\OrderMgmt_Purchase_Return_Calc_Cost_GeneralInfo|Purchase Returns at the Calculated Cost: General Information].
==Posting the Completion or Disposal==
If the repairs were successful, then you can receive the unit to stock by creating a move or labor transaction. If the unit is lot- or serial-tracked you can use the same lot or serial number or the new one, that is, you can add a suffix to indicate it has been repaired.{br}

If the repairs were not completely successful, then you can enter the scrap quantity on the Move or Labor transaction to complete the production order. Using this method can leave a balance for the WIP amount on the production order. Alternatively, you could receive the item into a disposal location and use an Inventory Issue with an appropriate reason code to charge the costs to whatever account you desire.
==Closing the Production Order==
The final step is to close production orders by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_50_60_00|Close Production Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=AM506000|AM506000]) form to zero out any WIP balance and to post those costs to the WIP Variance account. You can update the production order to change the WIP Variance account before closing the order.]]></column>

==Project Form Changes==
The '''PROD''' check box has been added to the '''Visibility Settings''' section on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]). You have the flexibility to decide if specific projects and tasks are visible for production orders and estimates. The following project management forms have enhancements to support the production order integration. [anchor|#_57b842cc-0b44-4908-8553-fdfddb9e2097]

*The production order selector used by multiple forms includes columns for project, task, and cost code.
*The following forms similarly have been enhanced to show project, task, and cost code:

**[HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_50_00_00|Release Production Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=AM500000|AM500000])

==Hints==
The work in process asset account associated with each production order collects all of the manufacturing expenses (materials, labor, overhead, scrap, etc.). The work in process and inventory asset accounts are the only accounts that are posted with project transactions. Expense transactions (labor, overhead, scrap, etc.) do not post to projects. It is strongly recommended to create a work in process account(s) to be only used for production orders in order to facilitate reconciliation with the GL.[anchor|#_bb2cd5e4-29e1-4406-b0c6-0c6dec609d0d]
*You should not purchase items you intend to issue to production orders that reference a project and the '''Update Project''' check box on the production order is selected otherwise you would charge the project twice.
*For the above reason, purchase orders created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_40_10_00|Critical Materials] ([~/?ScreenId=AM401000|AM401000]) form do not reference the project from the production order. Projects are updated when the materials are issued to the production order and the '''Update Project''' check box for the production order is selected.
*Inventory items can be issued or received to any valid warehouse location; that is, transactions do not require project-specific warehouse locations.
*Estimates do not create accounting transactions and therefore do not update projects.
*Project references on estimates do not update the corresponding project references on opportunities or sales orders.
*If you have both project and non-project production orders it may make sense to create separate order types on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_11_00|Production Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=AM201100|AM201100]) form to ensure the correct settings for account numbers and costing methods. If you do this, you could also clear the default order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_10_20_00|Production Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AM102000|AM102000]) form to force the users to choose the correct order type.

Labor is a component of product cost, both when rolling up the planned costs for bills of material and production orders and when recording the actual times or backflushing the standard times. Recording the actual time spent on production operations and comparing them to the planned costs is part of manufacturing performance reporting. Every production order tracks the variances between planned and actual costs and reports are provided in the module. Even if all or some labor is backflushed you could possibly create a custom inquiry or report to compare the actual labor costs to the ''earned'' or standard costs.{br}

There are two methods to report labor hours and their resultant cost against production orders:[anchor|#_7c5b0534-fdc6-4e48-bc5e-2407e087d55c]
#Direct entry by employees using their cost rates or work center standard rates.
#Backflushing labor by reporting quantities completed at an operation.

Both methods can be used concurrently. For example, employees will only report labor against milestone operations and the prior secondary operations will be backflushed for labor. Additionally, non-direct labor, labor not attributed to a production order, can be reported to capture their cost in the GL.{br}

Integration with employee time activities (for details, see [HelpRoot_Organization\EP__con_Time_Tracking|Time Activities]) is supported by using the [https://help-2020r1.acumatica.com/(W(52))/Wiki/ShowWiki|Create Labor Time Activities] (AM503000) form if the ''Time Reporting on Activity'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
==Prerequisites==
Whether or not you decide in include the labor element in your costs, the following items are required:[anchor|#_c8c42da3-f6f1-4b24-a103-677f8db44893]
*''GL Accounts:'' These are the offset accounts used when labor costs are posted to the Work in Progress account of the production order or indirect labor is reported.
*Labor codes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_65_00|Labor Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=AM206500|AM206500]) form: The labor code determines the GL account for labor cost. Direct labor requires a labor account and indirect requires both a labor account and an overhead account.
*Work calendar on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_90_00|Work Calendar] ([~/?ScreenId=CS209000|CS209000]) form: All work centers need to have a calendar.
*Shifts on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_50_00|Shifts] ([~/?ScreenId=AM205000|AM205000]) form: These are required when adding a work center. Shifts can also be used to factor labor rates for premium hours such as overtime or holidays.
*Work centers on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_70_00|Work Centers] ([~/?ScreenId=AM207000|AM207000]) form:
**''Standard Cost:'' This is the cost per hour used when calculating planned costs, backflushing labor, and optionally used when employees report labor.
**Shifts: You must specify a shift and its associated work calendar and labor code. When employees report their time, they must enter the shift and that defaults the labor code.
**''Backflush Labor:'' This will be the default when you add an operation for the work center in bills of material.
**Overhead: They are not required but it may be easier to add them to the work center rather than specifying them on the bill of material for each operation. You can use labor overhead rates calculated on the basis of hours and/or labor costs.

==Employees==[anchor|#_8372121a-f1f4-43ef-8e84-581cd18bed24]
*Employees, which are managed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form:
**''Production Employee:'' If employees will report direct or indirect labor they must be flagged as a production employee
**''Employee Cost:'' If you wish you use the employee cost rate, you must specify the rate on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_99_00|Labor Cost Rates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209900|PM209900]) form.

==Production Preferences==[anchor|#_b4145a2f-434f-49bf-bae9-2124250bfb7a]
*'''Use Labor Rate''': either ''Standard'' (uses Work Center Standard Cost) or ''Employee'' (use Employee Cost Rate not payroll rate). The work center standard rate is always used when labor is backflushed.
*'''Default User Employee ID''': If the logged on user is a production employee, then their employee number is populated on the Labor transaction form.

==Operations in Bills of Material==
The setup and run time elements for each operation are used to calculate the planned labor cost of a bill of material and production order. Both are extended by the work center standard rate per hour. Setup time cannot be reported; it is only posted when the operation is backflushed.
==Reporting Actual Hours==
The [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_10_00|Labor] ([~/?ScreenId=AM301000|AM301000]) form is used to report hours against production operations as well as the quantity completed, and optionally scrap, at an operation of a production order. This same form is used to report indirect labor.{br}

Additionally, production employees can clock on and off of production orders by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_31_50_00|Clock Entry] ([~/?ScreenId=AM315000|AM315000]) form or the Acumatica mobile app.[anchor|#_151829e4-7556-41ac-8574-13c0e9ddbc6f]
*Reporting of scrap is not allowed
*Clock entries must be approved by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_51_60_00|Approve Clock Entries] ([~/?ScreenId=AM516000|AM516000]) form to create a labor transaction batch.

==Accounting for Labor Costs==
The WIP account for the production order is debited and the labor account for the labor code is credited. When a quantity completed is reported on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_10_00|Labor] ([~/?ScreenId=AM301000|AM301000]) form, any labor overheads are calculated and debit WIP and credit their respective overhead accounts. You should consider the impact of posting to these accounts, as well as the other cost elements recorded by production management transaction, on your GL. Most companies record their actual factory expenses, such as wages and benefits, equipment costs, production supplies, and utilities to the GL.{br}

If both the actuals and the production order transactions are reported you may be posting the same costs twice. You should consider setting up the manufacturing accounts as accrual accounts and debit these accounts to zero when you post your actual costs.]]></column>

The following is a typical process flow of a production order from time of entry to closing it out in the system. All of these processes are recorded on the '''Events''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_15_00|Production Order Maintenance] ([~/?ScreenId=AM201500|AM201500]) form.[anchor|#_4ba7839f-0406-48a8-a58f-a73db8bdc50d][anchor|#_15a48d9c-8a06-4f3e-97dc-f205356a787a][image:UserGuide/Images/MFG_Production_Order_Process_Flow1.png|popup|450px]
==Creating Production Orders==
Production orders can be created in any of the following ways:[anchor|#_dbfbaad0-81fb-473d-a050-64678122815a]
*Manually by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_15_00|Production Order Maintenance] ([~/?ScreenId=AM201500|AM201500]) form
*By clicking '''Actions''' > '''Production Orders''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form
*By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_51_00_00|Create Production Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=AM510000|AM510000]) form
*By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_40_10_00|Critical Materials] ([~/?ScreenId=AM401000|AM401000]) form to create child production orders linked to a parent production order
*By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_40_00_00|MRP Display] ([~/?ScreenId=AM400000|AM400000]) from to create multiple orders

For orders created from MRP or critical materials, the primary bill of material from the '''Manufacturing''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) is used to create the production details. For manually created or from sales orders, the source of the production details can be a bill of material, an estimate managed on the [https://help-2020r1.acumatica.com/(W(92))/Wiki/ShowWiki|Estimate] (AM303000) form, or a configuration managed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_75_00|Configuration Maintenance] ([~/?ScreenId=AM207500|AM207500]) form.{br}

When created, the orders have a status of ''Planned''. Orders with status do not allocate inventory and cannot be posted with any transactions.
==Releasing Production Orders==
Production orders may have their status changed to ''Released'' directly from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_15_00|Production Order Maintenance] ([~/?ScreenId=AM201500|AM201500]) form. You can also release multiple orders by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_50_00_00|Release Production Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=AM500000|AM500000]) form. When released, production orders are listed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_20_00|Inventory Allocation Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) form and the quantity to product is shown in the '''On Production Supply''' box and the materials allocations in the '''In Production Demand''' box.
==Printing Production Tickets==
Production tickets, which you can view in the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\AM_62_50_00|Production Ticket] ([~/?ScreenId=AM625000|AM625000]) report, can be printed directly on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_15_00|Production Order Maintenance] ([~/?ScreenId=AM201500|AM201500]) form or multiple tickets printed by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_51_10_00|Print Production Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=AM511000|AM511000]) form. If either method is used, the method records the event of printing on the''' Event History''' tab of the order.
==Issue Materials==
Material transactions managed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_00_00|Materials] ([~/?ScreenId=AM300000|AM300000]) form, are used to issue materials to production orders. They can be created in any of the following ways:[anchor|#_f38d2462-4d85-4164-ad41-0267316eef85]
*Manually
*By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_00_10|Materials Wizard] form
*By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_55_00|Unreleased Material Allocations] ([~/?ScreenId=AM305500|AM305500]) form
*When confirming vendor shipments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_31_00_00|Vendor Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=AM310000|AM310000]) form
*Created and released automatically as a result of backflushing when reporting operation completes by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_10_00|Labor] ([~/?ScreenId=AM301000|AM301000]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_20_00|Move] ([~/?ScreenId=AM302000|AM302000]) forms.

When released, an inventory issue is created by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form to update the component on hand balances as well as the production order details, totals, and work in process balance. You should select the '''Automatically Post on Release''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form to ensure the timely updating of on hand and WIP balances. Alternatively, you can setup an automation schedule for releasing inventory documents by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_10_00|Release IN Documents] ([~/?ScreenId=IN501000|IN501000]) form throughout the day.{br}

Issuing materials changes the status of a production order to ''In Process'' if not already set.
==Posting to Operations==
Posting to the production order operations must be done in order to move the order through the production processes. Each company can decide which operations should be reported and which operations can be backflushed when setting up the bills of material. When reporting quantities completed, any prior operations that have not been reported are reported in the same quantity.{br}

Posting to operations changes the status of a production order to ''In Process'' if not already set.{br}

When the last operation is reported, an inventory receipt is created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) form to update the on hand balance of the item being produced. There are two methods used to post operations:[anchor|#_e5f0748e-8cec-402f-b16d-7567ddad0617]
*When you want to post the actual labor hours to a production order, use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_10_00|Labor] ([~/?ScreenId=AM301000|AM301000]) form. You can also optionally post the quantities completed and scrapped at the same time.
*When you want to report only the quantities completed and scrapped, use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_20_00|Move] ([~/?ScreenId=AM302000|AM302000]) form. Labor hours and costs are backflushed if set on the operation.

Regardless of which form is used, both a cost transaction on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_90_00|Cost Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=AM309000|AM309000]) form is created to record the transaction details and a GL batch on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_30_10_00|Journal Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=GL301000|GL301000]) form is created to debit the work in process account and credit the appropriate accrual accounts for labor, tools, machines, and overhead costs. The latter three cost elements are only posted when quantities are reported and the operation is marked for backflush. They are always issued automatically in proportion to the quantity reported. All costs incurred to date are summarized on the production order and production operations '''Totals''' tab.
==Completing Production Orders==
When reporting the last operation, if the total of quantity completed is equal to or greater than the quantity planned to produce, the production order status is changed to ''Complete''.{br}

You can manually change the status to ''Complete'' by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_15_00|Production Order Maintenance] ([~/?ScreenId=AM201500|AM201500]) form.{br}

When a production order is compete only WIP adjustment transactions managed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_80_00|WIP Adjustment] ([~/?ScreenId=AM308000|AM308000]) form can be posted to the production order.
==Closing Production Orders==
The final process is to close a production order by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_50_60_00|Close Production Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=AM506000|AM506000]) form, which creates the final adjustment to set the work in process balance to zero by creating a cost transaction on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_90_00|Cost Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=AM309000|AM309000]) form and a GL batch on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_30_10_00|Journal Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=GL301000|GL301000]) form. The offset is added to the WIP Variance account.]]></column>

|- 
| ''Planned''
| Production orders start in the ''Planned'' status. The supply allocation is ''Production Supply Prepared''; the material requirements are ''Production Demand Prepared''. Transactions cannot be entered against a production order in the ''Planned'' status. You can delete a production order in the ''Planned'' status; if the order is linked to a sales order, you will be prompted to confirm the deletion.
|- 
| ''Released''
| Production orders in the ''Released'' status allow transactions to be posted. The supply allocation is ''Production Supply''; the material requirements are ''Production Demand''. A production order can be moved from the ''Released'' status back to the ''Planned'' status. Productions orders can be released by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_15_00|Production Order Maintenance] ([~/?ScreenId=AM201500|AM201500]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_50_00_00|Release Production Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=AM500000|AM500000]), or the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_50_30_00|Release AM Documents] ([~/?ScreenId=AM503000|AM503000]) form.
|- 
| ''In Process''
| When the first transaction is posted against the production order, the status of the production order is automatically moved to ''In Process''. An ''In Process'' production order cannot be moved back to ''Release'' or ''Planned''. However, your can ''Complete'' or ''Cancel'' an ''In Process'' production order.
|- 
| ''Hold''
| Production orders in ''Planned'', ''Released'', or ''In Process'' status can be moved to the ''Hold'' status by selecting the '''Hold''' check box. When a production order is in the ''Hold'' status, no transactions can be issued against it. If the production order should no longer be on hold, clear the '''Hold''' check box. The production order will automatically change back to the status that it was at prior to the ''Hold'' status. Therefore, if the production order was released and then put on hold, when it is removed from hold, it will return to the ''Released'' status.
|- 
| ''Cancelled''
| Only a production order that is in process can be cancelled. Once cancelled, the production order cannot be changed back to any other status. You cannot issue transactions against a cancelled production order. If the production order has an open Work In Process, a GL batch will automatically be created to adjust the WIP account value. A production order can only be cancelled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_15_00|Production Order Maintenance] ([~/?ScreenId=AM201500|AM201500]) form. If the order is linked to a sales order, you will be prompted to confirm the deletion.
|- 
| ''Complete''
| Once all the finished good items have been completed, the status of the production order is completed. As labor or move transactions are entered against the production order, there is a check box that indicates that the operation is completed. When the last operation is completed, the production order is completed. The user can still issue transactions against a completed production order. The production order is completed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_10_00|Labor] ([~/?ScreenId=AM301000|AM301000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_20_00|Move] ([~/?ScreenId=AM302000|AM302000]), or the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_15_00|Production Order Maintenance] forms.
|- 
| ''Closed''
| Once a production order is completed, the next step is to close the production order. This is done through [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_50_60_00|Close Production Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=AM506000|AM506000]) form. This form lists all the completed production orders. The user can select the production orders that need to be closed and then click the '''Process''' button. If there is a WIP variance on the production order, the system will correct the variance through a GL batch.

This form lists all         the completed production orders. The user can select the production orders that need to be         closed and then click the  Process  button. If there is a WIP variance         on the production order, the system will correct the variance through a GL batch. ]]></column>

This topic describes how transactions are used to collect and post costs to production orders and how these transactions affect the general ledger.{br}{TOC}
==Transaction Types and Processing==
The following transactions are used to post to production orders:[anchor|#_31e45120-5d55-4be5-84ea-c2d6349d6e63]
*Labor (which are managed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_10_00|Labor] ([~/?ScreenId=AM301000|AM301000]) form)
**Posts direct labor to production order operations and creates a ''Cost Transaction'' batch.
**Allows posting of indirect labor to the indirect labor expense account and creates a ''Cost Transaction'' batch.
**If a quantity completed and/or scrap is entered, other costs related to the operation such as overhead, tooling, and/or machines are automatically posted as well in the ''Cost Transaction'' batch.
**If there are materials specified for the operation that are marked as backflush and a quantity completed and/or scrap is entered, then a ''Materials'' batch is created and processed.
**If the quantity completed is for the last operation, an ''Inventory Receipts'' batch is created. If the quantity completed is negative then an ''Inventory Issues'' batch is created.
*Move (which are managed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_20_00|Move] ([~/?ScreenId=AM302000|AM302000]) form)
**Same as labor but without posting of labor.
*Material (which are managed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_00_00|Materials] ([~/?ScreenId=AM300000|AM300000]) form)
**Post materials issues.
**Create ''Inventory Issues'' batch for components consumed and an ''Inventory Receipts'' batch for by-products.
**If materials are being returned, that is, a negative quantity was entered on the Materials batch or a negative quantity completed was entered on the Labor or Move transaction and there are materials marked as backflush, the ''Inventory Issues'' batch lines have a transaction type of ''Return''.
*Vendor shipment (which are managed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_31_00_00|Vendor Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=AM310000|AM310000]) form)
**Creates a materials batch.
**Create ''Inventory Issues'' batch for components consumed.
**Post the cost to the subcontract totals.
*WIP adjustment (which are managed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_80_00|WIP Adjustment] ([~/?ScreenId=AM308000|AM308000]) form)
**Adjusts the WIP balance and creates a ''Cost Transaction'' batch.
**If a production order is cancelled or closed a ''WIP Adjustment'' batch and ''Cost Transaction'' batch are created also.

The cost adjustment batches (managed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_90_00|Cost Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=AM309000|AM309000]) form) create a GL batch to update the work in process and the appropriate expense accounts.
==Processing Steps==
In order to ensure that all transactions are flow through the system as required, the following actions occur from the Release action of the source batch:[anchor|#_13633bc8-1cd9-402e-828e-a616bcf25215]
#All of the related transaction batches are created (''Materials'', ''Cost'', ''Inventory'', and ''GL'') with a status of ''Hold''. A user cannot edit or release the on hold ''Inventory'' or ''GL'' batches because the source is not IN or GL.
#All of the related transaction batches are released.
#The production orders are updated and the source batch is marked as ''Released''.
((({S:Warn}Should you find a production batch with a status of ''Balanced'' where the batch has a reference to an Inventory or GL batch, do not attempt to release the inventory or GL batch. Release the production source transaction batch again and it will process and release the related transaction batches if they already exist and create any that are missing. You may need to add the '''IN Ref Nbr''' or '''GL Ref Nbr''' to the columns in the details area in order to see the reference.
)))
==Reversing a Transaction==
All enterable production transactions can be reversed by entering a negative quantity or hours. The easiest way to accomplish this with a minimum of typing is to find the original transaction batch and create a new batch by copying its settings. You change the appropriate transaction line quantities or hours to a negative value. Then you delete any other lines that you do not need to correct. If batch control totals are used, they must be negative also. Then you release the new batch. When the transaction is to reverse/decrease an inventory receipt from a production order, see [HelpRoot_Manufacturing\AM_PM_NegativeMove|Reversing Production Receipts].((({S:Warn}Cost Transactions cannot be directly entered as they are created by other production transactions.
)))
==Transaction Accounting==
Each production order contains the following boxes that get posted as well as the individual cost elements:[anchor|#_dc70c82e-c954-4f84-aaa5-d0e3e74985ec]
*'''WIP Total''': This is the sum of all actual costs and is updated for every transaction.
*'''MFG to Inventory''': This is the total of the inventory receipts from the production order and is updated by a Labor or Move transaction for the final operation when a quantity complete is entered.
*'''WIP Balance''': This is the difference between '''WIP Total''' less '''MFG to Inventory'''

*The lot or serial numbers were incorrect.
*The receipt cost was wrong because transactions were not reported. This is particularly important when you are using Actual Costing.

==Creating the Move or Labor Batch==
You can directly enter the transaction or paste the original batch into the form. In either case the quantity to be reversed is entered as a negative. The following must be observed:[anchor|#_26272f06-4c21-42c0-94be-39802bc6abf0]
#You cannot reverse more than you have completed on the last operation.
#If you are reversing labor also, you cannot reverse more than the actual hours reported.
#You cannot drive the on hand balance of the warehouse location negative if the '''Allow Negative Inventory''' check box is cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form.
#If the inventory item is lot controlled, you must select an existing lot and the quantity cannot exceed the on hand balance. For multiple lots, you must enter each lot on a separate line.
#If the inventory item is serialized, you must enter each serial number on a separate line.
#If the inventory item has a FIFO valuation method, you must select the receipt number to adjust and the quantity cannot exceed the receipt quantity. If more than one receipt number, each receipt must be on a separate line.

These business rules are validated and enforced by the inventory adjustment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_30_00|Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=IN303000|IN303000]) form.
==Transaction Processing Details==
If the transaction is valid, then:[anchor|#_44de5f1c-8edd-4fec-991e-fafdb93c5041]
*The Inventory Adjustment batch is released and updates the on hand balance and unit cost.
*The production order ''Quantity Completed'' and ''Quantity Remaining'' are adjusted
*The production order total for ''MFG to Inventory'' is reduced by the extended cost.
*The production order total for ''WIP Total'' is increased by the extended cost.

The Estimating part provides the ability to create quick or detailed manufacturing estimates for improved estimate accuracy and turnaround times. An estimate is for a single inventory or non-inventory item. You build an estimate from bills of materials, production orders, or other estimates to accurately calculate costs and prices for new or existing parts using material costs, work center rates, overheads, and other cost data. Or you can start by entering just summary cost data and later on start adding the details.{br}

Estimating is designed to supplement and enhance the customer management processes from opportunity, through quoting, to sales order. It also supplements engineering from design, through building a prototype, and final conversion to a standard product with a bill of material.{br}

The estimating functionality is available only when the ''Estimating'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}{TOC}

*Various levels and combination of estimate details provides you with ability for quick or detailed entry.
*Estimates can be converted to standard sales order lines.
*A bill of material can be created from an estimate.
*A production order can be created from an estimate or converted sales order line.
*Estimates are not multilevel in that one estimate is referenced by another estimate.
{br}{TOC}
==Cost Levels and Calculations==
Estimate costs can be defined at the following levels: detail, operation, and estimate. The costs for an estimate always update the parent level totals. This includes any changes on the estimate or the estimate operation pages. The concept for calculating the cost types is the same as currently calculated for production planned costs on a production order with an exception that labor is broken out into fixed and variable. The extended information about the estimate cost levels is the following:[anchor|#_88429da7-cb25-47be-a671-7a3513b0c642]
*Detail
**The lowest level of detail represented by the material, tools, and overhead tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_40_00|Estimate Operation] ([~/?ScreenId=AM304000|AM304000]) form.
**Modifying these cost types will have their costs roll up to the parent operation level costs.
**The detail level cannot exist without an operation level as details are linked to an operation.
*Operation
**The middle level of an estimate.
**All detail level costs roll up to the estimate level unless the '''Override''' check box is selected for a specific cost type.
**When a cost type has the '''Override''' check box selected, any value can be entered. No updates will automatically calculate the value that has been overridden.
**Operations define the labor and machine costs related to the run rates and work center/machine costs.
**The operation level cannot exist without an estimate level as operations are linked to an estimate.
*Estimate
**The summary and highest level of an estimate.
**All operation level costs roll up to the estimate level unless the '''Override''' check box is selected for a specific cost type.
**When a cost type has the '''Override'''e check box selected, any value can be entered. No updates will automatically calculate the value that has been overridden.

The summarized order of calculating costs from estimates or estimate operations is the following:[anchor|#_103c2f85-714a-4e88-a0f0-84b179e9c7f3]
#For each operation, fixed labor, variable labor, machine, material, tools, and overhead are rolled up and update the operation cost type field if not set to override.
#Sum each operation cost type and update the estimate cost type fields if not set to override.
#Sum all cost types to show total cost.
#Divide total cost by order quantity to set the unit cost field
#If unit price override is selected: calculate margin percent
#If unit price override is cleared: calculate unit price
#If the estimate is referenced on a sales order or opportunity and the estimate reference is not completed or cancelled, then the source order must also have its pricing recalculated using the reference graph.

| Create the required estimate classes
| Use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_60_00|Estimate Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AM206000|AM206000]) form to define them. You must specify a class when you build an estimate.
|- 
| 3
| Define the numbering sequence for the estimation ID
| Create a numbering sequence for estimate IDs on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_10_10|Numbering Sequences] ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) form and specify the sequence on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_10_30_00|Estimate Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AM103000|AM103000]) form.
|- 
| 4
| Define work centers
| Use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_70_00|Work Centers] ([~/?ScreenId=AM207000|AM207000]) form to define the areas where work will be performed. Normally these are areas of a warehouse intended to be used in the production processing such as assembly, cutting, painting, and testing. These can also be used to track outside processing. These track standard labor rates (optional), overheads (optional) and machines (optional). You cannot add an estimate operation details on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_40_00|Estimate Operation] ([~/?ScreenId=AM304000|AM304000]) form unless you define a work center.
|- 
| 5
| Complete the estimate setup
| Use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_10_30_00|Estimate Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AM103000|AM103000]) form. This must be completed before you can use the estimating functionality.
|- 
| 6
| Optionally create notification templates
| Estimates use [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) records to indicate the Owner and/or Engineer of an estimate. You can use business events functionality to track changes of estimates. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Using_Business_Events_Mapref|Using Business Events].
|- 
| 7
| Determine if estimates will be used on customer management forms
| On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_10_10_00|Customer Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CR101000|CR101000]) form, select the '''Allow Estimating''' check box. For details on modification of the printing form for opportunity quotes, see [HelpRoot_Manufacturing\AM_EST_OpporuntityQuoteForm|Modifying the Opportunity Quote Form to Include Estimates].

The Product Configurator translates product knowledge into a set of rules to guide an end user through all of the steps necessary to produce a valid product and its options. You can use the configurator both in sales orders and production orders. A configure to order (CTO) item must be a stock inventory item. The [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_75_00|Configuration Maintenance] ([~/?ScreenId=AM207500|AM207500]) form is used to define configurations.{br}

This functionality is available when the ''Product Configurator'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}{TOC}
==Revision Control==
Configuration definitions are stored as non-date driven configuration revisions. This provides the designer with the ability to work on a new configuration definition for the same inventory item while the active revision is being used by end users.
==Features==
Features are the list of options available for user selection. Labels are used to identity the feature to the user. The user can navigate whatever way they select by using the Feature navigation panel in [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_60_00|Configuration Entry] ([~/?ScreenId=AM306000|AM306000]).{br}

A feature can specify the minimum and maximum options a user can select. Rules are used when an option selected for a feature may restrict the options available for another feature. For example, selecting a fabric option may restrict the options available to select for the color feature. Features can also be hidden when user selection is not required, for example once the options for the color and fabric features are selected, the inventory item to use is determined in a hidden feature.
==Options==
Options can be a list of selections or stock and non-stock inventory items. An inventory item associated with an option becomes a material component of the configuration. You can use subassemblies as options and mark an item as phantom; the subassembly, and optionally its routing, is exploded during production order creation and added to the list of components.{br}

In the following diagram, you can see the relationships between options and features.[anchor|#_dfca01c0-260f-4fa6-ab3d-b64932724f8b][anchor|#_459e6250-2e1e-4f5c-88b1-648d8d27755e][image:UserGuide/Images/MFG_Relations_BetweenFeatures_and_Options.PNG|popup|Relationships between features and options|350px]
==Attributes==
Attributes are used for multiple purposes. You can add attributes to features and configurations.[anchor|#_5be70412-da1a-4d17-b5f3-42dc3913f060]
*They can be used as selections in a configuration or to enter values. Rules can use attribute values to determine allowable options.
*Attributes can be assigned variables and used in formulas such as a width dimension and a height dimension used to calculate the area of material required.
*Attributes can be used to gather information used in the manufacturing or assembly process, for example, switch settings or dimensions.
*You enter a formula in the list of attributes that you wish to display during configuration entry but not allow data entry.

==Rules Driven==
Configuration rules apply to and drive both quantity (that is, dimensions) and features (that is, options). Rules are used to present the user with option choices based on other options they have selected. For example, the options for fabric change based on the color option selection. Option selection can be enforced by minimum and maximum criteria for the number of options a use can select. Quantity rules can specify minimum, maximums, and lot sizes.{br}

Rules can also be used with attributes to include or exclude features and options.{br}

Rules are optional; a feature might just require a user to select from a list such as storage and memory options.
==Formula Support==
Dimensions are handled through formulas on designated fields such as computing the square meters of fabric required based on the linear dimensions entered. Formulas can be expressed for any numeric field including quantities and attributes.
==Configuration Keys==
A configuration key identifies what values out of a configuration define its uniqueness compared to other completed configurations of the same configuration ID. A key value is an output of a completed configuration entry which can be preselected before entering a configuration to bring up the same configuration completed in the past using the same key. The key can be a numbering sequence unique to each configuration result or a formula using attribute values.{br}

Additionally, formulas may be used to create a key description and a transaction description.
==Completion==
A configuration is completed when all required features have been selected and all rules are validated and the user indicates that they are finished. This provides the user with the ability to save a configuration in progress without having to abandon data entry.
==Output==
The output of a configuration consists of the selected features and quantities, attributes and values, and configured item price. The options are combined with the template bill of material of the CTO inventory to build the production order details.]]></column>

This topic is intended to provide some methods to print the configuration results data on customer and prospect facing forms such as Sales Order, CRM Quote, Invoice, etc. The configuration results data is created and assigned a unique id when the configuration is saved on the related document. The relationships of the tables are described in [HelpRoot_Manufacturing\AM_Tables|Using Manufacturing Data in Inquiries and Reports].{br}{TOC}
==Sales Documents==
To print the configuration data on sales documents a subreport can be used. The main report needs to pass the order type, order number, and line number to the subreport. In most cases, the options selected during configuration would be printed. If desired the attribute values could also be printed.{br}

The sales form (Quote, Sale Order, and Invoice) have the same column layout of line number, inventory id, description, quantity, UOM, unit price, discount, and extended price. The [HelpRoot_ReportReference\SO_64_20_00|Shipment Confirmation] ([~/?ScreenId=SO642000|SO642000]) report removes the pricing information but the line number and inventory id and description are in the same location. Therefore the same subreport could be used for all four forms using visible expressions to suppress the pricing information if price is to be shown on the other three forms.{br}

The following reports are provided:[anchor|#_61e6f33d-b76d-49f6-b6b2-1199d0146b25]
*SO6410AM - example of the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\SO_64_10_00|Quote] ([~/?ScreenId=SO641000|SO641000]) report with the Estimates sub report. This could be used in a similar way to add the Configurator subreport.
*SO6411AM - Subreport for estimates
*SO6410PC - Subreport to print product configurator options that can be used for quotes, sales orders, and invoices.

==Subreport to Print Options for Sales Documents==
From the main report, you create the collection of columns to pass to the subreport:[anchor|#_047af5fe-65b6-4e07-ac40-24d0e6990ab5]

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Adding Configuration Data to Forms This topic is intended to provide some methods to print the configuration results data on     customer and prospect facing forms such as Sales Order, CRM Quote, Invoice, etc. The     configuration results data is created and assigned a unique id when the configuration is saved     on the related document. The relationships of the tables are described in  Using Manufacturing Data in Inquiries and Reports. Sales Documents To print the configuration data on sales documents a subreport can be used. The main report     needs to pass the order type, order number, and line number to the subreport. In most cases, the     options selected during configuration would be printed. If desired the attribute values could     also be printed. The sales form (Quote, Sale Order, and Invoice) have the same column layout of line number,     inventory id, description, quantity, UOM, unit price, discount, and extended price. The   ([~/?ScreenId=SO642000|SO642000]) Shipment Confirmation (SO642000) report removes the pricing information but     the line number and inventory id and description are in the same location. Therefore the same     subreport could be used for all four forms using visible expressions to suppress the pricing     information if price is to be shown on the other three forms. The following reports are provided: SO6410AM - example of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO641000|SO641000]) Quote (SO641000) report      with the Estimates sub report. This could be used in a similar way to add the Configurator      subreport. SO6411AM - Subreport for estimates SO6410PC - Subreport to print product configurator options that can be used for quotes,      sales orders, and invoices. Subreport to Print Options for Sales Documents From the main report, you create the collection of columns to pass to the subreport: SOLine.OrderType SOLine.OrderNbr SOLine.LineNbr These same columns must be defined in the susbreport as parameters and used as filters as     follows: The following filters can be used to only print selected features or options: AMConfigurationOption.PrintResults Equals 1 AMConfigurationFeaturen.PrintResults Equals 1 The last filter below, selects only those options that were selected for this configuration.      Without it, all options would be shown. AMConfigResultsOption.Included Equals 1 ]]></column>

==Defining a Configured Item==
Each item to be configured must be setup as a configured item, source of manufacturing, contain a bill of material, and have an active revision configuration definition. Setup of these values can be performed as follows:[anchor|#_5fe63ca6-6759-4aa4-bbbd-0ebe814842e4]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, in the '''Inventory ID''' box of the Summary area select the item and, on the '''Manufacturing''' tab, select the '''Configured Item''' check box.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_80_00|Bill of Material] ([~/?ScreenId=AM208000|AM208000]) form, an active bill of material should be created for an item–warehouse pair. This bill of material will be used as a template to add materials to each of the operations.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_75_00|Configuration Maintenance] ([~/?ScreenId=AM207500|AM207500]) form, you should create a configuration with an active revision for the stock item and BOM.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form, you do the following:
#*In the '''Inventory ID''' box, you select the stock item.
#*In the '''Warehouse''' box, you select the warehouse.
#*On the '''Replenishment Info''' tab, you make sure that ''Manufacturing'' is selected in the '''Replenishment Source''' box.
#*On the '''Manufacturing''' tab, you select the BOM linked to configuration definition.

==Labels==
You can create labels to make selections more user-friendly. The concept of labels is similar to an ID and CD configuration in the Acumatica ERP database, such as {{Inventory ID}} and {{Inventory CD}}: {{Inventory ID}} is the database key but the {{Inventory CD}} can be changed. This concept provides you with the ability to select rules, attributes, and other parameters based on the label value (visible string label) but the stored value in the database is the ID-like value (non-visible integer value). Due to this you can rename the label while keeping the related data connected without needing to update all necessary tables.
==Formulas==
To support dimensional configurations of certain fields by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_75_00|Configuration Maintenance] ([~/?ScreenId=AM207500|AM207500]) form, you can enter formulas. The formula concept is the same as used in Acumatica Report                         Designer and general inquiries when building reports and when executing reports. The configuration maintenance provides you with the ability to enter a fixed value or a formula value to be calculated during configuration entry on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_60_00|Configuration Entry] ([~/?ScreenId=AM306000|AM306000]) form. The calculation of formulas in configuration entry is constantly updated when rules are processed and values are changed. Formulas are only visible on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_75_00|Configuration Maintenance] form and never displayed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_60_00|Configuration Entry] form. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_30_60_00|Configuration Entry] form,boxes that contain formulas will always contain a value as a result of the formula execution. The [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM__ref_IS_Formula_Editor_Dialog|Formula Editor Dialog Box] is used for building formulas. After entering a formula, you should click '''Validate''' in the editor.
==Rules Processing==
Rules are controlled by three types: ''Exclude'', ''Include'', and ''Require''. When rules are processed you only see the available remaining options. You can select attributes, features, and options in any order. For example, one user might select color as an important choice and select it first. Another user might select the fabric first as the importance. For additional information, see [HelpRoot_Manufacturing\AM_PC_RulesProcessing|Rules Processing].
==Supplemental Items==
Supplemental items are supporting option items selected during configuration entry and indicated as a supplemental item in the configuration definition. When supplemental items are selected and the configuration entry is complete the options will be added to a quote or sales order as a new line item. The concept is a supporting item that is shipped and sold separately from the configured item. These line items cannot be edited by the user in the quote or sales order. Supplemental item price and cost does not get rolled into the configured item. For additional information, see [HelpRoot_Manufacturing\AM_PC_SupplementalItems|Supplemental Items].
==Configuration Keys==
The concept for configuration keys is to define a completed configuration entry with a selectable value for future configuration. It also supports the selections of sub items when the sub item feature is enabled. Configuration keys are generated at the completion of a configuration and recalculated if adjustments to a configuration entry are made. Completions of configuration entries are made when the user clicks the finish button. A user can select a configuration key before starting a new configuration entry to preload the selections or attribute used from the last completed configuration entry with the same configuration key. Only those features and options not selected to ''Results Copy'' will not be included in the preloaded configuration.
==Pricing==
The [HelpRoot_PricesAndDiscounts\PriceDiscount_Reviewing_Sales_Prices_GeneralInfo|Sales Prices: General Information] topic describes how the price of the configured item, its options, and bill of material components is determined. For additional information, see [HelpRoot_Manufacturing\AM_PC_Pricing|Pricing and Cost].
==Cost==
Factors that impact costing are no different than currently implemented in the current standard manufacturing suite. Cost factors are labor, machine, material, tools, and overhead and are not individual, configurable components. These cost factors are attached to the BOM as fixed entries. The only configurable cost factor is material which may vary depending on the configuration results through selected options and multilevel configurations. Cost is determined only when a production order is created.
==Production Order Details==
When a production order is created for a configured item the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_90_00|Production Order Details] ([~/?ScreenId=AM209000|AM209000]) form displays the operations defined in the configured item bill of material. The operations may have materials, steps, overhead, and tooling predefined. The materials selected by the configured are attached to their defined operations.]]></column>
			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Processes and Functions Defining a Configured Item Each item to be configured must be setup as a configured item, source of manufacturing,     contain a bill of material, and have an active revision configuration definition.

This topic describes ways to manage configurations.{br}{TOC}
==Managing Configurations and Revisions==
Configuration definitions are linked to a single bill of material which in turn makes each definition specific to an inventory item and warehouse. The following rules are applied to configuration definitions:[anchor|#_92931167-30f9-4296-8edb-db77699eedd3]
*You can have multiple bills of material for an inventory item and warehouse.
*You can have multiple configuration definitions for a bill of material.
*Only one configuration definition can be the default for a stock item and warehouse but you can change the default to another active configuration definition.

A configuration definition revision can have the following statuses:[anchor|#_ad00f9af-464c-4954-87e6-8869eeefb475]
*''Pending: ''This is the status for a new configuration. You can test the configuration but it cannot be used in sales orders or production orders and it cannot be the default configuration for an inventory item. You can only delete configuration definitions with this status.
*''Active:'' This is the only status allowed for configuration entry and specified as a default.
*''Inactive:'' This configuration definition cannot be used for new sales orders and production orders. However, You can reconfigure existing orders that are using this configuration and revision.

There can be only one revision with the ''Active'' status, one revision with the ''Pending'' status, and multiple revisions with the ''Inactive'' status. You change revision statuses as follows:[anchor|#_ee0e4ac4-c126-49ad-956b-0848a2f330cc]
*Before creating a new revision, you must change the status of the current revision with the ''Pending'' status to ''Active'' or ''Inactive''.
*If you want to change the revision status to ''Active'' or ''Pending'', you must first change the status of the current revision with the ''Active'' or ''Pending'' status to ''Inactive''.

The following table displays the possible status changes for revisions of a configuration definition.[anchor|#_459f53a3-46ea-4af6-bbfd-285f7f7d5b6b]

==Fixing Incorrectly Configured Orders==
Each configuration result has the configuration ID and revision level used and although the configuration definition may be inactive, you can reconfigure the order and that definition and revision will be used. On the '''References''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_15_00|Production Order Maintenance] ([~/?ScreenId=AM201500|AM201500]) form, you can view the configuration ID and revision. At this time, you can only delete and reenter the sales order line but first delete the production order. For production orders, you can delete and recreate if no activity has occurred, or if in process, correct the production details for any incorrect materials similar to adjusting the order because the bill of material was incorrect.
==Copying Sales Documents with Configured Items==
Additional columns have been added to the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form to display information about configurable items. These include a column to identify if an item is configurable and if the configuration is complete and columns to link any supplemental items to their parent configured items. In the latter, if you delete the line for a configured item, the supplemental items are deleted also; deletion of a supplemental item is disabled.{br}

When you copy a sales order with configurable items by using the '''Copy Order''' action on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form, you select the '''Copy Configurations''' check box selected. The system will copy configuration and any supplemental items appropriately and you can configure the copied lines.]]></column>

You can have multiple configuration definitions for a bill of material. Only one configuration definition can be the default for a stock item and warehouse but you      can change the default to another active configuration definition. A configuration definition revision can have the following statuses: Pending:  This is the status for a new configuration.

This topic describes rules that can be used with configurations.{br}{TOC}
==Types of Rules==
You can create rules of the following types: ''Exclude'', ''Include'', and ''Require''. When rules are processed you can only see the available remaining options. Selection of attributes, features, and options can go in any order. For example, one user might choose color as their first choice. Another user might select the fabric as their first choice.{br}

Rules are triggered by the source feature, any option or a specific option being selected, or the conditional value of an attribute. Then rule type determines what action to take against the target feature and its options as follows:[anchor|#_ff6c173f-2ea6-4c20-b250-d48b82e59b4d]
*''Exclude:'' All of the options or specific options of a feature cannot be selected. The options are not displayed unless the user chooses to see them.
*''Include:'' All of the options or specific options of a feature are automatically selected.
*''Require:'' An option selection must be made for the target feature.
*''Validate:'' The attribute value must meet a condition. This type is available only for attributes.

==Rule Examples==
'''Example 1: Excluding an Option Based on Another Option'''[anchor|#_795e06ab-f440-44a5-84f4-322d7df679e6]
*Feature A has Options A1, A2, and A3 
*Feature B has Options B1 and B2. Option B2 must be unavailable for selection when Option A1 is selected.

The rule for Feature A to exclude Option B2 for Feature B is displayed in the following table.[anchor|#_9dcd1457-7106-41cd-9e06-14805a2ef3df]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!'''Rule'''
! '''Source'''
! '''Target Feature'''
! '''Target Option'''
|- 
| Exclude
| A1
| Feature B
| B2
|}
Because you can select features in any order, you need to have a rule for Feature B also to exclude Option A1 if Option B2 is selected, as shown in the following table.((({S:Hint}You can use this rule with the same feature, for example, to make Option A2 unavailable when Option A1 is selected.
)))[anchor|#_879259bc-1441-4761-ac96-75e2fe9c67d7]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!'''Rule'''
! '''Source'''
! '''Target Feature'''
! '''Target Option'''
|- 
| Exclude
| B2
| Feature A
| A1
|}((({S:Hint}You can use ''Include'' instead of ''Exclude'' when an option is to be automatically selected based on the selection of another option.
)))
'''Using ANY and ALL'''{br}

{{<ANY>}} is used for the ''Source'' feature when any option selection will trigger the rule. {{<ALL>}} is used to include or exclude all ''Target'' feature options.{br}

For example, suppose that any option selected for Feature A must exclude Feature B Option B2, as shown in the following table.[anchor|#_e1dd14b7-f851-4ab8-9b79-1a08c3bebc26]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!'''Rule'''
! '''Source'''
! '''Target Feature'''
! '''Target Option'''
|- 
| Exclude
| {{<ANY>}}
| Feature B
| B2
|}
Further suppose that if Option A1 of Feature A is selected, then all options for Feature B must be excluded and Feature B must be unavailable for selection. The following table displays this rule.[anchor|#_683b74b0-3a7e-40ac-a1b8-68b15517c6e8]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!'''Rule'''
! '''Source'''
! '''Target Feature'''
! '''Target Option'''
|- 
| Exclude
| A1
| Feature B
| {{<ALL>}}
|}
In the example above, if the source were {{<ANY>}}, then Feature A and Feature B would be mutually exclusive. If the rule was of the ''Include'' type, then all options of Feature B would be added when Option A1 of Feature A was selected.
==Including an Option Based on an Attribute Value==
When you define attributes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_50_00|Attributes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) form, you can enter a list of valid values for attributes with the ''Combo'' and ''Multi Select Combo'' control types. You can also use attribute values specified in the '''Value ID''' column in rules. {br}

For example, suppose that you have an attribute with the list of colors (see the following table).[anchor|#_4e15667a-e718-4f1c-9563-59922deadecf]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!'''Value ID'''
! '''Description'''
|- 
| R
| Rudy Red
|- 
| B
| Baby Blue
|- 
| G
| Lime Green
|}
Based on the color selection, you want to include Option B2 of Feature B when the red color (Value ID = R) is selected. The rule will be the following.[anchor|#_f79d824d-f8c9-4e24-8c79-99b2da622858]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!'''Rule'''
! '''Condition'''
! '''Value 1'''
! '''Target Feature'''
! '''Target Option'''
|- 
| Include
| Equals
| =&rsquo;R&rsquo;
| Feature B
| B2
|}
Attribute values are text fields so they need to be in single quotes to validate by using the {{Equal}} operation or converted to decimals to validate by using the {{Between}}, {{Greater}}, or {{Less}} operations.{br}

'''Validating an Attribute Value'''{br}

You may need to validate an attribute value. Since attributes are text fields, you need to convert them to decimals in the '''Value''' boxes by using the {{CDec(x)}} conversion function. The '''Target Feature''' and '''Target Option''' boxes are unavailable for rules of the ''Validate'' type. {br}

For example, suppose that a user must enter a value between 1 and 5; such as 1, 1.5, 4.33, 5. The rule is the following.[anchor|#_5311898e-bfc7-4cfd-8c95-2fd053dcda50]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%"

==Rule Concepts==[anchor|#_158ac07c-81fe-45a5-882d-96dcae95a606]
*Rules are triggered by option selection or attribute value changing:
**Rules for features can be triggered by a single option or any option being selected.
**''Source'' and ''Target'' feature can be same.
**Rules for attributes can be triggered by the conditional value of the attribute.
**Rules for features and attributes can target a single option or all options.
*Features and their options can be selected in any order. When defining a configuration you need to account for the dependency of options; that is, if B2 is excluded when A1 is selected, then A1 is excluded when B2 is selected.
*Deleting options will revert all rules previously applied during that deleted options selection.
**If the option was included from another rules, the parent rule or rules will also need to be reverted.
**These are most likely include options. The parent and child rules of the include option being deleted will all be reverted as this implementation considers the ''Include ''rule type to be treated like an include required rule.
*When rules are triggered, the processing of each should be included in a recordable action to allow undo of parent and child processed rules. For example:
**User selects Option 1 of Feature 1 which has a rule that includes Option 3 of Feature 2.
**User selects Option 5 of Feature 6 which also has a rule that includes Option 3 of Feature 2.
**If the user removes Option 3 of Feature 2 from being selected Option 1 of Feature 1 and Option 5 of Feature 6 are also reversed.
**If Option 3 of Feature 2 had child rules they would also be removed.
*The rule trigger for features or options is the change in option selections. ''Selected'' or ''Included'' to apply rules and ''Unselected'' or ''Excluded'' to reverse any previously applied rules.
*The trigger for attribute rules are the change in attribute values.
*Attribute rules are applied before option rules when configuration entry orders are started.
*Options with the '''Fixed''' check box selected cannot be excluded by any rule. A user could write rules that would attempt to include, exclude, or require this type of option but all rules processing would ignore application to the options with fixed checked.

==Order of Rules==
Rules are validated in the following order:[anchor|#_a8a5b5b3-2f6f-486a-822d-17521cae4dc7]
#Selected or cleared option
#Rule type: Exclude, Include, Require (in that order).
#Source option with {{<ANY>}} being last
#Sort order of applied feature
#Applied option with {{<ALL>}} being last
#Repeat step 1 for each sub rule that needs to be processed as a result of any include or exclude rule previously executed.
#Exclude rules will override include rules when multiple rules are executed against an option.
#Include rules cannot override exclude rules when multiple rules are executed against an option.
#Rules that exclude/include entire features also run each rule against each option if one exists:
#*Example: Feature 1 was excluded by a rule on Option 2 in Feature 4. Option 1 within Feature 1 has a rule to exclude an option from Feature 2 which needs to be executed when Feature 1 was excluded the same was as if Feature 1 was specifically excluded.
#Required rules that have an empty applied option ({{<ALL>}}) do not get applied to all options like Include or Exclude rules do. Instead, the Required flag is set on the feature forcing a selection of any option while the selection still fits within the selection/quantity requirements.
#Attribute rules run as they are sorted in the rules grid.
#Attribute rules only execute if the condition is true. If the condition was previously true and the user changes a value or the overall condition from the result of a formula value is no longer true, all rules are reversed that were previously applied from that rule.
#Rules processing is chained to each feature/option rule executed from a previous rules execution:
#*Example: Option 1 of Feature 1 has a rule that includes Option 3 of Feature 2. Option 3 also has an exclude on Feature 4. When the rule for including Option 3 execute it also needs to run any rules attached to it such as excluding all of Feature 4.
#Options within a feature can only be selected once. If a user needs more than 1 of a specific option, the qty required field is used to indicate the number of units required.
#The Option selection panel is used to include the set of selections.
#The status of attributes, features, and options are updated at the end of each rules processing. For details on the process for determining each components status see Configuration Component Status in the Appendix.
#Defaults are applied the first time the configuration entry order is started. The order of execution are attribute defaults and any related rules then the order the options exist on the entry defaults page. Each default processes the rules the same way if a user entered the option selections in that same order.
#If an option was auto-included from the processing of a rule, the system should prevent a user from removing it and should give a proper message indicating the source selected option.
#If an option was added by a user, and a user selects an option which makes the previously selected option now excluded, the user should see a message indicating if the selection should continue with the exclusion or cancel the selection.

Types of Rules You can create rules of the following types:  Exclude ,  Include , and       Require . When rules are processed you can only see the available remaining options.     Selection of attributes, features, and options can go in any order. For example, one user might     choose color as their first choice. Another user might select the fabric as their first     choice. Rules are triggered by the source feature, any option or a specific option being selected, or     the conditional value of an attribute. Then rule type determines what action to take against the     target feature and its options as follows: Exclude:  All of the options or specific options of a feature cannot be selected. The      options are not displayed unless the user chooses to see them. Include:  All of the options or specific options of a feature are automatically      selected. Require:  An option selection must be made for the target feature. Validate:  The attribute value must meet a condition. This type is available only for      attributes. Rule Examples Example 1: Excluding an Option Based on Another Option Feature A has Options A1, A2, and A3  Feature B has Options B1 and B2. Option B2 must be unavailable for selection when Option A1      is selected. The rule for Feature A to exclude Option B2 for Feature B is displayed in the following     table. Rule Source Target Feature Target Option Exclude A1 Feature B B2 Because you can select features in any order, you need to have a rule for Feature B also to     exclude Option A1 if Option B2 is selected, as shown in the following table. You can use this rule with the same feature, for example, to make Option A2     unavailable when Option A1 is selected. Rule Source Target Feature Target Option Exclude B2 Feature A A1 You can use  Include  instead of  Exclude  when an option is to be     automatically selected based on the selection of another option. Using ANY and ALL <ANY>  is used for the  Source  feature when any option selection will     trigger the rule.  <ALL>  is used to include or exclude all  Target      feature options. For example, suppose that any option selected for Feature A must exclude Feature B Option B2,     as shown in the following table. Rule Source Target Feature Target Option Exclude <ANY> Feature B B2 Further suppose that if Option A1 of Feature A is selected, then all options for Feature B     must be excluded and  Feature B must be unavailable for selection. The following table displays     this rule. Rule Source Target Feature Target Option Exclude A1 Feature B <ALL> In the example above, if the source were  <ANY> , then Feature A and Feature     B would be mutually exclusive. If the rule was of the  Include  type, then all options of     Feature B would be added when Option A1 of Feature A was selected. Including an Option Based on an Attribute Value When you define attributes on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) Attributes (CS205000)     form, you can enter a list of valid values for attributes with the  Combo  and  Multi      Select Combo  control types. You can also use attribute values specified in the       Value ID  column in rules.  For example, suppose that you have an attribute with the list of colors (see the following     table). Value ID Description R Rudy Red B Baby Blue G Lime Green Based on the color selection, you want to include Option B2 of Feature B when the red color     (Value ID = R) is selected. The rule will be the following. Rule Condition Value 1 Target Feature Target Option Include Equals ='R' Feature B B2 Attribute values are text fields so they need to be in single quotes to validate by using the       Equal  operation or converted to decimals to validate by using the       Between ,  Greater , or  Less  operations. Validating an Attribute Value You may need to validate an attribute value. Since attributes are text fields, you need to     convert them to decimals in the  Value  boxes by using the       CDec(x)  conversion function. The  Target Feature  and       Target Option  boxes are unavailable for rules of the  Validate      type.  For example, suppose that a user must enter a value between 1 and 5; such as 1, 1.5, 4.33, 5.     The rule is the following. Rule Condition Value 1 Value 2 Target Feature Target Option Validate Is Between CDec(1) CDec(5 ) N/A N/A Rule Concepts Rules are triggered by option selection or attribute value changing: Rules for features can be triggered by a single option or any option being selected. Source  and  Target  feature can be same. Rules for attributes can be triggered by the conditional value of the attribute. Rules for features and attributes can target a single option or all options. Features and their options can be selected in any order. When defining a configuration you      need to account for the dependency of options; that is, if B2 is excluded when A1 is selected,      then A1 is excluded when B2 is selected. Deleting options will revert all rules previously applied during that deleted options       selection. If the option was included from another rules, the parent rule or rules will also need to        be reverted. These are most likely include options. The parent and child rules of the include option        being deleted will all be reverted as this implementation considers the  Include  rule        type to be treated like an include required rule. When rules are triggered, the processing of each should be included in a recordable action      to allow undo of parent and child processed rules. For example: User selects Option 1 of Feature 1 which has a rule that includes Option 3 of Feature        2. User selects Option 5 of Feature 6 which also has a rule that includes Option 3 of Feature        2. If the user removes Option 3 of Feature 2 from being selected Option 1 of Feature 1 and        Option 5 of Feature 6 are also reversed. If Option 3 of Feature 2 had child rules they would also be removed. The rule trigger for features or options is the change in option selections.  Selected       or  Included  to apply rules and  Unselected  or  Excluded  to reverse any      previously applied rules. The trigger for attribute rules are the change in attribute values. Attribute rules are applied before option rules when configuration entry orders are      started. Options with the  Fixed  check box selected cannot be excluded by any      rule. A user could write rules that would attempt to include, exclude, or require this type of      option but all rules processing would ignore application to the options with fixed      checked. Order of Rules Rules are validated in the following order: Selected or cleared option Rule type: Exclude, Include, Require (in that order). Source option with  <ANY>  being last Sort order of applied feature Applied option with  <ALL>  being last Repeat step 1 for each sub rule that needs to be processed as a result of any include or      exclude rule previously executed. Exclude rules will override include rules when multiple rules are executed against an      option. Include rules cannot override exclude rules when multiple rules are executed against an      option. Rules that exclude/include entire features also run each rule against each option if one       exists: Example: Feature 1 was excluded by a rule on Option 2 in Feature 4. Option 1 within        Feature 1 has a rule to exclude an option from Feature 2 which needs to be executed when        Feature 1 was excluded the same was as if Feature 1 was specifically excluded. Required rules that have an empty applied option ( <ALL> ) do not get      applied to all options like Include or Exclude rules do. Instead, the Required flag is set on      the feature forcing a selection of any option while the selection still fits within the      selection/quantity requirements. Attribute rules run as they are sorted in the rules grid. Attribute rules only execute if the condition is true. If the condition was previously true      and the user changes a value or the overall condition from the result of a formula value is no      longer true, all rules are reversed that were previously applied from that rule. Rules processing is chained to each feature/option rule executed from a previous rules       execution: Example: Option 1 of Feature 1 has a rule that includes Option 3 of Feature 2. Option 3        also has an exclude on Feature 4. When the rule for including Option 3 execute it also needs        to run any rules attached to it such as excluding all of Feature 4. Options within a feature can only be selected once. If a user needs more than 1 of a      specific option, the qty required field is used to indicate the number of units required. The Option selection panel is used to include the set of selections. The status of attributes, features, and options are updated at the end of each rules      processing.

A change to the configuration, whether in the sales order or in an associated production      order will add or remove the sales order lines for any supplemental items associated with the      configured sales order line and recalculate the order quantity. Changing the order quantity for the configured item will not change the order quantity for      the associated supplemental items. You can change the quantity, warehouse, price, and other parameters for supplemental      items. Examples Consider supplemental items as materials not required to build the configured item but are     selected based on the configured item and should be shipped with it: A desktop computer where the monitor and keyboard are separate inventory items that must be      picked and shipped with the sales order. The monitor and keyboard selections may affect the      configuration of the computer components but they are components themselves for the production      order for the computer. Accessories such as power cords, cables, installation CD's, and manuals for equipment that      are included with the configured item. Miscellaneous charges for rush orders, extra fees for services, or packaging and shipping      charges. You indicate supplemental items on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AM207500|AM207500]) Configuration Maintenance (AM207500) form by     selecting the material type for an option of a feature. Since supplemental items will not be     components on a production order, the operation number is not required. All other capabilities     such as calculation of the quantity required and rules are available. ]]></column>

| Create stock items
| Use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form to create the items. Once you have built a configuration you will need to select the configuration ID of the active revision. Do the same on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form. Stock Items should have a lot or serial class specified,where the lot or serial number is assigned upon receipt to help the system in selecting the proper item to allocate or ship. You can use the sales order number and line as the lot or serial number (such as SO123456/3) because the number is the reference in the production order. Alternatively, you can use the production order number as the lot or serial number because it is referenced in the sales order line.

This topic explains how capacity is calculated for work centers in the Manufacturing edition.{br}{TOC}
==Working Calendars==
A working calendar defines the starting and ending times for each working day plus any break times such as lunch. A work calendar can have exceptions for days not worked, such as holidays or shutdown periods, or non-working days that are work days, such as unplanned overtime on a weekend not normally worked.{br}

Each work center can have multiple shifts and each shift has a working calendar. A group of work centers may have a second shift or even a third shift.{br}

Some work centers may operate 24 x 7; such as fermentation tanks. Machines only require a calendar.
==Work Centers==
The daily capacity for a work center is the total working hours for all shifts. The value of the '''Basis for Capacity''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_70_00|Work Centers] ([~/?ScreenId=AM207000|AM207000]) form determines which operation times are used by the scheduling processes in each work center. In this box, you can select any of the following values:
*''Crew Size:'' The run units and run time from an operation are used.
*''Machines:'' The machine units and machine time from an operation are used. If the '''Machine Scheduling''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_10_20_00|Production Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AM102000|AM102000]) form, the machines calendar is used.

Setup time is used in both cases. ((({S:Warn}The following parameters are not used:[anchor|#_25d96b02-27e1-4660-afaa-32d295fff4ad]
*Crew size
*Machines
*Efficiency
*Move times
*Queue times
)))
==Schedule Blocks==
To simplify the scheduling process and to accommodate different types of manufacturing, schedule blocks are used in finite scheduling. The size of the schedule block is defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_10_20_00|Production Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AM102000|AM102000]) form and applies to all work centers. The block size can be as small as 5 minutes or as large as 1 hour with options for 10, 15, and 30 minutes.]]></column>

In conjunction with the constraint date, this determines the sequence by which the operations of the production order are scheduled. You can select any of the following scheduling methods on the '''General''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_15_00|Production Order Maintenance] ([~/?ScreenId=AM201500|AM201500]) form:[anchor|#_6af6ccf1-a090-44ed-b16a-80406313e4be]
*''Finish On:'' The operations are scheduled backwards from the constraint date. Production orders created from a sales order, or orders created as linked orders from a parent order, has this value selected by default. For sales orders, the constraint date is one day earlier than the scheduled ship date.
*''Start On:'' The operations are scheduled forward from the constraint date.
*''User Dates:'' This value provides you with the ability to define the start and end dates of the production order. This is a way for the user to override the manufacturing lead times or to use any calendar dates including non-working days. 

==Constraint Date==
This is a particular date by which the production order is needed or needs to be started. It is only entered when the scheduling method is either ''Finish On'' or ''Start On''. {br}

You specify the constraint date on the '''General''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_15_00|Production Order Maintenance] ([~/?ScreenId=AM201500|AM201500]) form.
==Dispatch Priority==
This is only used in APS to load the production orders and operations in priority sequence. Orders with the same priority are loaded by the constraint date. Orders with the highest priority are scheduled first. One (1) is the highest priority and ten (10) is the lowest.{br}

You specify the dispatch priority on the '''General''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_15_00|Production Order Maintenance] ([~/?ScreenId=AM201500|AM201500]) form.
==Infinite Capacity Planning==
Production order operations starting and ending dates are a calculated solely on the basis of operation duration. MRP planned orders always use this method. More details on how operation and production order dates are calculated can be found in the help article [HelpRoot_Manufacturing\AM_LeadTimeCalc|Lead Time Concepts].
==Finite Capacity Planning==
Production orders can be scheduled and rescheduled respecting the capacity and current load of work centers, machine, and tools and the availability of materials. If the scheduling method is ''Finish On'', the operations are scheduled backwards until the calculated operation start date is in the past. From that point the sequences is reversed and the operations are forward scheduled.((({S:Hint}You have the option to exclude the validation for available material as follows:[anchor|#_913c4ed9-ea8e-4988-bedc-59e36aaec249]
* For an entire production order type by setting the ''Scheduling'' option on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_20_11_00|Production Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=AM201100|AM201100]) form.
* For specific materials by setting the ''Scheduling'' option on the '''Manufacturing''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form.
)))
Operations are always scheduled in contiguous blocks skipping over non-working hours and schedule breaks. See the following example:[anchor|#_1aa774f5-dedc-4992-89ca-2a2d02098385]
*A work center has capacity available today starting at 11 am with a noon to 1 pm lunch break and a shift ending at 5 pm; so 5 hours remaining capacity and 8 hours available tomorrow. 
*The schedule blocks are 1 hour.
*An operation has a duration of 9 hours.

The following table shows the schedule blocks consumed by the operation.[anchor|#_f00007ca-8a8b-4be0-99fd-bf4d16f9cff0]

Finite scheduling may result in the following issues:[anchor|#_93e58ff0-d551-4830-99ac-59f7beb5bfff]
*Gaps may appear between operations when a resource is not available on the desired time slot. For example, an operation requires 8 hours of a resource and a contiguous block of time is not available for the next operation. This may not be the desirable when the next operation must be started immediately after completion of the previous operation.
*The calculated finish date of the production order may be after the required date for a sales order or linked production order.
*If all material is not available for the order, either in stock or allocated from a supply order, the order will not be scheduled.
*If machine scheduling is used, the machine may not be available although the work center is available.
*If tool scheduling is used, the tools required may not be available although the work center is available and the machine is available.

You can use engineering change control functionality only if the ''Engineering Change Control'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

In this topic, you will read about ECC functionality, workflow, and forms that support ECC functionality.
==ECC Functionality==
Engineering Change Control (ECC) provides the following abilities:[anchor|#_fda8cd86-f797-4790-88e0-b482445c1de2]
*Automates, controls, and organizes all change requests, plans, and actual changes to a bill of material.
*Full control from engineering change request (ECR) to engineering change order (ECO) to updating the bill of material.
*The ability to create multiple engineering change orders from multiple approved engineering change requests with the option to merge ECRs for the same bill of material and revision to a single ECO.
*The ability to use approval and assignment maps to control the approval process for both requests and change orders. You can specify if approvals are required for either or both ECR and ECO.
*Create notification templates on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_03|Notification Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=SM204003|SM204003]) form to inform users of the statuses of an ECR, ECO, and bill of material updates.

With the ''Engineering Change Control'' feature enabled the following restrictions apply if the '''Prevent New Revisions Without ECR''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_10_10_00|BOM Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AM101000|AM101000]) form:[anchor|#_5e0f576e-6abf-4a4e-ac4e-ef3a52b8a263]
*You cannot select the ''Hold'' check box for a bill of material (BOM) to edit it directly. You must use the ECR or ECO process to update BOMs once an ECR is created for the BOM.
*You can optionally disallow manually creating a new revision for a bill of material and force all new revisions to be created by the ECC process.
*The mass change process performed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_50_90_00|Mass Change] ([~/?ScreenId=AM509000|AM509000]) form is currently enabled but will be disabled in the future when ECRs are required. There will be an enhanced version of this process at a future date to support the ECC process.
*When an ECO is created for an ECR, the ECR status is changed to ''Completed''.
*When an ECO is applied to the bill of material, the ECO status is changed to ''Completed''.

==ECC Workflow==
In the following diagram, you can view the workflow of ECC.[anchor|#_f93b73bd-cc92-4e0d-b063-5fbd6acfd9d6][anchor|#_ad265741-3f70-4ff3-bec0-9c9789f296ca][image:UserGuide/Images/MFG_ECC_Process_Flow.png|popup|Workflow of Engineering Change Control|450px]{br}{TOC}
==Automation Definitions==
Predefined automation steps are provided for the ECR and ECO forms which are used to create the assignment and approval maps. The automation definitions must be imported by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AM_10_20_00|Production Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AM102000|AM102000]) form and then activated.
