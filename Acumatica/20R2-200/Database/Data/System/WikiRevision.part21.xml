System administrators play an important role in preparing Acumatica ERP to be used by the employees of an organization. As a system administrator, you install the system, keep it up to date, and configure the system based on the business processes of your organization. In this topic, you will read about the main tasks that a system administrator performs in the system.{br}{TOC}
==Installing and Maintaining an Acumatica ERP Instance==
If Acumatica ERP is used on the premises of your company or in your own data center, you first install the system on a server or multiple servers. This process involves the following steps:[anchor|#_af32904c-ef70-4344-a892-d32a5c609ece]
*Preparing your server or servers for the installation of Acumatica ERP: Before installing the system on your server, you may need to configure Internet Information Services and Microsoft SQL Server, as described in [HelpRoot_Install\PreInstall_System_Configuration|Preparing for Installing Acumatica ERP].
*Installing Acumatica ERP: You install the system on your local server or deploy the system in your own data center, as described in [HelpRoot_Install\Installing_Acumatica|Installing Acumatica ERP].
*Preparing the system for implementation: By default, Acumatica ERP is installed in trial mode. You remove the trial mode restrictions when you obtain and activate the license for using Acumatica ERP, configure system-wide security policies and provide access for implementers. For details, see [HelpRoot_Implement\config_SA_Prep_Instance_for_Implem_Mapref|Preparing Instance for Implementation].

When you exploit the system in production, you need to maintain it to provide trouble-free operation for the employees of your organization, as described in [HelpRoot_Administration\Maintaining_Acumatica|Maintaining Acumatica ERP].{br}

 Acumatica ERP is continuously being enhanced. These enhancements are provided in new versions and updates of the current version. Therefore, you need to update the system periodically to keep it up to date, as described in [HelpRoot_Install\Upgrading_Acumatica|Updating Acumatica ERP].
==Activating of Acumatica ERP Components ==
 Acumatica ERP provides a centralized point for managing activation of the system components. You can activate specific forms or features of Acumatica ERP in accordance with the purchased license. If required, you can also cancel the activation of specific components. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Implement\config_SA_Prep_Instance_for_Implem_Instance_Activation_and_Licensing|Preparing Instance: Activation and Licensing].
==Configuring System Security==
 Acumatica ERP specializes in the collection, storage, and processing of sensitive corporate data that must be protected against unauthorized access, use, modification, and disclosure. To ensure that the system resources are used properly, Acumatica ERP uses protective security measures, such as database encryption and access control.{br}

To ensure system security, you can do the following:[anchor|#_29b40e9c-1440-4263-a2f4-3db5dd86aca5]
*Administer user accounts: You configure and manage user accounts to provide your users with access to the system as a whole. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Managing_User_Access_Mapref|Managing User Access].
*Restrict access to information: You configure and manage access rights for users to the system objects. For more information, [HelpRoot_Administration\User_Roles_Mapref|Configuring User Roles] and [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Overview_of_Restriction_Groups|Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP].
*Enforce site security policies: You set up security polices for the system as a whole and for each particular user, including the auditing of user activities connected to system security. For details, see [HelpRoot_Implement\config_SA_Prep_Instance_for_Implem_Secure_Access_Implementers|Preparing Instance: System-Wide Security Policy].
*Encrypt sensitive data: You configure the encryption of sensitive information stored in the system. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Digital_Certificates|Data Encryption in Acumatica ERP].
*Audit data on the field level: You configure auditing on particular forms to record user activity on these forms. for details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Field_Level_Audit|Field-Level Auditing].

==Segmented Keys and Numbering Sequences==
In Acumatica ERP, different types of accounts and other system entities have identifiers, which you design to meet your organization&rsquo;s requirements, make identifiers more meaningful for users and reduce input errors. These identifiers can have any number of segments. For instance, you can define segments that denote specific divisions, departments, regions, or cost centers. You define segmentation by using segmented keys. Acumatica ERP provides a predefined configuration for each segmented key, which can be used in most cases. For more information about using segmented keys to configure identifiers for various entities, see the following topics: [anchor|#_6569ee78-9cb5-4ed9-b084-10e7308d0825]
*[HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Identifier_Segmentation|Segmented Identifiers]
*[HelpRoot_Financials\GL__con_Account_and_Subaccount_Identifiers|Account Identification]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Inventory_IDs_and_Subitem_Codes|Inventory Subitems]
*[HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Business_Accounts_Identifiers|Business Account Identifiers]

You use a numbering sequence to have the system automatically generate a number for a new object when the object is being created manually or automatically. For example, numbering sequences are used for numbering batches, allocations, schedules, vendors, and payments. Acumatica ERP provides a number of predefined numbering sequences, and your organization can create and use any number of user-defined numbering sequences. For additional information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Multiple_Numbering_Sequences|Numbering Sequence Usage].
==Configuring Input Validation Options==
To validate user input in data entry boxes in Acumatica ERP, you can define input masks and regular expressions. For instance, you can use input masks and regular expressions to validate the text boxes with phone numbers, postal codes, and tax registration numbers. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Examples_Mask_and_RegExp_Usage|Examples of Masks and Regular Expressions Usage ] and [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_CountryStatePostalCode_Validation|Country, State and Postal Code Validation].

For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__mng_MultiCompany|Managing Tenants].
*Site preferences: You can configure general settings for your organization, such as its name, the time zone of most users, the map viewer, the interface theme, and the parameters used when documents are exported to Microsoft Excel. For details, see [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_05|Site Preferences].
*Email settings: You can create and configure the system email accounts that can be used to centrally send mass emails, and you can schedule the sending and receiving of the emails. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\EM__con_System_Email_Accounts|System Email Accounts].
*Site structure: If the naming and organization of Acumatica ERP forms does not fit the needs of certain groups of users, you can view and update the order of forms in modules, create and populate new modules, regroup forms into sections, and rename forms. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Site_Map_Management|Managing the Site Map].
*File management: You can import and store different files, such as images in various formats, scanned documents, and internal instructions for employees. For example, you can attach a picture of an inventory item to the related item record, or a copy of an original vendor invoice to the related credit adjustment. You can easily view files, update them, check them out and in, get links to them, and configure access to them. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_File_Attachment_Management|File Attachment Management].

==Managing Emails==
 Acumatica ERP provides functionality to manage emails for the employees involved in customer relationship management (CRM) activities, such as working with leads and contacts, organizing campaigns, and handling cases. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\EP__con_Email_Management|Managing Emails]
==Specifying the Settings for Document Processing and Viewing==
In Acumatica ERP, you can specify the following system-wide settings for processing and viewing documents:[anchor|#_b607ddba-1c22-442b-890c-d4e623b033f9]
*Shared filters: Users can set up filters to list only the records they want to view (that is, only those with the criteria the users specify) on a particular form. By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_90_10|Filters] ([~/?ScreenId=CS209010|CS209010]) form, users can create filters for their personal use or filters to be shared with other users. As a system administrator, you can manage all shared filters created in the system. For more information, see [HelpRoot_ReportingTools\GI_Reusable_Filters_Mapref|Managing Advanced Filters].
*Segmented identifiers: You can design identifiers, which can be made up of any number of segments, for accounts and other types of system entities to meet your company&rsquo;s needs. For instance, in subaccount identifiers, you can define segments that denote specific divisions, departments, regions, or cost centers. By using segments, you make identifiers more meaningful for users and reduce input errors. You define identifiers by using segmented keys as follows: you can specify the number of segments the key has, the length and type of each, and the possible values of each segment. Acumatica ERP provides a predefined configuration for each segmented key, which can be used in most cases. For more information about segmented keys, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Identifier_Segmentation|Segmented Identifiers].
*Numbering sequences: You use a numbering sequence to have the system automatically generate a number that serves as the identifier (or a segment of the identifier) of a new entity when the object is being created manually or automatically. For example, numbering sequences are used for numbering batches, allocations, schedules, vendors, and payments. Acumatica ERP provides a number of predefined numbering sequences, and your organization can create and use any number of user-defined numbering sequences. For additional information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Multiple_Numbering_Sequences|Numbering Sequence Usage]. 
*Input validation options: To validate user input in data entry boxes, you can define input masks and regular expressions. For instance, you can use input masks and regular expressions to validate the text boxes with phone numbers, postal codes, and tax registration numbers. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Examples_Mask_and_RegExp_Usage|Examples of Masks and Regular Expressions Usage ] and [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_CountryStatePostalCode_Validation|Country, State and Postal Code Validation].

==Localizing Acumatica ERP==
You can maintain multiple locales and localize the Acumatica ERP user interface to multiple languages. You can translate strings from the application user interface directly in the application or by exporting the application strings to a third-party product and importing the translated strings back. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__mng_Locales|Managing Locales and Languages].
==Automating Processes==
You can automate particular processes in Acumatica ERP so that users spend less time initiating typical operations. You can automate processes as follows:[anchor|#_5753bbdb-4dd1-4dd7-b2ab-50e2c1f889ff]
*By scheduling processes: In any ERP system, the processing of documents and validation of accounts requires significant time and system resources. As such, these processes should be performed at times when there are no employees at work, such as at night or on the weekend. Other processing, such as releasing or posting documents, takes less time but also should be performed regularly, with a frequency geared toward the needs of your business. In Acumatica ERP, you can set up automated processing for most processing forms instead of initiating the processing manually. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Scheduled_Processing|Scheduled Processing].
*By automating workflows: For some forms in Acumatica ERP, you can create automation steps that redefine the functionality of toolbar buttons, add values to lists in combo boxes, or provide default values for the form elements based on the properties of the records to be processed. A complete set of automation steps is considered an ''automation definition'' and can be saved under the name you specify. You can create multiple automation definitions. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Automation_Maintenance|Automation Maintenance].

==Event Monitoring==
In Acumatica ERP, some executed business processes require the monitoring of particular activities and conditions in the system. You can configure the system to monitor the company data and to perform an action (such as sending a push notification or an email notification or performing the instructions defined by an import scenario) or multiple actions in the system based on various occurrences. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Using_Business_Events_Mapref|Using Business Events] and [HelpRoot_Administration\AI__con_Event_Monitoring|Managing Events].
==Configuring and Managing Dashboards==
Dashboards are an important and convenient tool for monitoring and analyzing critical business information. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_86_00|Dashboards] ([~/?ScreenId=SM208600|SM208600]) form, you can add dashboard pages, locate them in the site map, and set up the access rights to dashboard pages. For more information, see [HelpRoot_ReportingTools\Administering_Dashboards_Mapref|Managing Dashboards].
==Configuring and Managing Pivot Tables==
In Acumatica ERP, you can build pivot tables based on the data from generic inquiries. A pivot table is a program tool that you can use to reorganize and summarize data in a generic inquiry, to view it from different perspectives. Among other functions, a pivot table can automatically sort, count, total, or give the average of the data stored in a generic inquiry, displaying the results in a separate table showing the summarized data. You can configure and change the structure of pivot tables simply by dragging and dropping fields. For details, see [HelpRoot_ReportingTools\Pivot_Tables_Mapref|Managing Pivot Tables].
==Integrating Acumatica ERP with External Applications==
 Acumatica ERP is a web-based application; therefore, you can integrate it with various external web applications as follows:[anchor|#_0e9419cc-3dec-4a38-93f1-4e7ece6b5867]
*Building external web applications in Acumatica ERP: You can build external web applications in Acumatica ERP if the employees of your organization use these applications along with Acumatica ERP in their work. For example, you can build a Microsoft Power BI report into Acumatica ERP if employees analyze the reports based on data sets that are loaded from Acumatica ERP. For details, see [HelpRoot_Integration\SM__mng_Integration_External_Applications|Managing Integration with External Applications].
*Embedding Acumatica ERP forms in external web applications: You can embed Acumatica ERP forms in another web application that your employees use to solve their work tasks. For example, you can embed the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_40_40_00|Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=EP404000|EP404000]) form within your Office 365 page to view and access your Acumatica ERP task list directly in Office 365. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Integration\US__mng_Links|Integrating Acumatica ERP Forms on Your Website].

==Administering Acumatica Self-Service                         Portal==
The Acumatica Self-Service                         Portal provides a solution for you to more efficiently work and communicate with your customers. Self-Service Portal is specifically designed to be the site where your customers can view all the relevant information about their interactions with you as a vendor and perform needed activities online.{br}

If your organization wants to provide its customers with the functionality of Self-Service Portal, you need to install an instance of the portal, as described in [HelpRoot_Install\Installing_Portal|Setting Up Acumatica Self-Service                         Portal].{br}

After you have installed Self-Service Portal, you need to configure various settings so that the portal corresponds to the business processes of your organization. You can find a detailed description of Self-Service Portal configuration in [HelpRoot_SS_Portal_Admin\SP__SP_Portal_Overview|Overview of Acumatica Self-Service                         Portal].
==Customizing the User Interface==
In Acumatica ERP, you can flexibly customize the user interface (in particular, main menu items and workspace links) that all users will see so that it fits the business processes of your organization. Your customization of the user interface will make it easier for users to find and begin working with required forms and reports, speeding document processing in the system. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\AS__mng_User_Interface_Configuration|Customizing the User Interface].{br}

Also, you can define attributes for flexible, meaningful classification of multiple entities. An attribute is a property (such as age or industry) that enables you to specify additional information for objects in the system. For some entities, attributes are defined in the context of a class; for other entities, attributes can be added directly to the data entry form that corresponds to the entity. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Attributes_and_User_Defined_Fields|Managing Attributes and User-Defined Fields].
==Managing Wikis==
 Acumatica ERP provides wiki repository for working materials or a knowledge base where you can store such information as Help articles, internal manuals, instructions, marketing materials, and plans. Wikis can be created for number of different purposes. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__mng_Wikis|Managing Wikis].]]></column>

For details, see  Automation Maintenance. Event Monitoring In  Acumatica ERP, some executed business processes require the monitoring of particular activities and         conditions in the system. You can configure the system to monitor the company data and to         perform an action (such as sending a push notification or an email notification or         performing the instructions defined by an import scenario) or multiple actions in the system         based on various occurrences. For more information, see  Using Business Events and  Managing Events. Configuring and Managing Dashboards Dashboards are an important and convenient tool for monitoring and analyzing critical         business information. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM208600|SM208600]) Dashboards (SM208600) form, you can add         dashboard pages, locate them in the site map, and set up the access rights to dashboard         pages. For more information, see  Managing Dashboards. Configuring and Managing Pivot Tables In  Acumatica ERP, you can build pivot tables based on the data from generic inquiries. A pivot table is a         program tool that you can use to reorganize and summarize data in a generic inquiry, to view         it from different perspectives. Among other functions, a pivot table can automatically sort,         count, total, or give the average of the data stored in a generic inquiry, displaying the         results in a separate table showing the summarized data. You can configure and change the         structure of pivot tables simply by dragging and dropping fields. For details, see  Managing Pivot Tables. Integrating  Acumatica ERP     with External Applications  Acumatica ERP is a web-based application; therefore, you can integrate it with various external web         applications as follows: Building external web applications in  Acumatica ERP: You can build external web applications in  Acumatica ERP if the employees of your organization use these applications along with  Acumatica ERP in their work. For example, you can build a Microsoft Power BI report into  Acumatica ERP if employees analyze the reports based on data sets that are loaded from  Acumatica ERP. For details, see  Managing Integration with External Applications. Embedding  Acumatica ERP forms in external web applications: You can embed  Acumatica ERP forms in another web application that your employees use to solve their work tasks. For           example, you can embed the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP404000|EP404000]) Tasks (EP404000) form within your           Office 365 page to view and access your  Acumatica ERP task list directly in Office 365. For more information, see  Integrating Acumatica ERP Forms on Your Website. Administering  Acumatica Self-Service                         PortalThe  Acumatica Self-Service                         Portal provides a solution for you to more efficiently work and communicate with your customers.            Self-Service Portal         is specifically designed to be the site where your customers can view all the relevant         information about their interactions with you as a vendor and perform needed activities         online. If your organization wants to provide its customers with the functionality of  Self-Service Portal, you         need to install an instance of the portal, as described in  Setting Up Acumatica Self-Service                         Portal. After you have installed  Self-Service Portal, you         need to configure various settings so that the portal corresponds to the business processes         of your organization. You can find a detailed description of  Self-Service Portal         configuration in  Overview of Acumatica Self-Service                         Portal. Customizing the User Interface In  Acumatica ERP, you can flexibly customize the user interface (in particular, main menu items and         workspace links) that all users will see so that it fits the business processes of your         organization. Your customization of the user interface will make it easier for users to find         and begin working with required forms and reports, speeding document processing in the         system. For details, see  Customizing the User Interface. Also, you can define attributes for flexible, meaningful classification of multiple         entities. An attribute is a property (such as age or industry) that enables you to specify         additional information for objects in the system. For some entities, attributes are defined         in the context of a class; for other entities, attributes can be added directly to the data         entry form that corresponds to the entity. For more information, see  Managing Attributes and User-Defined Fields. Managing Wikis  Acumatica ERP provides wiki repository for working materials or a knowledge base where you can store         such information as Help articles, internal manuals, instructions, marketing materials, and         plans. Wikis can be created for number of different purposes. For details, see  Managing Wikis. ]]></column>

In Acumatica ERP, the data for all tenants and snapshots is stored in the database and may take a lot of space. To prevent uncontrolled growth of the database (for example, if you create many snapshots), the database size available for your Acumatica ERP instance is limited in your license. As such, you need to monitor and manage the usage of the database space by tenants and snapshots on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_25|Space Usage] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203525|SM203525]) form, as described in this topic.((({S:Warn}The statistics of using database space, which are displayed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_25|Space Usage] form, do not include data related to the System tenant.
)))
==Monitoring the Database Size==
When you take, import, or restore a snapshot, or when you copy a tenant, the system checks whether the database contains enough space to perform these operations. If the database has enough space available, the system continues the needed operation after the check. If the database does not have enough space, the system returns an error message and interrupts the operation. We recommend that before you perform one of these operations (copying a tenant, or taking, importing, or restoring a snapshot), you make sure that you have enough database space available for your instance.{br}

Before you take a snapshot, you do the following:[anchor|#_ff72342e-a8f1-4270-91eb-bd3f7cce3407]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_25|Space Usage] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203525|SM203525]) form, and click '''Calculate Used Space''' on the form toolbar. (The form initially shows the previously calculated statistics, so you must invoke this action to see the current statistics.)
#On the '''Tenants''' tab, in the '''Size in DB (MB)''' column, find the size of the tenant for which you want to take a snapshot.
#In the '''Free Space''' box of the Summary area, find the free space available for your instance and compare with the tenant size you found in Step 2.

Before you import a tenant, you do the following:[anchor|#_9119f876-20ff-40bb-a5bb-db8baec1cf13]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_25|Space Usage] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203525|SM203525]) form, and click '''Calculate Used Space''' on the form toolbar. (The form initially shows the previously calculated statistics, so you must invoke this action to see the current statistics.)
#In the snapshot folder on you hard drive, find the size of the <tt>manifest.xml</tt> file.
#In the '''Free Space''' box of the Summary area, find the free space available for your instance and compare with the size of the <tt>manifest.xml</tt> file you found in Step 2.

Before you restore a snapshot, you do the following:[anchor|#_8003a043-f3f7-46cf-9208-f95688b6e410]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_25|Space Usage] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203525|SM203525]) form, and click '''Calculate Used Space''' on the form toolbar. (The form initially shows the previously calculated statistics, so you must invoke this action to see the current statistics.)
#On the '''Snapshots''' tab, in the '''Size in DB (MB)''' column, find the size of the snapshot that you want to restore.
#On the '''Tenants''' tab, in the '''Size in DB (MB)''' column, find the size of the destination tenant.
#Subtract the size of the snapshot to restore from the size of the destination tenant.
#In the '''Free Space''' box of the Summary area, find the free space available for your instance and compare with the size difference you have calculated in Step 4.

Before you copy a tenant, you do the following:[anchor|#_f1de7657-a609-4f2a-b3f8-8ca162ebd222]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_25|Space Usage] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203525|SM203525]) form, and click '''Calculate Used Space''' on the form toolbar. (When you first open the form, it shows the previously calculated statistics, so you must invoke this action to see the current statistics.)
#On the '''Tenants''' tab, in the '''Size in DB (MB)''' column, find the size of the tenant that you want to copy, and the size of the destination tenant.
#Subtract the size of the tenant to copy from the size of the destination tenant.
#In the '''Free Space''' box of the Summary area, find the free space available for your instance and compare it with the size difference you have calculated in Step 3.
[anchor|#_b777b43d-c86a-4da6-894e-b815e68066fc]
==Cleaning Up the Database==
To clean up the database so that it has sufficient space for users to perform needed operations, you can open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_25|Space Usage] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203525|SM203525]) form, view the system calculations of the used space, find the tenants and snapshots that can be removed, and view the tables that are consuming a lot of database space. You can then remove the unnecessary tenants, snapshots, attachments, and schedule histories by using the forms on which they were created or initiated.{br}

After you have viewed the system calculations of the current space usage, to delete unused tenants from the database, you do the following:[anchor|#_6b357e36-7a23-41fe-bdec-02a28db44654]
#On the '''Tenants''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_25|Space Usage] form, you find the tenants with the ''Unlicensed''or ''Test Tenant'' status, neither of which reflects a tenant in use.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_20|Tenants] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203520|SM203520]) form, you delete these unused tenants. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Multitenancy_Delete_Tenant|To Delete a Tenant by Using the Web Interface].

After you have viewed the system calculations of the current space usage, to delete unused snapshots from the database, you do the following:[anchor|#_b8c2ece5-54a4-413a-9460-609e8b162cc3]
#On the '''Snapshots''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_25|Space Usage] form, you find the snapshots that have already been exported, that are unused, or that can be stored on disk rather than in the database.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_20|Tenants] form, you export to a file all snapshots that you may need in the future. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Snapshots_Export|To Export a Snapshot].
#:((({S:Warn}Exported snapshots are not updated when you update your instance. Thus, if you export these snapshots, they will become unusable after you update the instance, so you should import them again before any updates are performed.
)))
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_20|Tenants] form, you delete from the database unused snapshots and snapshots that have been exported. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Snapshots_Delete|To Delete a Snapshot].

On the '''Tables''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_25|Space Usage] form, you can view the list of tables with data related to all tenants and snapshots in your instance, including the size of each table in the Acumatica ERP database. This can help you to identify the actions you should take to reduce the size of these tables. The following tables generally use most of the database space of the Acumatica ERP instance:[anchor|#_23935b8c-46fb-42c8-b31e-aa0b9cd532f7]
*''UploadFileRevision'': Contains information about the database size used for attachments. To find the unused attachments (so that you can delete them), you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_20|Search in Files] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202520|SM202520]) form. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Delete_Attachment|To Delete an Attachment File].
*''AUScheduleHistory'': Contains information about the database size used for saving the history of the schedules. To review the forms where the automatic processes are scheduled, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_30|Automation Schedule Statuses] ([~/?ScreenId=SM205030|SM205030]) form. For information on how to delete the history of schedules, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Delete_Schedule_History|To Delete Histories of Scheduled Processes].
*''AuditHistory'': Contains information about the database size used for saving the audit history. To review the audit history, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_55_30|Audit History] ([~/?ScreenId=SM205530|SM205530]) form. You cannot delete the audit history, so we recommend that you turn on the field-level audit for no more than few forms.

*''Green check mark'': Indicates that the instance and the associated database are up to date (the versions of the application instance, the database, and the Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard are the same).
*''Yellow triangle with exclamation point'': Indicates that the instance and the instance database are outdated (the version of the application instance is same as the version of the database and is older than that of the installed Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard). You may need to update the application instance and the database. 
*:((({S:Warn}After you update the Acumatica ERP Tools, all your instances installed before the update are marked in this way.

*''Red circle with a white X'': Indicates that the instance or the database (depending on which has an older version) requires update; that is, the versions of the instance and the instance&rsquo;s database are different. You must update the one whose version is older.
*:Also, this marking may indicate that the instance and the database versions are newer than the version of the installed Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard. You won&rsquo;t be able to downgrade the instance or the database.

For example, the following screenshot displays several instances.

If you have installed a new version of Acumatica ERP or updated your Acumatica ERP instance by using the Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard, the push notifications are enabled in Acumatica ERP automatically. You can configure the notifications on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_00|Push Notifications] ([~/?ScreenId=SM302000|SM302000]) form, as described in [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__how_Configure_Push_Notifications|To Configure Push Notifications] in the Integration Development Guide. {br}

If you have updated your Acumatica ERP instance through the web interface, before configuring push notifications, you need to manually enable push notifications in Acumatica ERP, as described in [[#_e0ed4a7a-e197-45ed-8c14-c1eab4e5ca1d|To Enable Push Notifications Manually] in this topic. {br}

If you need to enable push notifications on the Acumatica ERP instances in a cluster, you should follow the instructions in [[#_99af8931-2fdf-4cd8-ad09-def60f811197|To Enable Push Notifications in a Cluster] in this topic.[anchor|#_e0ed4a7a-e197-45ed-8c14-c1eab4e5ca1d]

 Acumatica ERP is an application with multitenant architecture, in which any instance includes at least one tenant that is a separate tenant. If you need to create multiple similar tenants, you do not have to configure each tenant from scratch, you can use snapshots instead. {br}

Snapshots provide a way to save full or partial data of your Acumatica ERP tenant, and later restore the tenant to the state it had when the snapshot was taken. Snapshots can be exported from the source tenant and then restored to another tenant, thus speeding up the configuration of a new tenant. Snapshots are stored in the Acumatica ERP database, and you may face with a situation when the database is out of space. As such, it is important to monitor database size and delete unneeded snapshots.{br}

The topics of this chapter explain how to use snapshots, including taking a snapshot, storing it locally or in external storage, importing it to your instance, restoring the data from the snapshot.
==In This Chapter==
*[HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Using_Snapshots_GeneralInfo|Using Snapshots: General Information]
*:A snapshot is full or partial data of an Acumatica ERP tenant saved locally in the database of an instance to which the tenant belongs, or at specified location. Snapshots can also be used as tenant templates when you need to add new tenants that are similar in configuration to an Acumatica ERP instance. Also, you can use snapshots to set up a test environment for your company where you test the configuration changes required for your company before you apply them to your production tenant.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Using_Snapshots_Export_and_Import_Concept|Using Snapshots: Export and Import]
*:Snapshots are stored in database, to free disk space, you can export snapshots to store them in an external storage, and then delete obsolete snapshots. Exported snapshots can later be imported back into the instance.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Using_Snapshots_Modification_of_Content_Options_Concept|Using Snapshots: Custom Snapshot Configurations]
*:The contents of the snapshot is the data from SQL database tables that are included in the snapshot. The list of tables to be included to a snapshot is defined by a content option (or export mode) that you select when you take a snapshot. There is a predefined set of options that you can select in the '''Export Mode''' box of the '''Create Snapshot''' dialog box. If the predefined options do not suite your need, for example, for data security reasons, you can configure and add custom options.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Snapshot_Sensitive_Data|Examples of Sensitive Data Preservation in Snapshots]
*:Protection of sensitive data is critical to organizations and to users. Which data must be protected depends on many factors, including regulation (which is often mandatory), organization policy, contractual obligations, and user expectations. Because the snapshots may copy data you identify as sensitive, Acumatica ERP provides a way to exclude such data from the snapshots. You can preserve the data from particular SQL tables down to particular table fields by configuring snapshot configuration files. Use the following examples to better understand and configure snapshot configuration files.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Snapshots_Add|To Take a Snapshot]
*:To take a snapshot of the tenant configuration and data, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_20|Tenants] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203520|SM203520]) form. Published customization are also included in the snapshot.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Snapshots_Visibility|To Toggle the Visibility of a Snapshot]
*:In a multitenant configuration, you can toggle the visibility of snapshots on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_20|Tenants] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203520|SM203520]) form to group them by tenant, as described below. You can distinguish snapshots with different visibility by checking the state of the '''Tenant ID''' column on the '''Snapshots''' tab:
*[HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Snapshots_Export|To Export a Snapshot]
*:You can export a snapshot  by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_20|Tenants] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203520|SM203520]) form.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Snapshots_Import|To Import a Snapshot]
*:To import a snapshot, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_20|Tenants] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203520|SM203520]) form. A snapshot can be restored in a new database only if the version of the application match the version of the snapshot (that is, the version of the application used to take the snapshot). You can view the version of the snapshot in the ''manifest.xml'' file in the snapshot.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Snapshots_Restore|To Restore a Snapshot]
*:You can restore data to a tenant from any snapshot that is visible in the tenant by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_20|Tenants] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203520|SM203520]) form.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Snapshots_Delete|To Delete a Snapshot]
*:All the snapshots you take are stored in the database of your Acumatica ERP instance. To reduce the size of the database, you can delete obsolete snapshots by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_20|Tenants] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203520|SM203520]) form.

A snapshot is full or partial data of an Acumatica ERP tenant saved locally in the database of an instance to which the tenant belongs, or at specified location. Snapshots can also be used as tenant templates when you need to add new tenants that are similar in configuration to an Acumatica ERP instance. Also, you can use snapshots to set up a test environment for your company where you test the configuration changes required for your company before you apply them to your production tenant. {br}

A tenant used to take a snapshot is called source tenant and tenant where you plan to restore a snapshot is called destination tenant. Source and destination tenants may belong to the same instance or to different instances.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Take a snapshot of tenant specific content
*Export a snapshot to an external storage
*Review the ''manifest.xml'' file of snapshot to find out snapshot details 
*Import a snapshot
*Restore a snapshot for a destination tenant

==Applicable Scenarios==
You use snapshots in the following cases:[anchor|#_7165d0ed-fbf9-4bca-b563-a0155c7a9310]
*Before starting a user acceptance testing (UAT) phase of an implementation, you, as an implementation consultant, need to prepare a test instance to perform UAT. The test instance should be identical to the one you have configured for production. You take a snapshot of the production tenant and restore it on a test instance dedicated for UAT.
*Your company decided to try a new Acumatica ERP feature on the copy of your production tenant and you, as a system administrator, was requested to create a test tenant and port production data to it. You take a snapshot of the production tenant and restore it on a test instance dedicated for testing.
*You, as a system administrator, was requested to create a tenant with a training dataset for a new employee of your company. You download a snapshot with training dataset and restore it on the test tenant dedicated to the employee training.

==Snapshot Contents==
The contents of the snapshot is the data from SQL database tables that are included in the snapshot. The list of tables to be included to a snapshot is defined by a content option that you select when you take a snapshot in the '''Export Mode''' box of the '''Create Snapshot''' dialog box. The following content options are available by default: [anchor|#ul_nhd_hzs_tr]
*''Full'': All data related to the tenant
*''Full except Attachments and Wiki'': The full data related to the tenant, excluding attachments and wiki articles
*''Full except Attachments'': The full data related to the tenant, excluding attachments
*''Settings and Business Accounts'': The tenant&rsquo;s complete set of configuration settings and business accounts, including attachments
*''Settings and Business Accounts except Attachments'': The tenant&rsquo;s complete set of configuration settings and business accounts, excluding attachments
*''Settings except Attachments'': The tenant&rsquo;s configuration settings, excluding attachments
*''Settings only'': The tenant&rsquo;s configuration settings, including attachments

You select a content option depending on the intended use of the snapshot. If you need a snapshot for testing purposes or for making a tenant template, then configuration settings may be enough for you. If you need a complete copy of a tenant, then you should select one of the options that include all tenant data. {br}

You can add a custom content option, if the predefined set does not suite your needs, for example, for data security reasons. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Using_Snapshots_Modification_of_Content_Options_Concept|Using Snapshots: Custom Snapshot Configurations].
==Snapshot Creation==
You take a snapshot of the tenant configuration and data by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_20|Tenants] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203520|SM203520]) form. For a snapshot, you specify which data you want to include by selecting one of the available content options. Data from published customizations is a part of the database and is always included in snapshots. When you take a snapshot, any previously taken snapshots are not included in the new snapshot.[anchor|#_236b4a5b-3a04-44a4-b8ab-c7c694d3be9a]((({S:Hint}You can have a virtually unlimited number of snapshots. The only limitation is disk space: Snapshots are stored in the database, thus occupying disk space. We recommend that before you take or import a snapshot, you open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_25|Space Usage] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203525|SM203525]) form and make sure that you have enough free space in the Acumatica ERP database. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Database_Size_Monitoring|Database Size Monitoring and Management].
)))
The process of creating a snapshot may take a significant amount of time because the database tables are copied one by one for a snapshot, and this process sometimes results in errors. For example, a user may introduce changes to documents that have been partially copied; consequently, the data in the snapshot would be corrupted. Therefore, if you intend to restore the snapshot in a production system, we strongly recommend that you create snapshots in maintenance mode (that is, when the system is locked out for maintenance, as described in [HelpRoot_Install\Updating__how_Enable_Lockout|To Schedule the System Lockout]).{br}

For testing purposes, you can create snapshots without first locking out the system. In this case, a warning message will appear, and the system will mark this snapshot as unsafe. (The '''Is Safe''' column on the '''Snapshots''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_20|Tenants] form reflects whether the snapshot is safe or not.)((({S:Warn}Because the process of taking a snapshot could result in errors, we do not recommend that you use snapshots to back up data. We recommend that you instead use database management applications to back up the database of your Acumatica ERP instance.
)))
==Snapshot Storage and Update==
Once a snapshot is created, it appears on the '''Snapshots''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_20|Tenants] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203520|SM203520]) form. Tenant snapshots are stored in the database as tenants with special tenant IDs (negative integers). When you update the application and the database, the stored snapshots are updated as well.{br}

To free disk space, you can export snapshots to store them in an external storage, and then delete obsolete snapshots. Exported snapshots can later be imported back into the application. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Using_Snapshots_Export_and_Import_Concept|Using Snapshots: Export and Import].((({S:Warn}Snapshots stored in an external storage are not updated when you update your application instance.
)))
Deleting a snapshot is a permanent operation—you won&rsquo;t be able to recover a deleted snapshot. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Snapshots_Delete|To Delete a Snapshot].
==Snapshot Visibility Across Tenants==
In a multitenant configuration, you can sign in to one tenant, and then take a snapshot of any tenant available to you, be it the tenant you signed in to or another tenant that you can access. The snapshots you take are stored within the tenant you are signed in to (the ''base'' tenant); you won&rsquo;t be able to access them if you sign in to another tenant.{br}

Within the base tenant, when a snapshot is taken, it is associated with its source tenant. That is, to see the snapshot in the list on the '''Snapshots''' tab you should select its source tenant in the '''Tenant ID''' box of the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_20|Tenants] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203520|SM203520]) form. While a snapshot is associated with a tenant (the associated tenant is displayed for the snapshot in the '''Tenant ID''' column on the '''Snapshots''' tab) you can export or restore its snapshot only for the associated tenant. {br}

To make the snapshot available for export or restoration regardless of the selected tenant, you can change the visibility of the snapshot, by clicking '''Change Visibility''' on the table toolbar of the '''Snapshots''' tab for a selected snapshot. The system removes the association and clears the '''Tenant ID''' column for the snapshot. Then, the snapshot is available on the '''Snapshots''' tab regardless of the tenant you select in the '''Tenant ID''' box of the Summary area. You can export or restore the snapshot for any tenant selected in the '''Tenant ID''' box of the Summary area.{br}

Also, you can move a snapshot between tenants, for example for security reasons. You take a snapshot of a source tenant, remove the association, select a destination tenant in the '''Tenant ID''' box of the Summary area and click '''Change Visibility''' on the table toolbar of the '''Snapshots''' tab for the selected snapshot. The system associates the snapshot with the destination tenant and the snapshot is not available for other tenants of the system, even its source tenant. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Snapshots_Visibility|To Toggle the Visibility of a Snapshot].
==Snapshot Restoration==
When you take a snapshot, it is saved to the tenant you are currently signed in to. In a multitenant configuration, you can sign in to one tenant and move or share snapshots between other tenants that you can access by changing snapshot visibility. Alternatively, you can export a snapshot and store it in an external location and import it to the needed tenant. For details, on exporting and importing snapshots, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Using_Snapshots_Export_and_Import_Concept|Using Snapshots: Export and Import].{br}

You select a tenant for which you want to restore a snapshot in the '''Tenant ID''' box of the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_20|Tenants] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203520|SM203520]) form. The system displays snapshots available for the selected tenant in the list on the '''Snapshots''' tab. These snapshots can be imported, moved from another tenant or shared between all tenants of the instance. By restoring a snapshot, you set the tenant data (selected in the '''Tenant ID''' box of the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_20|Tenants] form) to the state of a source tenant when the snapshot was taken. {br}

If you restore an unsafe snapshot (one that was not taken in maintenance mode), the system displays a warning message, and adds a warning to the '''Tools''' > '''About...''' box. We do not recommend that you restore unsafe snapshots in production system because these snapshots can create corrupted data.[anchor|#_93d01f56-d253-4a91-94d2-c578f951e53b]((({S:Hint}You can have a virtually unlimited number of snapshots. The only limitation is disk space: Snapshots are stored in the database, thus occupying disk space. We recommend that before you take or import a snapshot, you open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_25|Space Usage] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203525|SM203525]) form and make sure that you have enough free space in the Acumatica ERP database.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Using Snapshots: General Information A snapshot is full or partial data of an  Acumatica ERP     tenant saved locally in the database of an instance to which the tenant belongs, or at specified     location. Snapshots can also be used as tenant templates when you need to add new tenants that     are similar in configuration to an  Acumatica ERP     instance. Also, you can use snapshots to set up a test environment for your company where you     test the configuration changes required for your company before you apply them to your     production tenant.  A tenant used to take a snapshot is called source tenant and tenant where you plan to restore     a snapshot is called destination tenant. Source and destination tenants may belong to the same     instance or to different instances. Learning Objectives In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following: Take a snapshot of tenant specific content Export a snapshot to an external storage Review the  manifest.xml  file of snapshot to find out snapshot details  Import a snapshot Restore a snapshot for a destination tenant Applicable Scenarios You use snapshots in the following cases: Before starting a user acceptance testing (UAT) phase of an implementation, you, as an      implementation consultant, need to prepare a test instance to perform UAT. The test instance      should be identical to the one you have configured for production. You take a snapshot of the      production tenant and restore it on a test instance dedicated for UAT. Your company decided to try a new  Acumatica ERP      feature on the copy of your production tenant and you, as a system administrator, was requested      to create a test tenant and port production data to it. You take a snapshot of the production      tenant and restore it on a test instance dedicated for testing. You, as a system administrator, was requested to create a tenant with a training dataset for      a new employee of your company. You download a snapshot with training dataset and restore it on      the test tenant dedicated to the employee training. Snapshot Contents The contents of the snapshot is the data from SQL database tables that are included in the     snapshot. The list of tables to be included to a snapshot is defined by a content option that     you select when you take a snapshot in the  Export Mode  box of the       Create Snapshot  dialog box. The following content options are available     by default:  Full : All data related to the tenant Full except Attachments and Wiki : The full data related to the tenant, excluding      attachments and wiki articles Full except Attachments : The full data related to the tenant, excluding      attachments Settings and Business Accounts : The tenant's complete set of configuration settings      and business accounts, including attachments Settings and Business Accounts except Attachments : The tenant's complete set of      configuration settings and business accounts, excluding attachments Settings except Attachments : The tenant's configuration settings, excluding      attachments Settings only : The tenant's configuration settings, including attachments You select a content option depending on the intended use of the snapshot. If you need a     snapshot for testing purposes or for making a tenant template, then configuration settings may     be enough for you. If  you need a complete copy of a tenant, then you should select one of the     options that include all tenant data.  You can add a custom content option, if the predefined set does not suite your needs, for     example, for data security reasons. For details, see  Using Snapshots: Custom Snapshot Configurations. Snapshot Creation You take a snapshot of the tenant configuration and data by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM203520|SM203520]) Tenants (SM203520) form. For a snapshot, you specify which data     you want to include by selecting one of the available content options. Data from published     customizations is a part of the database and is always included in snapshots. When you take a     snapshot, any previously taken snapshots are not included in the new snapshot. You can have a virtually unlimited number of snapshots. The only limitation is disk space: Snapshots are stored in the database, thus occupying disk space. We recommend that before you take or import a snapshot, you open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM203525|SM203525]) Space Usage (SM203525) form and make sure that you have enough free space in the  Acumatica ERP database. For details, see  Database Size Monitoring and Management. The process of creating a snapshot may take a significant amount of time because the database     tables are copied one by one for a snapshot, and this process sometimes results in errors. For     example, a user may introduce changes to documents that have been partially copied;     consequently, the data in the snapshot would be corrupted. Therefore, if you intend to restore     the snapshot in a production system, we strongly recommend that you create snapshots in     maintenance mode (that is, when the system is locked out for maintenance, as described in  To Schedule the System Lockout). For testing purposes, you can create snapshots without first locking out the system. In this     case, a warning message will appear, and the system will mark this snapshot as unsafe. (The       Is Safe  column on the  Snapshots  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM203520|SM203520]) Tenants form reflects whether the snapshot is safe or not.) Because the process of taking a snapshot could result in errors, we do not     recommend that you use snapshots to back up data. We recommend that you instead use database     management applications to back up the database of your  Acumatica ERP     instance. Snapshot Storage and Update Once a snapshot is created, it appears on the  Snapshots  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM203520|SM203520]) Tenants (SM203520) form. Tenant snapshots are stored in the database as     tenants with special tenant IDs (negative integers). When you update the application and the     database, the stored snapshots are updated as well. To free disk space, you can export snapshots to store them in an external storage, and then     delete obsolete snapshots. Exported snapshots can later be imported back into the application.     For details, see  Using Snapshots: Export and Import. Snapshots stored in an external storage are not updated when you update     your application instance. Deleting a snapshot is a permanent operation—you won't be able to recover a deleted snapshot.     For details, see  To Delete a Snapshot. Snapshot Visibility Across Tenants In a multitenant configuration, you can sign in to one tenant, and then take a snapshot of any     tenant available to you, be it the tenant you signed in to or another tenant that you can     access. The snapshots you take are stored within the tenant you are signed in to (the       base  tenant); you won't be able to access them if you sign in to another tenant. Within the base tenant, when a snapshot is taken, it is associated with its source tenant.     That is, to see the snapshot in the list on the  Snapshots  tab you should     select its source tenant in the  Tenant ID  box of the Summary area of the        ([~/?ScreenId=SM203520|SM203520]) Tenants (SM203520) form. While a snapshot is associated with a tenant     (the associated tenant is displayed for the snapshot in the  Tenant ID      column on the  Snapshots  tab) you can export or restore its snapshot only     for the associated tenant.  To make the snapshot available for export or restoration regardless of the selected tenant,     you can change the visibility of the snapshot, by clicking  Change      Visibility  on the table toolbar of the  Snapshots  tab for a     selected snapshot. The system removes the association and clears the  Tenant      ID  column for the snapshot. Then, the snapshot is available on the       Snapshots  tab regardless of the tenant you select in the       Tenant ID  box of the Summary area. You can export or restore the     snapshot for any tenant selected in the  Tenant ID  box of the Summary     area. Also, you can move a snapshot between tenants, for example for security reasons. You take a     snapshot of a source tenant, remove the association, select a destination tenant in the       Tenant ID  box of the Summary area and click  Change      Visibility  on the table toolbar of the  Snapshots  tab for the     selected snapshot. The system associates the snapshot with the destination tenant and the     snapshot is not available for other tenants of the system, even its source tenant. For details,     see  To Toggle the Visibility of a Snapshot. Snapshot Restoration When you take a snapshot, it is saved to the tenant you are currently signed in to. In a     multitenant configuration, you can sign in to one tenant and move or share snapshots between     other tenants that you can access by changing snapshot visibility. Alternatively, you can export     a snapshot and store it in an external location and import it to the needed tenant. For details,     on exporting and importing snapshots, see  Using Snapshots: Export and Import. You select a tenant for which you want to restore a snapshot in the  Tenant      ID  box of the Summary area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM203520|SM203520]) Tenants (SM203520) form.     The system displays snapshots available for the selected tenant in the list on the       Snapshots  tab. These snapshots can be imported, moved from another     tenant or shared between all tenants of the instance. By restoring a snapshot, you set the     tenant data (selected in the  Tenant ID  box of the Summary area of the        ([~/?ScreenId=SM203520|SM203520]) Tenants form) to the state of a source tenant when the snapshot was     taken.  If you restore an unsafe snapshot (one that was not taken in maintenance mode), the system     displays a warning message, and adds a warning to the  Tools About...  box. We do not recommend that you restore unsafe snapshots in production system     because these snapshots can create corrupted data. You can have a virtually unlimited number of snapshots.

Snapshots are stored in database, to free disk space, you can export snapshots to store them in an external storage, and then delete obsolete snapshots. Exported snapshots can later be imported back into the instance. {br}

Also, to move a snapshot to another instance, you export the snapshot from the source instance and import it to the destination instance.{br}

In this topic you will read about details of snapshot export and import.[anchor|#export_snapshot]
==Snapshot Export==
To be exported to external storage, a snapshot should be ''prepared''—that is, the snapshot&rsquo;s data should be saved to a file. When a snapshot is exported, the system copies the prepared file to an external storage; the snapshot itself remains in the database. For the detailed procedure, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Snapshots_Export|To Export a Snapshot].{br}

An exported snapshot is saved as an archive in ''.zip'' format. It contains the exported data in a collection of either ''.adb'' or ''.xml'' files and the description of the snapshot in ''manifest.xml''. 
==Validation of Snapshot Before Import==
''Manifest.xml'' carries the snapshot details generated when the snapshot was created. If you need to import a snapshot data to a tenant from an instance that is different from the instance of a source tenant, you need to define whether the destination instance is compatible with the snapshot. In the ''manifest.xml'' file you can find the following information that helps you understand whether your instance is compatible with a snapshot:[anchor|#_c1761032-c1d2-4a74-b7e4-fe978992535e]
*The Acumatica ERP version of the instance that has been used to prepare the snapshot (instance of the source tenant). The version of an instance of the tenant where you plan to restore the snapshot (destination tenant) must be the same.
*The snapshot contents, that is, export mode selected during the snapshot creation.
*Whether a snapshot was created in system maintenance mode. Such snapshots are marked as safe.
*List of customization packages that were applied to the instance of the sources tenant and whose custom data was included to the snapshot. These packages will be added to the destination tenant. You will specify whether to include custom data during snapshot import.
[anchor|#import_snapshot]
==Snapshot Import==
You can restore snapshots that are saved in database of the instance of a destination tenant. {br}

For this, you import a snapshot to a selected tenant on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_20|Tenants] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203520|SM203520]) form. The version of the snapshot (that is, the version of the instance used to take the snapshot) must match the version of the destination application instance.[anchor|#_6836a3b9-29f8-4486-a057-8056fef1c6e1]((({S:Hint}You can have a virtually unlimited number of snapshots. The only limitation is disk space: Snapshots are stored in the database, thus occupying disk space.

For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Database_Size_Monitoring|Database Size Monitoring and Management].
)))
When you import a snapshot, you need to specify whether a system should import custom data from the snapshot or not. Custom data is data entered to the fields that were added by customization packages applied to the instance where the snapshot was taken. This operation is controlled with the '''Include Data From Custom Columns''' check box in the import dialog box. {br}

Also, you need to specify whether the system should preliminarily match the data from the snapshot with the database structure in your current Acumatica ERP instance, to reveal any conflicts before the system imports the snapshot. This operation is controlled with the '''Check Database Structure Before Import''' check box in the import dialog box {br}

Customizations may include changes in the database structure (such as changing a field length). These changes may cause conflicts during the insertion of data from the snapshot to your current Acumatica ERP instance (for example, if the length of the inserted field exceeds the maximum length in the database of your current Acumatica ERP instance). When this check is performed and there are conflicts, the system returns an error message that lists all fields from the snapshot that have caused the conflicts. You can resolve these conflicts by changing the database structure in your current Acumatica ERP instance.((({S:Hint}If you have access to the destination instance database, you can resolve conflicts directly in database management studio, otherwise you can develop a customization package with a script that resolves the conflicts.

The following table summarizes our recommendations regarding selection of operations during importing a snapshot in dependance on set of customization packages applied to a source instance when a snapshot was taken and the one applied to destination instance when a snapshot is to be imported.[anchor|#_72bf167b-ce02-4baf-bc2e-6a86cc7cbd4f]

The contents of the snapshot is the data from SQL database tables that are included in the snapshot. The list of tables to be included to a snapshot is defined by a content option (or export mode) that you select when you take a snapshot. There is a predefined set of options that you can select in the '''Export Mode''' box of the '''Create Snapshot''' dialog box. If the predefined options do not suite your need, for example, for data security reasons, you can configure and add custom options.{br}

In this topic you will read about how snapshot configuration is stored and can be modified.[anchor|#section_Snapshot_Contents]
==Snapshot Configuration Storage==
The contents of a snapshot for each of content options (except the ''Full'' option) is defined by a corresponding snapshot configuration file with the ''.esc'' extension. Usually these files can be located in '''%Program Files%\Acumatica ERP\&lt;instance name&gt;\App&#95;Data\SnapshotConfigs''', where ''&lt;instance name&gt;'' is the name of the application instance website. 
==Creation of Custom Configurations==
When the system is creating a snapshot it goes through all tables specified in a configuration file and copies all data with no restrictions or validation. If you want to preserve some data that you consider sensitive—for example, user passwords and settings for connecting with third-party applications—we recommend you to create your own snapshot configuration files to preserve such data, down to SQL table fields. You can either exclude tables and table fields from snapshots or replace data in table fields with predefined values. For examples of configuration settings, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Snapshot_Sensitive_Data|Examples of Sensitive Data Preservation in Snapshots].((({S:Warn}We do not recommend modifying predefined snapshot configuration files, during upgrade these files will be replaced with the next predefined version.
)))
You can save a copy of predefined configuration file with a custom name to the same location where the other configuration files are stored and modify it contents to suite your needs. When you are ready with the modifications, you click '''Restart Application''' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_10|Apply Updates] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203510|SM203510]) form and your custom content option becomes available for a snapshot creation.((({S:Warn}Make sure that all users of your website are warned about the site restart so that they can save all documents.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Using Snapshots: Custom Snapshot Configurations The contents of the snapshot is the data from SQL database tables that are included in the         snapshot. The list of tables to be included to a snapshot is defined by a content option (or         export mode) that you select when you take a snapshot. There is a predefined set of options         that you can select in the  Export Mode  box of the  Create           Snapshot  dialog box. If the predefined options do not suite your need, for         example, for data security reasons, you can configure and add custom options. In this topic you will read about how snapshot configuration is stored and can be         modified. Snapshot Configuration Storage The contents of a snapshot for each of content options (except the  Full  option) is         defined by a corresponding snapshot configuration file with the  .esc  extension.         Usually these files can be located in  %Program Files%\ Acumatica ERP\<instance name>\App_Data\SnapshotConfigs , where  <instance name>  is the         name of the application instance website.

In Acumatica ERP, you never assign access rights to individual users, instead it uses roles to restrict access to the system. You assign users one role or multiple roles, and based on these assignments, the users are then granted the appropriate access rights to system objects. {br}

The topics of this chapter explain details about configuring user access in Acumatica ERP.
==In This Chapter==
*[HelpRoot_Administration\User_Roles_GeneralInfo|User Roles: General Information]
*:User roles in Acumatica ERP are sets of access rights to system objects designed for convenient management of access for users with similar responsibilities in the system. In Acumatica ERP, a system object to which access rights can be set up can be a particular form, container of form elements, form element, or wiki.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\User_Roles_Planning_Concept|User Roles: Planning Access Configuration]
*:Designing a system security requires a thorough planning and preparation. User access configuration should support business processes without exposing the company to undue risks. That is, a user should have only the access rights necessary to perform typical tasks, that are clearly stated in the job description of the user.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\User_Roles_Access_Levels|User Roles: Restriction Level Options]
*:Users are assigned to roles, and you give these roles the appropriate access rights to system objects— forms, containers of form elements, form elements, and wikis. By defining access rights for a system object you set restriction level a user will have for this object. With Acumatica ERP, you can control access down to the control of form elements, such as buttons, text boxes, and check boxes.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\User_Roles_User_Access_Level_Calculation|User Roles: Calculation of Restriction Level for a User]
*:In this topic you will learn how the system calculates a restriction level to a system object for a user with multiple roles assigned.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\User_Roles_Built_In_Roles|User Roles: Predefined Roles]
*:For ease of defining and administering roles, Acumatica ERP provides a set of predefined roles that are stored in the System tenant (for details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Support_of_Multiple_Companies|Support of Multiple Tenants]). Predefined roles are always supplied with the system and cannot be deleted.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\User_Roles_User_Access_Business_Date_Change|User Roles: Restrictions on Changing the Business Date]
*:In Acumatica ERP, the business date is displayed in the info area. The business date is the date that the system will insert by default into the records that you add to the system. By default, the current date is set as the business date.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\User_Roles_Config_Prereq|User Roles: Configuration Prerequisites]
*:Before starting to create user roles, you must be sure that the system has been configured properly and that all required entities have been created, as described in the following sections.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\User_Roles_Implem_Activity|User Roles: To Configure Roles for Four Access Tiers]
*:In the following activity, you will learn how to create a user role and specify access rights to system objects for the role.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\User_Roles_To_Configure_Granular_Role|User Roles: To Configure Role with Granular Access]
*:In the following activity, you will learn how to create a role with granular access to a system object.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\User_Roles_To_Modify_Role_Copy|User Roles: To Modify Access Rights for a Copied Role]
*:In the following activity, you will learn how to copy an existing role and modify copied role access to system objects.

In Acumatica ERP, a system object to which access rights can be set up can be a particular form, container of form elements, form element, or wiki. ((({S:Hint}For details about managing access to wikis, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Wiki_Access_Setup|Wiki Access Management].
))){br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Create a user role and specify access rights to system objects for this role
*Modify access rights to system objects for a copy of an existing role
*Give access to only several forms in the system and revoke access to all other system objects.
*Review access rights a role has to system objects

==Applicable Scenarios==
You create or modify user roles in the following cases:[anchor|#_7165d0ed-fbf9-4bca-b563-a0155c7a9310]
*When you, as a implementation consultant, initially implement Acumatica ERP for your client and the predefined set of roles does not suite your client needs.
*When you, as a system administrator, was notified that a security policy of your company has changed and after revision of the current set of roles, you need to modify access rights to Acumatica ERP elements.
*When you, as a system administrator, was notified about opening a new position in your company, for which the current set of roles does not cover the job description.

==Restriction Levels==
A user role in Acumatica ERP is a set of access rights to system objects. By defining access rights for a system object you set a restriction level a user with the role will have for this object. The restriction level defines set of operations a user may perform with the object. The highest restriction level allows a user to perform any operation with an object up to its deletion and the lowest denies access to an object.{br}

The system objects are a particular form, container of form elements, form element. In Acumatica ERP, the system objects are grouped in a tree with nodes, where a tenant is the first-level node with the workspaces nested under it. Each workspace, in it is turn, can nest multiple forms, that nest containers of form elements, that nest form elements. {br}

 Acumatica ERP has the ''Not Set'' restriction level that is specific for the system. The ''Not Set'' restriction level indicates that all roles have access to a form including its nested objects until at least one role is assigned any other restriction level to this form. All roles with the ''Not Set'' level are then denied access to the form. For example, you created a new generic inquiry and added it to a workspace. By default, all roles in the system will get the ''Not Set'' restriction level to the inquiry. If you change the level to any other for at least on role, users that are not assigned with this role will not have access to the inquiry. [anchor|#_7303dc59-8564-4f86-8ef9-73242753aa0a]{br}

The set of restriction levels available for the system objects depends on the object type. For some objects, you can specify more granular level, for others either allow or deny the access. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\User_Roles_Access_Levels|User Roles: Restriction Level Options].
==Access Propagation and Inheritance==
In Acumatica ERP, the system objects are grouped in a tree with nodes. Each node is a system object that can nest other objects. Access rights either propagated to the nested objects or nested objects inherit access rights from their parents. The hierarchy of nesting is the following: [anchor|#_218c8917-51c2-49ca-b7e4-091f725a00ce]
#''Tenant'': A tenant node nests all workspaces configured in the system. The system propagates access rights set to a role for this node to all workspaces in the tenant.
#''Workspace'': A workspace node nests all forms added to the workspace. The system propagates access rights set to a role for this node to all forms within the workspace.
#''Form'': A form node may or may not nest several containers with the form elements. Nested containers inherit access rights set to a role for a form.
#''Form container'': A container node nests form elements, such as boxes and actions. Nested elements inherit access rights set to a role for a container. 
#''Form element'': An element node is on the lowest level of objects hierarchy and inherits access rights from its parent container. 

The propagation and inheritance mechanism allows saving time and simplifies setting of access rights to system objects. You can change propagated or inherited rights for any object anytime, that is, change a restriction level received from a parent object. For specifics about restriction levels of a particular system object, see [HelpRoot_Administration\User_Roles_Access_Levels|User Roles: Restriction Level Options].
==Predefined Roles==
For ease of defining and administering roles, Acumatica ERP provides a set of predefined roles, which is expanded with every major release of Acumatica ERP. Predefined roles are always supplied with the system and cannot be deleted. We recommend using the predefined roles, while setting user access to the system during implementation. Create a new role, only if there is no a predefined role that suites your needs. For details on available predefined roles, see [HelpRoot_Administration\User_Roles_Built_In_Roles|User Roles: Predefined Roles].((({S:Warn}If a predefined role mostly works for you, but needs a bit of tweaking, we recommend copying the role and do needed changes. Otherwise, all your changes will be deleted during an upgrade.
)))
==Role Planning==
Organizations have different kinds of valuable information that needs protecting, like financial documents, customer and vendor information. Different employees need access to different subsets of this information to perform their duties. Before you start planning the set of user roles, we recommend to make sure that job roles and responsibilities in your company are clearly defined. The job responsibilities of a user define access to forms, records, and operations on the records. {br}

While planning the set of roles, take into account objectives of internal control procedures implemented in your company, like preventing and detecting fraud, completeness and accuracy of financial records, safeguarding assets, timely preparation of financial statements. For example, to minimize the risk of errors and fraud, duties associated with cash handling are often segregated. Also, segregation is recommended for duties related to documents recording and further processing, as well as conducting reconciliations and preparing financial statements.{br}

We highly recommend performing planning of access configuration when the system is initially implemented and in case of changing a security policy of an organization. For detailed recommendations, see [HelpRoot_Administration\User_Roles_Planning_Concept|User Roles: Planning Access Configuration].
==Role Creation==
You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_05|User Roles] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201005|SM201005]) form to create a role. By default, a newly created role has the ''Not Set'' restriction level for all system objects. The nested objects (containers and elements) have the ''Inherited'' access level. ((({S:Hint}We recommend using some naming conventions for the user roles that you create or copy from predefined roles. 
)))
As Acumatica ERP is supplied with the set of predefined roles, for which access rights were set up (that is, restriction levels to different objects were changed from ''Not Set'' to restriction level appropriate for a role), a newly created role will be denied access to most system objects.[anchor|#_ecfe6b9f-8b94-4d86-b911-ca09009f8ad2]((({S:Danger}The ''Not Set'' restriction level indicates that all roles have access to a form including its nested objects until at least one role is assigned any other restriction level to this form. This role can be any role in the system. All roles with the ''Not Set'' level are then denied access to the form.
)))
To set up access rights to multiple system objects for multiple roles, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_20|Access Rights by Screen] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201020|SM201020]) form. The form allows you to see restriction level that other roles have to a system object. This information can be useful when you set up access to this object to a particular role as it may affect access of other roles, if the ''Not Set'' restriction level is specified for them.{br}

To set up access rights to multiple system objects for an individual role, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_25|Access Rights by Role] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201025|SM201025]) form.((({S:Hint}The process of defining task-based roles requires in-depth knowledge of both the organization&rsquo;s business processes and the Acumatica ERP approach to security. 
)))[anchor|#section_wgv_hbd_yl]
==Role Access Modification==
During ongoing maintenance of Acumatica ERP, you may have tasks to change users&rsquo; access rights to some system objects. To modify a role access you use either the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_20|Access Rights by Screen] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_25|Access Rights by Role] form.{br}

You may take different approaches in configuring user access: assigning a user with a single role or with a combination of roles. This may affect how a role modification will affect an individual user access.{br}

If you do not use role combination the modification of a role will affect access for all users with the role assigned. If you use role combination the modification of a role may differently affect users with the role assigned. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\User_Roles_User_Access_Level_Calculation|User Roles: Calculation of Restriction Level for a User].{br}

Before proceeding to role modification, we recommend collecting detailed information about the role configuration and users assigned with the role. For details on access management reports, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Managing_User_Access_Reports_Inquiries|User Access: Related Report and Inquiry Forms].]]></column>

By defining access rights for a system         object you set a restriction level a user with the role will have for this object. The         restriction level defines set of operations a user may perform with the object.

The  Not Set  restriction             level indicates that all roles have access to a form including its nested objects until             at least one role is assigned any other restriction level to this form. This role can be any role in the             system. All roles with             the  Not Set  level are then denied access to the form. To set up access rights to multiple system objects for multiple roles, you use the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201020|SM201020]) Access Rights by Screen (SM201020) form. The form allows you to see restriction level         that other roles have to a system object. This information can be useful when you set up         access to this object to a particular role as it may affect access of other roles, if the            Not Set  restriction level is specified for them. To set up access rights to multiple system objects for an individual role, you use the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201025|SM201025]) Access Rights by Role (SM201025) form. The process of defining task-based roles requires in-depth knowledge of both the     organization's business processes and the  Acumatica ERP     approach to security.  Role Access Modification During ongoing maintenance of  Acumatica ERP, you may have tasks to change users' access rights to some system objects. To modify a         role access you use either the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201020|SM201020]) Access Rights by Screen or   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201025|SM201025]) Access Rights by Role form. You may take different approaches in configuring user access: assigning a user with a         single role or with a combination of roles. This may affect how a role modification will         affect an individual user access. If you do not use role combination the modification of a role will affect access for all         users with the role assigned. If you use role combination the modification of a role may         differently affect users with the role assigned. For details, see  User Roles: Calculation of Restriction Level for a User. Before proceeding to role modification, we recommend collecting detailed information about         the role configuration and users assigned with the role. For details on access management         reports, see  User Access: Related Report and Inquiry Forms. ]]></column>

Designing a system security requires a thorough planning and preparation. User access configuration should support business processes without exposing the company to undue risks. That is, a user should have only the access rights necessary to perform typical tasks, that are clearly stated in the job description of the user.{br}

In this topic you will read about approaches we recommend you to consider while planning user access to the system.
==Full Access Role Approach==
Small companies usually do not require a complex user access configuration that includes multiple roles and strict segregation by job responsibilities. Employees are usually multitasking and restricting access to the system configuration is usually enough. In this case, you can design roles individually for a person or for a group of people. For example, for a company with 5 to 10 employees, you can configure two roles as follows:[anchor|#_00043e42-b601-4551-b693-a878ba7d262a]
*''Administrator'': Users with this role have complete access to all system objects in the system regardless functional area.
*''Regular User'': Users with this role have complete access to system objects of multiple functional areas, except for areas related to the system security and user management.

==Access Tier Approach==
Midsized companies need more complex user access configuration as more people need to access company&rsquo;s data, but job responsibilities usually are defined and segregated more clearly.{br}

Let&rsquo;s consider the predefined set of roles that regulates access to finance-related functionality. Roles are grouped by functional areas, such as general ledger, accounts payables, accounts receivables and others. Across these areas, we can say that in this set there are three tiers of access for each functional area: Admin, Clerk, and Viewer. The following table summarizes the access difference for these tiers.[anchor|#_f2610da1-412f-453d-a7a0-1388c96a3b7c]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="20%" ! Access Tier

| Full access
|- 
| Clerk
| Full access
| Full access
| View only
| View only
|- 
| Viewer

|}
With such configuration you might consider giving to a user a set of roles either from the Clerk or Admin tiers and use roles from the Viewer tier for employees who perform internal or external audit. For example, you assign to a senior accountant all roles from the Admin tier, thus giving complete access to the whole finance-related functionality. For the accountant assistants you assign roles from the Clerk tier according to their responsibilities.{br}

Also, you might consider combination of roles from different tiers. For example, a user who is doing reconciliation will need to view reports and inquiries from general ledger and accounts payable functional areas. So, in addition to CA Admin role that allows doing reconciliation, you assign to the user the AP Viewer and GL Viewer roles.
==Granular Role Approach==
Aside having three tiers of access (Admin, Clerk, and Viewer), we recommend creating roles that allows performing granular, but sensitive tasks. For example, suppose that a senior accountant with a role from the Admin tier usually reprints checks. During their vacation the senior accountant passed this responsibility to their deputy who has a role from the Clerk tier. If you have a role that allows performing only reprinting checks, you can temporary assign this role to the deputy user, instead of giving a role from the Admin tier. {br}

The other solution for securing access to reprinting checks is to create a role specifically for reprinting checks and restrict access to reprinting for all other roles. In this case, you can assign this role to only approved users regardless their tier of access.]]></column>

Users are assigned to roles, and you give these roles the appropriate access rights to system objects— forms, containers of form elements, form elements, and wikis. By defining access rights for a system object you set restriction level a user will have for this object. With Acumatica ERP, you can control access down to the control of form elements, such as buttons, text boxes, and check boxes. {br}

This topic describes the restriction levels available to different system objects.{br}{TOC}
==Access to a Workspace==
In Acumatica ERP, you do not set up access to a particular workspace itself. Instead, by setting access rights (that is restriction level) for a workspace, you set up access for all the nested objects. If you change the access rights to any nested object of a workspace, the system will change the access rights to ''Multiple Rights'' at the workspace level. {br}

The system displays a workspace with ''Multiple Rights'' in the main menu. On the workspace dashboard, the system displays only forms for which access is not restricted for a particular user.{br}

 Keep in mind that a form may belong to multiple workspaces. If you set access to one of these workspaces (that is, to all forms in the workspace), the system will assign to a form that belongs to multiple workspaces the restriction level set most recently for one of these workspaces. The system will then change the access for other workspaces to which the form belongs to the ''Multiple Rights'' option, if these workspaces had a different access rights. For example, the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_40_20_00|Vendor Details] form can be accessed from the '''Payables''' and '''Purchases''' workspaces. Both workspaces have the ''Granted'' restriction level for the ''Purchasing'' role. You change the level for the form under the '''Payables''' workspace to ''Revoked''. The system displays the new level for the form under the '''Purchases''' workspace and changes access to ''Multiple Rights'' for both workspaces.{br}

The following table summarizes the restriction levels that roles can have to all forms that belong to a particular workspace of Acumatica ERP.[anchor|#table_fzs_pqd_wj]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="20%" ! Restriction Level
!width="80%" ! Description
|- 
| ''Multiple Rights''
| Means that a role has different restriction levels to the nested objects of a workspace. If you change the level for the workspace, the system will automatically apply the new level to all nested objects.
|- 
| ''Not Set''
| Allows all roles to have access to all forms in a workspace until ''Revoked'' or ''Granted'' level is set to the workspace for at least one role. After that, a role with the ''Not Set'' level is denied access to the forms in the workspace.
|- 
| ''Revoked''
| 
Denies the role access to all the forms in a workspace. That is, all forms will get the ''Revoked'' restriction level. For users with the role, the workspace and its forms do not appear in the main menu. 
|- 
| ''Granted''
| Allows the role complete access to all the forms in a workspace. That is, all forms will get the ''Delete'' restriction level. You can, however, limit or revoke access to particular forms within the workspace for the role. In this case, the system will change the access rights for the workspace to ''Multiple Rights''. 
|}((({S:Warn}You can set up access rights to individual forms in the '''Hidden''' node (which cannot be accessed from the main menu), but not to the node itself.
)))
==Access to Reports and Generic Inquiries==
A workspace may include multiple reports and inquiries along with the Acumatica ERP forms. Available restriction levels depend on tools used to develop a report or an inquiry.[anchor|#_f1709db3-76c7-4646-be4b-3829ef59be4b]
*Reports built with the Report Designer application and inquiries created using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_80_00|Generic Inquiry] form have the same list of available restriction levels that roles can have to workspaces.
*Reports built with the Analytical Report Manager toolkit and inquires developed using C# have the same list of available restriction levels that roles can have to forms.
[anchor|#section_whj_vn2_wj]
==Access to a Form==
Within each workspace, you can set the access rights that roles have to Acumatica ERP forms, which affects what users with those roles can access. The restriction level to the form is inherited by the entities and records that can be created by using the form. [anchor|#table_y1t_pqd_wj]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="20%" ! Restriction Level
!width="80%" ! Description
|- 
| ''Not Set''
| When assigned to all roles, allows all roles to have access to the form until the restriction level is changed to any other level for at least one role. After at least one role has been assigned another level, access to the form is denied for a role with the ''Not Set'' level.
|- 
| ''Revoked''
| Denies the role access to the form and its functionality.
|- 
| ''View Only''
| Gives the role restricted access to the form and its functionality. This level allows users with the role to view the form and any records associated with the form (in drop-down lists on other forms).
This level forbids users with the role to edit details about any record, create new records or entities of the type, and delete records.
|- 
| ''Edit''
| Gives the role restricted access to the form and its functionality. This level allows users with the role to view the form, select records, and edit details about any record.
This level forbids users with the role to create new records or entities of the type, and to delete records.{br}

The '''Clipboard''' button is available on the form toolbar for users with the role.
|- 
| ''Insert''
| Gives the role restricted access to the form and its functionality. This level allows users with the role to view the form, select records, edit details about any record, and create new records or entities of the type.
This level forbids users with the role to delete records.{br}

The '''Clipboard''' and '''Insert''' buttons are available on the form toolbar for users with the role.
|- 
| ''Delete''
| Gives the role complete access to the form and its functionality. This level encompasses the capabilities of the ''View Only'', ''Edit'', and ''Insert'' levels, while also giving users with the role the ability to delete records. 
For users with the role, the '''Clipboard''', '''Insert''', and '''Delete''' buttons are available on the form toolbar.
|}
==Access to Containers of Form Elements==
Each form includes containers of elements, such as nested forms, tabs, and grids. Each container includes multiple elements and actions. You can restrict access to any of these containers on the form. The restriction level a role has to the container is inherited by the entities and records created by using the container, if applicable. For example, if you permit access for a user role to a grid, a user with this role can access all records in this grid. By default, containers inherit restriction level from the form to which they belong.{br}

{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="20%" ! Restriction Level
!width="80%" ! Description
|- 
| ''Inherited''
| Indicates that the role&rsquo;s access to the container was not explicitly specified and is inherited from its form.
|- 
| ''Revoked''
| Denies the role access to the container and hides it from the form for users with the role. These users will not see the container on the form.
|- 
| ''View Only''
| Gives the role restricted access to the container and its functionality. This level allows users with the role to view the container and any records associated with the container (in drop-down lists on other forms), if applicable.
The level forbids users with the role to edit details about any record, create new records or entities of the type, and delete records, if applicable.
|- 
| ''Edit''
| Gives users with the role restricted access to the container and its functionality. This level allows users with the role to view the container, select records, and edit details about any record, if applicable.
The level forbids users with the role to create new records or entities of the type, and delete records, if applicable.
|- 
| ''Insert''
| Gives the role restricted access to the container and its functionality. This level allows users with the role to view the container, select records, edit details about any record, and create new records or entities of the type, if applicable.
This level forbids users with the role to delete records, if applicable.
|- 
| ''Delete''
| Gives the role complete access to the container and its functionality. This level encompasses the capabilities of the ''View Only'', ''Edit'', and ''Insert'' levels, while also giving users with the role the ability to delete records, if applicable. 
|}
==Access to Form Elements==
By default, the restriction level a role has to the form elements and actions is inherited from the container of form elements to which elements and actions belong. In most cases, a restriction level for a container is not explicitly specified and is set to ''Inherited''. Thus, before changing a restriction level to an element or an action you should explicitly specify a restriction level for the parent container. Then you can set access to the form elements and actions.[anchor|#table_kgx_3h2_wj]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%"

!width="80%" ! Description
|- 
| ''Inherited''
| Indicates that the role&rsquo;s access to the element was not explicitly specified and is inherited from its container of form elements.
|- 
| ''Revoked''
| Denies the role access to the element and hides the element. A user with the role will not see the element on the form.
|- 
| ''View Only''
| Makes the element read-only for users with the role. A user with the role will see the element on the form but will not be able to use it.
|- 
| ''Edit''
| Allows the use of the element for users with the role.

The system will then change the access for                 other workspaces to which the form belongs to the  Multiple Rights  option, if                 these workspaces had a different access rights. For example, the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP402000|AP402000]) Vendor Details form can be accessed from the                      Payables  and  Purchases  workspaces.                 Both workspaces have the  Granted  restriction level for the  Purchasing                  role. You change the level for the form under the  Payables                  workspace to  Revoked . The system displays the new level for the form under                 the  Purchases  workspace and changes access  to  Multiple                     Rights  for both workspaces. The following table summarizes the restriction levels that roles can have to all                 forms that belong to a particular workspace of  Acumatica ERP. Restriction Level Description Multiple Rights Means that a role has different restriction levels to the nested                                 objects of a workspace. If you change the  level for the workspace,                                 the system will automatically apply the new level to all nested                                 objects. Not Set Allows all roles to have access to all forms in a workspace until                                      Revoked  or  Granted  level is set to the workspace                                 for at least one role. After that, a role with the  Not Set                                  level is denied access to the forms in the workspace. Revoked Denies the role access to all the forms in a workspace. That is,                                     all forms will get the  Revoked  restriction level. For                                     users with the role, the workspace and its forms do not appear                                     in the main menu.  Granted Allows the role complete access to all the forms in a workspace.                                 That is, all forms will get the  Delete  restriction level. You                                 can, however, limit or revoke access to particular forms within the                                 workspace for the role. In this case, the system will change the                                 access rights for the workspace to  Multiple Rights .  You can set up access rights to individual forms in the                      Hidden  node (which cannot be accessed from the main                 menu), but not to the node itself. Access to Reports and Generic Inquiries A workspace may include multiple reports and inquiries along with the  Acumatica ERP forms. Available restriction levels depend on tools used to develop a report or                 an inquiry. Reports built with the  Report Designer application and inquiries created using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM208000|SM208000]) Generic Inquiry                     form have the same list of available restriction levels that roles can have to                     workspaces. Reports built with the Analytical Report Manager toolkit and inquires developed                     using C# have the same list of available restriction levels that roles can have                     to forms. Access to a Form Within each workspace, you can set the access rights that roles have to  Acumatica ERP forms, which affects what users with those roles can access. The restriction                 level to the form is inherited by the entities and records that can be created by                 using the form.  Restriction Level Description Not Set When assigned to all roles, allows all roles to have access to                                 the form until the restriction level is changed to any other level                                 for at least one role. After at least one role has been assigned                                 another level, access to the form is denied for a role with the                                      Not Set  level. Revoked Denies the role access to the form and its functionality. View Only Gives the role restricted access to the form and its                                 functionality. This level allows users with the role to view the                                 form and any records associated with the form (in drop-down lists on                                 other forms). This level forbids users with the role to edit                                     details about any record, create new records or entities of the                                     type, and delete records. Edit Gives the role restricted access to the form and its                                 functionality. This level allows users with the role to view the                                 form, select records, and edit details about any record. This                                     level forbids users with the role to create new records or                                     entities of the type, and to delete records. The                                          Clipboard  button is available on the form toolbar for                                     users with the role. Insert Gives the role restricted access to the form and its                                 functionality. This level allows users with the role to view the                                 form, select records, edit details about any record, and create new                                 records or entities of the type. This level forbids users with the                                     role to delete records. The  Clipboard  and                                          Insert  buttons are available on the form toolbar for                                     users with the role. Delete Gives the role complete access to the form and its functionality.                                 This level encompasses the capabilities of the  View Only ,                                      Edit , and  Insert  levels, while also giving users                                 with the role the ability to delete records.  For users with the                                     role, the  Clipboard ,  Insert , and  Delete                                      buttons are available on the form toolbar. Access to Containers of Form Elements Each form includes containers of elements, such as nested forms, tabs, and grids.                 Each container includes multiple elements and actions. You can restrict access to                 any of these containers on the form. The restriction level a role has to the                 container is inherited by the entities and records created by using the container,                 if applicable. For example, if you permit access for a user role to a grid, a user                 with this role can access all records in this grid. By default, containers inherit                 restriction level from the form to which they belong. Restriction Level Description Inherited Indicates that the role's access to the container was not                                     explicitly specified and is inherited from its form. Revoked Denies the role access to the container and hides it from the                                     form for users with the role. These users will not see the                                     container on the form. View Only Gives the role restricted access to the container and its                                     functionality. This level allows users with the role to view the                                     container and any records associated with the container (in                                     drop-down lists on other forms), if applicable. The level                                         forbids users with the role to edit details about any                                         record, create new records or entities of the type, and                                         delete records, if applicable. Edit Gives users with the role restricted access to the container                                     and its functionality. This level allows users with the role to                                     view the container, select records, and edit details about any                                     record, if applicable. The level forbids users with the role                                         to create new records or entities of the type, and delete                                         records, if applicable. Insert Gives the role restricted access to the container and its                                     functionality. This level allows users with the role to view the                                     container, select records, edit details about any record, and                                     create new records or entities of the type, if                                         applicable. This level forbids users with the role to                                         delete records, if applicable. Delete Gives the role complete access to the container and its                                     functionality. This level encompasses the capabilities of the                                          View Only ,  Edit , and  Insert  levels,                                     while also giving users with the role the ability to delete                                     records, if applicable.  Access to Form Elements By default, the restriction level a role has to the form elements and actions is                 inherited from the container of form elements to which elements and actions belong.                 In most cases, a restriction level for a container is not explicitly specified and                 is set to  Inherited . Thus, before changing a restriction level to an element                 or an action you should explicitly specify a restriction level for the parent                 container. Then you can set access to the form elements and actions. Restriction Level Description Inherited Indicates that the role's access to the element was not                                 explicitly specified and is inherited from its container of form                                 elements. Revoked Denies the role access to the element and hides the element. A                                 user with the role will not see the element on the form. View Only Makes the element read-only for users with the role. A user with                                 the role will see the element on the form but will not be able to                                 use it. Edit Allows the use of the element for users with the role. ]]></column>

In this topic you will learn how the system calculates a restriction level to a system object for a user with multiple roles assigned.[anchor|#_2708bbea-95b1-4a47-8cc5-3bbcb3dc961f]
==Calculation of Restriction Level to Forms==
 If a user has multiple roles assigned and the roles have different restriction levels to the system object, the following general rule is used: Acumatica ERP applies the most permissive level among the roles. For example, suppose that a user is assigned the Employee and Sales Manager roles. The Employee role has the ''Revoked'' restriction level for the '''Inventory''' workspace node, and the Sales Manager role has the ''Granted'' level for the same node. With these settings, the user has the ''Granted'' level to the forms in the '''Inventory''' workspace. See, the table below for illustration of the example.[anchor|#_37bce6d3-a52c-4394-af9b-06c7af96dbab]

This role can be any role in the system. All roles with the ''Not Set'' level are then denied access to the form.
)))
==Calculation of Restriction Level to Form Nested Objects with Inherited Level==
If all roles have the ''Inherited'' restriction level to the particular form element container or form element, the resulting level is the most permissive level of the system object at the next highest level—the form (for a form element container) or the form element container (for a form element). Suppose that a user is assigned the Employee and the Accountant user roles. The Employee role has the ''Revoked'' restriction level to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form, and the Accountant role has the ''Edit'' level to this form. The default restriction level both roles have to the form elements is ''Inherited''. The user with these roles, then, has the ''Edit'' access level to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form and its elements.

==Calculation of Restriction Level to Form Nested Objects with Specified Level==
If you have explicitly specified a restriction level to the particular form element container or form element for at least one role, while the other roles have the ''Inherited'' level to this system object, then the resulting level of access rights is the most permissive among only the roles with explicitly defined restriction levels. The system ignores the roles with the ''Inherited'' level of access rights. This algorithm is used to optimize the speed of loading the form. {br}

Suppose that a user is assigned the Employee, Warehouse Worker, and Sales Assistant user roles. All these roles have the ''Insert'' restriction level to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) form. The ''Employee'' role has the ''Inherited'' restriction level to the '''Release''' button on this form, the ''Warehouse Worker'' role has the ''Revoked'' level to this button, and the ''Sales Assistant'' role has the ''View Only'' level to this button. As a result, the user has the ''View Only'' restriction level (the most permissive level of the two explicitly defined levels) to this button.

For ease of defining and administering roles, Acumatica ERP provides a set of predefined roles that are stored in the System tenant (for details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Support_of_Multiple_Companies|Support of Multiple Tenants]). Predefined roles are always supplied with the system and cannot be deleted. {br}

Some of these roles grant the users access to a specific functionality, and some of the roles are used by the system and should not be assigned to users manually.
==Service Roles==
The following service roles are available in the system:[anchor|#_adf47f0a-e38d-4561-afc0-637f451bd353]
*''AcumaticaSupport'': The role is reserved for the predefined ''AcumaticaSupport'' user, that is used to provide access for support engineers to a tenant.
*''Anonymous'': This role is reserved for system use. 
*''DashboardDesigner'': The system automatically designates this role as a dashboard owner role for dashboards that were created in previous versions of Acumatica ERP. We recommend that you create specific roles for users who should own particular dashboards. For details, see [HelpRoot_ReportingTools\Administering_Dashboards_Mapref|Managing Dashboards].
*''Guest'': This role is used for backward compatibility. 

==Administrative Roles==
The following administrative roles are available in the system:[anchor|#_b42ea6d8-0b98-4d60-8486-7799bcc5af79]
*''Administrator'': A user with this role has full access to all system objects, and any access restrictions to system objects are not applied to this role. Therefore we recommend that you assign users to this role only during initial system setup so they can define roles and enter users. Then assign the role only in extraordinary cases. We recommend that you create a user role for system administrators with access only to Acumatica ERP forms that are used for configuration and management of the system.
*:((({S:Hint}When you add a new form to the site map, for example a generic inquiry, we strongly recommend to set the ''Granted'' level to this form for this role.
)))
*:((({S:Warn}A user with this role cannot publish reports and modify original dashboards (which have an owner role other than ''Administrator'').
)))
*''BI'': A user with this role can access the ''BI Views''—that is, the generic inquiries that are exposed through the OData protocol (the '''Expose via OData''' check box is selected for the inquiry on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_80_00|Generic Inquiry] ([~/?ScreenId=SM208000|SM208000]) form). For more information, see [HelpRoot_ReportingTools\GI_Exposing_Inquiry_by_Using_OData_Mapref|Exposing an Inquiry by Using OData].
*''BusinessDateOverride'': A user with this role can change the business date in the info area of Acumatica ERP. This role appears only if the ''Secure Business Date'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\User_Roles_User_Access_Business_Date_Change|User Roles: Restrictions on Changing the Business Date].
*''Customizer'': A user with this role can customize Acumatica ERP applications. For details, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Customization\CG_GL_Stages_Role|To Assign the Customizer Role to a User Account].
*''CS Admin'': Users with this role can access system functions and configuration entities that might be needed by users in financial positions. More specifically, they have administrative permissions to configure most of the common settings, including segmented keys, numbering sequences, tasks, and business process scenarios, as well as to manage business events, notification templates, and document templates. Users with the ''CS Admin'' role also have full access to row-level security settings and most of the integration functions.
*''Data Privacy Controller'': A user with this role has access to the compliance tools for General Data Protection Regulation. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\GD__MNG_Handling_Personal_Data|Handling Personal Data].
*''Field-Level Audit'': A user with this role can view the audit trail directly from an audited form. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__mng_FieldLevel_audit|Managing Field-Level Auditing].
*''OData4 User'': A user with this role can access data exposed through the OData protocol version 4.
*''ReportDesigner'': A user with this role can publish reports in Acumatica ERP. Any user can create reports in Report Designer, but for publishing reports in Acumatica ERP, the user needs to be granted this role.
*''Wiki Admin'': A user with this role can set other users&rsquo; access rights to wikis. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Wiki_Access_Setup|Wiki Access Management].
*''Wiki Author'': A user with this role can create wiki articles. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Wiki_Access_Setup|Wiki Access Management].

==User Profile-Related Roles==
The following roles that manage access to a user personal settings are available in the system:[anchor|#_aa1370f7-80de-4ab6-8898-20ef2b099568]
*''Internal Employee'': Users with this role have full access to personal settings, tasks, events, email, and time cards, as well as expense receipts and claims. Additionally, these users can view Help.
*''Internal User'': A user with this role can change personal settings, and view Help. It is automatically assigned to all user accounts linked with the ''Employee'' user type.

==CRM-Related Roles==
The following roles that manage access to CRM functionality are available in the system:[anchor|#_404caa74-9be7-434c-919c-f072977adc51]

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[User Roles: Predefined Roles For ease of defining and administering roles,  Acumatica ERP provides a set of predefined roles that are stored in the System tenant (for                 details, see  Support of Multiple Tenants). Predefined                 roles are always supplied with the system and cannot be deleted.  Some of these roles grant the users access to a specific functionality, and some of                 the roles are used by the system and should not be assigned to users manually. Service Roles The following service roles are available in the system: AcumaticaSupport : The role is reserved for the predefined                          AcumaticaSupport  user, that is used to provide access for support                     engineers to a tenant. Anonymous : This role is reserved for system use.                      DashboardDesigner : The system automatically designates this role as a                     dashboard owner role for dashboards that were created in previous versions of                          Acumatica ERP. We recommend that you create specific roles for users who should own                     particular dashboards. For details, see  Managing Dashboards. Guest : This role is used for backward compatibility.                      Administrative Roles The following administrative roles are available in the system: Administrator : A user with this role has full access to all system                     objects, and any access restrictions to system objects are not applied to this                     role. Therefore we recommend that you assign users to this role only during                     initial system setup so they can define roles and enter users. Then assign the                     role only in extraordinary cases. We recommend that you create a user role for                     system administrators with access only to  Acumatica ERP forms that are used for configuration and management of the system. When you add a new form to the site map, for example a generic                         inquiry, we strongly recommend to set the  Granted  level to this  form                         for this role. A user with this role cannot                         publish reports and modify original dashboards (which have an owner role                         other than  Administrator ). BI : A user with this role can access the  BI Views —that is, the                     generic inquiries that are exposed through the OData protocol (the                          Expose via OData  check box is selected for the                     inquiry on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM208000|SM208000]) Generic Inquiry (SM208000) form).                     For more information, see  Exposing an Inquiry by Using OData. BusinessDateOverride : A user with this role can change the business date                     in the info area of  Acumatica ERP. This role appears only if the  Secure Business Date  feature is enabled                     on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. For                     details, see  User Roles: Restrictions on Changing the Business Date. Customizer : A user with this role can customize  Acumatica ERP applications. For details, see  To Assign the Customizer Role to a User Account. CS Admin : Users with this role can access system functions and                     configuration entities that might be needed by users in financial positions.                     More specifically, they have administrative permissions to configure most of the                     common settings, including segmented keys, numbering sequences, tasks, and                     business process scenarios, as well as to manage business events, notification                     templates, and document templates.

==Story==
Suppose that the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company has purchased Acumatica ERP subscription in . The instance has been installed by SaaS engineers, and a basic company configuration has been performed. It was decided to have four access tiers:[anchor|#_5952fff8-d698-4f09-a7e3-6443603044dc]
*''Configurator'': Roles from this tier give access only to configuration settings of a functional area.
*''Manager'': Roles from this tier allows working with entities, inquiries, and reports of a functional area without any restrictions and view configuration settings.
*''Clerk'': Roles from this tier allows only adding new records and edit record details within a functional area.
*''Auditor'': Roles from this tier allows only viewing records, inquiries, and reports associated with a functional area.

You, as a system administrator, decided to start implementation of the tiers with the general ledger functional area. By default, forms related to this area are grouped under the '''Finance''' workspace.
==Process Overview==
To configure roles for four access tiers within the general ledger functional area, you first prepare a spreadsheet with the list of forms of the functional area, and mark a category of each form to understand what this form for—configuration, data entry, processing, or reporting. Then you add roles to the list and set restriction level for each role against the form. For this activity we will use the [{up}UserGuide/Files/User_Roles_GL_4Tier_Access.xlsx|GL&#95;4Tier&#95;Access] spreadsheet that was prepared for training purposes.((({S:Warn}The [{up}UserGuide/Files/User_Roles_GL_4Tier_Access.xlsx|GL&#95;4Tier&#95;Access] spreadsheet contains limited set of the forms related to the general ledger functional area and can be used for training purposes only.
)))
With the spreadsheet prepared, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_05|User Roles] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201005|SM201005]) form to create four roles. You will use the <tt>AA</tt> prefix for the roles to have them on top of the list, combined with <tt>&#95;GL</tt> to indicate the functional area.{br}

With the roles created, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_20|Access Rights by Screen] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201020|SM201020]) form to set up access rights to multiple system objects for multiple roles. 
==System Preparation==
Before you start configuring roles, sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded as a system administrator with the following credentials:[anchor|#_d2dffc6e-985c-4fe7-97aa-7a4b3562c712]
*Username: ''gibbs''
*Password: ''123''

==Step 1: Creating Roles==
To create a role, do the following:[anchor|#_fa742785-635f-4638-890f-918dff014a89]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_05|User Roles] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201005|SM201005]) form.[anchor|#_ece34ef3-94bb-4a1d-8727-7ff7a9b04a67]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record'''.
#In the '''Role Name''' box, type <tt>AA&#95;GL&#95;Configurator</tt>.
#In the '''Role Description''' box, type <tt>Role to access GL configuration settings</tt>.[anchor|#_559b9a22-d1e6-4532-b8f9-6d38a1f4e5e3]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.
#Add three more roles with the following settings:
#*'''Name''': <tt>AA&#95;GL&#95;Manager</tt>; '''Description''': <tt>Role for working with GL entities and viewing settings</tt>
#*'''Name''': <tt>AA&#95;GL&#95;Clerk</tt>; '''Description''': <tt>Role for entering and editing records</tt>
#*'''Name''': <tt>AA&#95;GL&#95;Auditor</tt>; '''Description''': <tt>Role for viewing records and reports</tt>

==Step 2: Granting Access to All Forms of a Workspace==
To set access rights to multiple roles, do the following:[anchor|#_157bbfb8-a804-4c3c-b8df-06b8f140a5bc]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_20|Access Rights by Screen] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201020|SM201020]) form.
#In the left pane of the form, select the '''Finance''' node.
#In the right pane, locate the four roles you have created. Notice, that the roles have the ''Not Set'' access rights for all forms within the workspace, as all newly created roles. 
#In the right pane, for the ''AA&#95;GL&#95;Manager'' role, in the '''Access Rights''' column, select the ''Granted'' option. This role is planned to have the highest access level to the most forms. To save time, you grant access to all the forms of the workspace at once.[anchor|#_de090008-aa96-468c-9d30-c425bb94f967]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

==Step 3: Modifying Access to a Form==
To modify restriction level for a form, do the following:[anchor|#_9f1c4112-4096-4dc5-a3ef-87486ef4fc3d]
#While remaining on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_20|Access Rights by Screen] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201020|SM201020]) form, in the left pane expand the '''Finance''' node, to access the list of the forms.
#In the left pane, select the first form from the list, which is [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_40_20_00|Account by Period].
#In the right pane, for the ''AA&#95;GL&#95;Auditor'' role, in the '''Access Rights''' column, select the ''View Only'' option. According to the [{up}UserGuide/Files/User_Roles_GL_4Tier_Access.xlsx|GL&#95;4Tier&#95;Access] spreadsheet, that is the restriction level this role should have for this form.
#Verify that the other three roles have the planned access, that is:
#*AA&#95;GL&#95;Configurator: ''Not Set''
#*AA&#95;GL&#95;Manager: ''Delete''
#*AA&#95;GL&#95;Clerk: ''Not Set''[anchor|#_9d5a30d1-e7e3-4651-9951-3186e9a5264f]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.
#Modify access rights for the rest of the forms, according to the [{up}UserGuide/Files/User_Roles_GL_4Tier_Access.xlsx|GL&#95;4Tier&#95;Access] spreadsheet.

If you are using another dataset, or if any system             settings have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the             activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100              dataset to its initial state. Story Suppose that the  SweetLife Fruits & Jams company has purchased  Acumatica ERP subscription in  . The instance has been installed by SaaS engineers, and a basic company                 configuration has been performed. It was decided to have four access tiers: Configurator : Roles from this tier give access only to configuration                     settings of a functional area. Manager : Roles from this tier allows working with entities, inquiries,                     and reports of a functional area without any restrictions and view configuration                     settings. Clerk : Roles from this tier allows only adding new records and edit                     record details within a functional area. Auditor : Roles from this tier allows only viewing records, inquiries, and                     reports associated with a functional area. You, as a system administrator, decided to start implementation of the tiers with the                 general ledger functional area. By default, forms related to this area are grouped                 under the  Finance  workspace.

==Story==
Suppose that a CFO of the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company decided that only employees, authorized by CFO are allowed to reprint checks. To accommodate this requirement, you, as a system administrator, decided to create a granular role that will give access to the reprinting checks only and restrict access to this operation to all other roles. As a result, only users that have full access to accounts payable (that is, assigned with a role that gives this access) can be authorized to reprint checks by assigning them this granular role on CFO request.
==Process Overview==
You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_05|User Roles] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201005|SM201005]) form to create the <tt>AA&#95;AP&#95;Reprint&#95;Checks</tt> role. You will use the <tt>AA</tt> prefix for the role to have it on top of the list, combined with <tt>&#95;AP</tt> to indicate the functional area.{br}

You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_20|Access Rights by Screen] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201020|SM201020]) form to set access to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_50_52_00|Release Payments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP505200|AP505200]) form that contains the ''Reprint'' and ''Reprint With New Number'' operations. The new role is to be used only in combination with a role that gives full access to the accounts payable functionality, but you cannot configure access to the actions if an explicit restriction level is not specified for the form. Thus, you revoke access to the form for the new role, because you need to allow access only to two elements, access to the other functionality of the form will be provided by the accompanying role.{br}

The You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_20|Access Rights by Screen] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201020|SM201020]) form to modify access to the ''Reprint'' and ''Reprint With New Number'' operations as follows:[anchor|#_c73e4b43-cce1-4c0d-99bf-386741bf931b]
#You determine roles that also have full access to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_50_52_00|Release Payments] form. You can exclude roles that have the ''Not Set'', ''View Only'', and ''Revoked'' access to the form and then the roles that you are not using for managing user access (for example, predefined roles delivered with Acumatica ERP). In this activity, we assume that the ''Accountant'' and ''Purchase Manager'' roles meet the criteria. That is, these roles are used for user access management and have a restriction level higher than ''View Only''.
#:((({S:Hint}To form the list of roles that need modification you can use filters for the table columns in the right pane of the form or create an advanced filter in the same pane. For details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS_Filtering_and_Sorting_Mapref|Filtering and Sorting in Acumatica ERP].
)))
#You modify access rights to a form container for these roles. The ''Reprint'' and ''Reprint With New Number'' operations are stored in the ''ReleaseChecksFilter'' container of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_50_52_00|Release Payments] form. Initially, all three roles will have the ''Inherited'' restriction level set to the container and form elements. Thus, before modifying access rights to the actions, you need to modify access to their parent container. 
#:You change the restriction level set for the container from ''Inherited'' to a specific one. In this case, you revoke access to the container for the newly created role (<tt>AA&#95;AP&#95;Reprint&#95;Checks</tt>), because you need to grant access to only to elements for this role. For the other two roles, you set the ''Delete'' level, because you need to restrict access to only two elements and allow access to all others. 
#After you modified access to the container, its nested elements still will have the ''Inherited'' restriction level. While calculating a restriction level for a user, the system takes into account only roles for which an explicit level is set. As you will use the granular role in combination with other roles, you explicitly revoke access for other roles involved and grant access to only the granular role. 

The following table summarizes changes that need to be done. For details, on how the system calculates a restriction level for a user, see [HelpRoot_Administration\User_Roles_User_Access_Level_Calculation|User Roles: Calculation of Restriction Level for a User].[anchor|#_d9c6da0d-e86b-4432-abcd-40a67c60f596]

==System Preparation==
Before you start configuring a role, sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded as a system administrator with the following credentials:[anchor|#_d2dffc6e-985c-4fe7-97aa-7a4b3562c712]
*Username: ''gibbs''
*Password: ''123''

==Step 1: Creating a Role==
To create a role, do the following:[anchor|#_fa742785-635f-4638-890f-918dff014a89]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_05|User Roles] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201005|SM201005]) form.[anchor|#_3c721017-455e-4d35-a877-9ffab184616b]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record'''.
#In the '''Role Name''' box, type <tt>AA&#95;AP&#95;Reprint&#95;Checks</tt>.

#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

==Step 2: Setting Access to a Form==
To set restriction level for a form, do the following:[anchor|#_223cc755-4cc9-4104-940f-cdd690a42bb6]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_20|Access Rights by Screen] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201020|SM201020]) form.
#In the left pane, expand the '''Payables''' node and select the '''Release Payments''' node.
#In the right pane, for the ''AA&#95;AP&#95;Reprint&#95;Checks'' role, in the '''Access Rights''' column, select the ''Revoked'' option.[anchor|#_65fbb271-a443-48cd-8c26-019290babca2]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

==Step 3: Modifying Access to a Form Element==
To modify restriction level for a form element, do the following:[anchor|#_9f1c4112-4096-4dc5-a3ef-87486ef4fc3d]
#While remaining on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_20|Access Rights by Screen] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201020|SM201020]) form, in the left pane expand the '''Release Payments''' node and select the '''ReleaseChecksFilter''' node, which is container for the operations.
#In the right pane, do the following:
#*In the '''Access Rights''' column, select the ''Revoked'' option for the ''AA&#95;AP&#95;Reprint&#95;Checks'' role.
#*In the '''Access Rights''' column, select the ''Delete'' option for the ''Accountant'' and ''Purchase Manager'' roles.[anchor|#_568f107c-904d-46d5-ad92-7fa5f12d629c]
#*On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.
#In the left pane, expand the '''ReleaseChecksFilter''' node and select the '''Reprint''' element.

#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.
#Modify access rights for the '''Reprint With New Number''' element, in the same way.

You have created and configured a role with an access to only one form and restricted access to two operations of this form for other roles in the system that have access to this form.
==(Optional) Step 3: Verifying Configured Access==
To verify the configured access to the actions, do the following:
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_55|Access Rights by User] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201055|SM201055]) form.
#In the '''Login''' box, select a user with the ''pasic'' username. This user is assigned with the ''Accountant'' role.
#In the left pane, expand the '''Payables''' > '''Release Payments''' nodes and select the '''ReleaseChecksFilter''' node.
#In the right pane, verify that access to the '''Reprint''' and '''Reprint With New Number''' elements is revoked. That is, the ''Revoked'' option is displayed in the '''Access Rights''' column.
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) form.
#In the '''Login''' box, select a user with the ''pasic'' username.
#On the '''Roles''' tab, for the row with ''AA&#95;AP&#95;Reprint&#95;Checks'' in the '''Role Name''' column, select the checkbox in the '''Selected''' column.[anchor|#_0eddaa46-949a-45de-a366-4354a27b23df]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_55|Access Rights by User] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201055|SM201055]) form.
#In the '''Login''' box, select a user with the ''pasic'' username. This user is assigned with the ''Accountant'' role.
#In the left pane, expand the '''Payables''' > '''Release Payments''' nodes and select the '''ReleaseChecksFilter''' node.
#In the right pane, verify that access to the '''Reprint''' and '''Reprint With New Number''' elements is allowed. That is, the ''Edit'' option is displayed in the '''Access Rights''' column.
#In the right pane, select the row with the '''Reprint''' element and click '''View Roles''' on the table toolbar.
#In the '''View Roles''' dialog box that opens, review the list of roles assigned to the selected user and access rights that each role has to the element, as show on the following screenshot. The system gives the user the most permissive restriction level to the element (1 on the screenshot) among the roles with explicitly defined restriction levels (2 on the screenshot). The roles with the ''Inherited'' level of access rights are ignored.[anchor|#_371016d9-13a0-40d0-a589-edcdd5932da9][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_UserRoles_Granular_Role_Access_Verification.png|popup|The list of roles assigned to the selected user that affects user&rsquo;s access to the Reprint element|450px]

You use the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201020|SM201020]) Access Rights by Screen (SM201020) form to set access to the                       ([~/?ScreenId=AP505200|AP505200]) Release Payments (AP505200) form that contains the  Reprint                  and  Reprint With New Number  operations. The new role is to be used only in                 combination with a role that gives full access to the accounts payable                 functionality, but you cannot configure access to the actions if an explicit                 restriction level is not specified for the form. Thus, you revoke access to the form                 for the new role, because you need to allow access only to two elements, access to                 the other functionality of the form will be provided by the accompanying role. The You use the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201020|SM201020]) Access Rights by Screen (SM201020) form to modify access to                 the  Reprint  and  Reprint With New Number  operations as follows: You determine roles that also have full access to the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP505200|AP505200]) Release Payments form. You can exclude roles that have the  Not                         Set ,  View Only , and  Revoked  access to the form and then                     the roles that you are not using for managing user access (for example,                     predefined roles delivered with  Acumatica ERP). In this activity, we assume that the  Accountant  and  Purchase                         Manager  roles meet the criteria. That is, these roles are used for user                     access management and have a restriction level higher than  View                         Only . To form the list of roles that need modification                         you can use filters for the table columns in the right pane of the form or                         create an advanced filter in the same pane. For details, see  Filtering and Sorting in Acumatica ERP. You modify access rights to a form container for these roles. The  Reprint                      and  Reprint With New Number  operations are stored in the                          ReleaseChecksFilter  container of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP505200|AP505200]) Release Payments                     form. Initially, all three roles will have the  Inherited  restriction                     level set to the container and form elements. Thus, before modifying access                     rights to the actions, you need to modify access to their parent container.                          You change the restriction level set for the container from                              Inherited  to a specific one. In this case, you revoke access to                         the container for the newly created role                             ( AA_AP_Reprint_Checks ), because you need to grant                         access to only to elements for this role. For the other two roles, you set                         the  Delete  level, because you need to restrict access to only two                         elements and allow access to all others.  After you modified access to the container, its nested elements still will have                     the  Inherited  restriction level. While calculating a restriction level                     for a user, the system takes into account only roles for which an explicit level                     is set. As you will use the granular role in combination with other roles, you                     explicitly revoke access for other roles involved and grant access to only the                     granular role.  The following table summarizes changes that need to be done. For details, on how the                 system calculates a restriction level for a user, see  User Roles: Calculation of Restriction Level for a User. Restriction level modifications need for configuring access to form                     elements Roles / System Objects Release Payments (form) ReleaseChecksFilter (form                                 container) Reprint and Reprint with New Number                                 (form elements stored in the container) Initial Level Configured Level Initial Level Configured Level Initial Level Configured Level AA_AP_Reprint_Checks Not Set Revoked Inherited Revoked Inherited Edit Accountant Delete Delete Inherited Delete Inherited Revoked Purchase Manager Delete Delete Inherited Delete Inherited Revoked System Preparation Before you start configuring a role, sign in to a company with the  U100                  dataset preloaded as a system administrator with the following credentials: Username:  gibbs Password:  123 Step 1: Creating a Role To create a role, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201005|SM201005]) User Roles (SM201005) form. On              the form toolbar, click  Add New Record . In the  Role Name  box, type                          AA_AP_Reprint_Checks . In the  Role Description  box, type  Role to                         reprint AP checks . On the form toolbar, click  Save . Step 2: Setting Access to a Form To set restriction level for a form, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201020|SM201020]) Access Rights by Screen (SM201020) form. In the left pane, expand the  Payables  node and select the                          Release Payments  node. In the right pane, for the  AA_AP_Reprint_Checks  role, in the                          Access Rights  column, select the  Revoked                      option. On the form toolbar, click  Save . Step 3: Modifying Access to a Form Element To modify restriction level for a form element, do the following: While remaining on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201020|SM201020]) Access Rights by Screen (SM201020) form, in the                     left pane expand the  Release Payments  node and select the                          ReleaseChecksFilter  node, which is container for the                     operations. In the right pane, do the following: In the  Access Rights  column, select the                                  Revoked  option for the  AA_AP_Reprint_Checks  role. In the  Access Rights  column, select the                                  Delete  option for the  Accountant  and  Purchase                                 Manager  roles. On the form toolbar, click  Save . In the left pane, expand the  ReleaseChecksFilter  node and                     select the  Reprint  element. In the right pane, do the following: In the  Access Rights  column, select the                                  Edit  option for the  AA_AP_Reprint_Checks  role. In the  Access Rights  column, select the                                  Revoked  option for the  Accountant  and  Purchase                                 Manager  roles. On the form toolbar, click  Save . Modify access rights for the  Reprint With New Number                      element, in the same way. You have created and configured a role with an access to only one form and restricted                 access to two operations of this form for other roles in the system that have access                 to this form. (Optional) Step 3: Verifying Configured Access To verify the configured access to the actions, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201055|SM201055]) Access Rights by User (SM201055) form. In the  Login  box, select a user with the  pasic                      username. This user is assigned with the  Accountant  role. In the left pane, expand the  Payables Release Payments  nodes and select the  ReleaseChecksFilter                      node. In the right pane, verify that access to the  Reprint  and                          Reprint With New Number  elements is revoked. That is,                     the  Revoked  option is displayed in the  Access                         Rights  column. Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) Users (SM201010) form. In the  Login  box, select a user with the  pasic                      username. On the  Roles  tab, for the row with                          AA_AP_Reprint_Checks  in the  Role Name  column, select the                     checkbox in the  Selected  column. On the form toolbar, click  Save . Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201055|SM201055]) Access Rights by User (SM201055) form. In the  Login  box, select a user with the  pasic                      username. This user is assigned with the  Accountant  role. In the left pane, expand the  Payables Release Payments  nodes and select the  ReleaseChecksFilter                      node. In the right pane, verify that access to the  Reprint  and                          Reprint With New Number  elements is allowed. That is,                     the  Edit  option is displayed in the  Access Rights                      column. In the right pane, select the row with the  Reprint                      element and click  View Roles  on the table toolbar. In the  View Roles  dialog box that opens, review the list                     of roles assigned to the selected user and access rights that each role has to                     the element, as show on the following screenshot. The system gives the user the                     most permissive restriction level to the element (1 on the screenshot) among the                     roles with explicitly defined restriction levels (2 on the screenshot). The                     roles with the  Inherited  level of access rights are ignored.

==Story==
Suppose that with the company growth you, as a system administrator, got an assistant. At the beginning, the assistant will help you with creation of users for the new employees. Then you will decide what other responsibilities the assistant will carry on. To accommodate current job responsibilities, you decided to copy your existing role and modify access rights for the copy.
==Process Overview==
You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_25|Access Rights by Role] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201025|SM201025]) form to create a copy of a role and then modify access rights for the copied role.{br}

You name the new role ''Junior Administrator'' and revoke role&rsquo;s access to all workspaces in the system. To allow creating a user, you give full access to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]), and [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) forms that are needed for adding employees to the system. (For details on user accounts creation, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Managing_User_Access_To_Add_User_Account_Activity|User Access: To Add User Account].) These forms are located in the different workspaces ('''User Security''', '''Marketing''', and '''Configuration''') access to which you have revoked. The system displays restricted workspaces in the main menu, but only links to allowed forms are visible inside a workspace. 
==System Preparation==
Before you start modifying a copied role, sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded as a system administrator with the following credentials:[anchor|#_d2dffc6e-985c-4fe7-97aa-7a4b3562c712]
*Username: ''gibbs''
*Password: ''123''

==Step 1: Copying a Role==
To copy an existing role, do the following:[anchor|#_fa742785-635f-4638-890f-918dff014a89]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_25|Access Rights by Role] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201025|SM201025]) form.
#In the '''Role Name''' box, select the ''Administrator'' role.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Copy Role'''.
#In the '''New Role''' dialog box, which opens, do the following:
##In the '''New Role Name''' box, type <tt>Junior Administrator</tt>.
##Click '''Copy''' to copy the role and close the dialog box.
#In the '''Role Description''' box, add <tt>Junior</tt> to the copied description.[anchor|#_681e9ac3-12e2-41d9-a9b7-9d89d7614a78]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

==Step 2: To Modify Access Rights for a Selected User Role==
To modify access rights for a role, do the following:[anchor|#_d2c754f6-9347-42c9-a461-1459f0a2042d]
#While remaining on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_25|Access Rights by Role] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201025|SM201025]) form with the copied role selected in the '''Role Name''' box, in the left pane select the tenant node (the very first one).
#In the right pane, for all workspaces in the system, select the ''Revoked'' option in the '''Access Rights''' column.
#:((({S:Hint}You can skip workspaces with the functionality that is not included in your license.
)))
#In the left pane, click the '''Configuration''' node.
#In the right pane, for the row with the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees], select the ''Delete'' option in the '''Access Rights''' column.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.
#In the similar way, set the ''Delete'' access to the following forms:
#*The [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) form under '''Marketing'''
#*The [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) under '''User Security'''

An individual must have a user account in the system to access Acumatica ERP. Access to information is controlled primarily by the roles assigned to the user who logs in to the system. Roles generally correspond to particular job assignments or functions of groups of users. When they log in, the users authenticate themselves, and the associated roles determine which system resources they may access. {br}

In this chapter, you will find information on Acumatica ERP user access management.
==In This Chapter==
*[HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Managing_User_Access_GeneralInfo|User Access: General Information]
*:To access Acumatica ERP, an individual must have a user account in the system and a user role assigned to the account. Each account includes a login, a password, and other properties, such as the user’s first and last name, email address, password policy options, and set of roles that control user's access to the system objects.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Managing_User_Access_User_Access_Security_Concept|User Access: User Access Security]
*:In addition to system-wide password policy configured on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_60|Security Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201060|SM201060]) form you can use the following capabilities of Acumatica ERP to apply your organization's security policies to individual user accounts on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) form.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Managing_User_Access_Mobile_Devices_Concept|User Access: Mobile Devices]
*:Users of the system may use the Acumatica mobile app to perform their job responsibilities. They just need to download the application to a mobile device and enter connection parameters: Acumatica ERP website address and user credentials. The system keeps track of only those devices for which a user allowed push notifications from the app.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Managing_User_Access_User_Types_Usage_Concept|User Access: Linked Entity and User Type]
*:In Acumatica ERP, a ''linked entity'' is an employee or contact account that is associated with the user. If the user you are creating is already defined in the system as an employee or contact account, you can select the appropriate employee or contact name in this box. This will cause relevant elements to be filled in.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Managing_User_Access_Config_Prereq|User Access: Configuration Prerequisites]
*:Before starting to configuring user access, you must be sure that the system has been configured properly and that all required entities have been created, as described in the following sections.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Managing User Access An individual must have a user account in the system to access  Acumatica ERP. Access to information is controlled primarily by the roles assigned to the user                 who logs in to the system. Roles generally correspond to particular job assignments                 or functions of groups of users. When they log in, the users authenticate                 themselves, and the associated roles determine which system resources they may                 access.  In this chapter, you will find information on  Acumatica ERP user access management.

To access Acumatica ERP, an individual must have a user account in the system and a user role assigned to the account. Each account includes a login, a password, and other properties, such as the user’s first and last name, email address, password policy options, and set of roles that control user&rsquo;s access to the system objects. {br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Create a user account and assign it with roles, combination of which provide access rights necessary to job responsibilities.
*Assign a role to multiple users.
*Modify access for an existing user account
*Review user&rsquo;s access to system objects.

==Applicable Scenarios==
You manage user access in the following cases:[anchor|#_7165d0ed-fbf9-4bca-b563-a0155c7a9310]
*When you, as an implementation consultant, initially implement Acumatica ERP for your client and is ready to give access to company employees.
*When you, as a system administrator, was notified about a new hire and need to give appropriate access to the system for the new employee.
*When you, as a system administrator, was notified about change of a position for an employee and need to change access for this employee according to the new responsibilities.

==User Authentication and Authorization==
 Acumatica ERP requires users to authenticate by using the appropriate username and password. After successful authentication, user membership in roles is checked. Then users may access only the resources and perform only the actions they are authorized to by their roles. {br}

A user with no role assigned has no access to the system. If the user has multiple roles that have different levels of access rights to an entity, the highest level applies. {br}

Method of authentication in Acumatica ERP can be one of the following: [anchor|#_0bf517b1-a901-4736-bcd4-8609358a7c10]
*Local: User accounts are created and managed directly in Acumatica ERP. 
*External: If Acumatica ERP is integrated with an external identity management system, then user accounts and roles are created and managed in the integrated system. For details on supported integrations see, [HelpRoot_Integration\US__con_Integration_with_Active_Directory|Integration with Active Directory], [HelpRoot_Integration\US__con_ADFS_Integration|Integration with AD FS], and [HelpRoot_Integration\US__con_AzureAD_Integration|Integration with Azure Active Directory].

To make the authentication process easier for your users, you can configure single sign-on with external identity providers, such as Google and Microsoft Account. For details, see [HelpRoot_Integration\US__con_SSO_with_Google|Single Sign-On with Google] and [HelpRoot_Integration\US__con_SSO_with_Microsoft_Account|Single Sign-On with Microsoft Account].{br}

Also, Acumatica ERP provides two-factor authentication, so that access to the system is granted only after the user successfully presents to the system additional evidence of authentication in addition to the user credentials (that is, the username and password). For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__mng_Two_Factor_Auth|Managing Two-Factor Authentication].
==User Account Creation==
When you configure access for users to Acumatica ERP, you perform the following steps on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) form:[anchor|#_c56d62c5-d31c-4844-ab83-504e31428b0d]
#You create a user account and specify the username, password, user&rsquo;s first and last name, and email address. 
#If your organization uses specific security policies, you apply them to the user account. For more detailed information on security policies for user accounts, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Managing_User_Access_User_Access_Security_Concept|User Access: User Access Security].
#You define access to the system objects by assigning set of roles that corresponds to the user&rsquo;s job responsibilities.

==Ways to Generate and Share User Credentials==
When you create a new user, the system automatically generates password for the user. That is, fills in the '''Password''' box with the masked password. You can clear the '''Generate Password''' checkbox for the new user and type a password (that can be generated by any third-party tool) to the '''Password''' box. For an existing user you can click '''Reset Password''' on the form toolbar and enter a new password for this user.{br}

If a default system email account is configured and corresponding notification templates are specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_01|Email Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM204001|SM204001]) form, the system sends an email with user credentials to the address you have specified in the '''Email''' box for the user, when you save user settings for the first time.{br}

If a system email account is not configured or you do not want to share credentials using email services, you can share credentials using third-party services you trust to. In this case, you set passwords manually for the users in Acumatica ERP and share user credentials using a third-party tool.
==Roles Assignment==
To give a user access to the system objects, you need to assign this user with a role or combination of roles which provide access necessary to perform job responsibilities. For details on user role configuration, see [HelpRoot_Administration\User_Roles_GeneralInfo|User Roles: General Information].{br}

To assign multiple roles to a selected user, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) form. For example, you use this way when you have created a new user account and want to assign it existing roles.{br}

To assign multiple users a selected role, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_05|User Roles] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201005|SM201005]) form. For example, you use this way when you have created a new role and want to assign it to existing users. ((({S:Hint}You can use user types to simplify the assignment of user roles to users. For details, see[HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Managing_User_Access_User_Types_Usage_Concept|User Access: Linked Entity and User Type].
)))
==Roles Application==
To access Acumatica ERP, users must pass authentication to confirm their identity (that is, sign in the system). Then users pass authorization to determine their access rights to the system objects. Users can access only the objects they are allowed to use and perform only the actions they are authorized to based on their access rights. A user with no role assigned has no access to system. {br}

You may take different approaches in configuring user access: assigning a user with a single role or with a combination of roles. This may affect how the system calculates an individual user access. A role defines access rights to system objects with a restriction level set for these objects.[anchor|#_4f382cdf-5355-46fe-b954-d3ee691acc45]{br}

The set of restriction levels available for the system objects depends on the object type. For some objects, you can specify more granular level, for others either allow or deny the access. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\User_Roles_Access_Levels|User Roles: Restriction Level Options].{br}

If a user is assigned with a combination of roles, some of these roles may have different restriction levels set to the same system object. How the system calculates the final restriction level depends on a system object for which levels are different among roles assigned to a user. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\User_Roles_User_Access_Level_Calculation|User Roles: Calculation of Restriction Level for a User].{br}

You can view the user access rights to a particular form, containers or form element by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_55|Access Rights by User] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201055|SM201055]) form. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Managing_User_Access_Reports_Inquiries|User Access: Related Report and Inquiry Forms].
==Monitoring Access Configuration==
Access configuration, once established, should be a subject or regular review and modification. People in an organization move across roles and projects or leave the company and new people hired instead. Job responsibilities for a particular employee or the whole department can be changed. You should keep the user access configuration in compliance with the company changed business processes and make sure that its sensitive data is protected from unwanted access.{br}

We recommend establishing a process of requesting an access to a particular system objects. Such requests should be justified by changes in the job responsibilities and approved by superiors.{br}

You should be notified each time when an employee is leaving the company or a contractor with a an access to the system completed their project. You can either deactivate user accounts for these people or you can clear the list of assigned roles if you need to keep a user account for some reason.{br}

Regular review of the list of user roles configured is also recommended. You can either delete unused roles that have zero people assigned or add some prefix to role description if you want to keep them for some reason. Decide for yourself what is the number of roles you can maintain to effectively secure access to the system and try keep the list within this number.{br}

Also, we recommend, regularly review history of users&rsquo; access to Acumatica ERP forms that allows viewing companies sensitive data to identify unexpected or unwanted access behavior. {br}

You can use reports and inquires provide by Acumatica ERP for monitoring access configuration. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Managing_User_Access_Reports_Inquiries|User Access: Related Report and Inquiry Forms].]]></column>

When a user signs in to the mobile app for the first time, the application sends details about the device to Acumatica ERP, and then the information is updated with each subsequent sign-in. {br}

The system administrator can manage registered devices of a user on the '''Devices''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) form. 
==Deleting Mobile Devices==
You can delete any registered device listed on the '''Devices''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] form by clicking it and using the standard button on the table toolbar, or you can delete all devices for a user by clicking the '''Delete All''' button on this toolbar. 
==Enabling Push Notifications==
Also, you can control to which devices the system can send push notifications on the '''Devices''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] form. You can use the '''Turn On Notifications''' check box to selectively allow or disallow these notifications for devices. You can also enable or disable sending push notifications for all user&rsquo;s devices by clicking the '''Enable All''' and '''Disable All''' buttons, respectively, on the table toolbar. {br}

If push notifications are disabled for a device, the owner of this device will not be able to use the following functionality that uses push notifications:[anchor|#_48286e4c-14ad-4f18-986c-dbb426889d8e]
*Receiving a push notification if a business event occurred. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Using_Business_Events_Mapref|Using Business Events].
*Uploading images to Acumatica ERP using a mobile device. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__mng_File_Attachements|Managing Attached Files].
*Using two-factor authentication. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__mng_Two_Factor_Auth|Managing Two-Factor Authentication].

==Tracking User Location==
In Acumatica ERP, you can view the GPS location coordinates of users that are tracked through their mobile devices. To be able to view a user&rsquo;s coordinates in the system, you have to configure location tracking for each necessary user on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) form. You use the '''Location Tracking''' tab to turn on the tracking functionality for the selected user, specify the time and distance intervals at which the coordinates will be tracked in the system, and specify on which days and during which time periods the system registers the user location. For detailed instructions on how to turn on and configure the location tracking, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__HOW_To_Turn_on_Location_Tracking|To Turn On Location Tracking of a User].((({S:Warn}For GPS location coordinates to be tracked, on the user&rsquo;s device, GPS location recording has to be switched on.
)))
You can view the history of the location coordinates of all users that have been tracked in the system on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_20_00|Location Tracking History] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202000|SM202000]) form.]]></column>
			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[User Access: Mobile Devices Users of the system may use the  Acumatica mobile app to perform their job responsibilities. They just need to download the         application to a mobile device and enter connection parameters:  Acumatica ERP website address and user credentials. The system keeps track of only those devices for         which a user allowed push notifications from the app. Registering Mobile Devices If a user of the system is using the  Acumatica mobile app and allowed push notifications from the app for a device, the information         about such device is stored in their  Acumatica ERP user profile (the  Devices  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) User Profile (SM203010) form).  When a user signs in to the mobile app for the first time, the application sends details         about the device to  Acumatica ERP, and then the information is updated with each subsequent sign-in.  The system administrator can manage registered devices of a user on the            Devices  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) Users         (SM201010) form.

In Acumatica ERP, a ''linked entity'' is an employee or contact account that is associated with the user. If the user you are creating is already defined in the system as an employee or contact account, you can select the appropriate employee or contact name in this box. This will cause relevant elements to be filled in. {br}

User types are used to provide default settings for new users that you create. You can define the set of roles that are available for a user of the type and the default roles to be assigned when a user of this type is created. {br}

Also, your company may need to give your partners limited access to Acumatica ERP—for instance, to facilitate the process of entering contacts or customer orders. In such a scenario, you may need some way to segregate users that are internal to your company from external users, or even to give your partners the means to create and manage their own users in Acumatica ERP, thus freeing your administrators of the responsibility to manage these users. You can address these requirements through the use of user types in Acumatica ERP.{br}

In Acumatica ERP, creating a user account and an employee or contact is not the same. Contacts, employees, and users are created independently and can be associated with each other later. You can also create a user that is not associated with any user type or linked entity. 
==Linked Entity for User Account==
Depending on your purpose, you can select the following system entities as linked entity of the user: [anchor|#_e836f277-e429-4518-bfd4-ec6592ff6205]
*''Contact'': You can assign this entity to external users, such as partners or contacts of customer or vendor organizations. 
*''Employee'': You can assign this entity to employees of your company and possibly to consultants that you consider part of your company. 

==Default Settings Provided by User Type==
If you use the user types functionality you can specify the following security settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_25_00|User Types] ([~/?ScreenId=EP202500|EP202500]) form that will be applied to all users of this type:[anchor|#_9fc1df49-697e-41fd-8806-da0d40d7fcbc]
*Allow users with linked contacts to use their emails as their login to the system.
*Force new users to change their password at the first login.
*Force new users to activate their account.

For each user type, you can specify the set of roles that can be assigned to users of this type. For the procedure of adding a user type, see [HelpRoot_Administration\US__how_Add_Contact_User_Type|To Add a User Type].((({S:Warn}If you assign a user type to an existing user, the collection of roles from the user type overrides any roles that have been explicitly assigned to the user. 
)))[anchor|#_775858a7-972a-4226-ac5d-7e74ae894419]
==Internal User Types==
An employee-related user type is associated with employees in your system. These user types are intended for users who are internal to your company (generally employees of your company and possibly consultants that you consider part of your company).
==External User Types==
A contact-related user type is associated with a contact in your system. These user types are intended for users who are external to the company—for example, partners or contacts. As opposed to employee-related user types, you can use contact-related user types to delegate the right to create users, as described in [HelpRoot_Administration\US__how_Delegation_User_Creation_Rights|To Delegate the Right to Create Users].]]></column>

This may be required if you need to give                 your partners the right to manage their organizations' users or customers on the  Self-Service Portal of your  Acumatica ERP instance. This procedure describes how you provide an external user with the right to create                 users in  Acumatica ERP. To Delegate the Right to Create Users Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP202500|EP202500]) User Types (EP202500) form. Create a contact-related user type for an external administrator who will have                     the right to create users. You could name this type, for example,  External                         Admin . For details, see  To Add a User Type. Create a contact-related user type for external users. You could name this type,                     for instance,  Portal User . The external administrator will have the right                     to create users of this type. In the Selection area, in the  User Type  box, select the                          External Admin  user type.

In Acumatica ERP, you can use restriction groups in addition to role-based access rights to configure the security of information within the system. In this chapter, you will read about ways of using restriction groups, types of restriction groups, operations that you can perform with the groups, and specific information about particular entities whose visibility you can control.
==In This Chapter==
*[HelpRoot_Administration\RS__RS_Features|Overview of Row-Level Security]
*:Acumatica ERP implements a role-based, task-oriented approach to security. You assign roles to users and give the roles appropriate access rights to the system resources—such as modules, specific forms, form elements, and toolbar buttons—that the users need to perform their work tasks. For more information about user roles, see [HelpRoot_Administration\User_Roles_Mapref|Configuring User Roles].
*[HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Overview_of_Restriction_Groups|Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP]
*:Acumatica ERP provides you with restriction groups, which are flexible tools for limiting the visibility and use of entities, such as General Ledger accounts, inventory items, and customer and vendor accounts.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Types_of_Restriction_Groups|Types of Restriction Groups]
*:Restriction groups in Acumatica ERP provide additional flexibility to the configuration of access rights for suites, modules, and forms. (For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Managing_User_Access_Mapref|Managing User Access].) You can use restriction groups when users should have access to a form, but on this form they are allowed to see one set of entities and are not allowed to see another set of entities.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Operations_Restriction_Groups|Operations with Restriction Groups]
*:The operations that you can perform with restriction groups (such as creating the groups, adding entities to a group, deleting entities from a group, and viewing group details) depend on the form. This topic describes the operations that you can perform with restriction groups.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Account_and_Subaccount_Security|Account and Subaccount Security]
*:In Acumatica ERP, you can control which users will use particular General Ledger (GL) accounts and subaccounts.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Security_of_Cash_Accounts|Security of Cash Accounts]
*:Cash is a company's most liquid asset, which is why an organization must have adequate controls to secure it. In Acumatica ERP, you can control which users can view which particular cash accounts, as described in this topic.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_GL_Budget_Security|Security of GL Budget Articles]
*:In Acumatica ERP, organizations implement general access restrictions by assigning roles to users of the system. The roles assigned to users allow them to access the needed resources to perform specific tasks required for their jobs. If a role allows a user to view or edit General Ledger (GL) budget articles, the user can view all the articles, including those that might be sensitive.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Warehouse_Security|Warehouse Security]
*:An organization can have multiple warehouses in Acumatica ERP, and different groups of employees may work with these warehouses in the system. To limit in the system the set of employees who work with a particular warehouse, you can create restriction groups to display the warehouse for only employees who are responsible for tasks that involve this warehouse. If the employees who work with the same warehouse perform only specific tasks (such as accepting goods and creating purchase orders), you can provide these employees with access to only the forms that they should use.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Restriction_Groups_for_Subitems|Inventory Item Security]
*:An organization that distributes goods may have many items in stock. In this case, users who work with inventory items in the system may have specific tasks and work with only particular item classes. When users create a sales order, they need to enter an inventory ID for each product. You can define restriction groups to limit the lists of inventory items particular users see.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Branch_Security|Security of Organization Branches]
*:If your organization has multiple branches defined in Acumatica ERP, you may need to control which employees get access to which branches. Because branches share some data, you may also need to control access to the shared data. Acumatica ERP provides user access roles, which you can use to control users' access to branches, and restriction groups to limit the visibility of shared data. In this topic, you will read about ways to manage the security of a branch.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Customer_Security|Customer Security]
*:If your organization sells goods and provides services to customers, you may have a great deal of customer-related information stored in Acumatica ERP. When the employees of your organization create documents for customers, they have to select the required customer from the full list of customers. If certain employees work with only very important customers, and other employees are not allowed to see these customers in the system for security reasons, you can create restriction groups to manage the visibility of your customers to users of Acumatica ERP, as described in this topic.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\RS__CON_Business_Account_Security|Business Account Security]
*:In Acumatica ERP a user can convert a business account to a customer account, a vendor account, or both by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) form. After this conversion, the business account continues to exist and is used in marketing processes.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Vendor_Security|Vendor Security]
*:As your organization buys goods and services from external organizations, your accountants manage vendors' information and process documents. If your organization works with more than 10 vendors, accountants may work with particular vendors only. In this case, the accountants who do not work with particular vendors should not see them in the system for security reasons and to avoid entry errors. You can use restriction groups to make vendors visible to only the accountants who work with these vendors in the system, as described in this topic.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Project_Security|Project Security]
*:Many organizations use projects to achieve their business objectives efficiently. An organization may have multiple projects in progress at a given time. By limiting users' access to and visibility of information about particular projects and related transactions, managers can properly organize the work on each project. In Acumatica ERP, you can use roles to provide access to forms according to employees' responsibilities and restriction groups to limit the visibility of particular projects to onlythe responsible team, as described in this topic.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Preparation_Configuration_Reastriction_Groups|Preparation for Configuration of Restriction Groups]
*:Before you start configuring restriction groups, you need to gather the information that will help you to plan your restriction groups, as described in this topic.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Configuration_Restriction_Groups|Configuration of Restriction Groups]
*:After you have prepared all necessary information about restriction groups, you can start configuring them, as described in this topic.

For more information about user roles, see [HelpRoot_Administration\User_Roles_Mapref|Configuring User Roles].{br}

To give your organization the ability to apply more complex security policies, Acumatica ERP provides restriction groups, which you can administer in the Row-Level Security module. A ''restriction group'' is a set of entities of two or more types that you define to achieve one of these goals:[anchor|#_712b604d-a1a5-457a-9099-da56cf73a4fc]
*To restrict employees&rsquo; visibility of sensitive data processed by using Acumatica ERP
*To relate particular entities to each other so as they are used only together on Acumatica ERP forms.

In the sections of this topic, you can find brief information on restriction groups in general, types of restriction groups, and common usage scenarios for restriction groups.{br}{TOC}
==Restriction Groups==
You can use restriction groups to control the visibility of system entities to employees of your organization. For more information about restriction groups, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Overview_of_Restriction_Groups|Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP].{br}

Your work with restriction groups in the Row-Level Security module includes the following tasks:[anchor|#_d2d1dba3-2fe0-43b1-a210-b7fd7af50694]
*Creating a restriction group and including users and entities in it to control the visibility of entities in the system. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Configuration_Restriction_Groups|Configuration of Restriction Groups].
*Adding objects or users to an existing group when you add new objects and users in the system and need to configure visibility.
*Removing objects or users from a group when you want to display the objects to all users or when the users&rsquo; functional roles are changed in your organization.
*Deactivating a group when you no longer need the visibility restrictions provided by this group.

For details on all operations with restriction groups, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Operations_Restriction_Groups|Operations with Restriction Groups].
==Types of Restriction Groups==
 Acumatica ERP provides two basic types of restriction groups—A and B. Restriction groups of both types can limit the visibility of system entities in a direct way (types ''A'' and ''B'') and an inverse way (types ''A Inverse'' and ''B Inverse''). The differences between ''A'' and ''B'' and between ''A Inverse'' and ''B Inverse'' are in how these groups work if the same entity is added to multiple groups. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Types_of_Restriction_Groups|Types of Restriction Groups].[anchor|#_e711cbda-6281-4c3d-b7b2-46c0fe5d6812]
==Combinations of Restriction-Group Entities==
 Acumatica ERP supports a variety of scenarios of configuring the visibility of entities within the system. With the most common scenarios, you can create restriction groups that include the following system entities:
*Users and General Ledger (GL) accounts: With these restriction groups, if your organization has sensitive GL accounts, you can make these accounts visible to a limited number of employees. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Account_and_Subaccount_Security|Account and Subaccount Security].
*Users and subaccounts: As with groups that include users and GL accounts, you can limit the visibility of sensitive subaccounts to employees. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Account_and_Subaccount_Security|Account and Subaccount Security].
*:((({S:Warn}For performance reasons, visibility restrictions by user for subaccounts do not affect analytical (ARM) and form-based reports or general inquiries. This means that users who can view the reports and general inquiries that include subaccounts will see the full list of subaccounts.
)))
*Users and vendor accounts: You can define these restriction groups to make particular vendors visible in the system to only employees who work with these vendors. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Vendor_Security|Vendor Security].
*Users and customer accounts: With these restriction groups, you can make particular customers visible to only employees who work with these customers. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Customer_Security|Customer Security].
*Users and GL budget articles: With these restriction groups, you can limit the visibility of sensitive budget articles so that only particular users can see and work with these articles. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_GL_Budget_Security|Security of GL Budget Articles].
*Users and warehouses: You can create restriction groups to display a particular warehouse (or set of warehouses) for only employees who work with this warehouse (or this set of warehouses). For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Warehouse_Security|Warehouse Security].
*Users and inventory items: You can define these restriction groups to reduce the number of items in the lists with inventory items, depending on the particular employee signed in to the system. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Restriction_Groups_for_Subitems|Inventory Item Security].
*Users and projects: You can define these restriction groups to configure the visibility of particular projects only to a responsible project team. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Project_Security|Project Security].
*Users and printers: If the ''DeviceHub'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]), you can define these restriction groups to configure the visibility of printers to particular users. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__how_Configure_Printer_Access|To Configure Printer Access].
*Branches, GL accounts, and users: With these restriction groups, you can allow users to work with only branch-specific accounts. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Account_and_Subaccount_Security|Account and Subaccount Security].
*Branches, subaccounts, and users: You can set up these restriction groups so that the system displays to users only the branch-specific subaccounts. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Account_and_Subaccount_Security|Account and Subaccount Security].
*Branches and cash accounts: If there are multiple branches in your organization, with these restriction groups, you can allow users in each branch to work with only branch-specific cash accounts. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Security_of_Cash_Accounts|Security of Cash Accounts].
*GL Accounts and Subaccounts: If you have subaccounts that employees must use only with particular GL accounts, by defining these restriction groups, you can set up lists of available subaccounts for each GL account. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Account_and_Subaccount_Security|Account and Subaccount Security].

 Acumatica ERP provides you with restriction groups, which are flexible tools for limiting the visibility and use of entities, such as General Ledger accounts, inventory items, and customer and vendor accounts.{br}

In this topic, you can find information about situations where restriction groups are useful, types of restriction groups, and types of entities that you can include in restriction groups.{br}{TOC}
==Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP==
You can use restriction groups to do the following:[anchor|#_321658d4-45b5-4f90-b64f-879c2ce4ecd9]
#Control the visibility of sensitive data for employees of your organization. To do this, you include in a restriction group the entities for which you need to restrict the visibility, and the users who should or should not be able to view these entities. For details, see [[#_0af57538-82a6-4d16-af40-490af350626d|Restriction Groups with Users].
#To relate entities to one another so that they are used only together on Acumatica ERP forms (or so that they cannot be used together). To do this, you include in a group only related entities and do not include users. For more information, see [[#_47c5a9b2-7df7-4186-980d-ceee777c8e94|Restriction Groups Without Users].

You can find details on configuring restriction groups in [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Configuration_Restriction_Groups|Configuration of Restriction Groups].{br}

In Acumatica ERP, you can use specific forms to create restriction groups, view the entities included in a group, and manage the list of entities of a particular type in a restriction group. For details on the typical operations you can perform with restriction groups, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Operations_Restriction_Groups|Operations with Restriction Groups].[anchor|#_0af57538-82a6-4d16-af40-490af350626d]
==Restriction Groups with Users==
To understand how restriction groups with users are used, consider a typical case with restriction groups that include users and General Ledger (GL) accounts. Suppose that a role allows all its users to access all GL accounts, but for two groups of accounts, you want to provide visibility to only particular users.[anchor|#_6b014dde-f9e7-44da-8a91-2c4d3149a719][anchor|#_b9ed6e6c-b6f5-4076-880e-28e542131881][image:UserGuide/Images/RestrictionGroups_Direct_Restriction.png|popup|Restriction groups for GL accounts and users|450px]{br}

The diagram above shows how restriction groups can address these security needs. You define Group 1 as a restriction group that includes only appropriate accountants (User C and User D) and accounts (1, 2, and 3). Similarly, you create Group 2, which includes User Y and User Z, as well as the accounts they should work with (4, 5, and 6).{br}

Among all users in the system, only User C and User D will see the first group of sensitive accounts (1, 2, and 3), and only User X and User Z will see the second group of sensitive accounts (4, 5, and 6). Users who are not assigned to any restriction group will not see the accounts associated with either group.[anchor|#_47c5a9b2-7df7-4186-980d-ceee777c8e94]
==Restriction Groups Without Users==
If a restriction group does not include users, all users may view the entities that are members of the group (if their roles provide access to forms with these entities), but entities included in the group become related in a way that limits their use. For example, suppose that you create two groups with GL accounts and subaccounts as follows:[anchor|#_e3a4ed20-9e08-427b-9952-3bea3ab3f011]
*Group 1 includes Account 1, Subaccount K, Subaccount L, and Subaccount M.
*Group 2 includes Account 2, Subaccount P, Subaccount Q, and Subaccount R.

For simplicity, suppose that there are no other accounts and subaccounts in the system.{br}

The result of these settings is the following:[anchor|#_6a47b272-5611-4ac3-90af-1aa0d8714c0b]
*If a user selects Account 1 on an entry form, he or she will be able to select only Subaccount K, Subaccount L, or Subaccount M in a box with subaccounts. The subaccounts included in Group 2 will be hidden from the list.
*If the user selects Account 2, he or she will see Subaccount P, Subaccount Q, and Subaccount R in the box with subaccounts; the user will not see Subaccount K, Subaccount L, and Subaccount M.
[anchor|#_f775f054-4e52-4895-bb80-1fe611cd4ec8]((({S:Warn}If you are using restriction groups to control the accounts and subaccounts that can be used together, you must create at least two groups and include all subaccounts in either of the groups. For example, suppose that you need to restrict visibility of subaccounts for only one account. To solve this task, you create two restriction groups. In the first group with direct restriction, you include a GL account and the list of subaccounts that should be related to this account. In the second group with inverse restriction, you include the same account and subaccounts that should not be displayed after users select this account. As a result, when users select the account on a form, they will see only one of the subaccounts included in the first group.

==Types of Restriction Groups==
 Acumatica ERP provides two basic types of restriction groups—A and B. Restriction groups of both types can limit the visibility of system entities in a direct way (types ''A'' and ''B'') and an inverse way (types ''A Inverse'' and ''B Inverse'' in the Acumatica ERP user interface). The differences between ''A'' and ''B'' and between ''A Inverse'' and ''B Inverse'' are in how these groups work if the same entity is added to multiple groups. For detailed descriptions of each group type, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Types_of_Restriction_Groups|Types of Restriction Groups].[anchor|#_c611e33d-0eae-4b92-ba15-444db68eb38d]
==Combinations of Restriction-Group Entities==
 Acumatica ERP supports a variety of scenarios of configuring the visibility of entities within the system. With the most common scenarios, you can create restriction groups that include the following system entities:
*Users and General Ledger (GL) accounts: With these restriction groups, if your organization has sensitive GL accounts, you can make these accounts visible to a limited number of employees. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Account_and_Subaccount_Security|Account and Subaccount Security].
*Users and subaccounts: As with groups that include users and GL accounts, you can limit the visibility of sensitive subaccounts to employees. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Account_and_Subaccount_Security|Account and Subaccount Security].
*:((({S:Warn}For performance reasons, visibility restrictions by user for subaccounts do not affect analytical (ARM) and form-based reports or general inquiries. This means that users who can view the reports and general inquiries that include subaccounts will see the full list of subaccounts.
)))
*Users and vendor accounts: You can define these restriction groups to make particular vendors visible in the system to only employees who work with these vendors. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Vendor_Security|Vendor Security].
*Users and customer accounts: With these restriction groups, you can make particular customers visible to only employees who work with these customers. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Customer_Security|Customer Security].
*Users and GL budget articles: With these restriction groups, you can limit the visibility of sensitive budget articles so that only particular users can see and work with these articles. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_GL_Budget_Security|Security of GL Budget Articles].
*Users and warehouses: You can create restriction groups to display a particular warehouse (or set of warehouses) for only employees who work with this warehouse (or this set of warehouses). For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Warehouse_Security|Warehouse Security].
*Users and inventory items: You can define these restriction groups to reduce the number of items in the lists with inventory items, depending on the particular employee signed in to the system. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Restriction_Groups_for_Subitems|Inventory Item Security].
*Users and projects: You can define these restriction groups to configure the visibility of particular projects only to a responsible project team. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Project_Security|Project Security].
*Users and printers: If the ''DeviceHub'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]), you can define these restriction groups to configure the visibility of printers to particular users. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__how_Configure_Printer_Access|To Configure Printer Access].
*Branches, GL accounts, and users: With these restriction groups, you can allow users to work with only branch-specific accounts. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Account_and_Subaccount_Security|Account and Subaccount Security].
*Branches, subaccounts, and users: You can set up these restriction groups so that the system displays to users only the branch-specific subaccounts. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Account_and_Subaccount_Security|Account and Subaccount Security].
*Branches and cash accounts: If there are multiple branches in your organization, with these restriction groups, you can allow users in each branch to work with only branch-specific cash accounts. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Security_of_Cash_Accounts|Security of Cash Accounts].
*GL Accounts and Subaccounts: If you have subaccounts that employees must use only with particular GL accounts, by defining these restriction groups, you can set up lists of available subaccounts for each GL account. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Account_and_Subaccount_Security|Account and Subaccount Security].

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Restriction Groups in  Acumatica ERP Acumatica ERP provides you with restriction groups, which are flexible tools for limiting the 				visibility and use of entities, such as General Ledger accounts, inventory items, 				and customer and vendor accounts. In this topic, you can find information about situations where restriction groups are 				useful, types of restriction groups, and types of entities that you can include in 				restriction groups. Restriction Groups in  Acumatica ERPYou can use restriction groups to do the following: Control the visibility of sensitive data for employees of your organization. To do this, you 					include in a restriction group the entities for which you need to restrict the 					visibility, and the users who should or should not be able to view these 					entities. For details, see  Restriction Groups with Users Restriction Groups with Users. To relate entities to one another so that they are used only together on  Acumatica ERP forms (or so that they cannot be used together). To do this, you include in a 					group only related entities and do not include users. For more information, see 						 Restriction Groups Without Users Restriction Groups Without Users. You can find details on configuring restriction groups in  Configuration of Restriction Groups. In  Acumatica ERP, you can use specific forms to create restriction groups, view the entities 				included in a group, and manage the list of entities of a particular type in a 				restriction group. For details on the typical operations you can perform with 				restriction groups, see  Operations with Restriction Groups. Restriction Groups with Users To understand how restriction groups with users are used, consider a typical case with 				restriction groups that include users and General Ledger (GL) accounts. Suppose that 				a role allows all its users to access all GL accounts, but for two groups of 				accounts, you want to provide visibility to only particular users. Restriction groups for GL accounts and users The diagram above shows how restriction groups can address these security needs. You define 				Group 1 as a restriction group that includes only appropriate accountants (User C 				and User D) and accounts (1, 2, and 3). Similarly, you create Group 2, which 				includes User Y and User Z, as well as the accounts they should work with (4, 5, and 				6). Among all users in the system, only User C and User D will see the first group of 				sensitive accounts (1, 2, and 3), and only User X and User Z will see the second 				group of sensitive accounts (4, 5, and 6). Users who are not assigned to any 				restriction group will not see the accounts associated with either group. Restriction Groups Without Users If a restriction group does not include users, all users may view the entities that 				are members of the group (if their roles provide access to forms with these 				entities), but entities included in the group become related in a way that limits 				their use. For example, suppose that you create two groups with GL accounts and 				subaccounts as follows: Group 1 includes Account 1, Subaccount K, Subaccount L, and Subaccount M. Group 2 includes Account 2, Subaccount P, Subaccount Q, and Subaccount R. For simplicity, suppose that there are no other accounts and subaccounts in the 				system. The result of these settings is the following: If a user selects Account 1 on an entry form, he or she will be able to select 					only Subaccount K, Subaccount L, or Subaccount M in a box with subaccounts. The 					subaccounts included in Group 2 will be hidden from the list. If the user selects Account 2, he or she will see Subaccount P, Subaccount Q, 					and Subaccount R in the box with subaccounts; the user will not see Subaccount 					K, Subaccount L, and Subaccount M. If you are using restriction groups to             control the accounts and subaccounts that can be used together, you must create at least             two groups and include all subaccounts in either of the groups. For example, suppose             that you need to restrict visibility of subaccounts for only one account. To solve this             task, you create two restriction groups. In the first group with direct restriction, you             include a GL account and the list of subaccounts that should be related to this account.             In the second group with inverse restriction, you include the same account and             subaccounts that should not be displayed after users select this account. As a result,             when users select the account on a form, they will see only one of the subaccounts             included in the first group. Types of Restriction Groups  Acumatica ERP provides two basic types of restriction groups—A and B. Restriction groups of 				both types can limit the visibility of system entities in a direct way (types 					 A  and  B ) and an inverse way (types  A Inverse  and  B 					Inverse  in the  Acumatica ERP user interface). The differences between  A  and  B  and between  A 					Inverse  and  B Inverse  are in how these groups work if the same entity 				is added to multiple groups. For detailed descriptions of each group type, see  Types of Restriction Groups. Combinations of Restriction-Group Entities  Acumatica ERP supports a variety of scenarios of configuring the visibility of entities within                 the system. With the most common scenarios, you can create restriction groups that                 include the following system entities: Users and General Ledger (GL) accounts: With these restriction groups, if your                     organization has sensitive GL accounts, you can make these accounts visible to a                     limited number of employees. For details, see  Account and Subaccount Security. Users and subaccounts: As with groups that include users and GL accounts, you                     can limit the visibility of sensitive subaccounts to employees. For more                     information, see  Account and Subaccount Security. For performance reasons, visibility restrictions by             user for subaccounts do not affect analytical (ARM) and form-based reports or general             inquiries. This means that users who can view the reports and general inquiries that             include subaccounts will see the full list of subaccounts. Users and vendor accounts: You can define these restriction groups to make                     particular vendors visible in the system to only employees who work with these                     vendors. For details, see  Vendor Security. Users and customer accounts: With these restriction groups, you can make                     particular customers visible to only employees who work with these customers.                     For details, see  Customer Security. Users and GL budget articles: With these restriction groups, you can limit the                     visibility of sensitive budget articles so that only particular users can see                     and work with these articles. For more information, see  Security of GL Budget Articles. Users and warehouses: You can create restriction groups to display a particular                     warehouse (or set of warehouses) for only employees who work with this warehouse                     (or this set of warehouses). For details, see  Warehouse Security. Users and inventory items: You can define these restriction groups to reduce the                     number of items in the lists with inventory items, depending on the particular                     employee signed in to the system. For more information, see  Inventory Item Security. Users and projects: You can define these restriction groups to configure the                     visibility of particular projects only to a responsible project team. For more                     information, see  Project Security. Users and printers: If the  DeviceHub  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features form (CS100000), you can define                     these restriction groups to configure the visibility of printers to particular                     users. For more information, see  To Configure Printer Access. Branches, GL accounts, and users: With these restriction groups, you can allow                     users to work with only branch-specific accounts. For details, see  Account and Subaccount Security. Branches, subaccounts, and users: You can set up these restriction groups so                     that the system displays to users only the branch-specific subaccounts. For more                     information, see  Account and Subaccount Security. Branches and cash accounts: If there are multiple branches in your organization,                     with these restriction groups, you can allow users in each branch to work with                     only branch-specific cash accounts. For details, see  Security of Cash Accounts. GL Accounts and Subaccounts: If you have subaccounts that employees must use                     only with particular GL accounts, by defining these restriction groups, you can                     set up lists of available subaccounts for each GL account.

Restriction groups in Acumatica ERP provide additional flexibility to the configuration of access rights for suites, modules, and forms. (For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Managing_User_Access_Mapref|Managing User Access].) You can use restriction groups when users should have access to a form, but on this form they are allowed to see one set of entities and are not allowed to see another set of entities. {br}

With different types of restriction groups, you can configure simple and complicated rules of visibility for entities. In this topic, you will find descriptions of the types of restriction groups, the differences between the types, and usage examples.((({S:Warn}In this topic, the restriction groups in the examples contain users and entities, but the same principles apply to groups that contain only entities. 
When you add users and entities to a group, the system restricts the visibility of the entities to the users. When you add entities of two different types to the group and don&rsquo;t add users, these entities can be used only with one another when users select values of the entities on forms. For example, if you add a GL account and subaccounts to the group, and a user selects the included account on a form, only the included subaccounts are available for selection.
))){br}{TOC}
==Types of Restriction Groups==
 Acumatica ERP provides two basic types of restriction groups—A and B. Restriction groups of both types can limit the visibility of system entities in a direct way (types ''A'' and ''B'') and an inverse way (types ''A Inverse'' and ''B Inverse''). The differences between ''A'' and ''B'' and between ''A Inverse'' and ''B Inverse'' are in how these groups work if the same entity is added to multiple groups. For detailed descriptions of each group type, see [[#_ecbb9908-440a-4b11-a163-3d54838b8b85|Descriptions of Types of Restriction Groups].{br}

You use groups of types ''A'' or ''B''—groups with direct restriction—when you need to make entities visible to users within the group. (For groups with only entities, the direct restriction group includes entities that must be used together.) The following diagram shows how groups with direct restriction work. In the diagram, you can see four users (for example, accountants) and six entities (for example, GL accounts). Initially, all users can see all accounts. Group 1 is defined to include Users С and D and Accounts 1, 2, and 3. These accounts are visible to Users С and D and hidden from Users Y and Z. Group 2 is defined to include Accounts 4, 5, and 6 and Users Y and Z. Users Y and Z can see Accounts 4, 5, and 6, and Users С and D cannot see these accounts.[anchor|#_a4e5a847-c1bc-45bb-8aa2-bc9e2d4067ee][anchor|#_7d1be201-56ee-44d0-bc93-ccb2063953a0][image:UserGuide/Images/RestrictionGroups_Direct_Restriction.png|popup|Example of groups with direct restriction|450px]{br}

You use groups of types ''A Inverse'' or ''B Inverse''—groups with inverse restriction—when you need to hide entities from a small number of users. (For groups without users, an inverse restriction group includes entities that may not be used together.) See the following diagram, which illustrates how groups with an inverse restriction work. Group 1 is defined to include Users С and D and Accounts 1, 2, and 3. Accounts 1, 2, and 3 become invisible to Users С and D and remain visible to users Y and Z. Group 2 is defined to include Accounts 4, 5, and 6 and Users Y and Z. This hides Accounts 4, 5, and 6 from Users Y and Z, but Users С and D still can see these accounts. The final visibility for groups with inverse restriction is the opposite of the final visibility for groups with direct restriction.[anchor|#_23b4deb5-bb1b-4939-ab33-8f2da9a2a060][anchor|#_756c9045-792a-45f2-9bdc-3040e5adf0b0][image:UserGuide/Images/RestrictionGroups_Inverse_Restriction.png|popup|Example of groups with inverse restriction|450px]{br}

For more examples of using restriction groups of all types, see [[#_2c295d9e-d1c4-45d7-bc03-2ce9f3360a0f|Usage Example 1], [[#_13a4a93a-3489-441d-aa68-106a175a8618|Usage Example 2], and [[#_6c0e0845-aab1-4959-bcfd-aca68aeeac84|Usage Example 3].{br}

The following table summarizes the types of restriction groups and describes how the visibility of entities is affected if a particular entity belongs to multiple groups of the type.[anchor|#_ecbb9908-440a-4b11-a163-3d54838b8b85]

==Usage Example 1==
'''Problem statement:''' Suppose that as a system administrator, you have to configure the visibility of accounts to the appropriate users considering the following:[anchor|#_5f2e8d99-77c0-4715-9cfd-46749aa300b1]
*There are four accountants in your organization: User C, User D, User Y, and User Z.
*User M is the accounting manager who controls work of the accounting department.
*There are six accounts in the General Ledger module: Account 1, Account 2, Account 3, Account 4, Account 5, and Account 6.
*Users C and D are allowed to see Accounts 1, 2, and 3.
*Users Y and Z are allowed to see Accounts 4, 5, and 6.
*User M is allowed to see all accounts.

So Accounts 1, 2, and 3 should be visible to Users C, D, and M (and should be hidden from all other users), and Accounts 4, 5, and 6 should be visible to Users Y, Z, and M (and should be hidden from all other users).{br}

You can use either of two solutions (described below) to configure the visibility of accounts to users.{br}

'''Solution 1:''' To address the problem of Usage Example 1, you can create three restriction groups of type ''A''—Group 1, Group 2, and Group 3 (see the diagram below, including the user visibility shown in ''Final Visibility (Group Type A)''):[anchor|#_888d274b-682a-4c0a-8c97-ccf1f9928140]
*Group 1: In this group, you include Accounts 1, 2, and 3 and Users C and D.
*Group 2: In this group, you include Accounts 4, 5, and 6 and Users Y and Z.
*Group 3: In this group, you include User M and all six accounts.
((({S:Warn}If you were to use groups of type ''B'' instead of type ''A'', all accounts would be hidden from the users included in Groups 1, 2, and 3. See ''Final Visibility (Group Type B)'' in the diagram below. (To make this approach work with groups of type ''B'', you would need to include User M in Groups 1, 2, and 3.)
)))[anchor|#_8a7e96ae-699f-44a9-8681-0876c94e5d60][anchor|#_abaf060c-7240-4a27-841d-6bd968c5c51c][image:UserGuide/Images/RestrictionGroups_Example1_1.png|popup|Example of groups with direct restriction and intersecting entities|450px]
'''Solution 2:''' As a second way to address the problem of Usage Example 1, you can create two restriction groups of type ''A'' or ''B''—Group 1 and Group 2 (see the following diagram):[anchor|#_ba289b5d-e3c6-4724-bd63-f69a1d2f1834]
*Group 1: In this group, you include Accounts 1, 2, and 3 and Users C and D.
*Group 2: In this group, you include Accounts 4, 5, and 6 and Users Y and Z.
*You include User M in both groups.

==Usage Example 2==
'''Problem statement:''' Suppose that as a system administrator, you have to configure the visibility of accounts to the appropriate users considering the following:[anchor|#_caf1124d-9300-40e6-824e-c49996bb0013]
*There are four accountants: User C, User D, User Y, and User Z.
*There are six accounts in the General Ledger module: Account 1, Account 2, Account 3, Account 4, Account 5, and Account 6.
*User Y works with only one sensitive account, Account 1; User Y is not allowed to see the following accounts: Account 2, Account 3, Account 4, Account 5, and Account 6.
*The other accountants work with all accounts except Account 1.
*Only accountants have access to the Finance suite. (Thus, there is no need to hide accounts from other system users.)

'''Solution:''' To address the problem of Usage Example 2, you can create two restriction groups—Group 1 of type ''A'' or ''B'', and Group 2 of type ''A Inverse'' or ''B Inverse''. (If you select type ''A'' for Group 1, you should select type ''A Inverse'' for Group 2. If you select type ''B'' for Group 1, you should select type ''B Inverse'' for Group 2.) These groups are defined as follows:[anchor|#_cd1dea4e-3b82-4c36-b1da-d4f8322d5295]
*Group 1: In this group, you include User Y and Account 1. (Other users will not see Account 1.)
*Group 2: In this group, you include User Y and Accounts 2 to 6. (User Y will not see these accounts.)

The following diagram illustrates the proposed solution.[anchor|#_16a05c24-ea76-4f51-99a3-181717ab63c7][anchor|#_7c2223a3-d1f1-4bc7-98b7-cf94f7af3c29][image:UserGuide/Images/RestrictionGroups_Example2.png|popup|Example of combined use of groups with direct and inverse restriction|450px][anchor|#_6c0e0845-aab1-4959-bcfd-aca68aeeac84]
==Usage Example 3==
'''Problem statement:''' Suppose that as a system administrator, you have to configure the visibility of accounts to the appropriate users considering the following:[anchor|#_3e722326-ddd4-405d-a1a2-6583494ab948]
*There are four accountants in your organization: User C, User D, User Y, and User Z.
*There are six accounts in the General Ledger module of your organization: Account 1, Account 2, Account 3, Account 4, Account 5, and Account 6.
*Users С and D should work with all six accounts.
*User Y should work with Accounts 1, 2, and 3 but is not allowed to see Accounts 4, 5, and 6.
*User Z is a junior accountant, so this user is not allowed to see the accounts.

You can use either of two solutions (described below) to configure the visibility of accounts to users.{br}

'''Solution 1:''' To address the problem of Usage Example 3, you can create two groups of type ''B Inverse''—Group 1 and Group 2 (shown in the diagram below, with the user visibility shown in ''Final Visibility (Group Type B Inverse)''):[anchor|#_4b45f6c8-4de6-438c-8882-33838ec77a82]
*Group 1: In this group, you include User Y and Accounts 4, 5, and 6.

((({S:Warn} If you were to use groups of type ''A Inverse'' instead of ''B Inverse'' in this example, Accounts 4, 5, and 6 would be visible to all users because they are added in two restriction groups (see ''Final Visibility (Group Type A Inverse'') in the following diagram).

==Recommendations for Selecting the Restriction Group Type ==
As you decide which type of restriction group best meets your security needs, consider the following recommendations:[anchor|#_95604798-edd6-4027-a103-1082e9ab6ef0]
*When you create multiple groups with entities of the same combination of types (for example, suppose that you have two restriction groups that include users and customers), use groups of the same basic type (either A or B). (Otherwise, if you were to add the same entity to multiple groups of different types, the result may not be what you expect.)
*To configure the required visibility of entities, you can combine direct and inverse restriction groups of the same basic type (either A or B), as was done in the solution of [[#_13a4a93a-3489-441d-aa68-106a175a8618|Usage Example 2]. Thus, you can combine groups of types ''A'' and ''A Inverse'', and groups of types ''B'' and ''B Inverse''.
*If you want to hide particular entities from the majority of users, include the entities and the users who should see the entities in a group with direct restriction (type ''A'' or ''B'').
*If you want to hide particular entities from a small number of users, add the entities and the users who shouldn&rsquo;t see the entities to a group with inverse restriction (type ''A Inverse'' or ''B Inverse'').

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Types of Restriction Groups Restriction groups in  Acumatica ERP provide additional flexibility to the configuration of access rights for suites, modules,         and forms. (For details, see  Managing User Access.) You can use restriction         groups when users should have access to a form, but on this form they are allowed to see one         set of entities and are not allowed to see another set of entities.  With different types of restriction groups, you can configure simple and complicated rules         of visibility for entities. In this topic, you will find descriptions of the types of         restriction groups, the differences between the types, and usage examples. In this topic, the restriction groups in the examples contain users and entities, but         the same principles apply to groups that contain only entities.  When you add users and           entities to a group, the system restricts the visibility of the entities to the users.           When you add entities of two different types to the group and don't add users, these           entities can be used only with one another when users select values of the entities on           forms. For example, if you add a GL account and subaccounts to the group, and a user           selects the included account on a form, only the included subaccounts are available for           selection. Types of Restriction Groups  Acumatica ERP provides two basic types of restriction groups—A and B. Restriction groups of both types         can limit the visibility of system entities in a direct way (types  A  and  B )         and an inverse way (types  A Inverse  and  B Inverse ). The differences between            A  and  B  and between  A Inverse  and  B Inverse  are in how these         groups work if the same entity is added to multiple groups. For detailed descriptions of         each group type, see  Descriptions of Types of Restriction Groups Descriptions of Types of Restriction Groups. You use groups of types  A  or  B —groups with direct restriction—when you need         to make entities visible to users within the group. (For groups with only entities, the         direct restriction group includes entities that must be used together.) The following         diagram shows how groups with direct restriction work. In the diagram, you can see four         users (for example, accountants) and six entities (for example, GL accounts). Initially, all         users can see all accounts. Group 1 is defined to include Users С and D and Accounts 1, 2,         and 3. These accounts are visible to Users С and D and hidden from Users Y and Z. Group 2 is         defined to include Accounts 4, 5, and 6 and Users Y and Z. Users Y and Z can see Accounts 4,         5, and 6, and Users С and D cannot see these accounts. Example of groups with direct restriction You use groups of types  A Inverse  or  B Inverse —groups with inverse         restriction—when you need to hide entities from a small number of users. (For groups without         users, an inverse restriction group includes entities that may not be used together.) See         the following diagram, which illustrates how groups with an inverse restriction work. Group         1 is defined to include Users С and D and Accounts 1, 2, and 3. Accounts 1, 2, and 3 become         invisible to Users С and D and remain visible to users Y and Z. Group 2 is defined to         include Accounts 4, 5, and 6 and Users Y and Z. This hides Accounts 4, 5, and 6 from Users Y         and Z, but Users С and D still can see these accounts. The final visibility for groups with         inverse restriction is the opposite of the final visibility for groups with direct           restriction. Example of groups with inverse restriction For more examples of using restriction groups of all types, see  Usage Example 1 Usage Example 1,  Usage Example 2 Usage Example 2, and  Usage Example 3 Usage Example 3. The following table summarizes the types of restriction groups and describes how the         visibility of entities is affected if a particular entity belongs to multiple groups of the         type. Descriptions of Types of Restriction Groups Group Type Restriction Description A Direct Makes entities included in the group visible to users who are also included in                   the group. Other users cannot view these entities. When a particular entity belongs to multiple groups of type  A , if you want                   a user to see this entity in the system, you add the user to at least one of these                   groups. A Inverse Inverse Hides the entities included in the group from users who are also included in the                   group. Users who are not assigned to this group can view and use the entities. When a particular entity belongs to multiple groups of type  A Inverse , if                   you don't want a user to see this entity, you must include this user in each of                   these groups. If you include the user in only one of the groups, he or she will                   see the entity in the system. B Direct Makes entities included in the group visible to users who are also included in                   the group. Other users cannot view these entities. When a particular entity belongs to multiple groups of type  B , if you want                   a user to see this entity in the system, you need to include this user in each of                   these groups. B Inverse Inverse Hides the entities included in the group from users who are also included in the                   group. Users who are not assigned to this group can view and use the entities. When a particular entity belongs to multiple groups of type  B Inverse , if                   you don't want a user to see this entity in the system, you include the user in at                   least one of these groups. Usage Example 1 Problem statement:  Suppose that as a system administrator, you have to configure the         visibility of accounts to the appropriate users considering the following: There are four accountants in your organization: User C, User D, User Y, and User           Z. User M is the accounting manager who controls work of the accounting department. There are six accounts in the General Ledger module: Account 1, Account 2, Account 3,           Account 4, Account 5, and Account 6. Users C and D are allowed to see Accounts 1, 2, and 3. Users Y and Z are allowed to see Accounts 4, 5, and 6. User M is allowed to see all accounts. So Accounts 1, 2, and 3 should be visible to Users C, D, and M (and should be hidden from         all other users), and Accounts 4, 5, and 6 should be visible to Users Y, Z, and M (and         should be hidden from all other users). You can use either of two solutions (described below) to configure the visibility of         accounts to users. Solution 1:  To address the problem of Usage Example 1, you can create three         restriction groups of type  A —Group 1, Group 2, and Group 3 (see the diagram         below, including the user visibility shown in  Final Visibility (Group Type A) ): Group 1: In this group, you include Accounts 1, 2, and 3 and Users C and D. Group 2: In this group, you include Accounts 4, 5, and 6 and Users Y and Z. Group 3: In this group, you include User M and all six accounts. If you were to use groups of type  B  instead of type  A , all accounts would         be hidden from the users included in Groups 1, 2, and 3. See  Final Visibility (Group Type           B)  in the diagram below. (To make this approach work with groups of type  B , you         would need to include User M in Groups 1, 2, and 3.) Example of groups with direct restriction and intersecting entities Solution 2:  As a second way to address the problem of Usage Example 1, you can         create two restriction groups of type  A  or  B —Group 1 and Group 2 (see         the following diagram): Group 1: In this group, you include Accounts 1, 2, and 3 and Users C and D. Group 2: In this group, you include Accounts 4, 5, and 6 and Users Y and Z. You include User M in both groups. Example of groups with direct restriction and no intersecting entities Usage Example 2 Problem statement:  Suppose that as a system administrator, you have to configure the         visibility of accounts to the appropriate users considering the following: There are four accountants: User C, User D, User Y, and User Z. There are six accounts in the General Ledger module: Account 1, Account 2, Account 3,           Account 4, Account 5, and Account 6. User Y works with only one sensitive account, Account 1; User Y is not allowed to see           the following accounts: Account 2, Account 3, Account 4, Account 5, and Account 6. The other accountants work with all accounts except Account 1. Only accountants have access to the Finance suite. (Thus, there is no need to hide           accounts from other system users.) Solution:  To address the problem of Usage Example 2, you can create two restriction         groups—Group 1 of type  A  or  B , and Group 2 of type  A Inverse  or            B Inverse . (If you select type  A  for Group 1, you should select type  A           Inverse  for Group 2. If you select type  B  for Group 1, you should select type            B Inverse  for Group 2.) These groups are defined as follows: Group 1: In this group, you include User Y and Account 1. (Other users will not see           Account 1.) Group 2: In this group, you include User Y and Accounts 2 to 6. (User Y will not see           these accounts.) The following diagram illustrates the proposed solution. Example of combined use of groups with direct and inverse restriction Usage Example 3 Problem statement:  Suppose that as a system administrator, you have to configure the         visibility of  accounts to the appropriate users considering the following: There are four accountants in your organization: User C, User D, User Y, and User           Z. There are six accounts in the General Ledger module of your organization: Account 1,           Account 2, Account 3, Account 4, Account 5, and Account 6. Users С and D should work with all six accounts. User Y should work with Accounts 1, 2, and 3 but is not allowed to see Accounts 4, 5,           and 6. User Z is a junior accountant, so this user is not allowed to see the accounts. You can use either of two solutions (described below) to configure the visibility of         accounts to users. Solution 1:  To address the problem of Usage Example 3, you can create two groups of         type  B Inverse —Group 1 and Group 2 (shown in the diagram below, with the user         visibility shown in  Final Visibility (Group Type B Inverse) ): Group 1: In this group, you include User Y and Accounts 4, 5, and 6. Group 2: In this group, you add User Z and Accounts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  If you were to use groups of type  A Inverse  instead of  B Inverse  in this         example, Accounts 4, 5, and 6 would be visible to all users because they are added in two         restriction groups (see  Final Visibility (Group Type A Inverse ) in the following         diagram). Example of groups with inverse restriction and intersecting entities Solution 2:  As a second way to address the problem of Usage Example 3, you can         create two groups of the  A Inverse  or  B Inverse  type—Group 1 and Group         2: Group 1: In this group, you include User Z and Accounts 1, 2, and 3. Group 2: In this group, you include Users Y and Z and Accounts 4, 5, and 6. The following diagram illustrates Solution 2. Example of groups with an inverse restriction and no intersecting entities Recommendations for Selecting the Restriction Group Type  As you decide which type of restriction group best meets your security needs, consider the         following recommendations: When you create multiple groups with entities of the same combination of types (for           example, suppose that you have two restriction groups that include users and customers),           use groups of the same basic type (either A or B). (Otherwise, if you were to add the same           entity to multiple groups of different types, the result may not be what you expect.) To configure the required visibility of entities, you can combine direct and inverse           restriction groups of the same basic type (either A or B), as was done in the solution of              Usage Example 2 Usage Example 2. Thus, you can combine groups of types  A  and  A Inverse ,           and groups of types  B  and  B Inverse . If you want to hide particular entities from the majority of users, include the entities           and the users who should see the entities in a group with direct restriction (type              A  or  B ). If you want to hide particular entities from a small number of users, add the entities           and the users who shouldn't see the entities to a group with inverse restriction (type              A Inverse  or  B Inverse ). ]]></column>

The operations that you can perform with restriction groups (such as creating the groups, adding entities to a group, deleting entities from a group, and viewing group details) depend on the form. This topic describes the operations that you can perform with restriction groups.{br}{TOC}
==Creating a Restriction Group==
You create a restriction group to restrict the visibility of some system entities. You do the following:[anchor|#_d11170e0-ca32-4d1e-bd26-095c2af20979]
#You open one of the forms in the '''Manage''' node of the Row-Level Security module, which you can use to create restriction groups with the particular system entities you want to add. For the list of entities, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Overview_of_Restriction_Groups|Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP].
#You enter a group name that reflects what the group limits visibility to.
#You select the group type. For information about the types of restriction groups, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Types_of_Restriction_Groups|Types of Restriction Groups].
#If the group includes users, on the '''Users''' tab, you select the users that will be included in the group.
#On the tab with the list of entities, you select the values of the entity that should be included in the group. (For example, if the entity is warehouses, you select the particular warehouses you want to include in the group.) Repeat this step for each entity type that you want to include in the group.
#You save your changes.

==Deactivating a Restriction Group==
If you do not want to apply the restrictions of some group to the system entities included in the group, you do the following:[anchor|#_f0ab518f-4e15-4f09-88d4-5f05164f6b30]
#You open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_30|Restriction Groups] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201030|SM201030]) form.
#In the Selection area, you select the restriction group you want to edit. 
#You clear the '''Active''' check box.
#You save your changes.
#:Restrictions configured in the group are no longer applied to the entities.
[anchor|#_769aca82-01cf-49ce-8b23-342ac7eaef5b]
==Setting Up Default Restriction Groups for Vendor and Customer Classes==
To ease the addition of new vendors and customers to restriction groups, you can specify a default restriction group for a vendor or customer class, so that vendors and customers of the selected class will be included in the restriction group automatically.{br}

You specify a default restriction group for a vendor class by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_10_00|Vendor Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AP201000|AP201000]) form and for a customer class by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_10_00|Customer Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR201000|AR201000]) form. You perform the following steps to specify a default restriction group for a vendor class:[anchor|#_e36a1beb-440f-4b2e-9e3d-cafc90efeff2]
#In the '''Class ID''' box, you select the vendor class for which you want to specify the default restriction group.
#In the '''Default Restriction Group''' box of the '''Default General Settings''' section on the '''General Settings''' tab, you select the default restriction group that will be used for the selected vendor class.
#You click '''Actions''' > '''Include Vendors in Restriction Group''' to include all entities of the class in the default restriction group.
#You save your changes.

You perform similar steps on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_10_00|Customer Classes] form when you want to specify a default restriction group for a customer class.
==Removing Class Entities from a Default Restriction Group==
If you want to cancel the visibility restriction for entities of a vendor class, you can remove all class entities from a default restriction group as follows:[anchor|#_b33cce15-efa1-41ea-ba22-bd866f17d87e]
#You open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_10_00|Vendor Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AP201000|AP201000]) form.
#In the '''Default General Settings''' section on the '''General Settings''' tab, you clear the value in the '''Default Restriction Group''' box
#You click '''Actions''' > '''Include Vendors in Restriction Group'''.
#You save your changes.

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_10_00|Customer Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR201000|AR201000]) form, you can perform similar steps to remove customers of a class from the default restriction group.[anchor|#_5352f349-5e81-434f-9121-0ee8532d0797]
==Adding Entities to an Existing Restriction Group==
While addressing your everyday tasks, you may need to add users and entities to restriction groups that you have created and configured previously. For example, suppose that a new employee of your organization should use accounts with limited visibility, or that new inventory items have been added to the system and should be in a particular restriction group.{br}

When you need to add an entity to an existing group, you perform the following steps:[anchor|#_b250cd71-71bb-4cde-8f52-3611a09a15f7]
#In the '''Explore''' node of the Row-Level Security module, you open the form that displays restriction groups for the entity you want to add to the restriction group. For example, for a user, you open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_35|Restriction Groups by User] form.
#In the Selection area, you select the entity that you want to add to a restriction group. For example, in the '''Login''' box, you select ''Todd Bloom''.
#In the table with the list of restriction groups, you select the unlabeled Included check box for each group in which you want to include the selected entity.
#You save your changes.

After you have included the entity in the restriction groups, the system applies the visibility limitations to the entity.{br}

Similarly, you can remove entities from a restriction group by clearing the Included check box for this group.

This topic describes the operations that you can perform with         restriction groups. Creating a Restriction Group You create a restriction group to restrict the visibility of some system entities. You do         the following: You open one of the forms in the  Manage  node of the Row-Level           Security module, which you can use to create restriction groups with the particular system           entities you want to add. For the list of entities, see  Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP. You enter a group name that reflects what the group limits visibility to. You select the group type. For information about the types of restriction groups, see              Types of Restriction Groups. If the group includes users, on the  Users  tab, you select the           users that will be included in the group. On the tab with the list of entities, you select the values of the entity that should be           included in the group. (For example, if the entity is warehouses, you select the           particular warehouses you want to include in the group.) Repeat this step for each entity           type that you want to include in the group. You save your changes. Deactivating a Restriction Group If you do not want to apply the restrictions of some group to the system entities included in         the group, you do the following: You open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201030|SM201030]) Restriction Groups (SM201030) form. In the Selection area, you select the restriction group you want to edit.  You clear the  Active  check box. You save your changes. Restrictions configured in the group are no longer applied to             the entities. Setting Up Default Restriction Groups for Vendor and Customer Classes To ease the addition of new vendors and customers to restriction groups, you can specify a         default restriction group for a vendor or customer class, so that vendors and customers of         the selected class will be included in the restriction group automatically. You specify a default restriction group for a vendor class by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP201000|AP201000]) Vendor Classes (AP201000) form and for a customer class by         using the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR201000|AR201000]) Customer Classes (AR201000) form. You perform the         following steps to specify a default restriction group for a vendor class: In the  Class ID  box, you select the vendor class for which you           want to specify the default restriction group. In the  Default Restriction Group  box of the  Default             General Settings  section on the  General Settings  tab,           you select the default restriction group that will be used for the selected vendor           class. You click  Actions Include Vendors in Restriction Group  to include all entities of the class in the default restriction group. You save your changes. You perform similar steps on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR201000|AR201000]) Customer Classes form when         you want to specify a default restriction group for a customer class. Removing Class Entities from a Default Restriction Group If you want to cancel the visibility restriction for entities of a vendor class, you can         remove all class entities from a default restriction group as follows: You open the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP201000|AP201000]) Vendor Classes (AP201000) form. In the  Default General Settings  section on the  General             Settings  tab, you clear the value in the  Default Restriction             Group  box You click  Actions Include Vendors in Restriction Group . You save your changes. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR201000|AR201000]) Customer Classes (AR201000) form, you can perform         similar steps to remove customers of a class from the default restriction group. Adding Entities to an Existing Restriction Group While addressing your everyday tasks, you may need to add users and entities to restriction         groups that you have created and configured previously. For example, suppose that a new         employee of your organization should use accounts with limited visibility, or that new         inventory items have been added to the system and should be in a particular restriction         group. When you need to add an entity to an existing group, you perform the following steps: In the  Explore  node of the Row-Level Security module, you open           the form that displays restriction groups for the entity you want to add to the           restriction group. For example, for a user, you open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201035|SM201035]) Restriction Groups by User           form. In the Selection area, you select the entity that you want to add to a restriction           group. For example, in the  Login  box, you select  Todd           Bloom . In the table with the list of restriction groups, you select the unlabeled Included           check box for each group in which you want to include the selected entity. You save your changes. After you have included the entity in the restriction groups, the system applies the         visibility limitations to the entity. Similarly, you can remove entities from a restriction group by clearing the Included check         box for this group.  ([~/?ScreenId=AR201000|AR201000])  ([~/?ScreenId=AR102000|AR102000])  ([~/?ScreenId=SM201030|SM201030])  ([~/?ScreenId=SM201035|SM201035])  ([~/?ScreenId=AP102000|AP102000])  ([~/?ScreenId=AP201000|AP201000]) ]]></column>

In Acumatica ERP, you can control which users will use particular General Ledger (GL) accounts and subaccounts.{br}

To configure the security of GL accounts and subaccounts, you can use a combination of user roles and restriction groups. By using user roles, you can configure the access of users to branches and to all branch-specific accounts and subaccounts. With restriction groups, you can set up the visibility of particular accounts and subaccounts within branches and for certain users, and you can limit the use of subaccounts with particular accounts. For details on restriction groups, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Overview_of_Restriction_Groups|Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP].[anchor|#_0247deaf-0d14-4e6e-81e4-de4d26980a5f]((({S:Warn}In Acumatica ERP, you can configure groups with direct and inverse restriction. In this topic, for simplicity, groups with direct restriction are used in examples. You can use inverse restriction groups in the same way as you use direct restriction groups. For details on the types of restriction groups, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Types_of_Restriction_Groups|Types of Restriction Groups].
)))
In this topic, you will read about using restriction groups and branch-specific roles to configure and manage the security of accounts and subaccounts.{br}{TOC}
==Usage Scenarios==
The most common scenarios of managing the security of accounts and subaccounts are the following:[anchor|#_688565fd-8159-41fe-855f-d04797271b20]
*Managing the visibility by branch: When your organization consists of multiple branches (and you have created multiple branches in Acumatica ERP), you can configure the system so that it narrows the lists of accounts and subaccounts by branch on data entry forms. For details, see [[#_f5f7e636-7b77-47f9-af08-8603b9b974bb|Visibility by Branch].
*:((({S:Warn}You can configure and use the restriction groups that include branches only if the ''Multi-Branch Support'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
)))
*Managing the visibility by user: If your organization has sensitive GL accounts and subaccounts, you can provide the visibility of these objects to only a limited set of users. For more information, see [[#_c30589e8-94fe-4203-ba5d-45fb5e286fa5|Visibility by User].
*:((({S:Warn}For performance reasons, visibility restrictions by user for subaccounts do not affect analytical (ARM) and form-based reports or general inquiries. This means that users who can view the reports and general inquiries that include subaccounts will see the full list of subaccounts.
)))
*Managing the visibility of subaccounts by account: If you have subaccounts that users must use with only particular GL accounts, you can set up lists of available subaccounts for each GL account. For details, see [[#_85625a34-0be7-45c0-895d-1c4978be46f8|Visibility of Subaccounts by Account].
*Adding the needed objects to one restriction group to control visibility by multiple factors: For example, if you need to limit the users who use sensitive accounts, and only particular subaccounts must be used with these sensitive accounts, you can configure restriction groups to address this task. For details, see [[#_e4e7f09a-ac95-4542-88cc-36763dc94c8c|Visibility of Accounts, Subaccounts, and Users].
[anchor|#_66cae873-959e-4e2a-86bc-41faf385b7f0]((({S:Warn}If the ''By Segment: All Avail. Segment Values'' lookup mode is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form for the ''SUBACCOUNT'' segmented key (that is, if the users of your Acumatica ERP instance enter subaccounts by segments on forms), you manage the security of subaccount segments instead of entire subaccounts. In this case, you need to add to a restriction group all subaccount segments that form a subaccount whose visibility should be restricted.
)))
Cash accounts are one type of sensitive accounts that you may need to secure in the system. The ways of managing the security of cash accounts differ from the ways of managing the security of GL accounts. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Financials\CA__CON_Access_to_CashAccounts|Security of Cash Accounts ].[anchor|#_f5f7e636-7b77-47f9-af08-8603b9b974bb]
==Visibility by Branch==
If your organization has users who have access to multiple branches, you can use restriction groups to narrow the lists of accounts and subaccounts on data entry forms by branch. With restriction groups set up in this way, users will make fewer mistakes when selecting accounts and subaccounts on data entry forms.{br}

For example, suppose that your organization has two branches—the Headquarters office (''HQ'' in the system) and the Regional Sales office (''RS''). The accounting department processes documents for both branches. To configure the visibility restrictions of accounts and subaccounts by branch, you need to do the following:[anchor|#_b85c21ec-f0c1-4c29-ab6b-e160213c81a8]
#You configure user roles for each branch (for example, ''Branch HQ'' and ''Branch RS'') and assign both roles to the user accounts of the accountants. With the roles assigned, the accountants will see information for both branches in Acumatica ERP. For details, see [HelpRoot_Organization\CS__con_Branch_Security_Administration|Security of Organization Branches].
#To configure the visibility of accounts within branches, you do the following on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_10_30_40|GL Accounts by Branch Access] ([~/?ScreenId=GL103040|GL103040]) form:
##You create two restriction groups of type ''A'' (with direct restriction): the ''HQ Accounts'' group for the Headquarters office and the ''RS Accounts'' group for the Regional Sales office.
##In the ''HQ Accounts'' group, you include the Headquarters branch (''HQ'') and the accounts that should be visible within the ''HQ'' branch.
##In the ''RS Accounts'' group, you include the Regional Sales branch (''RS'') and the accounts specific to the ''RS'' branch.
#To configure the visibility of subaccounts within branches, you do the following on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_10_30_60|Subaccounts by Branch Access] ([~/?ScreenId=GL103060|GL103060]) form:
##You create two restriction groups of type ''A'' (with direct restriction): the ''HQ Subaccounts'' group for the Headquarters office and the ''RS Subaccounts'' group for the Regional Sales office.
##In the ''HQ Subaccounts'' group, you include the ''HQ'' branch and the subaccounts that should be visible within this branch.
##In the ''RS Subaccounts'' group, you include the ''RS'' branch and the subaccounts specific to this branch.

After you have configured restriction groups for accounts and branches, or subaccounts and branches, the system will narrow the lists of accounts or the list of subaccounts on data entry forms after a user selects a branch. For example, suppose that an accountant is adding a bill on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form and selects the ''HQ'' branch in the '''Branch''' column of the '''Document Details''' tab. In the '''Account''' column of the same tab, the accountant will see only accounts added to the ''HQ Accounts'' restriction group.[anchor|#_c30589e8-94fe-4203-ba5d-45fb5e286fa5]
==Visibility by User==
Within branches, your organization may have sensitive or confidential accounts and subaccounts which must be invisible for majority of users. You can control the visibility of these accounts and subaccounts for users (that is, which users can view the accounts and subaccounts) by using restriction groups.{br}

For example, suppose that only a chief accountant of your organization can work with the tax payable account. To make this account visible to the chief accountant only, you need to do the following on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_10_40_00|GL Account Access] ([~/?ScreenId=GL104000|GL104000]) form:[anchor|#_abe58501-3664-4e26-b806-f36c7bc89f70]
#You create a restriction group (for example, ''Access to Tax Payable Account'') with direct restriction.
#You add to the group the user account of the chief accountant.
#You add to the group the tax account.

As another example, suppose that the subaccount for the financial department can be used only by accountants (and not by other users). To make this subaccount visible to only accountants, you need to do the following on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_10_40_00|GL Account Access] form:[anchor|#_59d432e6-12ac-49fa-a3de-cb03c2876eae]
#You create a restriction group (for example, ''Access to Financial Subaccount'') with direct restriction.
#You add to the group the user accounts of the accountants.
#You add to the group the subaccount for the financial department.
[anchor|#_85625a34-0be7-45c0-895d-1c4978be46f8]
==Visibility of Subaccounts by Account==
You can specify which subaccounts can be used with only a particular account on forms in Acumatica ERP; thus, the specified subaccounts will appear for selection only if that account is selected. This limitation will help users to avoid errors when they select accounts and subaccounts on forms.[anchor|#_889c87e6-e7f3-49aa-9ec4-03377d071290]((({S:Warn}If you are using restriction groups to control the accounts and subaccounts that can be used together, you must create at least two groups and include all subaccounts in either of the groups. For example, suppose that you need to restrict visibility of subaccounts for only one account. To solve this task, you create two restriction groups. In the first group with direct restriction, you include a GL account and the list of subaccounts that should be related to this account. In the second group with inverse restriction, you include the same account and subaccounts that should not be displayed after users select this account. As a result, when users select the account on a form, they will see only one of the subaccounts included in the first group.
))){br}

For example, suppose that the ''ELE-000'' subaccount, which is used for electronics and computers, should be visible only after a user has selected the ''12100'' warehouse account, and the ''NSS-000'' subaccount should be related to the ''12200'' warehouse account. To restrict the visibility of the subaccounts by account, you should create the following restriction groups on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_10_40_00|GL Account Access] ([~/?ScreenId=GL104000|GL104000]) form:[anchor|#_297e4a2a-df76-4655-87a8-873a439b1145]
#''Stock Item Subaccounts'': In this group, you need to include the ''12100'' warehouse account and the ''ELE-000'' subaccount.
#''Non-Stock Item Subaccounts'': To this group, you should add the ''12200'' warehouse account and the ''NSS-000'' subaccount.
[anchor|#_e4e7f09a-ac95-4542-88cc-36763dc94c8c]
==Visibility of Accounts, Subaccounts, and Users==
By using restriction groups, you can combine the functionality of the following scenarios:[anchor|#_f876fa46-58a7-4ca1-ba10-77f8bae45bdd]
*Managing the visibility of accounts to users
*Managing the visibility of subaccounts by account

To implement this functionality, you need to add users, accounts, and subaccounts (or subaccount segments) to the same group. In this case, the visibility will be restricted as follows:[anchor|#_0be1d4b1-4f40-48bb-a52e-0cfd8d47b888]
*Only users included in the restriction group will see the accounts and subaccounts added to the group.
*If a user included in the group selects an account in the group when processing a document, he or she will be able to select a subaccount from the list of only subaccounts added to the group.

For example, suppose that the ''ELE-000'' (electronics and computers) and ''FUR-000'' (furniture) subaccounts should be visible only if a user has selected the ''12100'' warehouse account, and that only the warehouse workers User Y and User Z should work with these accounts and subaccounts. To restrict the visibility of the ''ELE-000'' and ''FUR-000'' subaccount by the ''12100'' account and to make the account and the subaccounts visible to only User Y and User Z, you should do the following on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_10_40_00|GL Account Access] ([~/?ScreenId=GL104000|GL104000]) form:[anchor|#_8336802f-f6d0-4e7c-bd9c-2b56ad1ce47a]
#You create a restriction group (for example, ''Restriction of Warehouse Accounts'').
#You add to the group the ''12100'' warehouse account.
#You add to the group the ''ELE-000'' and ''FUR-000'' subaccounts.
#You add to the group User Y and User Z.

==Forms for Account and Subaccount Security==
In the following table, you can find the list of forms that you can use to manage restriction groups with accounts, subaccounts, and subaccount segments, and tasks that you can resolve by using each form.[anchor|#_bfa28e88-8b0e-4ca9-9d70-47eee41c93a7]

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Account and Subaccount Security In  Acumatica ERP, you can control which users will use particular General Ledger (GL) accounts                     and subaccounts. To configure the security of GL accounts and subaccounts, you can use a                     combination of user roles and restriction groups. By using user roles, you can                     configure the access of users to branches and to all branch-specific accounts                     and subaccounts. With restriction groups, you can set up the visibility of                     particular accounts and subaccounts within branches and for certain users, and                     you can limit the use of subaccounts with particular accounts. For details on                     restriction groups, see  Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP. In  Acumatica ERP,             you can configure groups with direct and inverse restriction. In this topic, for             simplicity, groups with direct restriction are used in examples. You can use inverse             restriction groups in the same way as you use direct restriction groups. For details on             the types of restriction groups, see  Types of Restriction Groups. In this topic, you will read about using restriction groups and branch-specific                     roles to configure and manage the security of accounts and subaccounts. Usage Scenarios The most common scenarios of managing the security of accounts and subaccounts                     are the following: Managing the visibility by branch: When your organization consists of                         multiple branches (and you have created multiple branches in  Acumatica ERP), you can configure the system so that it narrows the lists of accounts                         and subaccounts by branch on data entry forms. For details, see  Visibility by Branch Visibility by Branch. You can configure and use the restriction groups                             that include branches only if the  Multi-Branch Support  feature is                             enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features                             (CS100000) form. Managing the visibility by user: If your organization has sensitive GL                         accounts and subaccounts, you can provide the visibility of these objects to                         only a limited set of users. For more information, see  Visibility by User Visibility by User. For performance reasons, visibility restrictions by             user for subaccounts do not affect analytical (ARM) and form-based reports or general             inquiries. This means that users who can view the reports and general inquiries that             include subaccounts will see the full list of subaccounts. Managing the visibility of subaccounts by account: If you have subaccounts                         that users must use with only particular GL accounts, you can set up lists                         of available subaccounts for each GL account. For details, see  Visibility of Subaccounts by Account Visibility of Subaccounts by Account. Adding the needed objects to one restriction group to control visibility by                         multiple factors: For example, if you need to limit the users who use                         sensitive accounts, and only particular subaccounts must be used with these                         sensitive accounts, you can configure restriction groups to address this                         task. For details, see  Visibility of Accounts, Subaccounts, and Users Visibility of Accounts, Subaccounts, and Users. If the  By Segment: All Avail. Segment Values              lookup mode is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) Segmented Keys             (CS202000) form for the  SUBACCOUNT  segmented key (that is, if the users of             your  Acumatica ERP             instance enter subaccounts by segments on forms), you manage the security of subaccount             segments instead of entire subaccounts. In this case, you need to add to a restriction             group all subaccount segments that form a subaccount whose visibility should be             restricted. Cash accounts are one type of sensitive accounts that you may need to secure in                     the system. The ways of managing the security of cash accounts differ from the                     ways of managing the security of GL accounts. For more information, see  Security of Cash Accounts . Visibility by Branch If your organization has users who have access to multiple branches, you can use                     restriction groups to narrow the lists of accounts and subaccounts on data entry                     forms by branch. With restriction groups set up in this way, users will make                     fewer mistakes when selecting accounts and subaccounts on data entry forms. For example, suppose that your organization has two branches—the Headquarters                     office ( HQ  in the system) and the Regional Sales office ( RS ). The                     accounting department processes documents for both branches. To configure the                     visibility restrictions of accounts and subaccounts by branch, you need to do                     the following: You configure user roles for each branch (for example,  Branch HQ  and                              Branch RS ) and assign both roles to the user accounts of the                         accountants. With the roles assigned, the accountants will see information                         for both branches in  Acumatica ERP. For details, see  Security of Organization Branches. To configure the visibility of accounts within branches, you do the                         following on the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL103040|GL103040]) GL Accounts by Branch Access (GL103040)                             form: You create two restriction groups of type  A  (with direct                                 restriction): the  HQ Accounts  group for the Headquarters                                 office and the  RS Accounts  group for the Regional Sales                                 office. In the  HQ Accounts  group, you include the Headquarters branch                                     ( HQ ) and the accounts that should be visible within the                                      HQ  branch. In the  RS Accounts  group, you include the Regional Sales                                 branch ( RS ) and the accounts specific to the  RS                                  branch. To configure the visibility of subaccounts within branches, you do the                         following on the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL103060|GL103060]) Subaccounts by Branch Access (GL103060)                             form: You create two restriction groups of type  A  (with direct                                 restriction): the  HQ Subaccounts  group for the Headquarters                                 office and the  RS Subaccounts  group for the Regional Sales                                 office. In the  HQ Subaccounts  group, you include the  HQ  branch                                 and the subaccounts that should be visible within this branch. In the  RS Subaccounts  group, you include the  RS  branch                                 and the subaccounts specific to this branch. After you have configured restriction groups for accounts and branches, or                     subaccounts and branches, the system will narrow the lists of accounts or the                     list of subaccounts on data entry forms after a user selects a branch. For                     example, suppose that an accountant is adding a bill on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form and selects the                          HQ  branch in the  Branch  column of the                          Document Details  tab. In the                          Account  column of the same tab, the accountant will                     see only accounts added to the  HQ Accounts  restriction group. Visibility by User Within branches, your organization may have sensitive or confidential accounts                     and subaccounts which must be invisible for majority of users. You can control                     the visibility of these accounts and subaccounts for users (that is, which users                     can view the accounts and subaccounts) by using restriction groups. For example, suppose that only a chief accountant of your organization can work                     with the tax payable account. To make this account visible to the chief                     accountant only, you need to do the following on the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL104000|GL104000]) GL Account Access (GL104000) form: You create a restriction group (for example,  Access to Tax Payable                             Account ) with direct restriction. You add to the group the user account of the chief accountant. You add to the group the tax account. As another example, suppose that the subaccount for the financial department can                     be used only by accountants (and not by other users). To make this subaccount                     visible to only accountants, you need to do the following on the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL104000|GL104000]) GL Account Access form: You create a restriction group (for example,  Access to Financial                             Subaccount ) with direct restriction. You add to the group the user accounts of the accountants. You add to the group the subaccount for the financial department. Visibility of Subaccounts by Account You can specify which subaccounts can be used with only a particular account on                     forms in  Acumatica ERP; thus, the specified subaccounts will appear for selection only if that                     account is selected. This limitation will help users to avoid errors when they                     select accounts and subaccounts on forms. If you are using restriction groups to             control the accounts and subaccounts that can be used together, you must create at least             two groups and include all subaccounts in either of the groups. For example, suppose             that you need to restrict visibility of subaccounts for only one account. To solve this             task, you create two restriction groups. In the first group with direct restriction, you             include a GL account and the list of subaccounts that should be related to this account.             In the second group with inverse restriction, you include the same account and             subaccounts that should not be displayed after users select this account. As a result,             when users select the account on a form, they will see only one of the subaccounts             included in the first group. For example, suppose that the  ELE-000  subaccount, which is used for                     electronics and computers, should be visible only after a user has selected the                          12100  warehouse account, and the  NSS-000  subaccount should be                     related to the  12200  warehouse account. To restrict the visibility of the                     subaccounts by account, you should create the following restriction groups on                     the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL104000|GL104000]) GL Account Access (GL104000)                         form: Stock Item Subaccounts : In this group, you need to include the                                  12100  warehouse account and the  ELE-000                              subaccount. Non-Stock Item Subaccounts : To this group, you should add the                                  12200  warehouse account and the  NSS-000                              subaccount. Visibility of Accounts, Subaccounts, and Users By using restriction groups, you can combine the functionality of the following                     scenarios: Managing the visibility of accounts to users Managing the visibility of subaccounts by account To implement this functionality, you need to add users, accounts, and subaccounts                     (or subaccount segments) to the same group. In this case, the visibility will be                     restricted as follows: Only users included in the restriction group will see the accounts and                         subaccounts added to the group. If a user included in the group selects an account in the group when                         processing a document, he or she will be able to select a subaccount from                         the list of only subaccounts added to the group. For example, suppose that the  ELE-000  (electronics and computers) and                          FUR-000  (furniture) subaccounts should be visible only if a user has                     selected the  12100  warehouse account, and that only the warehouse workers                     User Y and User Z should work with these accounts and subaccounts. To restrict                     the visibility of the  ELE-000  and  FUR-000  subaccount by the                          12100  account and to make the account and the subaccounts visible to                     only User Y and User Z, you should do the following on the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL104000|GL104000]) GL Account Access (GL104000) form: You create a restriction group (for example,  Restriction of Warehouse                                 Accounts ). You add to the group the  12100  warehouse account. You add to the group the  ELE-000  and  FUR-000                              subaccounts. You add to the group User Y and User Z. Forms for Account and Subaccount Security In the following table, you can find the list of forms that you can use to manage                     restriction groups with accounts, subaccounts, and subaccount segments, and                     tasks that you can resolve by using each form.

Cash is a company&rsquo;s most liquid asset, which is why an organization must have adequate controls to secure it. In Acumatica ERP, you can control which users can view which particular cash accounts, as described in this topic.[anchor|#_a1171756-23c9-4812-a8db-95df4caef3b7]((({S:Warn}In Acumatica ERP, you can configure groups with direct and inverse restriction.

For details on the types of restriction groups, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Types_of_Restriction_Groups|Types of Restriction Groups].
))){br}{TOC}
==Usage Scenarios==
The most common scenarios of managing the security of cash accounts are the following:[anchor|#_7a3fea99-1cba-443b-bea2-eb223f75d8a6]
*Managing the visibility by branch: If your organization consists of multiple branches, you can allow users in each branch to work with only branch-specific cash accounts. For details, see [[#_ab2ece5a-cf95-41cf-bcc1-812a57201a4a|Visibility of Cash Accounts by Branch].
*:((({S:Warn}You can configure multiple branches only if the ''Multi-Branch Support'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. If the ''Multi-Branch Support'' feature is disabled, all cash accounts belong to a single branch and are visible to all users who are allowed to view the accounts, based on their membership in restriction groups.
)))
*Managing the visibility by user: If only a limited number of users can work with cash accounts, you can configure the visibility of the cash accounts to only these users. For more information, see [[#_093f0813-c50a-4bfd-a5f8-5ac63629f734|Visibility of Cash Accounts by User].
[anchor|#_ab2ece5a-cf95-41cf-bcc1-812a57201a4a]
==Visibility of Cash Accounts by Branch==
The visibility of a cash account can be restricted based on the branch the account belongs to. Consider a user who is allowed to view multiple branches due to this user&rsquo;s assigned branch roles. On the data entry forms, this user can view the cash accounts of all the branches this user is allowed to view, based on the branch selected in the '''Branch''' box of the data entry form (which is filled by default with the branch to which the user is currently signed in).{br}

To restrict the visibility of a cash account by the branch, you should do the following:[anchor|#_dc73163c-28a4-48c6-83ed-15d8e95cf8c6]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you enable the ''Inter-Branch Transactions'' feature, which gives you the ability to configure the automatic generation of inter-branch transactions for each document that involves multiple branches. With this feature enabled, the '''Restrict Visibility by Branch''' check box appears on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_20_00|Cash Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CA202000|CA202000]) form.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_20_00|Cash Accounts] form, you select a cash account, select the '''Restrict Visibility by Branch''' check box, and save your changes. You repeat this step for each cash account whose visibility you want to control. 
#:With this check box selected, the cash account is visible to only users who can select the branch (specified for the cash account) in the '''Branch''' box on the data entry forms. (If the '''Restrict Visibility by Branch''' check box is cleared for a cash account, this cash account will be visible regardless of the selected branch.)
#:((({S:Warn}If the '''Branch''' box is absent on a data entry form, then the visibility of the cash account is defined by the branch to which the user is currently signed in.
)))
#If you have a company with branches not requiring balancing (the ''Multi-Branch Support'' feature is enabled and the ''Inter-Branch Transactions'' feature is disabled), you can still control the visibility of cash accounts across branches by selecting or clearing the '''Restrict Visibility by Branch''' check box.

Alternatively, you can restrict access to cash accounts by using branch roles in the same way as for GL accounts. For details, see [HelpRoot_Financials\GL__con_Account_and_Subaccount_Security|Account and Subaccount Security].[anchor|#_093f0813-c50a-4bfd-a5f8-5ac63629f734]
==Visibility of Cash Accounts by User==
You can control the visibility of a specific cash account to users (that is, which users can view the account) with the help of restriction groups.{br}

For example, suppose that there is only one accountant in your organization and only this person should work with a cash account in the system. To restrict the visibility of the cash account, you should do the following on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_10_40_00|GL Account Access] ([~/?ScreenId=GL104000|GL104000]) form:[anchor|#_e7c6c426-b5e2-49b1-8b6c-9bada42ac0d3]
#You create a restriction group (for example, ''Access to Cash Account'') with direct restriction.
#You add to the group the user account of the accountant.
#You add to the group the GL account the cash account is linked to.
((({S:Hint}We recommend that you carefully design and configure restriction groups containing accounts, so that a user can view the accounts he or she needs for work. Otherwise, a user may encounter problems with processing transactions of the linked cash accounts.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Security of Cash Accounts Cash is a company's most liquid asset, which is why an organization must have                     adequate controls to secure it. In  Acumatica ERP, you can control which users can view which particular cash accounts, as                     described in this topic. In  Acumatica ERP,             you can configure groups with direct and inverse restriction. In this topic, for             simplicity, groups with direct restriction are used in examples. You can use inverse             restriction groups in the same way as you use direct restriction groups. For details on             the types of restriction groups, see  Types of Restriction Groups. Usage Scenarios The most common scenarios of managing the security of cash accounts are the                     following: Managing the visibility by branch: If your organization consists of multiple                         branches, you can allow users in each branch to work with only                         branch-specific cash accounts. For details, see  Visibility of Cash Accounts by Branch Visibility of Cash Accounts by Branch. You can configure multiple branches only if the                                  Multi-Branch Support  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. If the                                  Multi-Branch Support  feature is disabled, all cash accounts                             belong to a single branch and are visible to all users who are allowed                             to view the accounts, based on their membership in restriction                             groups. Managing the visibility by user: If only a limited number of users can work                         with cash accounts, you can configure the visibility of the cash accounts to                         only these users. For more information, see  Visibility of Cash Accounts by User Visibility of Cash Accounts by User. Visibility of Cash Accounts by Branch The visibility of a cash account can be restricted based on the branch the                     account belongs to. Consider a user who is allowed to view multiple branches due                     to this user's assigned branch roles. On the data entry forms, this user can                     view the cash accounts of all the branches this user is allowed to view, based                     on the branch selected in the  Branch  box of the data                     entry form (which is filled by default with the branch to which the user is                     currently signed in). To restrict the visibility of a cash account by the branch, you should do the                     following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, you                         enable the  Inter-Branch Transactions  feature, which gives you the                         ability to configure the automatic generation of inter-branch transactions                         for each document that involves multiple branches. With this feature                         enabled, the  Restrict Visibility by Branch  check box                         appears on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA202000|CA202000]) Cash Accounts (CA202000)                         form. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA202000|CA202000]) Cash Accounts form, you select a cash                         account, select the  Restrict Visibility by Branch                          check box, and save your changes. You repeat this step for each cash account                         whose visibility you want to control.  With this check box selected, the                             cash account is visible to only users who can select the branch                             (specified for the cash account) in the  Branch                              box on the data entry forms. (If the  Restrict Visibility by                                 Branch  check box is cleared for a cash account, this                             cash account will be visible regardless of the selected                             branch.) If the  Branch  box is absent on                             a data entry form, then the visibility of the cash account is defined by                             the branch to which the user is currently signed in. If you have a company with branches not requiring balancing (the                              Multi-Branch Support  feature is enabled and the  Inter-Branch                             Transactions  feature is disabled), you can still control the                         visibility of cash accounts across branches by selecting or clearing the                              Restrict Visibility by Branch  check box. Alternatively, you can restrict access to cash accounts by using branch roles in                     the same way as for GL accounts. For details, see  Account and Subaccount Security. Visibility of Cash Accounts by User You can control the visibility of a specific cash account to users (that is, which users can view                     the account) with the help of restriction groups. For example, suppose that there is only one accountant in your organization and only this person                     should work with a cash account in the system. To restrict the visibility of the                     cash account, you should do the following on the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL104000|GL104000]) GL Account Access (GL104000) form: You create a restriction group (for example,  Access to Cash Account )                         with direct restriction. You add to the group the user account of the accountant. You add to the group the GL account the cash account is linked to. We recommend that you carefully design and configure restriction groups                     containing accounts, so that a user can view the accounts he or she needs for                     work. Otherwise, a user may encounter problems with processing transactions of                     the linked cash accounts. Forms for Security of Cash Accounts In the following table, you can find the list of the forms that you can use to manage restriction                     groups with cash accounts and the tasks that you can solve by using each                     form.

In Acumatica ERP, organizations implement general access restrictions by assigning roles to users of the system.

==Managing the Visibility of GL Budget Articles by User==
You can configure restriction groups that will limit the visibility of GL budget articles (leaf articles or nodes at any level) for users. As a result, the users not included in the group will not be able to see the budget articles (and these articles&rsquo; subarticles, if there are any). {br}

For example, suppose that the ''Wages'' budget article should be available to only the chief financial officer of your organization. To configure the visibility of this budget article, you need to do the following on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_10_50_30|GL Budget Access] ([~/?ScreenId=GL105030|GL105030]) form:[anchor|#_ac6e777a-2ed5-4363-b163-7bd59087eefa]
#You create a restriction group (for example, ''Group for Wages Budget Article'') with direct restriction.
#You add to the group the user account of the chief financial officer.
#You add to the group the ''Wages'' budget article.

An organization can have multiple warehouses in Acumatica ERP, and different groups of employees may work with these warehouses in the system. To limit in the system the set of employees who work with a particular warehouse, you can create restriction groups to display the warehouse for only employees who are responsible for tasks that involve this warehouse. If the employees who work with the same warehouse perform only specific tasks (such as accepting goods and creating purchase orders), you can provide these employees with access to only the forms that they should use.{br}

))){br}{TOC}
==Usage Scenarios==
The most common scenarios of managing the security of warehouses are the following:[anchor|#_9dc29b29-f49a-4106-a206-d3c8063611bb]
*Managing access to forms based on employees&rsquo; functional roles: If employees perform specific tasks (such as receiving goods and creating purchase orders), you can provide the employees access to the forms they use in their work, and revoke access for forms that they shouldn&rsquo;t use. For details, see [[#_236c0426-5412-4075-8b52-77da575b8c6c|Access to Forms Based on Roles].
*Managing the visibility of particular warehouses by user: If you have created multiple warehouses in Acumatica ERP, you can restrict the visibility of warehouses to users on forms by using restriction groups. For details, see [[#_3f0d84fb-0019-4aa9-a174-bc0851279638|Visibility of Warehouses by User].
*:((({S:Warn}You can create and manage multiple warehouses in Acumatica ERP only if the ''Multiple Warehouses'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
)))

In addition to managing the visibility of warehouses in whole, you can restrict the visibility of particular inventory items. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Restriction_Groups_for_Subitems|Inventory Item Security].[anchor|#_236c0426-5412-4075-8b52-77da575b8c6c]
==Access to Forms Based on Roles==[HelpRoot_Administration\User_Roles_GeneralInfo|User Roles: General Information]
You can use user roles in Acumatica ERP to give employees access to forms related to working with warehouses. A role can correspond to an area of responsibility for an employee who performs warehouse-related tasks, such as creating purchase orders, accepting goods, and preparing replenishment. If needed, you can assign multiple roles to an employee. For more information about user roles, see [HelpRoot_Administration\User_Roles_GeneralInfo|User Roles: General Information].{br}

Consider the following examples of roles for employees who work with inventory and order management:[anchor|#_a590d26b-c917-41bc-8920-79217bf9382c]
*''Supervisor'': A role for an employee who configures the Inventory submodule and manages work with the submodule. This role should have access to the forms related to inventory processes, such as the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form.
*''Data Entry Clerk'': A role for an employee who creates documents on data entry forms. You should provide access to such forms as [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]), or [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_40_00|Transfers] ([~/?ScreenId=IN304000|IN304000]).
*''Purchasing Manager'': A role for an employee who is responsible for replenishment. For this role, you should provide access to the '''Replenishment''' node of the '''Processes''' tab of the Inventory module.
[anchor|#_3f0d84fb-0019-4aa9-a174-bc0851279638]
==Visibility of Warehouses by User==
By default, all employees who have access to forms of the inventory and order management modules can see all warehouses created in the system. By using the forms of the Row-Level Security module, you can configure the system so that each warehouse is displayed only to users who work with this warehouse. You can use restriction groups to set up the visibility of warehouses to employees. For details on restriction groups, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Overview_of_Restriction_Groups|Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP].{br}

For example, suppose that your system has the ''Wholesale'' and ''Retail'' warehouses defined, and you need to configure the visibility of these warehouses to users as follows:[anchor|#_27ed231f-3d2f-4df9-b432-485e551f0985]
*User S is a supervisor who should configure and manage both warehouses.
*User C1 is a clerk who enters documents for the ''Wholesale'' warehouse.
*User C2 is a clerk who enters documents for the ''Retail'' warehouse.

To configure the visibility of warehouses according to this example, you do the following on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_20_00|Warehouse Access] ([~/?ScreenId=IN102000|IN102000]) form:[anchor|#_4411b4ed-ff9f-4614-b078-b86e1735ff9a]
#You create two restriction groups of type ''A'' (with direct restriction): ''Group 1'' for the ''Wholesale'' warehouse, and ''Group 2'' for the ''Retail'' warehouse.
#In Group 1, you include User S, User C1, and the ''Wholesale'' warehouse.
#In Group 2, you include User S, User C2, and the ''Retail'' warehouse.

The resulting visibility of warehouses will be the following:[anchor|#_a4ab849d-c84c-491a-aad4-6655fe17a040]
*User S can see both the ''Wholesale'' and ''Retail'' warehouses.
*User C1 can see only the ''Wholesale'' warehouse.
*User C2 can see only the ''Retail'' warehouse.

A role                     can correspond to an area of responsibility for an employee who performs                     warehouse-related tasks, such as creating purchase orders, accepting goods, and                     preparing replenishment. If needed, you can assign multiple roles to an                     employee. For more information about user roles, see  User Roles: General Information. Consider the                     following examples of roles for employees who work with inventory and order                     management: Supervisor : A role for an employee who configures the Inventory                         submodule and manages work with the submodule. This role should have access                         to the forms related to inventory processes, such as the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000) form. Data Entry Clerk : A role for an employee who creates documents on                         data entry forms. You should provide access to such forms as   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) Issues (IN302000),   ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) Receipts (IN301000), or   ([~/?ScreenId=IN304000|IN304000]) Transfers (IN304000). Purchasing Manager : A role for an employee who is responsible for                         replenishment. For this role, you should provide access to the                              Replenishment  node of the                              Processes  tab of the Inventory module. Visibility of Warehouses by User By default, all employees who have access to forms of the inventory and order management modules                     can see all warehouses created in the system. By using the forms of the                     Row-Level Security module, you can configure the system so that each warehouse                     is displayed only to users who work with this warehouse. You can use restriction                     groups to set up the visibility of warehouses to employees. For details on                     restriction groups, see  Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP. For example, suppose that your system has the  Wholesale  and  Retail  warehouses                     defined, and you need to configure the visibility of these warehouses to users                     as follows: User S is a supervisor who should configure and manage both warehouses. User C1 is a clerk who enters documents for the  Wholesale                          warehouse. User C2 is a clerk who enters documents for the  Retail                          warehouse. To configure the visibility of warehouses according to this example, you do the following on the                           ([~/?ScreenId=IN102000|IN102000]) Warehouse Access (IN102000)                     form: You create two restriction groups of type  A  (with direct restriction):  Group 1  for                         the  Wholesale  warehouse, and  Group 2  for the  Retail                          warehouse. In Group 1, you include User S, User C1, and the  Wholesale  warehouse. In Group 2, you include User S, User C2, and the  Retail  warehouse. The resulting visibility of warehouses will be the following: User S can see both the  Wholesale  and  Retail  warehouses. User C1 can see only the  Wholesale  warehouse. User C2 can see only the  Retail  warehouse.

==Visibility of Inventory Items to Users==
The list of inventory items from which employees should select an item can be very long, which increases the probability of an entry error. By using restriction groups, you can reduce the list of inventory items that users see on forms. For more information about restriction groups, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Overview_of_Restriction_Groups|Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP].((({S:Warn}The ''N/A'' item cannot be specified in restriction groups.
)))
For example, suppose that your organization sells furniture, and that each sales manager works with furniture for a particular room, such as kitchen, living room, and bedroom. When managers create a sales order, they should select items from only the list of furniture they sell to avoid entry mistakes. Further suppose that User K sells kitchen furniture, User L sells living room furniture, and User M sells bedroom furniture. To restrict the visibility of inventory items to the appropriate users in the system, you would create the following restriction groups with direct restriction on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_30_00|Inventory Item Access] ([~/?ScreenId=IN103000|IN103000]) form:[anchor|#_e2d90541-44be-4f10-be26-6d5882600d87]
#Group K: In this group, include User K and all inventory IDs for kitchen furniture items.
#Group L: To this group, add User L and all inventory IDs for items of living room furniture.
#Group M: In this group, include User M and all inventory IDs for bedroom furniture items.

As a result, the visibility of the inventory items in sales orders will be restricted in the system as follows:[anchor|#_af12de0e-9d2e-4626-ae2a-847aa2286b2c]
*User K can view and select only inventory items for kitchen furniture.
*User L can work with only inventory items for living room furniture.
*User M can see and select only inventory items for bedroom furniture.
*Other users cannot see the inventory items that have been added to the three restriction groups in the system.

If your organization has multiple branches defined in Acumatica ERP, you may need to control which employees get access to which branches. Because branches share some data, you may also need to control access to the shared data. Acumatica ERP provides user access roles, which you can use to control users&rsquo; access to branches, and restriction groups to limit the visibility of shared data. In this topic, you will read about ways to manage the security of a branch.[anchor|#_beb7db1f-ebd6-44fe-8332-d23245ce0271]((({S:Warn}In Acumatica ERP, you can configure groups with direct and inverse restriction.

For details on the types of restriction groups, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Types_of_Restriction_Groups|Types of Restriction Groups].
))){br}{TOC}
==Usage Scenarios==
The most common scenarios of managing the security of company branches are the following:[anchor|#_57dd98c9-0b61-442a-adeb-eecf429f00b9]
*Managing user access to branches: If your organization has multiple branches (and you have created multiple branches in Acumatica ERP), you can configure access to branches for employees who work in these branches. For details, see [[#_e62abf7b-c139-4524-92be-459172937701|User Access to Branches].
*Managing the visibility of data shared between branches: If you need to make data shared between branches (such as General Ledger accounts and subaccounts) visible only within a particluar branch, you can use restriction groups to resolve this task. For more information, see [[#_e5e275b2-6a58-4bce-9dfc-d6911cf301bf|Visibility of Data Within a Branch].
((({S:Warn}You can create and maintain multiple branches in your Acumatica ERP instance only if the ''Multi-Branch Support'' feature is enabled in your system on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form (for details, see [HelpRoot_Organization\CS__con_Multiple_Branch_Support|Multiple Branch Support]).
)))[anchor|#_e62abf7b-c139-4524-92be-459172937701]
==User Access to Branches==
After multiple branches have been defined in the system, you provide access to the branches for users who will work in the system as follows:[anchor|#_ee081430-cefb-4525-9d5e-d5685c35112b]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_05|User Roles] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201005|SM201005]) form, you create branch-specific user roles (one role per branch) and assign these roles to user accounts. For details on user roles, see [HelpRoot_Administration\User_Roles_GeneralInfo|User Roles: General Information].
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_20_00|Branches] ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) form, you assign the roles to branches as follows: For each branch, in the '''Access Role''' box, you select the user role created for this branch.
((({S:Hint}[anchor|#_7188b3ab-c2e1-480d-bf34-5813920ceef6]
*Once a role is assigned to one of the branches, other branches also must have roles assigned. A branch with no role assigned will be inaccessible to any user.
*To allow a user to access multiple branches, assign to him or her the roles for the branches to which the user should have access.
)))
If a user, based on his or her role, has access to a data entry form where this user enters a document and specifies the branch of origin, only the branches to which the user has access are available on the drop-down list. The users who have access to multiple branches can select the specific branch from the '''Branches''' menu on the form&rsquo;s title toolbar and create documents on behalf of the selected branch.{br}

No matter which branch users have access to, users who have access to the following forms, based on their roles, will see and work with all branches (because users configure system objects by using these forms):[anchor|#_b273a2d2-0914-41d6-a7a9-587c80047198]

==Visibility of Data Within a Branch==
Branches have some data shared between branches and some data kept as branch-specific (for details, see [HelpRoot_Organization\CS__con_Multiple_Branch_Support|Multiple Branch Support]). You may need to restrict the visibility of data that is shared but may contain sensitive information, such as General Ledger accounts and subaccounts. Acumatica ERP provides restriction groups so you can control which accounts and subaccounts are used with which branch. For details on configuring restriction groups for accounts and subaccounts, see [HelpRoot_Financials\GL__con_Account_and_Subaccount_Security|Account and Subaccount Security].
==Forms for Branch Security==
In the following table, you can find the list of the forms that you can use to manage restriction groups with branches and the tasks that you can resolve by using each form.[anchor|#_f3d1b2f0-f044-48ac-b2b3-35a85d6509b2]

Usage Scenarios The most common scenarios of managing the security of company branches are the                     following: Managing user access to branches: If your organization has multiple branches                         (and you have created multiple branches in  Acumatica ERP), you can configure access to branches for employees who work in these                         branches. For details, see  User Access to Branches User Access to Branches. Managing the visibility of data shared between branches: If you need to make                         data shared between branches (such as General Ledger accounts and                         subaccounts) visible only within a particluar branch, you can use                         restriction groups to resolve this task. For more information, see  Visibility of Data Within a Branch Visibility of Data Within a Branch. You can create and maintain multiple branches in your  Acumatica ERP instance only if the  Multi-Branch Support  feature is enabled in your                     system on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form                     (for details, see  Multiple Branch Support). User Access to Branches After multiple branches have been defined in the system, you provide access to the branches for users who will work in the system as follows: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201005|SM201005]) User Roles (SM201005) form, you create                         branch-specific user roles (one role per branch) and assign these roles to                         user accounts. For details on user roles, see  User Roles: General Information. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) Branches (CS102000) form, you assign the roles to branches as follows: For each branch, in the  Access Role  box, you select the user role created for this branch. Once a role is assigned to one of the branches, other branches also must have roles assigned. A branch with no role assigned will be inaccessible to any user. To allow a user to access multiple branches, assign to him or her the roles for the branches to which the user should have access. If a user, based on his or her role, has access to a data entry form where this user enters a document and specifies the branch of origin, only the branches to which the user has access are available on the drop-down list. The users who have access to multiple branches can select the specific branch from the  Branches  menu on the form's title toolbar and create documents on behalf of the selected branch. No matter which branch users have access to, users who have access to the following forms, based on their roles, will see and work with all branches (because users configure system objects by using these forms):  ([~/?ScreenId=GL101010|GL101010]) Inter-Branch Account Mapping (GL101010)  ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) Branches (CS102000)  ([~/?ScreenId=CS205010|CS205010]) Buildings (CS205010)  ([~/?ScreenId=EP205000|EP205000]) Assignment and Approval Maps (EP205000)  ([~/?ScreenId=EP204060|EP204060]) Import Company Tree (EP204060)  ([~/?ScreenId=GL103020|GL103020]) Restriction Groups by Branch (GL103020)  ([~/?ScreenId=GL103040|GL103040]) GL Accounts by Branch Access (GL103040)  ([~/?ScreenId=GL103060|GL103060]) Subaccounts by Branch Access (GL103060) Visibility of Data Within a Branch Branches have some data shared between branches and some data kept as branch-specific (for details, see  Multiple Branch Support). You may need to restrict the visibility of data that is shared but may contain sensitive information, such as General Ledger accounts and subaccounts.  Acumatica ERP provides restriction groups so you can control which accounts and subaccounts are used with which branch. For details on configuring restriction groups for accounts and subaccounts, see  Account and Subaccount Security.

If your organization sells goods and provides services to customers, you may have a great deal of customer-related information stored in Acumatica ERP. When the employees of your organization create documents for customers, they have to select the required customer from the full list of customers. If certain employees work with only very important customers, and other employees are not allowed to see these customers in the system for security reasons, you can create restriction groups to manage the visibility of your customers to users of Acumatica ERP, as described in this topic.[anchor|#_10e1cf39-8b8e-409d-b376-362b07d31699]((({S:Warn}In Acumatica ERP, you can configure groups with direct and inverse restriction.

For details on the types of restriction groups, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Types_of_Restriction_Groups|Types of Restriction Groups].
)))
==Visibility of Customers by User==
By using restriction groups, you can show or hide particular customers on Acumatica ERP forms, depending on the user who is logged in to the system. For example, if some customers are very important to your organization, dedicated employees might be assigned to process documents that contain information about these customers in the system. For details about restriction groups, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Overview_of_Restriction_Groups|Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP].{br}

For example, suppose that your organization provides cleaning services and Megabank is a very important customer of your organization. Manager M is responsible for all operations in the systems related to Megabank, and other managers should not see Megabank on any forms of the system. To configure the visibility of this customer in the system, you need to do the following on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_20_00|Customer Access] ([~/?ScreenId=AR102000|AR102000]) form:[anchor|#_cbb54de1-0666-4fd4-aa6b-8b8252d58e05]
#You create a restriction group (for example, ''Group for Megabank'') with direct restriction.
#You add to the group the user account of the Manager M.
#You add to the group the Megabank customer.

If you use customer classes and want to include each new customer of a particular class in a restriction group automatically, you can specify a default restriction group for this class, as described in the [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Operations_Restriction_Groups#_769aca82-01cf-49ce-8b23-342ac7eaef5b|Setting Up Default Restriction Groups for Vendor and Customer Classes] section of [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Operations_Restriction_Groups|Operations with Restriction Groups].

Access to a business account is defined by rules based on restriction groups that are configured for the customer or vendor accounts that were created from this business account. The system applies these rules to the business account as well. 
==Visibility of Business Account and Related Entities by User==
If access to a customer or vendor account has been restricted to deny access to a group of employees, these employes will not be able to view the related business account on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] form.

Many organizations use projects to achieve their business objectives efficiently. An organization may have multiple projects in progress at a given time. By limiting users&rsquo; access to and visibility of information about particular projects and related transactions, managers can properly organize the work on each project. In Acumatica ERP, you can use roles to provide access to forms according to employees&rsquo; responsibilities and restriction groups to limit the visibility of particular projects to onlythe responsible team, as described in this topic.[anchor|#_59f078a5-658e-413e-9899-ebba366ea835]((({S:Warn}In Acumatica ERP, you can configure groups with direct and inverse restriction. In this topic, for simplicity, groups with direct restriction are used in examples. You can use inverse restriction groups in the same way as you use direct restriction groups. For details on the types of restriction groups, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Types_of_Restriction_Groups|Types of Restriction Groups].

==Usage Scenarios==
The most common scenarios of managing the security of projects are the following:[anchor|#_365e8b26-a322-4eb4-8de7-9cd514ee7f6b]
*Managing access to forms based on users’ roles: Each employee involved with a project has specific tasks. You can configure user roles that will give employees access to project-related forms according to their responsibilities. For details, see [[#_45dc3692-8189-421a-9310-9c2da05085ff|Access to Forms Based on Roles].
*Managing the visibility of particular projects by user: If your organization has multiple project teams and multiple employees have the same functional responsibilities in different projects, you can make particular projects available to employees of only a particular project team by using restriction groups. For more information, see [[#_f9a31c37-858a-4e23-aac5-945af4fbe125|Visibility of Projects by Users].
*Managing the visibility of projects by area of the system: If a project should be associated with transactions in a particular system area (such as accounts payable), you can make it visible only within this area. For details, see [[#_ee57f12b-ae7e-417e-a331-a46746de3e97|Visibility of Projects by Area].
[anchor|#_45dc3692-8189-421a-9310-9c2da05085ff]
==Access to Forms Based on Roles==
By using the user security forms, you can configure access rights to the project-related forms for each employee, in accordance with the employee&rsquo;s typical responsibilities. For more information about user roles, see [HelpRoot_Administration\User_Roles_GeneralInfo|User Roles: General Information].{br}

For example, you can create the following roles for employees of your organization who work with projects: [anchor|#_82f87d4a-b918-499f-94fb-bb3f15885c04]
*''Project Manager:'' A role for an employee who coordinates projects and is responsible for achieving the project goals. In the system, this person sets up pricing in projects, creates tasks, and configures projects and project templates. This role should have access to project-related forms—that is, the forms in the '''Projects''' workspace—including those listed in the '''Preferences''' category. Also, this role may require access to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) form so that the users with this role can approve projects.
*''Project Controller'': A role for an employee who controls project transactions, performs allocations, and runs project billing. This role should have full access to project-related forms—that is, the forms in the '''Projects''' workspace—including those listed in the '''Processes''' category.
*''Project Accountant'': A role for an employee who plans and executes the project budget and enters project transactions. This role should have access to project-related forms—that is, the forms in the '''Projects''' workspace—including those listed in the '''Transactions''' and '''Profiles''' categories.
*''Project Team Member:'' A role for an employee who works for a project and enters time sheets and time cards. This role should have access to project-related forms—that is, the forms in the '''Projects''' workspace—including those listed in the '''Transactions''' and '''Profiles''' categories. It should also have access to the forms listed in the '''Time Tracking''' category of the '''Time and Expenses''' workspace.
[anchor|#_f9a31c37-858a-4e23-aac5-945af4fbe125]
==Visibility of Projects by Users==
By using the row-level security forms of Acumatica ERP, you can configure the system to hide or display particular projects for employees, in addition to implementing task-based roles. Employees who have access to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form can view or edit all the projects available in your organization. You may need to use restriction groups to restrict the visibility of specific projects to only employees of the project team. For details on restriction groups, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Overview_of_Restriction_Groups|Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP].{br}

As a simple example, suppose that you need to restrict the visibility of projects to employees in your organization given the following: [anchor|#_5b055f99-8ff7-42a9-988f-466a3f611dff]
*There are two projects in your organization: ''Project Y'' and ''Project Z''.
*User PM is a project manager who controls all projects in your organization.
*User AC is an accountant who plans budgets and performs transactions for all projects in your organization.
*Users E1 and E2 are engineers who work on ''Project Y''.
*Users E3 and E4 are engineers who work on ''Project Z''.

To configure the visibility of projects according to the listed statements, you would do the following on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_20_00|Project Access] ([~/?ScreenId=PM102000|PM102000]) form:[anchor|#_0d4520e4-ab22-4bb5-8720-17f473f94f19]
#You create two restriction groups of type ''A'' (with direct restriction): Group 1 for ''Project Y'' and Group 2 for ''Project Z''.
#You include the following entities in Group 1:''Project Y'', user PM, user AC,  and users E1 and E2.
#In Group 2, you include ''Project Z'', user PM, user AC, and users E3 and E4.

With the settings you have specified, the users’ visibility of projects would be the following:[anchor|#_62d32c2b-a90c-42e5-9226-68ec81f82494]
*Users PM and AC can see both ''Project Y'' and ''Project Z''.
*Users E1 and E2 can see only ''Project Y''.
*Users E3 and E4 can see only ''Project Z''.
[anchor|#_ee57f12b-ae7e-417e-a331-a46746de3e97]
==Visibility of Projects by Area==
After you have created a project in Acumatica ERP, the project is available system-wide by default. You can control the visibility of projects within functional areas of the system in the following ways:[anchor|#_a445fa36-c804-4abe-b0a1-33cd28b91664]
*Display or hide the '''Project''' boxes and columns on forms: If you use projects in a particular functional area (for example, accounts receivable), you can configure the system to display the boxes and columns where a user can select a project on forms only within this area. In the '''Visibility Settings''' section of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form, you can select the check boxes for the areas where these elements should be displayed and clear the check boxes for the areas where the elements should not be displayed..
*Display or hide a project: If the project transactions of a particular project should be performed within a particular area (for example, inventory), you can make the project visible only in this area so that users can select only appropriate projects when they are preparing documents. You can select areas in the '''Visibility Settings''' section of the '''General Info''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. After you have selected an area, users can select the project in documents generated on the related forms, and the release of these documents automatically updates the project data.
*Display or hide the tasks of a project: If employees need to process documents related to a project in multiple areas, but the users perform particular tasks of a project in a certain area (for example, the ''Warehouse operations'' task requires users to enter inventory transactions and the ''Customer payments'' task is performed in accounts receivable), you can select the areas where the task will be displayed in the settings of the task. You select these areas in the '''Visibility Settings''' section of the '''General Info''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form.

==Forms for Project Security==

An organization may have multiple projects in                     progress  at                     a given time . By limiting users' access to and visibility of                     information about particular projects and related transactions, managers can                     properly organize the work on each project. In  Acumatica ERP, you can use roles to provide access to forms according to employees'                     responsibilities and restriction groups to                      limit                      the visibility of particular projects                      to  only the                      responsible team, as described in this topic. In  Acumatica ERP,             you can configure groups with direct and inverse restriction. In this topic, for             simplicity, groups with direct restriction are used in examples. You can use inverse             restriction groups in the same way as you use direct restriction groups. For details on             the types of restriction groups, see  Types of Restriction Groups. Usage Scenarios The most common scenarios of managing the security of projects are the                     following: Managing access to forms based on                          users’                          role s :                         Each employee involved with a project has                          specific                         tasks. You can configure user roles that will                          give                          employees access to project-related forms according to their                         responsibilities. For details, see  Access to Forms Based on Roles Access to Forms Based on Roles. Managing the visibility of particular projects by user: If your organization                         has multiple project teams and multiple employees have the same functional                         responsibilities in different projects, you can make particular projects                         available to employees of only a particular project team by using                         restriction groups. For more information, see  Visibility of Projects by Users Visibility of Projects by Users. Managing the visibility of projects by                          area                          of the system : If a project should be associated with                         transactions in a particular system area (such as                          a ccounts                          p ayable),                         you can make it visible only within this area. For details, see  Visibility of Projects by Area Visibility of Projects by Area. Access to Forms Based on Roles By using the user security forms, you can configure access rights to the project-related forms                     for each                     employee ,                      in accordance with the employee's typical responsibilities. For more information                     about user roles, see                          User Roles: General Information. For example, you can create the following roles for employees of your organization who work with projects:  Project Manager:  A role for an employee who                             coordinates                              project s                              and is responsible for achieving the project goals. In the system, this                             person sets up pricing in projects, creates tasks, and configures                             projects and project templates. This role should have access to                             project-related                             forms —that                             is, the forms in the  Projects                              workspace—including those listed in the                                  Preferences                              category .                             Also, this role may                              require                              access to the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) Approvals (EP503010)                             form so that the users with this role can approve projects. Project Controller : A role for an employee who controls project transactions, performs                             allocations, and runs project billing. This role should have full access                             to project-related                             forms —that                             is, the forms in the  Projects                              workspace—including those listed in the                                  Processes                              category . Project Accountant : A role for an employee who plans and executes the project budget and                             enters project transactions. This role should have access to                             project-related                             forms —that                             is, the forms in the  Projects                              workspace—including those listed in the                                  Transactions  and                                  Profiles                              categor ies . Project Team Member:  A role for an employee who works for a project and enters time                             sheets and time cards. This role should have access                             to                              project-related                             forms —that                             is, the forms in the  Projects                              workspace—including those listed in the                                  Transactions  and                                  Profiles                              categories .                              It should also have access to the forms listed in the  Time                                 Tracking  category of the  Time and                                 Expenses                              workspace. Visibility of Projects by Users By using the row-level security                     forms  of                          Acumatica ERP, you can configure the system to hide or display particular                     projects for employees, in addition to implementing task-based roles. Employees                     who have access to the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000)                     form                      can                      view or edit all the projects available in your organization. You may need to                     use restriction groups to restrict the visibility of specific projects to only                     employees of the project team. For details on restriction groups, see  Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP. As                     a simple  example, suppose that you need to restrict the                     visibility of projects to employees in your organization                      given                      the following:  There are two projects in your organization:  Project Y  and  Project Z . User                          PM                          is a project manager who controls all projects in your organization. User AC is an accountant who plans budgets and                          performs                          transactions for all projects in your organization. Users E1 and E2 are engineers who work on  Project Y . Users E3 and E4 are engineers who work on  Project Z . To configure the visibility of projects according to the listed statements, you would do the following on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM102000|PM102000]) Project Access (PM102000) form: You create two restriction groups of type  A  (with direct                         restriction):                          Group 1  for  Project Y  and Group 2 for  Project                             Z . You                         include the following entities in  Group 1 : Project                         Y ,                          u ser                         PM,                          u ser                         AC,                                                   and u sers E1 and E2 . In Group 2, you include  Project                         Z ,                          u ser                         PM,                          u ser                         AC,                          and                         u sers E3 and E4 . With                     the settings you have                      specified ,                     the  users’                      visibility of projects would be the following: Users PM and AC can see both  Project Y  and  Project Z . Users E1 and E2 can see only  Project Y . Users E3 and E4 can see only  Project Z . Visibility of Projects by Area After you have created a project in  Acumatica ERP, the project is available system-wide by default. You can control the                     visibility of projects within functional                     areas  of                     the system  in the following ways: Display or hide the                              Project                          boxes and columns on forms: If you                          use                          projects in a particular functional area (for example,                          a ccounts                          r eceivable),                         you can configure the system to display the boxes and columns where a user                         can select a project on forms only within this area. In the                              Visibility Settings  section of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form, you can select                          the                         check boxes for the                          areas                          where these elements should be displayed and clear the check boxes for the                         areas where the elements should not be displayed. . Display or hide a project: If the project                         transactions                          of a particular project  should be performed within a                         particular area (for example,                          i nventory),                         you can make the project visible only in this area so that users can select                         only appropriate projects when they are preparing documents. You can select                         areas in the  Visibility Settings  section of the                              General Info  tab on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. After you have                         selected an area, users can select the project in documents generated on the                         related forms, and the release of these documents automatically updates the                         project data. Display or hide                          the  tasks of a project: If employees need to process                         documents related to a project in multiple areas, but the users perform                         particular tasks of a project in a certain area (for example, the                              Warehouse operations  task requires                          users                         to enter  inventory transactions and the  Customer                             payments  task is performed                          in                          a ccounts                          receivable ),                         you can select the areas where the task will be                         displayed                          in the settings of the task . You select these areas in the                              Visibility Settings  section of the                              General Info  tab on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) Project Tasks (PM302000) form.

Before you start configuring restriction groups, you need to gather the information that will help you to plan your restriction groups, as described in this topic.
==Preparation for the Configuration of Restriction Groups==
Before you create and configure restriction groups, you need to do the following for each visibility-related task you want to resolve:[anchor|#_a578f7b8-6291-4355-96b9-3c3e5c93bb5f]
#Determine whether or not users will be included in your restriction group. The restriction group consists of users and entities if you need to limit the visibility of entities (for example, customers) for users. The restriction group consists of only entities (and no users) if you need to restrict the visibility of entities (for example, subaccounts) when they are used with particular entities of a different type (for example, GL accounts). For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Overview_of_Restriction_Groups|Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP].
#Select the restriction group type:
#*For a group with users:
#**If a smaller number of users ''should'' see the entities, you select a group with direct restriction. When you configure a restriction group, you will add the entities and the users who should see the entities to the group.
#**If a smaller number of users ''should not'' see the entities, you select a group with inverse restriction. You will add the entities and the users who shouldn’t see the entities to the group.
#*For a group without users:
#**If the number of entities of Type 1 (such as subaccounts) that ''should'' be visible when the entity of Type 2 (such as an account) is selected is smaller than the number of entities of Type 1 that shouldn&rsquo;t be visible, you select a group with direct restriction. When you configure a restriction group, the group will include entities of Type 1 that should be visible and the entity of Type 2.
#**If the number of entities of Type 1 that ''shouldn’t'' be visible when the entity of Type 2 is selected is smaller than the number of entities of Type 1 that should be visible, you select a group with inverse restriction. The group will include entities of Type 1 that shouldn’t be visible and the entity of Type 2.
#Estimate the number of restriction groups you need to resolve this task: You determine how many groups you need to create by using the following guidelines:
#*If a particular user or a set of users should (or shouldn&rsquo;t) see entities of different types (such as customers or GL accounts), you need to create a separate restriction group for each entity type.
#*If multiple sets of users should (or shouldn&rsquo;t) see different values of entities of the same type (such as warehouses), you need to create a separate group for each entity value or set of entity values.
#*You can include particular combinations of entities in one group with users. For supported combinations of entities, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Configuration_Restriction_Groups|Configuration of Restriction Groups].
#*If you need to control the accounts and subaccounts that can be used together, you must create at least two groups and include all subaccounts in either of the groups.

For examples of using restriction groups, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Types_of_Restriction_Groups|Types of Restriction Groups].{br}

After you plan the restriction groups, you can create and configure them. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Configuration_Restriction_Groups|Configuration of Restriction Groups].

After you have prepared all necessary information about restriction groups, you can start configuring them, as described in this topic.{br}{TOC}
==Overview of the Configuration Process==
The configuration process of row-level security in Acumatica ERP includes the following steps:[anchor|#_46fb1241-2856-4fee-b4b6-e4a27740bdae]
#You create the restriction group of a required type by using the appropriate form (which depends on the entities that you want to add to a restriction group). For the list of entities, see [[#_e812c21c-b02e-4356-be92-f77825911a31|Scenarios of Using Restriction Groups].
#If the group should include users, you add entities and users to the group.
#If the group should not include users, you add related entities to the group.
#Optional: You specify default restriction groups for entity classes as needed to simplify adding new entities of these classes to the restriction groups. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Operations_Restriction_Groups#_769aca82-01cf-49ce-8b23-342ac7eaef5b|Setting Up Default Restriction Groups for Vendor and Customer Classes] in [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Operations_Restriction_Groups|Operations with Restriction Groups].

At any time, you can include entities in previously created restriction groups (for example, when you need to make an entity visible to a new user). For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Operations_Restriction_Groups#_5352f349-5e81-434f-9121-0ee8532d0797|Adding Entities to an Existing Restriction Group] in [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Operations_Restriction_Groups|Operations with Restriction Groups].[anchor|#_e812c21c-b02e-4356-be92-f77825911a31]
==Combinations of Restriction-Group Entities==
 Acumatica ERP supports a variety of scenarios of configuring the visibility of entities within the system. With the most common scenarios, you can create restriction groups that include the following system entities:
*Users and General Ledger (GL) accounts: With these restriction groups, if your organization has sensitive GL accounts, you can make these accounts visible to a limited number of employees. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Account_and_Subaccount_Security|Account and Subaccount Security].
*Users and subaccounts: As with groups that include users and GL accounts, you can limit the visibility of sensitive subaccounts to employees. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Account_and_Subaccount_Security|Account and Subaccount Security].
*:((({S:Warn}For performance reasons, visibility restrictions by user for subaccounts do not affect analytical (ARM) and form-based reports or general inquiries. This means that users who can view the reports and general inquiries that include subaccounts will see the full list of subaccounts.
)))
*Users and vendor accounts: You can define these restriction groups to make particular vendors visible in the system to only employees who work with these vendors. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Vendor_Security|Vendor Security].
*Users and customer accounts: With these restriction groups, you can make particular customers visible to only employees who work with these customers. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Customer_Security|Customer Security].
*Users and GL budget articles: With these restriction groups, you can limit the visibility of sensitive budget articles so that only particular users can see and work with these articles. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_GL_Budget_Security|Security of GL Budget Articles].
*Users and warehouses: You can create restriction groups to display a particular warehouse (or set of warehouses) for only employees who work with this warehouse (or this set of warehouses). For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Warehouse_Security|Warehouse Security].
*Users and inventory items: You can define these restriction groups to reduce the number of items in the lists with inventory items, depending on the particular employee signed in to the system. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Restriction_Groups_for_Subitems|Inventory Item Security].
*Users and projects: You can define these restriction groups to configure the visibility of particular projects only to a responsible project team. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Project_Security|Project Security].
*Users and printers: If the ''DeviceHub'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]), you can define these restriction groups to configure the visibility of printers to particular users. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__how_Configure_Printer_Access|To Configure Printer Access].
*Branches, GL accounts, and users: With these restriction groups, you can allow users to work with only branch-specific accounts. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Account_and_Subaccount_Security|Account and Subaccount Security].
*Branches, subaccounts, and users: You can set up these restriction groups so that the system displays to users only the branch-specific subaccounts. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Account_and_Subaccount_Security|Account and Subaccount Security].
*Branches and cash accounts: If there are multiple branches in your organization, with these restriction groups, you can allow users in each branch to work with only branch-specific cash accounts. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Security_of_Cash_Accounts|Security of Cash Accounts].
*GL Accounts and Subaccounts: If you have subaccounts that employees must use only with particular GL accounts, by defining these restriction groups, you can set up lists of available subaccounts for each GL account. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Account_and_Subaccount_Security|Account and Subaccount Security].

At any time, you can include entities in previously created restriction groups (for         example, when you need to make an entity visible to a new user). For details, see  Adding Entities to an Existing Restriction Group in  Operations with Restriction Groups. Combinations of Restriction-Group Entities  Acumatica ERP supports a variety of scenarios of configuring the visibility of entities within                 the system. With the most common scenarios, you can create restriction groups that                 include the following system entities: Users and General Ledger (GL) accounts: With these restriction groups, if your                     organization has sensitive GL accounts, you can make these accounts visible to a                     limited number of employees. For details, see  Account and Subaccount Security. Users and subaccounts: As with groups that include users and GL accounts, you                     can limit the visibility of sensitive subaccounts to employees. For more                     information, see  Account and Subaccount Security. For performance reasons, visibility restrictions by             user for subaccounts do not affect analytical (ARM) and form-based reports or general             inquiries. This means that users who can view the reports and general inquiries that             include subaccounts will see the full list of subaccounts. Users and vendor accounts: You can define these restriction groups to make                     particular vendors visible in the system to only employees who work with these                     vendors. For details, see  Vendor Security. Users and customer accounts: With these restriction groups, you can make                     particular customers visible to only employees who work with these customers.                     For details, see  Customer Security. Users and GL budget articles: With these restriction groups, you can limit the                     visibility of sensitive budget articles so that only particular users can see                     and work with these articles. For more information, see  Security of GL Budget Articles. Users and warehouses: You can create restriction groups to display a particular                     warehouse (or set of warehouses) for only employees who work with this warehouse                     (or this set of warehouses). For details, see  Warehouse Security. Users and inventory items: You can define these restriction groups to reduce the                     number of items in the lists with inventory items, depending on the particular                     employee signed in to the system. For more information, see  Inventory Item Security. Users and projects: You can define these restriction groups to configure the                     visibility of particular projects only to a responsible project team. For more                     information, see  Project Security. Users and printers: If the  DeviceHub  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features form (CS100000), you can define                     these restriction groups to configure the visibility of printers to particular                     users. For more information, see  To Configure Printer Access. Branches, GL accounts, and users: With these restriction groups, you can allow                     users to work with only branch-specific accounts. For details, see  Account and Subaccount Security. Branches, subaccounts, and users: You can set up these restriction groups so                     that the system displays to users only the branch-specific subaccounts. For more                     information, see  Account and Subaccount Security. Branches and cash accounts: If there are multiple branches in your organization,                     with these restriction groups, you can allow users in each branch to work with                     only branch-specific cash accounts. For details, see  Security of Cash Accounts. GL Accounts and Subaccounts: If you have subaccounts that employees must use                     only with particular GL accounts, by defining these restriction groups, you can                     set up lists of available subaccounts for each GL account.

These structured identifiers usually consist of multiple parts separated by a predefined character (such as a hyphen or slash). In the system, these parts are called ''segments'', and the structure definition of the object identifier is called a ''segmented key''. You can use segmented keys to help users remember long identifiers and enter the identifiers on data entry forms, because smaller parts are easier to remember and enter than long sequences of letters and digits are.{br}

For example, general ledger subaccounts can have the following structure for a six-character identifier: a two-character regional branch code, a one-digit department number, and a three-character product type. Thus, the subaccount identifier ''CA-1-T32'' denotes a subaccount of the California branch (''CA''), department ''1'', related to the product ''T32''.{br}

 Acumatica ERP also provides the automatic numbering option for segmented keys. You can configure the numbering sequence to be used in a specific segmented key. An auto-numbered numbering sequence can be applied to only one segment of the multi-segmented key. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Multiple_Numbering_Sequences|Numbering Sequence Usage].{br}

 Acumatica ERP provides you a number of preconfigured segmented keys. You can use preconfigured segmented keys, either as they have been designed or with changes to the settings to better meet your needs. You can also configure your own segmented keys.{br}{TOC}
==Preconfigured Segmented Keys==
 Acumatica ERP provides the following built-in segmented keys, which can be used for only the types of system objects for which they were designed:[anchor|#_3a8533b0-92c5-4fb8-bb9c-974bc89ae880]

 Acumatica ERP provides a number of preconfigured segmented keys. Also you can configure your own segmented keys and the settings of the keys. In this topic, you will read about the preconfigured segmented keys, the steps you perform to configure segmented keys, and the settings of the keys.{br}{TOC}
==Configuration and Maintenance of Segmented Keys==
The process of configuring a segmented key consists of the following general steps:[anchor|#_0b9ce9db-25a5-4331-87a1-07e4a4134303]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form, you select the predefined key that you want to configure, or you add a new key. Then you specify the settings of the key, such as the module where the segmented key will be used, the identifier of the numbering sequence that will be applied to the segment that is auto-numbered, and the lookup mode. (For details on the lookup mode, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Lookup_Modes|Lookup Modes for Segmented Keys ].)
#In the table on the same form, you specify the settings of each segment of the segmented key, such as the length, mask, and separator. You can define one segment per key as auto-numbered, which means that the system will automatically increase the value of this segment by the numbering step specified for the numbering sequence. You can add any number of segments (but you must specify at least one) as long as the total length of all segments does not exceed the maximum length specified for the segmented key. The maximum length does not include the segment separators.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_30_00|Segment Values] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203000|CS203000]) form, you add the values of each segment that will not be auto-numbered. When you add new values for a segment on this form, the system automatically converts case of each value (if the '''Case Conversion''' check box has been selected for the segment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form) and checks whether the value meets the input mask requirements (which are specified in the '''Edit Mask''' column for the segment). Users will use these segment values to create the object identifiers described by the segmented key and to enter the identifiers on data entry forms.
#On the form that you use to manage the objects whose identifiers are described by the segmented key (such as [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_20_30_00|Subaccounts] ([~/?ScreenId=GL203000|GL203000]), which is used to manage subaccounts), you add the objects and their identifiers. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Business_Accounts_Identifiers|Business Account Identifiers].
[anchor|#_d4f43fb4-2390-4d6f-b250-9579986772a3]
==Changes to the Structure of Segmented Keys==
You can change the structure of the segmented key after the identifiers were created as follows:[anchor|#_66630010-1281-4d8d-9f51-657bea60c6ff]
*Add a segment to the segmented key. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__how_Add_Segment_to_Segmented_Key|To Add a Segment to an Existing Segmented Key].
*Remove a segment from the segmented key. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__how_Remove_Segment_from_Segmented_key|To Remove a Segment from an Existing Segmented Key].
*Split a one-segment identifier into multiple segments. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__how_Split_Segment_to_Multiple_Segments|To Split a One-Segment Identifier into Multiple Segments].
*Change the length of a segment. For more information, see [[#_87152ff2-a86a-43e6-a549-aee450adacbf|Change of Segment Length].

If you need to make other changes to the segmented keys, contact your Acumatica support provider.[anchor|#_87152ff2-a86a-43e6-a549-aee450adacbf]
==Change of Segment Length==
Due to changes in business processes of your organization, you may need to change a segment length. When you change the length of an existing segment, the system checks the following:[anchor|#_6f40ed81-9728-4ce6-93e0-5e17efc033cd]
#Whether any values of this segment have been defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_30_00|Segment Values] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203000|CS203000]) form. The system acts based on this check as follows:
#*Segment values have been defined: The system does not change the segment length; it instead displays an error message.
#*No values have been defined: The system performs the next check.
#Whether any identifiers with the segment have been defined in the system. (If they have, you can see these values on the form that is used to manage the object identifiers, such as the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_20_30_00|Subaccounts] ([~/?ScreenId=GL203000|GL203000]) form.) The system acts based on this check as follows: 
#*No identifiers defined: The system changes the segment length.
#*Identifiers defined: The system estimates the length of each segment and acts based on this estimation as follows:
#**If the length of any found value exceeds the new length of the segment, the system does not change the segment length; it instead displays an error message. In this case, you need to specify a longer segment length or delete identifiers that contain longer values of the segment.
#**If the length of all found values is equal to or shorter than the new length, the system changes the segment length. For found segment values whose length is shorter than the new segment length, the system adds spaces to the end of each value to make its length equal to the new segment length.

For example, suppose that there are three segments in the ''INSUBITEM'' segmented key: ''Color'', ''Size'', and ''Material''. You want to reduce the length of the ''Size'' segment from 4 to 3. Suppose that no values are defined for the segment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_30_00|Segment Values] form. The system acts as follows based on its check for values of segmented keys with the segment:[anchor|#_953b5c45-ed07-407e-9e11-513365a01b59]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_50_00|Subitems] ([~/?ScreenId=IN205000|IN205000]) form, suppose that only the ''BLK-6-Leather'' identifier is defined. The system will change the length of the ''Size'' segment and will add spaces to the end of the segment in the found segmented key: ''BLK-6&#95;&#95;-Leather''.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_50_00|Subitems] form, suppose that the ''WHT-XXXL-Cotton'' identifier is defined. The system will not change the length of the ''Size'' segment because the length of the ''XXXL'' value is 4 (which is greater than 3).

==Lookup Modes for Segmented Keys==
In the '''Lookup Mode''' box of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form, you can select one of the following modes:[anchor|#_53dfc226-3645-498c-b4c3-05f826835041]
*''By Segment: All Avail. Segment Values'': In this mode, a user enters an identifier segment by segment. While typing a segment value, the user can press F3 to open the list of the segment values (as specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_30_00|Segment Values] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203000|CS203000]) form) and select a value from this list.
*:If you select this mode, the '''Allow Adding New Values On the Fly''' check box becomes selected and unavailable for the segmented key. If the '''Validate''' check box is cleared for the segment whose value a user is typing while entering an identifier, the user can enter a new segment value. The system automatically saves this value to the list of segment values and creates a new segmented key value. If the '''Validate''' check box is selected for the segment whose value the user is typing, the user cannot enter a new segment value.
*''By Segment: Child Segment Values'': In this mode, a user enters an identifier segment by segment. While typing a segment value, the user can press F3 to open the list of the segment values that have been specified on the object management form (such as the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form). This list is filtered by the value of the previous segment or segments. When the user is typing segment values, the system lists existing object identifiers. This mode is displayed for only the segmented keys that support the hierarchical structure of segments: ''INITEMCLASS''. For details on hierarchy in item class identifiers, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Item_Classes_GeneralInfo|Item Classes for Stock Items: General Information].

==Guidelines for Selecting a Lookup Mode==
For the majority of predefined segmented keys, you cannot change the default ''By Segmented Key'' mode because usually identifiers that these segmented keys describe are one-segmented.{br}

The most common objects with multi-segmented identifiers are General Ledger subaccounts and inventory subitems. For the segmented keys that describe these identifiers, you can select a lookup mode that best meets you business requirements. For the ''INSUBITEM'' and ''SUBACCOUNT'' segmented keys, consider the following guidelines as you select the lookup mode:[anchor|#_9b8be426-a342-451b-9b20-809286f5feba]
*If the segmented key has only one segment, you can select the ''By Segmented Key'' mode. In this case, entering identifiers segment-by-segment is the same thing as entering identifiers as a whole.
*You can select the ''By Segmented Key'' mode if all of the following conditions are met: The segmented key includes multiple segments, the number of identifiers based on the segmented key is between two and ten, and users are not allowed to enter new identifiers on the fly on data entry forms. In this case, users can select the entire identifier more quickly than they could select the values of each segment.
*If the segmented key includes multiple segments and users are allowed to enter new values on the fly, you can select the ''By Segment: All Avail. Segment Values'' mode and clear the '''Validate''' check box for all segments. Entering new identifiers on the fly is useful when the number of segments and the number of values in each segment could produce so many combinations that it would be labor-intensive to enter all identifiers in advance.
*You can select the ''By Segment: All Avail. Segment Values'' mode and select the '''Validate''' check box for each segment if all of the following conditions are met: The segmented key includes multiple segments, the number of identifiers based on the segmented key is more than ten, and users are not allowed to enter new identifiers on the fly. In this case, the system will display an error message if a user enters a segment value not from the list and saves his or her changes.

For segmented keys that support a hierarchical structure (''INITEMCLASS''), you can select the ''By Segment: Child Segment Values'' mode.

 Acumatica ERP uses numbering sequences to automatically generate identifiers (IDs) for new objects of a certain type when they are created, whether manually by users or automatically by the system. Numbering sequences are used, for example, for customer invoices, vendor bills, inventory receipts and issues, Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable payments, batches, schedules, and allocations. {br}

You can use the predefined numbering sequences without changes, or you can modify them to suit your organization&rsquo;s needs. Also, you can create new sequences. If your organization has branches, numbering sequences for documents associated with branches can be split into subsequences that have different prefixes or specify different ranges of numbers. {br}{TOC}
==Numbering Sequence Parameters==
Each numbering sequence is defined by parameters set on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_10_10|Numbering Sequences] ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) form. The system uses the following parameters to calculate the numbers it assigns to new objects: 
*'''Start Number''': The number to be used first in this numbering sequence.
*'''Last Number''': The number most recently assigned to an object in this numbering sequence. Each time the system assigns a number to a new object, it updates this value.
*'''Numbering Step''': The increment used in the numbering sequence to generate the next number; for each new number, this increment is added to the rightmost numerical portion of the last number used.
*'''End Number''': The number to be used last in this numbering sequence.

You can set other parameters on the form, too, such as the following: 
*'''Start Date''': The date when this sequence will take effect. For sequences that include subsequences, you can specify the date when each subsequence first becomes effective.
*'''New Number Symbol''': An alphanumeric string (of up to 15 characters) used to indicate that a new number for an object will be assigned.
*'''Warning Number''': The minimum number that generates a warning that available numbers will be used up soon. When this number (and each number that exceeds it) is assigned, the system displays a warning. If the end number is near or has been reached for a numbering sequence, you should create a new sequence in the appropriate module and assign it to this object type.

==Format of Identifiers==
 Acumatica ERP generates numbers or object IDs for a numbering sequence as alphanumeric strings. The precise format of the numbers is defined by the numbering sequence parameters, such as the start number and the end number, set on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_10_10|Numbering Sequences] form. The same number of characters must be used for all parameters in a numbering sequence; the system issues a warning if the format of any parameter differs. {br}

A numbering sequence may have numbers that start with a ''prefix'', an alphanumeric string that ends in an alphabetic character. The system automatically detects a prefix in the start number when alphabetic characters are used. If a prefix is used, auto-numbering is applied to only the rightmost numeric positions. The same prefix must be used for the start, warning, and end numbers. {br}

Suppose, for example, that you want to create sequences to automatically assign meaningful IDs to sales orders of different types. For different order types, different two-letter abbreviations are used. For general sales orders (the ''SO'' type), you might set the start number as ''S0000001'', the warning number as ''S0995000'', and the end number as ''S0999999''. For cash sales orders, you might set the start number, warning number, and end number as ''CS000001'', ''CS997000'', and ''CS999999'', respectively. Note that all these numbers use the same prefix followed by six digits. 
==Subsequences==
A numbering sequence may consist of any number of sequences or subsequences, each intended for a different branch or starting on a specific date. Subsequences can be helpful when, for example, an organization uses different invoice numbers in each season of the year. If the organization has branches, it is convenient when document reference numbers indicate a specific branch of origin by a branch-specific prefix or range of numbers. {br}

Each subsequence is defined by a branch, start date, start number, end number, numbering step, and start date. Numbers are assigned as follows: 
#The first new object is assigned the start number depending on the branch and the start date. (The start number is also assigned to the last used number.)
#The rightmost numerical portion of the second number and subsequent numbers for the same branch is equal to that of the last number plus the numbering step. The last number value is updated.
#When the start date specified for any subsequence occurs, the system switches to using that subsequence.
((({S:Hint}The numbers available in one subsequence cannot be used in another subsequence of the same sequence. 
)))
==Usage Tips==
Follow these tips when you define numbering sequences: 
*Objects get numbers in the order in which they are created. Thus, if you use the same numbering sequence to identify objects of different types, successive numbers can be assigned to objects of different types. The disadvantage of this approach is that objects&rsquo; identifiers won&rsquo;t help you distinguish between their types.
*If you use similar numbering sequences for different document or objects that might be listed on the same form, duplicate numbers may occur, which could confuse users. It is better to define a numbering sequence so that the start number of one sequence exceeds the end number of the previous one, or to use different prefixes for each numbering sequence. These approaches ensure that duplicate numbers will not occur.

In Acumatica ERP, business accounts are used to store information related to customers, vendors, and employees, as well as similar information about your organization&rsquo;s companies and branches (this information is used on outgoing documents). Acumatica ERP gives you flexibility in configuring identifiers for these business accounts, as described in this article. If needed, you can use similar but distinct identifiers for customers, vendors, and employees. {br}

The same business can be both your customer and your vendor, with a separate identifier for each capacity. Also, customers and vendors can be organized into a hierarchy that reflects their actual business relationships. {br}{TOC}[anchor|#_d6c04c46-eb0b-4da8-bba6-f9723297a7f5]
==Creation of Objects with Identifiers Based on Segmented Keys==
After you have configured the segmented key and populated its segments, you can create objects with identifiers based on this key on forms that are designed for managing the objects. For example, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_20_30_00|Subaccounts] ([~/?ScreenId=GL203000|GL203000]) form to create subaccounts. If the '''Allow Adding New Values On the Fly''' check box is selected for the segmented key, users can create the objects when they are filling in data entry forms.{br}

When you create an object identifier defined by a segmented key with multiple segments, you see the input mask (for example, ''––/–/–––'', where the slash is a segment separator) that shows the number of segments and the length of each segment.{br}

You can configure the system to make sure that users create correct identifiers by selecting the '''Validate''' check box for each segment of the key on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form. With this check box selected, users can enter the identifier that consists of only existing segment values that have been created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_30_00|Segment Values] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203000|CS203000]) form.{br}

If you clear the '''Validate''' check box for a segment, users can create an identifier that contains new segment values. In this case, the system validates the new segment values only in accordance with the segment definition: the type of the string and its length. The system does not copy the new segment values that users enter on the fly to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_30_00|Segment Values] form. If needed, you can add these values manually to the list of segment values.((({S:Warn}For objects with identifiers that support hierarchical structure (such as inventory item classes), the system does not perform validation of segments controlled by the '''Validate''' check box because you enter segment values for these objects on a form used for managing the objects (such as the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form).
)))
==Defining Identifiers for Business Accounts==
You can decide upon and configure the rules for creating business account identifiers during system deployment. The ''BIZACCT'' segmented key, which you define by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form, is used for configuring the general structure of identifiers for business accounts, including accounts for your companies and branches. This structure includes the overall identifier length, the number of segments, and the type of segments. {br}

Before you configure the key, consider the information you would like to include in company, branch, vendor, customer, and employee IDs. Make such decisions as how many segments the identifiers will have, whether auto-numbering should be used for one of the segments, and whether values for each segment should be validated. (These options are described in more detail in [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Identifier_Segmentation|Segmented Identifiers].) You also need to decide whether to use the ''BIZACCT'' segmented key directly for companies, branches, vendors, customers, and employees or to configure separate keys based on ''BIZACCT'', as the following sections describe. {br}

Once you have defined all needed segmented keys, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_30_00|Segment Values] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203000|CS203000]) form to enter the valid values for segments that should be validated. 
==Using BIZACCT Directly for Companies, Branches, Vendors, Customers, and Employees==
Once you have configured the ''BIZACCT'' segmented key, it can be used by default for company, branch, vendor, customer, and employee identifiers. However, in this case, if you turn on auto-numbering for ''BIZACCT'', entities of different types (such as companies, vendors, or employees) will not be easy to distinguish by their identifiers.
==Configuring Separate Identifiers for Companies, Branches, Vendors, Customers, and Employees==
If you want these types of identifiers to look different at a glance, use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] form to configure the ''COMPANY'', ''BRANCH'', ''VENDOR'', ''CUSTOMER'', and ''EMPLOYEE'' segmented keys, all of which inherit their structure (number of segments, segment types, and overall length) from the ''BIZACCT'' key. If ''BIZACCT'' has an auto-numbered segment, consider using different prefixes for numbering sequences for each type of identifier. ((({S:Hint}
For the ''COMPANY'', ''BRANCH'', ''CUSTOMER'', ''VENDOR'', and ''EMPLOYEE '' segmented keys, you can configure only limited differences, such as different sets of values for validated segments, or different prefixes for the auto-numbering sequences if one of the segments in the ''BIZACCT '' key was configured as an auto-numbered segment.
)))
==Using Parent Accounts==
In Acumatica ERP, your company&rsquo;s customers and vendors can be organized into hierarchies with ''parent'' and ''child'' companies to reflect the relations among the companies while allowing you to preserve each as a separate entity in the system, if needed. Any of your vendors or customers can be a parent of another vendor or customer. When you create a vendor or customer business account, you can select the ID of its parent in the '''Parent Account''' list on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form. On either form, this list includes all vendor and customer identifiers based on the ''BIZACCT '' segmented key, so that you can pick the appropriate vendor or customer as a parent. {br}

On some forms, users can select objects of different types from the same lookup list. For example, when preparing time cards, employees can select in the same box either a project or a contract on which they spent their work hours. To make this possible, identifiers of these objects should have similar structures. The structure that should be common for multiple segmented keys, is defined in the ''parent'' segmented key. Segmented keys for object identifiers that should have similar structure are called ''child'' keys and inherit their structure from the ''parent'' key. That is, the child key has the same number of segments as the parent key, and all its segments have the same lengths as the respective segments of the parent key.{br}

By default, the child key has the same structure as the parent key, and the segment values specified for the parent key are available for identifiers based on the child key. However, you can make identifiers based on a child key distinguishable at a glance from identifiers based on the parent key in the following ways:[anchor|#ul_ubk_pkn_xh]
*For an alphanumeric segment, you can enter different sets of values for the parent and child key segments.
*For an auto-numbered segment, you can assign numbering sequences with different properties—for example, with different prefixes.

In the example of time cards mentioned in the beginning of the section, the ''CONTRACT'' segmented key inherits its structure from the ''PROJECT'' segmented key. For overview of other keys with inheritance relations, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Business_Accounts_Identifiers|Business Account Identifiers].

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Business Account Identifiers In  Acumatica ERP, business accounts are used to store information related to customers, vendors, 				and employees, as well as similar information about your organization's companies 				and branches (this information is used on outgoing documents).  Acumatica ERP gives you flexibility in configuring identifiers for these business accounts, as 				described in this article. If needed, you can use similar but distinct identifiers 				for customers, vendors, and employees.  The same business can be both your customer and your vendor, with a separate 				identifier for each capacity. Also, customers and vendors can be organized into a 				hierarchy that reflects their actual business relationships.  Creation of Objects with Identifiers Based on Segmented Keys After you have configured the segmented key and populated its segments, you can 				create objects with identifiers based on this key on forms that are designed for 				managing the objects. For example, you use the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL203000|GL203000]) Subaccounts (GL203000) form to create subaccounts. If the  Allow 					Adding New Values On the Fly  check box is selected for the segmented 				key, users can create the objects when they are filling in data entry forms. When you create an object identifier defined by a segmented key with multiple 				segments, you see the input mask (for example,  ––/–/––– , where the slash is a 				segment separator) that shows the number of segments and the length of each 				segment. You can configure the system to make sure that users create correct identifiers by 				selecting the  Validate  check box for each segment of the key 				on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) Segmented Keys (CS202000) form. With this check box 				selected, users can enter the identifier that consists of only existing segment 				values that have been created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203000|CS203000]) Segment Values 				(CS203000) form. If you clear the  Validate  check box for a segment, users can 				create an identifier that contains new segment values. In this case, the system 				validates the new segment values only in accordance with the segment definition: the 				type of the string and its length. The system does not copy the new segment values 				that users enter on the fly to the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203000|CS203000]) Segment Values 				form. If needed, you can add these values manually to the list of segment 				values. For objects with identifiers that support hierarchical structure (such as 				inventory item classes), the system does not perform validation of segments 				controlled by the  Validate  check box because you enter 				segment values for these objects on a form used for managing the objects (such as 				the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000) form). Defining Identifiers for Business Accounts You can decide upon and configure the rules for creating business account identifiers 				during system deployment. The  BIZACCT  segmented key, which you define by 				using the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) Segmented Keys (CS202000) form, is used for 				configuring the general structure of identifiers for business accounts, including 				accounts for your companies and branches. This structure includes the overall 				identifier length, the number of segments, and the type of segments.  Before you configure the key, consider the information you would like to include in 				company, branch, vendor, customer, and employee IDs. Make such decisions as how many 				segments the identifiers will have, whether auto-numbering should be used for one of 				the segments, and whether values for each segment should be validated. (These 				options are described in more detail in  Segmented Identifiers.) You also need to 				decide whether to use the  BIZACCT  segmented key directly for companies, 				branches, vendors, customers, and employees or to configure separate keys based on 					 BIZACCT , as the following sections describe.  Once you have defined all needed segmented keys, you use the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203000|CS203000]) Segment Values (CS203000) form to enter the valid 				values for segments that should be validated.  Using BIZACCT Directly for Companies, Branches, Vendors, Customers, and 				Employees Once you have configured the  BIZACCT  segmented key, it can be used by default 				for company, branch, vendor, customer, and employee identifiers. 				 However, 				in this case, if you turn on auto-numbering for  BIZACCT , entities of 				different types (such as companies, vendors, or employees) will not be easy to 				distinguish by their identifiers . Configuring Separate Identifiers for Companies, Branches, Vendors, Customers, and 				Employees If you want these types of identifiers to look different at a glance, use the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) Segmented Keys form to configure the  COMPANY ,  BRANCH , 					 VENDOR ,  CUSTOMER , and  EMPLOYEE  segmented keys, all of which 				inherit their structure (number of segments, segment types, and overall length) from 				the  BIZACCT  key. If  BIZACCT  has an auto-numbered segment, consider 				using different prefixes for numbering sequences for each type of identifier.  For the  COMPANY ,  BRANCH ,  CUSTOMER ,  VENDOR , and 						 EMPLOYEE   segmented keys, you can configure only limited differences, 					such as different sets of values for validated segments, or different prefixes 					for the auto-numbering sequences if one of the segments in the  BIZACCT   					key was configured as an auto-numbered segment. Using Parent Accounts In  Acumatica ERP, your company's customers and vendors can be organized into hierarchies with 					 parent  and  child  companies to reflect the relations among the 				companies while allowing you to preserve each as a separate entity in the system, if 				needed. Any of your vendors or customers can be a parent of another vendor or 				customer. When you create a vendor or customer business account, you can select the 				ID of its parent in the  Parent Account  list on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors (AP303000) or   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000) form. On either form, this 				list includes all vendor and customer identifiers based on the  BIZACCT   				segmented key, so that you can pick the appropriate vendor or customer as a parent.  On some forms, users can select objects of different types from the same lookup list. 				For example, when preparing time cards, employees can select in the same box either 				a project or a contract on which they spent their work hours. To make this possible, 				identifiers of these objects should have similar structures. The structure that 				should be common for multiple segmented keys, is defined in the  parent  				segmented key. Segmented keys for object identifiers that should have similar 				structure are called  child  keys and inherit their structure from the 					 parent  key. That is, the child key has the same number of segments as the 				parent key, and all its segments have the same lengths as the respective segments of 				the parent key. By default, the child key has the same structure as the parent key, and the segment 				values specified for the parent key are available for identifiers based on the child 				key. However, you can make identifiers based on a child key distinguishable at a 				glance from identifiers based on the parent key in the following ways: For an alphanumeric segment, you can enter different sets of values for the 					parent and child key segments. For an auto-numbered segment, you can assign numbering sequences with different 					properties—for example, with different prefixes. In the example of time cards mentioned in the beginning of the section, the 					 CONTRACT  segmented key inherits its structure from the  PROJECT  				segmented key. For overview of other keys with inheritance relations, see  Business Account Identifiers.

If you have created a one-segment identifier (for example, for the ''SUBACCOUNT'' segmented key) and then realized that it is more convenient for users if the identifier has more segments, you can split the segment into multiple parts without losing the existing values of the identifier.{br}

In this topic, you will read about how to split a one-segment ''SUBACCOUNT'' key into two segments.
==To Split a One-Segment ''SUBACCOUNT'' Segmented Key into Two Segments==
For example, suppose that the ''SUBACCOUNT'' key has the following values: ''AAA000'', ''AAA010'', ''BBB000'', and ''BBB010''; also suppose that you need to split the values into two segments of three characters each. To resolve this task, you do the following:[anchor|#_c284ea7f-508e-486d-a28e-e7732bdd52e8]
#Add the second segment as follows:
##Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form.
##In the '''Segmented Key ID''' box of the Summary area, select the ''SUBACCOUNT'' segmented key.
##On the table toolbar, click '''Add Row''' to add a new segment.
##In the '''Description''' column, add a description of the new segment.
##In the '''Length''' column, type <tt>3</tt>.
##Save your changes.
#Change the existing values of the ''SUBACCOUNT'' key as follows:
##Navigate to the Subaccounts (GL203000) form.
##For each subaccount value, move the last three characters of the first segment to the second segment. For example, change ''AAA000'' to ''AAA&#95;&#95;&#95;-000''.
##Save your changes.
#Change the length of the first segment as follows:
##Navigate to the Segmented Keys form.
##In the '''Segmented Key ID''' box of the Summary area, select the ''SUBACCOUNT'' segmented key.
##In the '''Length''' column of the row with the first segment, type <tt>3</tt>.
##Save your changes.

As a result, the ''SUBACCOUNT'' key will have the following values: ''AAA-000'', ''AAA-010'', ''BBB-000'', and ''BBB-010''.]]></column>

To Split a One-Segment  SUBACCOUNT  Segmented Key into Two Segments For example, suppose that the  SUBACCOUNT  key has the following values:                      AAA000 ,  AAA010 ,  BBB000 , and  BBB010 ; also suppose                 that you need to split the values into two segments of three characters each. To                 resolve this task, you do the following: Add the second segment as follows: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) Segmented Keys (CS202000) form. In the  Segmented Key ID  box of the Summary area,                             select the  SUBACCOUNT  segmented key. On the table toolbar, click  Add Row  to add a new                             segment. In the  Description  column, add a description of                             the new segment. In the  Length  column, type                                  3 . Save your changes. Change the existing values of the  SUBACCOUNT  key as follows: Navigate to the Subaccounts (GL203000) form. For each subaccount value, move the last three characters of the first                             segment to the second segment. For example, change  AAA000  to                                  AAA___-000 . Save your changes. Change the length of the first segment as follows: Navigate to the Segmented Keys form. In the  Segmented Key ID  box of the Summary area,                             select the  SUBACCOUNT  segmented key. In the  Length  column of the row with the first                             segment, type  3 . Save your changes. As a result, the  SUBACCOUNT  key will have the following values:                  AAA-000 ,  AAA-010 ,  BBB-000 , and  BBB-010 . ]]></column>

 Acumatica ERP provides a range of tools to control the format of passwords, user and object names, phone numbers, email addresses, and postal codes that are entered in the system. You can use ''input masks'' to implement restrictions to allow particular types of characters in certain positions of these entities. Also, you can use regular expressions to define specific requirements for text strings entered by a user.{br}{TOC}
==Input Masks==
You create input masks by using the following symbols: [anchor|#_f9cb5363-4686-4184-b633-06fabe427b7c]
*''C'': Designates any character
*''A'': Designates any letter or digit
*''L'': Designates a letter only
*''#'': Designates a digit only
*''?'': Designates an optional letter
*''9'': Designates an optional digit

You can also use the following control symbols (which are not placeholders) to affect the characters that follow them: [anchor|#_5f1a7b3b-4baa-4b22-a646-3aae12815d4a]
*&gt;: Requires that all letters that follow &gt; are uppercase letters. If a lowercase letter is typed, the system will automatically convert it to uppercase. Subsequent &gt; symbols will toggle the uppercase functionality. For example, the mask ''&gt;LL&gt;LL&gt;LL'' will cause the uppercase to be turned off for the second ''LL'' characters, but then turned back on for the third LL characters.
*&lt;: Requires that all letters that follow &lt; are lowercase letters. If an uppercase letter is typed, the system converts it to lowercase. Subsequent &lt; characters will toggle the lowercase functionality. For example, the mask'' &lt;LL&lt;LL&lt;LL'' will cause the lowercase to be turned off for the second ''LL'' characters, but then turned back on the third ''LL'' characters.
*\: Causes the next character to be displayed literally, as it is.
*&ldquo;&ldquo;: Causes the characters within the quotation marks to be displayed literally.
{br}{TOC}
==Regular Expressions==
You can use standard syntax for regular expressions in Acumatica ERP. For more information on regular expressions, see the [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ae5bf541(v=vs.100)|Microsoft Software Developer Network].{br}{TOC}

==Examples of Masks and Regular Expressions==
The following table provides examples of masks and regular expressions you might use. 
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="20%" ! Object
!width="80%" ! Description
|- 
|  United States Phone Numbers
|  The input mask ''(###) ###-####'' forces users to enter the three-digit area code in parentheses, with the other seven digits separated by a hyphen (''-'') in two groups: one with three digits and the other with four digits. ((({S:Hint} If certain input values will always have the same characters, just type the characters within the mask.
)))
|- 
|  United States Postal Codes
|  If you want users to enter a five-digit ZIP code followed by a mandatory four-digit extension, use the mask ''#####-####''. If, however, you want to make the four-digit extension optional, use a regular expression, such as {{/^\d{5}([\-]\d)?$/;}}
|- 
|  Canadian Postal Codes
|  The mask ''&gt;L#L #L#'' ensures that the postal code will be entered as two three-character groups separated by a space: 
*The first group contains an uppercase letter and a digit, and an uppercase letter.
*The second group contains a digit, an uppercase letter, and a digit.

Only the following letters are actually allowed: ''A, B, C, E, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, R, S, T, V, X,'' and ''Y''. The following regular expression ensures that the postal code will comply with this rule too: {{/^\s*[a-ceghj-npr-tvxy]\d[a-z](\s)?\d[a-z]\d\s*$/i;}}
|- 
|  United Kingdom Postcodes
|  The format of United Kingdom postcodes may be represented by a set of masks: 
*L# #LL
*L## #LL
*L## #LL
*LL# #LL
*LL## #LL
*LL#L #LL

Some letters (''CIKMOV'') are not allowed in these codes. Because only one mask is allowed, you can create a regular expression such as the following for United Kingdom postal codes: {{[[A-Z]{1,2}[0-9R][0-9A-Z]? [0-9][A-Z-[CIKMOV]]{2};}}. (For more information about the format of postcodes in the United Kingdom, see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postcodes_in_the_United_Kingdom|Postcodes in the United Kingdom].)

==Regular Expressions Usage in Password Masks==
In some cases, you may need to set a regular expression to enforce the company&rsquo;s password policies. For example, a regular expression could define valid and invalid characters, specific formats (for example, the password must begin with a letter), or minimum and maximum password lengths. Below are some examples of regular expressions and their explanations: 
*{{^(?=.*\d).{4,8}$}}: The password must be four to eight characters long and include at least one numeric digit.
*{{^[a-zA-Z]\w{3,9}$}}: The password must be four to ten characters long, the first character must be a letter, and no character is permitted except letters, numbers, and underscores.

Input masks may be created to help users enter data in the required format. Masks are used, for example, for phone numbers and postal codes. Moreover, regular expressions can be created to validate the entered values, because the values for some elements must meet not only input format requirements but also specific rules. {br}

For more details on the format of masks, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Examples_Mask_and_RegExp_Usage|Examples of Masks and Regular Expressions Usage ]. 
==Country and State Validation==
In Acumatica ERP, countries are identified by a two-letter code in accordance with ISO 3166. In data that is imported to the system, the country field may contain a name instead of the required code. A similar situation can occur with states or provinces within countries. To help the system identify each country or state during import, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_40_00|Countries/States] ([~/?ScreenId=CS204000|CS204000]) form, you can select the appropriate validation modes for countries and for states.{br}

In the '''Validation Mode''' box in the '''Country Validation''' section of this form, you can select one of the following modes, which the system will use to validate each value in a country field during import:[anchor|#_8662f7d2-a223-4eed-9df4-bc88406ea27c]
*''By Country ID'' (default): The system validates the entered value by using the ID of the selected country. 
*:You use this mode if users enter the country on forms manually or when imported data usually contains country codes and you want to ensure that these codes are valid codes in accordance with ISO 3166.
*''By Country ID and Name'': The system validates the entered value by using the ID and name of the selected country.
*:You use this mode when data is imported to Acumatica ERP and it contains either country IDs or country names that are spelled as they are in the system.
*''By Country ID, Name, and Regexp'': The system validates the entered value by using the ID, the name of the selected company, and the regular expression (which is specified in the '''Lookup Regexp''' box of the '''Country Validation / Lookup''' section of this form).
*:You use this mode if imported data may contain a country name typed with errors or differences from the country name entered in the system. (For example, suppose that the imported data contains ''England'' but the country name is ''United Kingdom of Great Britain'' in the system.)
{br}

For each country with states or provinces, in the '''Validation Mode''' box in the '''State Validation''' section of this form, you can select one of the following modes, which the system will use to validate each value in a state field during import:[anchor|#_5ddef4f2-f073-4785-9818-690249df9a39]
*''No Validation'' (default): The system does not validate the state ID or name. You do not need to change this mode if states were not defined for the selected country on this form.
*''By State ID'': The system validates the entered value by using the list of state IDs defined for the selected country on this form.
*:You use this mode if users enter states on forms manually or when imported data usually contains state IDs that are spelled as they are in the system.
*''By State ID and Name'': The system validates the entered value by using the lists of state IDs and state names defined for the selected country on this form.
*:You use this mode when data is imported to Acumatica ERP and it contains either state IDs or names spelled as they are in the system.
*''By State ID, Name, and Regexp'': The system validates the entered value by using the state ID, state name, and regular expression (which is specified in the '''Validation Regexp''' box of the '''States/Provinces''' table of this form).
*:You use this mode if imported data may contain a state name typed with errors or differences from the state name entered in the system.
{br}

When a country data is imported to the system along with other data, the system validates the value in the country field as follows:[anchor|#_57d59b63-6a51-4657-80de-5904f56c38ba]
#Regardless of the validation mode specified for countries, checks whether the imported value is one of the country IDs defined in the system. The system processes the results of this check as follows:
#*The imported value is found in the database: The system regards the entered value as a valid country ID.
#*The imported value is not found in the database: If the ''By Country ID and Name'' or ''By Country ID, Name, and Regexp'' validation mode is specified for at least one country defined in the system, the system proceeds to Step 2. If the ''By Country ID'' validation mode is specified for all countries, the system returns an error message for the import task.
#Checks whether the imported value is one of the names of the countries with the ''By Country ID and Name'' or ''By Country ID, Name, and Regexp'' validation mode specified. The system searches all matches of the imported value with the country names. The system processes the results of this check as follows:
#*Multiple matches are found in the database: The system returns an error message for the import task.
#*Only one match is found in the database: The system regards the imported value as valid and replaces the value with the country ID that corresponds to the country name it has found.
#*No match is found in the database: If the ''By Country ID, Name, and Regexp'' validation mode is specified for at least one country in the system, the system proceeds to Step 3. If there are no countries with the ''By Country ID, Name, and Regexp'' validation mode in the system, an error message is returned for the import task.
#Checks whether the imported value matches any of the regular expressions specified for the countries with the ''By Country ID, Name, and Regexp'' validation mode specified. The system searches all matches of the entered value with regular expressions. The system processes the results of this check as follows:
#*Multiple matches are found in the database: The system returns an error message for the import task.
#*Only one match is found in the database: The system regards the imported value as valid and replaces the value with the country ID that corresponds to the country name it has found.
#*No match is found in the database: The system returns an error message for the import task.

If any of the states defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_40_00|Countries/States] form has a validation mode other than ''No Validation'' (that is, if state validation is required for any state of the country), the system performs similar checks to those described above to validate the value in the state field.
==Postal codes==
Input masks for postal codes are set on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_40_00|Countries/States] ([~/?ScreenId=CS204000|CS204000]) form. They are used for input validation on the following forms: 
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_20_00|Branches] ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) 
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) 
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000])

By Country ID and Name : The system validates the entered value by using the ID and name                 of the selected country. You use this mode when data is imported to  Acumatica ERP and it contains either country IDs or country names that are spelled as they                     are in the system. By Country ID, Name, and Regexp : The system validates the entered value by using the ID,                 the name of the selected company, and the regular expression (which is specified in                 the  Lookup Regexp  box of the  Country Validation /                     Lookup  section of this form).

By State ID : The system validates the entered value by using the list of state IDs                 defined for the selected country on this form. You use this mode if users enter                     states on forms manually or when imported data usually contains state IDs that                     are spelled as they are in the system. By State ID and Name : The system validates the entered value by using the lists of state                 IDs and state names defined for the selected country on this form.

No match is found in the database: If the  By Country ID, Name, and 								Regexp  validation mode is specified for at least one country in 							the system, the system proceeds to Step 3. If there are no countries 							with the  By Country ID, Name, and Regexp  validation mode in the 							system, an error message is returned for the import task. Checks whether the imported value matches any of the regular expressions 					specified for the countries with the  By Country ID, Name, and Regexp  					validation mode specified. The system searches all matches of the entered value 					with regular expressions. The system processes the results of this check as 						follows: Multiple matches are found in the database: The system returns an error 							message for the import task. Only one match is found in the database: The system regards the imported 							value as valid and replaces the value with the country ID that 							corresponds to the country name it has found. No match is found in the database: The system returns an error message 							for the import task.

 Acumatica ERP provides GDPR compliance tools that enable you to do the following:[anchor|#_1d7e7b44-0994-42f3-84a6-2ee0655d729c]
*Track in the system whether the consent of individuals for the processing of personal data has been obtained or recalled
*Restrict the processing of personal data for particular individuals
*Erase and restore personal data
*Audit who restricted the processing of personal data or erased personal data in the system, when the event occurred, and what data was restricted

==Availability of GDPR Compliance Tools==
GDPR compliance tools become available in the system if the ''GDPR Compliance Tools'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

To be able to access GDPR compliance tools, you need to have the ''Data Privacy Controller'' role. This predefined role has ''View Only'' access to all forms that contain personal data. Also, it is the only role that has access (of the ''Delete'' type, which means that the role has complete access) to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GD_10_20_10|Restrict Personal Data] ([~/?ScreenId=GD102010|GD102010]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\GD_10_20_20|Erase Personal Data] ([~/?ScreenId=GD102020|GD102020]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\GD_10_20_30|Restricted Personal Data] ([~/?ScreenId=GD102030|GD102030]), and [HelpRoot_FormReference\GD_10_10_10|Privacy Tools Audit] ([~/?ScreenId=GD101010|GD101010]) forms.
==Affected Entities==
In the out-of-the-box Acumatica ERP instance, GDPR compliance tools affect the following entities:[anchor|#_d4d6e792-440c-4b43-9ae6-dad8df058aae]
*Business accounts, including customers, vendors, and prospects
*Documents associated with business accounts, such as sales orders, invoices, and purchase orders
*Contacts
*Leads
*Employees
*Opportunities

Also, you can mark a user-defined attribute as containing personal data by selecting the '''Contains Personal Data''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_50_00|Attributes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) form; the values of this attribute will then be treated by the system as personal data.
==Consent Settings==
To record that an individual has given his or her consent for the processing of the person&rsquo;s personal data and to specify the time interval during which the system should consider the individual&rsquo;s consent to be effective, you can use the settings in the '''Personal Data Privacy''' section, which is available on the following forms: [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]), and [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]).{br}

These settings can be mass-updated for leads, contacts, and business accounts through the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_50_30_20|Update Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR503020|CR503020]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_50_30_21|Update Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR503021|CR503021]), and [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_50_33_20|Update Business Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR503320|CR503320]) forms.
==Obfuscation of Personal Data==
To restrict the processing of personal data for individuals whose consent has expired or has been revoked, you can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GD_10_20_10|Restrict Personal Data] ([~/?ScreenId=GD102010|GD102010]) form. On the form toolbar of this form, the '''Pseudonymize''' and '''Pseudonymize All''' actions are available. These actions obfuscate the personal data contained in the selected records or in all listed records, respectively, and make this data unavailable for further processing; however, this data remains stored in the database and can be restored at any time on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GD_10_20_30|Restricted Personal Data] ([~/?ScreenId=GD102030|GD102030]) form.{br}

Records with pseudonymized personal data are not shown on generic inquiry forms, and the system does not include these records in mass processes, such as the validation of records for duplicates.{br}

By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GD_10_20_20|Erase Personal Data] ([~/?ScreenId=GD102020|GD102020]) form, you can permanently obfuscate personal data. Permanently obfuscated data cannot be restored.{br}

If the ''Scheduled Processing'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, automation schedules can be set up for the restriction or deletion of personal data.
==Restoration of Personal Data==
Sometimes you may need to restore an individual&rsquo;s personal data (for instance, if the previously expired consent has been given again). You can restore obfuscated personal data by using the '''Restore''' action on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GD_10_20_30|Restricted Personal Data] ([~/?ScreenId=GD102030|GD102030]) form. The system marks an entity with restored personal data as inactive, so you may need to manually mark the needed entity as active by using the respective entry form.
==Privacy Tools Audit==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GD_10_10_10|Privacy Tools Audit] ([~/?ScreenId=GD101010|GD101010]) form, you can monitor the history of record changes, track who restricted the processing of personal data or erased personal data in the system, when this user restricted processing or erased personal data, and what data was restricted.
==Custom Fields with Personal Data==
Any custom fields will be treated by the system as fields that contain personal data if all of the following conditions are met:[anchor|#_3d29f808-ce15-41de-9ceb-18a2988554d1]
*<tt>PXPersonalDataTable</tt> is specified for the customized DAC or cache extension.
*The <tt>PXPersonalDataField</tt> attribute is appended to the corresponding fields.
*The <tt>pseudonymizationStatus</tt> class is declared, with <tt>PXPseudonymizationStatusField</tt> specified in it.

 Acumatica ERP uses digital certificates to store sensitive information in the database encrypted and to authenticate documents (PDF files) that are shared or sent electronically. These certificates can be purchased from a recognized certification authority. Each certificate has a password that is used to validate the owner of the certificate if you need to reinstall the system or move the database.{br}

This topic describes the ways of using digital certificates in Acumatica ERP in more detail.{br}{TOC}
==Configuration Steps==
When you want to use a digital certificate in Acumatica ERP, you do the following:[anchor|#_8c2ce3e6-0296-439d-b23b-880159caf5ec]
#You import your certificate on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_30|Encryption Certificates] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200530|SM200530]) form. For a detailed procedure that describes how to import certificates, see [HelpRoot_Administration\US__How_to_Import_Digital_Certificate|To Import Certificates].
#:((({S:Hint}Digital certificates used by Acumatica ERP have the {{.pfx}} extension. Before you can import digital certificates into the system, make sure {{.pfx}} is on the list of allowed extensions on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_50|File Upload Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202550|SM202550]) form.
)))
#You apply the uploaded certificate to one of the following processes:
#*Encrypting the database: You can replace the encryption algorithm used in Acumatica ERP to encrypt sensitive data by using your encryption certificate on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_35|Certificate Replacement] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200535|SM200535]) form. For more information, see [[#_ad9bf929-99d9-40f4-becb-c813a9e40bc2|Database Encryption].
#*Signing PDF documents: You can use the imported encryption certificate for signing PDF files generated in Acumatica ERP. You can specify a default certificate (which will be used for all PDF documents generated in Acumatica ERP) in the '''PDF Signing Certificate''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_60|Security Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201060|SM201060]) form. Individual users can also select an imported certificate as a personal certificate (which overrides the default one) in the '''PDF Signing Certificate''' box on the [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\SM_20_30_10|User Profile] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) form. For details, see [[#_c05808be-e98b-42ab-a1ea-f38fefab0386|PDF Signature].
[anchor|#_ad9bf929-99d9-40f4-becb-c813a9e40bc2]
==Database Encryption==
 Acumatica ERP database stores sensitive data, such as credit card numbers and passwords, encrypted. If no encryption certificate is loaded, the base64-encryption is used. You can find the list of encrypted data on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_35|Certificate Replacement] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200535|SM200535]) form. You can replace the encryption algorithm used in Acumatica ERP with your encryption certificate. If the database of your Acumatica ERP instance is large, encryption may take a lot of time and may cause slowdowns in responses from the database. For large databases, we recommend that you postpone the start of encryption by scheduling it at a time when nobody uses the system (for example, at night). For a procedure that describes how to encrypt the database, see [HelpRoot_Administration\US__How_to_Encrypt_Database|To Encrypt the Database].[anchor|#_c05808be-e98b-42ab-a1ea-f38fefab0386]
==PDF Signature==
You can use encryption certificates to sign PDF files generated in the system. A PDF certificate protects the authenticity of a document throughout its life cycle. For example, when a company employee emails the company&rsquo;s digitally signed quarterly financial statements, the recipients of the documents can be sure of the identity of the sender and the integrity of the financial information.{br}

You can specify a default certificate that will be used for signing all the PDF documents generated by the system. You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_60|Security Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201060|SM201060]) form to specify a default certificate.{br}

In addition, you (or any other user of your Acumatica ERP instance) can select another certificate to be used as a personal certificate on the [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\SM_20_30_10|User Profile] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) form. For a user with a personal certificate, the personal certificate is used instead of the default certificate for signing PDF documents when the user creates PDF documents in the system.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
The development of automatic data processing has made it necessary to consider protecting sensitive information. In certain highly regulated industries, companies must implement auditing to address identity-management concerns related to compliance issues. Regulations such as Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) all have extensive requirements on auditing user identity and access to system resources.{br}

If your company must comply with such regulations, wants to ensure accountability and the ability to track user actions in the system, or wants to implement sound auditing procedures, you can use the field-level auditing available in Acumatica ERP.{br}

By using the field-level auditing functionality, you can monitor and record user actions on Acumatica ERP forms as they are recorded in the system. The audit trail holds records of every change users have made on the monitored forms, such as changes to documents and their properties, modifications to customer accounts or employee records, and changes in security policies. You can also see who made the changes and when they took place.{br}{TOC}
==Managing Access to Field-Level Audit Feature==
Before you start configuring and turning on auditing for specific forms, you must enable the ''Field-Level Audit'' feature. To give users the ability to configure, turn on, and turn off auditing of forms, as well as view the audit trails, you assign them the ''Field-Level Audit'' role and give them access to the forms used to manage field-level auditing. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Managing_Field_Level_Audit_Access|Management of Access to Field-Level Audit Functionality].
==Configuring and Turning on Auditing of a Form==
If you want to maintain a record of user activity on any form, you can configure and turn on auditing of the form. Granular auditing is configured, turned on, and turned off on a per-form basis. After the form audit is configured, you can quickly turn on and off auditing of the form. When you turn on the audit, every time a user makes changes to a document associated with the form and clicks '''Save''', a record is added to the audit trail the system maintains for the form. This record contains the details of the modification, including who modified the document, what changes were made, and when the changes occurred.{br}

For more granular control, you can perform auditing of individual database tables associated with the forms and specific database table fields. You can audit entire database tables or only certain database table fields, such as the fields associated with the interface elements on the form. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__How_to_Configure_Field_Level_Audit|To Configure and Turn On Field-Level Auditing for a Form].
==Viewing an Audit Trail==
When auditing is turned on for a form, you can select a document and view the changes made to the document directly from the form by clicking '''Audit History''' on the '''Tools''' menu. The audit trail shows who modified the document and when, what form was used, when the modification took place, and what changes were made.{br}

Also, you can view all the changes made in the database tables of the audited form. The audit trail shows the user who modified the document, the date and time of the update, and the details of the modification of the selected database table. You can filter the modifications that you view in any audited database table by user and by date range. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__How_to_view_Field_Level_Audit|To View a Field-Level Audit Trail].

Enabling the Field-Level Audit Feature To allow the use of field-level auditing in your system, you enable the  Field-Level 					Audit  feature by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features(CS100000)  form. For more information on enabling and disabling features, 				see  Preparing Instance: Activation and Licensing. Managing Access to Field-Level Audit Functionality You give users access to only the system objects that they need to accomplish their jobs: To let a user configure, turn on, and turn off auditing of the forms, give the 					user access to the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM205510|SM205510]) Audit (SM205510) form. To let a user view the audit trail directly from an audited form, assign the user the 						 Field-Level Audit  role. When you assign this role to a user, the 							 Audit History  command in the 							 Tools  menu on the form title bar becomes 						available to the user. The user can open any audited form, select a document 						created by using the form, and click  Audit History  to 						view the audit trail for the selected document. To let a user view the complete audit trail for the form, give the user access 					to the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM205530|SM205530]) Audit History (SM205530) form. To let a user view the list of forms for which auditing is configured and check 					whether auditing is turned on for each form, give the user access to the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM205520|SM205520]) Audit (SM205520) form. In  Acumatica ERP, you manage access to system objects by using roles. For more information about 				assigning roles to users, see  Managing User Access.

Once field-level auditing is enabled in your system, you configure and turn on auditing for each form you want to monitor. For the audited form, you can control the extent of the auditing by turning on auditing of particular database tables and fields associated with the form. Also, you can quickly turn on or off auditing of the individual database tables or the entire form.
==To Configure Auditing of a Specific Form==[anchor|#ol_m12_cd4_qj]
#You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_55_10|Audit] ([~/?ScreenId=SM205510|SM205510]) form to configure auditing in one of the following ways:
#*By navigating directly to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_55_10|Audit] form and selecting the form to be audited:
#*#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_55_10|Audit] ([~/?ScreenId=SM205510|SM205510]) form by searching for or navigating to it.
#*#In the Summary area, in the '''Screen Name''' box, select the form for which you want to configure auditing.
#*By accessing the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_55_10|Audit] form from the form to be audited, if auditing is not turned on for the selected form:
#*#Open the form for which you want to configure auditing.
#*#On the form toolbar, on the '''Tools''' menu, click '''Audit History''' to open the '''Update History''' dialog box.
#*#:((({S:Warn}If the '''Audit History''' command is missing, the selected form doesn&rsquo;t support field-level auditing.

 Acumatica ERP is an application with multitenant architecture, in which any instance includes at least one tenant that is a separate tenant. By running one instance of the application with one instance of a database, you can give multiple tenants web access to the same database. You can manage tenants locally or by using the web interface.{br}

All tenants of your instance can be split by status on active and test tenants. Active tenants are used in production; the number of active tenants you may use depends on your license. Test tenants are used to set up test environments that can be used for training purposes or for testing the system before performing potentially hazardous operations. You can have a virtually unlimited number of test tenants, although test tenants cannot be converted back to active tenants. For more information on licensing in Acumatica ERP, see [HelpRoot_Install\Licensing_Acumatica|Licensing and Activating Acumatica ERP].
==Managing Tenants Locally==
By using the Tenant Setup page of the Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard, you can do the following:[anchor|#ul_ncy_xks_tl]
*Add a new tenant to the selected instance. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\Managing_Companies_Add_new|To Add a New Tenant by Using Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard].

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
==Tenants==
When you install the Acumatica ERP application, you create at least one tenant. You can create more tenants with the help of the Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard, or directly from the Acumatica ERP application by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_20|Tenants] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203520|SM203520]) form. Because the functionality of creating new tenants is available within the application, you can create multiple tenants in the same application without signing out of the application. For details on creating tenants, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_MultiCompany_Add_Company|To Add a New Tenant by Using the Web Interface].((({S:Warn}We recommend that before you create the second and next tenants you open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_25|Space Usage] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203525|SM203525]) form and make sure that you have enough free space in the Acumatica ERP database.
)))
You can configure each tenant from scratch or create tenants by using templates based on snapshots. For more information on using snapshots as tenant templates, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Company_Templates|Snapshots as Tenant Templates]. Once the tenant is configured, users can initialize it by importing or entering the data. A tenant&rsquo;s configuration settings and entered data are not accessible from other tenants of the same application. 
==Active and Test Tenants==
You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_30|Tenant List] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203530|SM203530]) form to view the list of tenants and the statuses of the tenants (that is, if the tenant is active, test, or unlicensed) and the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_20|Tenants] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203520|SM203520]) form to add, delete, and manage particular tenants.{br}

''Active'' tenants are the tenants that have the ''Active'' status and are used in the production environment. Your license determines the number of active tenants you can add to the instance, the number of concurrent users allowed, and the set of features you can activate for the instance. {br}

''Test'' tenants are the tenants that have the ''Test'' status. You can create a virtually unlimited number of test tenants because the test tenants do not count toward the maximum number of allowed tenants, based on your license. At the same time, all test tenants have the following limitations:[anchor|#ul_ipd_2xg_ks]
*Only two concurrent users are allowed
*A test tenant cannot be converted back to an active tenant

You can use test tenants in a test environment for the following purposes:[anchor|#ul_yzg_wdn_nm]
*To test application features in a demo tenant. You can try any application feature in a tenant with demo data.
*To test whether specific configuration changes are applicable to the tenant configuration.
*To train your employees through a copy of a live tenant.

For details on setting up a test environment, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Test_Environment|Configuration of the Test Environment]. [anchor|#_55903026-815a-4006-ba6a-52e31388461b]
==The System Tenant==
When you install Acumatica ERP, the System tenant (with a '''Tenant ID''' set to ''1'') is always created automatically. {br}

The System tenant contains the preconfigured system data, such as roles, numbering sequences, and the wiki-based documentation. The system data is used by all tenants of the same application instance. {br}

By default, the System tenant is hidden on all end-user forms. All other user-created tenants inherit the initial configuration and system data (predefined data) from the System tenant. That is, all the data available in System tenant is visible to other tenants in the same database. An application update or upgrade replaces all data available in the System tenant, while the data created by users in user-created tenants remains unchanged. {br}

A snapshot created for a user-defined tenant includes all custom data available in the database for the tenant account and does not include any data contained in the System tenant. When a snapshot is being restored in the same database or another database, it uses the system data from the System tenant available in that database. [anchor|#_00438cad-c503-4843-b289-a4e202879e79]
==The Parent Tenant==
If you would like to replace the preconfigured roles, numbering sequences, and other data similarly for multiple new tenants, you can create a ''parent'' tenant that will serve as a system tenant for your new tenants. {br}

To configure a custom parent tenant, create a new tenant and provide a name that clearly indicates how this tenant will be used (for example, ''MyParent''). This tenant inherits all the data from the System tenant. In the MyParent tenant, override the preconfigured settings as needed and specify other configuration settings to be used in all the new tenants. Then when you create a new tenant by using the Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard, you specify MyParent as the new tenant&rsquo;s parent tenant; the new tenant will inherit all the data from the MyParent tenant, not the System tenant. You can create a virtually unlimited number of parent tenants; a parent tenant can be a child of another parent tenant. Users won&rsquo;t be able to sign in to a parent tenant.((({S:Warn}You can create new tenants based on the parent tenant only by using the Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard.
)))
If you create a snapshot of a tenant based on a custom parent that is not the System tenant, this snapshot will not contain the parent&rsquo;s data; when the snapshot is restored in another database with no custom parent tenant, the custom parent&rsquo;s data will be replaced by the original system data. To fully restore such a tenant from its snapshot in another database, perform the following steps: 
#Create the first new tenant.
#Restore the snapshot of the parent tenant in the first new tenant. This tenant will serve as the custom parent tenant.
#Create the second new tenant, and select the first tenant as the parent tenant for the second tenant.
#Restore the tenant snapshot with all the required data in this new tenant. 
[anchor|#_aef32d79-655d-4926-9ad3-0cab76a0d85a]
==Signing in to a Specific Tenant==
In a multitenant Acumatica ERP instance, the Tenant box appears on Sign-In page by default. Thus, the users can select the tenant to sign in to from the list of all available tenants.{br}

If you want to restrict the list of tenants a user can see only to the tenants the user has access to, select the '''Secure Tenant on Login Screen''' check box on the Tenant Setup page of the Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard. In this case, the '''Tenant''' box does not appear on the Sign-In page by default and all users first authenticate themselves by entering their login and password. Depending on the user, one of the following occurs:[anchor|#_5b6af4ed-9f91-48c8-a1bb-6cfb0f0d0b6c]
*A user who has access to only one tenant will be automatically signed in to this tenant after entering the login and password.
*A user who has access to multiple tenants and has the same credentials in these tenants must select a tenant in the Tenant box, which appears after the user has been authenticated and contains the list of tenants available for the user.
*A user who has access to multiple tenants and has different credentials for different tenants is signed in to the tenant whose credentials the user entered on the Sign-In page.
*A user who has access to multiple tenants and logs in to Acumatica ERP instance using single sign-on with an external identity provider, is signed in to the first tenant with enabled single sign-on.

==Data Sharing Between Tenants==
 Acumatica ERP provides shared data access in a multitenant configuration. You can set up the data sharing mode for all tenants on a per-table basis and the mode is applied to every tenant immediately. ((({S:Hint}Table configuration is a dangerous operation that can result in database corruption. Any changes you make are at your own risk. If you configure tables, be sure to first back up the database.
)))
You can select one of the available data sharing modes: ''Split'', ''Shared'', or ''Separate''.

If you need to create multiple similar tenants, you don&rsquo;t have to configure each tenant from scratch as described in the Acumatica ERP Implementation Guide. To speed up the implementation of new tenants, you can create and use tenant templates. In Acumatica ERP, you use the functionality of snapshots to create tenant templates.{br}

You create snapshots by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_20|Tenants] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203520|SM203520]) form. A ''snapshot'' may contain all custom data available in the database for the tenant account or only some of the data. For details on snapshots, see [HelpRoot_Administration\process_SA_Using_Snapshots_Mapref|Using Snapshots].{br}

When a tenant snapshot is restored in a newly created empty tenant, this new tenant will contain all the data that you included in the snapshot. You can restore a snapshot in the same database where it was created or import it to another website and restore it in another database. Any snapshot can be used multiple times. {br}

This topic outlines several possible method of using snapshots as tenant templates. {br}{TOC}
==Method I==
To create a new tenant that is very similar in configuration to an existing tenant without any customizations, follow the basic steps below: ((({S:Warn}A snapshot carries information about the version of the database where it was created, so before you restore a snapshot, make sure that the versions match. 
)))[anchor|#ol_xhm_lqs_tr]
#Sign in to the tenant you want to use as a template
#Take a snapshot of the tenant and do the following on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_20|Tenants] form:
#*In the '''Export mode''' box, select ''Settings only'' to include the tenant&rsquo;s configuration settings only and exclude actual documents.
#*Select the '''Prepare Data for Export''' check box.
#:For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Snapshots_Add|To Take a Snapshot]. 
#Export the snapshot, as described in [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Snapshots_Export|To Export a Snapshot]. 
#Sign in to the new the tenant.
#Import the prepared snapshot without customization data, as described in [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Snapshots_Import|To Import a Snapshot].
#Restore the data from the snapshot, as described in [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Snapshots_Restore|To Restore a Snapshot].

After the snapshot is restored, the new tenant has the same settings as the source tenant does.
==Method II==
If you need to create multiple related tenants with similar configurations, first configure the most typical one (which you will use as a prototype). At each stage of implementation, create a snapshot that includes the full data of the prototype tenant. If the tenants are related businesses, you can enter business accounts that are used by more than one tenant and add them to another snapshot that can be used for each tenant. {br}

When you create a snapshot, it appears on the list of available snapshots for the tenant on the '''Snapshots''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_20|Tenants] form. Snapshots of a specific tenant, by default, are visible to (and can be restored in) only this tenant. However, if needed, you can change the visibility of the snapshots to allow these snapshots to be visible to (and restored in) other tenants in the same database. {br}

When you create another related tenant, select the snapshot to be used as a template for the new tenant by following these guidelines: 
*Select a snapshot of a later stage of implementation if the new tenant is very similar to the prototype.
*Select a snapshot that features an earlier implementation stage if the new tenant is similar to the prototype only at some extent (to include only those configuration features that present in the new tenant).

==Method III==
Suppose you need to create multiple related tenants for which you need to replace some preconfigured settings (such as roles and numbering sequences), add custom reports and inquiries, and customize specific forms similarly. Preconfigured settings are provided by the System tenant, which is available in each installation as a hidden tenant with tenant ID ''1''. These settings are available to each tenant created in the same database. {br}

You can create a custom ''parent'' tenant that contains all the data that is shared between these tenants. To configure a custom parent tenant, perform the following general steps: 
#Create the tenant that will contain the shared data.
#Change the preconfigured settings as needed, and configure other functionality that will be used in all tenants.
#Take a snapshot of the tenant and do the following on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_20|Tenants] form:
#*In the '''Export mode''' box, select ''Full'' to include the tenant&rsquo;s configuration settings only and exclude actual documents.
#*Select the '''Prepare Data for Export''' check box.
#:For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Snapshots_Add|To Take a Snapshot]. 
#Create a new tenant in the same instance of application by using the Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard. Specify the configured tenant as the parent for the new tenant; the new tenant will inherit all the data from the parent tenant. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\Managing_Companies_Add_new|To Add a New Tenant by Using Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard] in Acumatica ERP Installation Guide.
#Repeat Step 4 to add as many new tenants as needed, all based on the custom parent tenant.

If you want to create a similar tenant in another instance of application by using the snapshot of a tenant based on the custom parent tenant, you first restore the parent tenant from its snapshot. Then you create a new empty tenant based on this custom parent tenant, and restore the snapshot with actual tenant data.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Snapshots as Tenant Templates If you need to create multiple similar tenants, you don't have to configure each tenant from 				scratch as described in the  Acumatica ERP Implementation Guide. To speed up the implementation of new tenants, you can 				create and use tenant templates. In  Acumatica ERP, you use the functionality of snapshots to create tenant templates. You create snapshots by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM203520|SM203520]) Tenants (SM203520) 				form. A  snapshot  may contain all custom data available in the database for 				the tenant account or only some of the data. For details on snapshots, see  Using Snapshots. When a tenant snapshot is restored in a newly created empty tenant, this new tenant will 				contain all the data that you included in the snapshot. You can restore a snapshot 				in the same database where it was created or import it to another website and 				restore it in another database. Any snapshot can be used multiple times.  This topic outlines several possible method of using snapshots as tenant templates.  Method I To create a new tenant that is very similar in configuration to an existing tenant without any 				customizations, follow the basic steps below:  A snapshot carries information about the version of the database where it was 				created, so before you restore a snapshot, make sure that the versions match.  Sign in to the tenant you want to use as a template Take a snapshot of the tenant and do the following on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM203520|SM203520]) Tenants 						form: In the  Export mode  box, select  Settings 								only  to include the tenant's configuration settings only and 							exclude actual documents. Select the  Prepare Data for Export  check 							box. For details, see  To Take a Snapshot.  Export the snapshot, as described in  To Export a Snapshot.  Sign in to the new the tenant. Import the prepared snapshot without customization data, as described in  To Import a Snapshot. Restore the data from the snapshot, as described in  To Restore a Snapshot. After the snapshot is restored, the new tenant has the same settings as the source tenant 				does. Method II If you need to create multiple related tenants with similar configurations, first configure 				the most typical one (which you will use as a prototype). At each stage of 				implementation, create a snapshot that includes the full data of the prototype 				tenant. If the tenants are related businesses, you can enter business accounts that 				are used by more than one tenant and add them to another snapshot that can be used 				for each tenant.  When you create a snapshot, it appears on the list of available snapshots for the tenant on 				the  Snapshots  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM203520|SM203520]) Tenants form. Snapshots of a 				specific tenant, by default, are visible to (and can be restored in) only this 				tenant. However, if needed, you can change the visibility of the snapshots to allow 				these snapshots to be visible to (and restored in) other tenants in the same 				database.  When you create another related tenant, select the snapshot to be used as a template for the 				new tenant by following these guidelines:  Select a snapshot of a later stage of implementation if the new tenant is very similar to 					the prototype. Select a snapshot that features an earlier implementation stage if the new tenant is similar 					to the prototype only at some extent (to include only those configuration 					features that present in the new tenant).

Protecting data is very important for every business. Thus, before you make any significant configuration changes or perform an irreversible operation, you should perform the required changes in a test environment—that is, a test tenant that contains the full or partial data of your tenant.

You can create as many accounts as you may need, each serving a different purpose—for instance, one account for communications with your customer support department, and another account for sending newsletters. For each system email account, you specify the outgoing mail server, the incoming mail server (optional), and the protocol to be used. Also, you must specify ports, login information for servers of both types, and the type of encrypted connection (if required by the server).{br}

For any system account, you can enable processing of incoming mail and select processing options that define how emails received to the account should be processed, such as whether to create a case for each email message or a new lead record (for details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\EM__con_Mail_Processing|Incoming Mail Processing]). Also, you can specify the types of attachments that are permitted, if attachments are permitted at all. You can allow the deletion of processed emails or forbid it (if your organization requires emails to be kept for a particular period of time, for instance).

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[System Email Accounts In  Acumatica ERP, you can configure and manage system email accounts by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM204002|SM204002]) System Email Accounts (SM204002) form. You can create as many         accounts as you may need, each serving a different purpose—for instance, one account         for communications with your customer support department, and another account for sending         newsletters. For each system email account, you specify the outgoing mail server, the         incoming mail server (optional), and the protocol to be used. Also, you must specify ports,         login information for servers of both types, and the type of encrypted connection (if         required by the server). For any system account, you can enable processing of incoming mail and select processing         options that define how emails received to the account should be processed, such as whether         to create a case for each email message or a new lead record (for details, see  Incoming Mail Processing). Also, you can specify the types of attachments         that are permitted, if attachments are permitted at all. You can allow the deletion of         processed emails or forbid it (if your organization requires emails to be kept for a         particular period of time, for instance).

In Acumatica ERP, all incoming mail that is received by system email accounts is processed in a series of consecutive steps.{br}

The processing of incoming emails consists of the basic processing, which is enabled out of the box and cannot be additionally configured, and the advanced processing that can be set up individually for each system email account.{br}

This topic describes the rules that the system follows when processing incoming emails and how you can set up this functionality.{br}{TOC}
==Basic Processing==
The basic processing consists of the following steps, which are performed by default upon each email received by a system email account:[anchor|#_aea7b8b0-bce4-4a67-9cd3-4521919d405a]
#Based on a received email, the system creates an email in Acumatica ERP, with the sender&rsquo;s name, sender&rsquo;s email address, subject, and description specified. The email has the ''Pending Processing'' status and the current date specified as the start date.
#If the sender is recognized as an employee, the system assigns that employee as the owner of the email. (The system does not verify whether the employee has the ''Active'' status.)
#The system analyzes hidden tags attached to the email and determines if the email has a parent activity in Acumatica ERP. If such an activity is found, the email becomes linked to it and also associated with the related entity, contact, business account, owner, and workgroup (if any) from the parent activity. (When assigning the owner, the system does not verify whether the employee has the ''Active'' status.)

==Advanced Processing==
Depending on your business, the mail you receive through Acumatica ERP may consist of requests for information, emails related to customer contracts, or emails received from contacts or leads as replies to emails sent during specific marketing campaigns. You can configure incoming mail processing so that based on an incoming email, the system creates a case or a lead and attaches the email to the created entity as a related activity. Also, an incoming email may be attached to an existing lead, contact, or business account that is related to the email exchange. You can activate and configure the processing of incoming mail individually for each of the system email accounts. You can also specify an email assignment map, which the system will use when it cannot assign incoming emails based on email history. All these options are included in the advanced functionality of incoming mail processing.{br}

 You can activate the processing of incoming mail by selecting the required account on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_02|System Email Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=SM204002|SM204002]) form, and then selecting the '''Incoming Mail Processing''' check box on the '''Incoming Mail Processing''' tab. ((({S:Warn}Before you activate this processing, make sure that email addresses are specified for all employees involved in customer support and CRM activities on either the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form or the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) form.
))){br}

The advanced processing can be divided into two parts: the mandatory part, which is executed whenever processing is enabled for the system email account, and the optional part, which you can tailor through the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_02|System Email Accounts] form to fit your needs.{br}

The mandatory part includes the following steps, if the related entity that is linked to the email is a case with the ''Open'' or ''Pending Customer'' status and if the email sender is not the owner of the case:[anchor|#_99fa01a8-dfa0-435f-bbbb-98ca6f467610]
#The status of the case changes to ''Open'' with the reason set to ''Updated''.
#A notification about the updated status is sent to the case owner.
#:((({S:Hint}No such notification is sent if the incoming email is a part of internal communication between employees.
)))

The optional part includes the following steps, which you can configure by using the '''Incoming Mail Processing''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_02|System Email Accounts] form:[anchor|#ul_nyd_thw_v3]
*''Initial processing'': You can configure the system to confirm the receipt of incoming emails by sending replies based on a specific template created through the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_03|Notification Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=SM204003|SM204003]) form.
*''Main Processing'': You can select options corresponding to any of the following actions:
**Create a new case for each processed email and attach the email to the case as a related activity.
**Route the email to the email addresses specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form for the owners of the parent activity (the owner of the outgoing email to which the sender of the incoming email has replied), related entity (such as the opportunity, contact, or case), and associated business account. 
**:((({S:Warn}Emails are routed to only those employees that have the '''Route Emails''' check box selected on the '''General Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form. Emails are not sent to deleted employees or to employees that have the ''Inactive'' status.
)))
**Attach each processed email to the business account, contact, or lead related to the email exchange.
**Create a new lead for each processed email and attach the email to the lead as a related activity.
**Reply to unassigned emails by using a specific template created through the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_03|Notification Templates] form.
*''Final processing'': You can decide whether the system should remove processed messages and whether it should add available source information to the bottom of each processed email.

==Processing Steps==
Depending on the selected options, the system processes each email as follows (skipping the step if the corresponding option is not selected or if it is not applicable):[anchor|#ul_ggc_nfq_v3]
#A receipt confirmation is generated and sent to the email sender.
#The email undergoes the basic processing steps.
#The system updates the status of the linked case.
#The email is routed to the email addresses of the relevant employees.
#A new case is created based on the email information.
#The email is attached to the business account, contact, or lead related to the email exchange.
#A notification is sent to the case owner.
#An automatic reply is sent if the system has failed to assign the email.
#The email is deleted if the specified conditions are met.
#If the email remains unassigned, the system uses the email assignment map specified on the '''Assignment Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_02|System Email Accounts] form to assign the email.
#A new lead is created based on the email sender.
((({S:Warn}Generally, the subjects for outgoing mass emails are system-generated and contain values from particular contact records, cases, and activities that will help later with processing replies to the emails if addressees do not change the email subjects.

 Acumatica ERP provides email management functionality to employees involved in customer relationship management (CRM) activities, such as working with leads and contacts, organizing campaigns, and handling cases.{br}

In Acumatica ERP, users can use their favorite email programs for communication with customer contacts and leads, and use their personal email accounts if these email addresses are registered with the system.{br}

For every user involved in CRM or case processing, you should specify the user&rsquo;s personal email account on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form, the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) form, or both forms. If incoming mail processing is activated for a system email account, before the system forwards incoming emails to a specific employee, it checks whether the employee has an email address specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] form; if there is no such address, the system uses the email address specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] form. {br}

On the [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\SM_20_30_10|User Profile] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) form, the user can create a signature, which will be inserted at the end of each email this user sends. The '''Email Settings''' tab provides a text box and a toolbar with tools to format the text of the signature. For more details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__con_Personal_Document_Processing|Personal Settings for Document Processing]. {br}

On the forms used for creating emails, personal email addresses are available for selection (that is, they appear on the '''From''' list) to only their owners.{br}

 Acumatica ERP tracks the history of email exchanges—that is, the system stores all emails along with references to the related entities (such as contacts or cases). This history is used for automatic processing of incoming emails. For more info, see [HelpRoot_Administration\EM__con_Email_Exchange_History|Email Exchange History].{br}

Users can use templates for their emails or set up automatic notifications based on specific templates. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\EM__con_Notification_Templates|Notification Templates].{br}

For each system email account, you can manually initiate the processes of sending and receiving mail, or you can set up an automatic schedule for these processes. Also, you can suspend sending and receiving emails for all system email accounts at once. For more info, see [HelpRoot_Administration\EM__con_Sending_and_Receiving_Emails|Mail Sending and Receipt].{br}

To prevent the system from slowing down due to a large number of emails, both incoming and outgoing, accumulated over a long time, you can archive processed emails. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\EM__con_Email_Archiving|Email Archiving].

You can configure Acumatica ERP to automatically send template-based emails to users on different occasions. For example, a new user may receive an email with the user credentials to be used to access the system, or a user can receive a notification that a document has been approved and needs further processing. Also, you can use template-based emails in mass mailings. For an example of a notification template for notifications on changes in case contents made through Self-Service Portal, see [HelpRoot_Administration\EM__how_Case_Notification|To Add a Notification Template for Changes in Case Contents].{br}

In addition to the standard set of templates that comes with Acumatica ERP, you can create new templates for notifications or emails by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_03|Notification Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=SM204003|SM204003]) form. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_01|Email Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM204001|SM204001]) form, you can set the default templates for welcoming new users and for helping users with login and password recovery. 
==Using Placeholders in Notification Templates==
To specify the recipients of the emails, you can use the data fields (as the placeholders, separated with semicolons) that hold email addresses and whose values are retrieved when the system send the email. For the '''To''', '''CC''', and '''BCC''' boxes, you can specify an email address as follows:[anchor|#_e938b547-812b-42c3-90ef-f1b179d37a02]
*A specific user in the system whom you add by double clicking the username in the '''Users''' folder that is available in the look-up box. The system adds it as <tt>EMAIL((&lt;username&gt;));</tt>.
*A specific email address that you manually type in the box. For example, <tt>sales@acumatica.com</tt>.
*A placeholder for an email address stored in the system, which you add by double clicking a corresponding database field in the '''Entity''' folder that is available in the look-up box. The contents of the folder is provided by the form or generic inquiry selected in the '''Screen Name''' box of the form. For example, <tt>((customer.DefContactID.EMail))</tt>.

In the body of the notification template (on the '''Message''' tab), you can click '''Insert Data Field''' on the formatting toolbar to insert as a placeholder any data field provided by the form or generic inquiry selected in the '''Screen Name''' box of the form. {br}

For notification templates used as subscribers of business events, you can click '''Insert Previous Datafield''' to insert as a placeholder any data field whose value was retrieved before the business event occurred. You can use this ability to demonstrate how the value of the data field has changed, for example, a case status has changed from ''New'' to ''Open''.((({S:Hint}Any template that you want to use as a user welcome template must have four placeholders set up in the following order: ''((Company))'', ''((Name))'', ''((Username))'', and ''((Password))''. To see an example, view the ''User Welcome Notification'' template, which is the default template to welcome new users to Acumatica ERP.
)))
==Including Document Details==
You can include information from document detail lines in notifications by adding a {{foreach}} loop to the body of the notification template in the HTML format. An HTML tag can include the {{data-foreach-view="view_name"}} attribute. The attribute indicates that markup that is embedded inside the tag will be repeated for all document lines, as shown in the following example for notifications about opportunities. The new attribute is supported for the following HTML tags:{{ <tr>}}, {{<td>}}, {{<li>}}, and {{<div>}}. In the following example, when the email content is generated, all tags included in the <tt>&lt;table&gt;</tt> tag are repeated for every record in the {{"transactions"}} view.{{{{&lt;table border="1" &gt;
	&lt;tbody&gt;
		&lt;tr data-foreach-view="Products" &gt;                    
			&lt;td class="warncell" data-foreach-view="Products"&gt;((Products.InventoryID)) &lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td class="warncell"&gt;((Products.Quantity)) &lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td class="warncell"&gt;((Products.CuryExtPrice)) &lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
}}}}((({S:Warn}You can use the {{"data-foreach-view"}} attribute in the notification templates used for business events, but leave empty the view name in the attribute {{<tr data-foreach-view="">}}. If you specify the view name in this attribute, the system will insert the values of only the first record in the email.

System email accounts for outgoing mail are used mainly to send mass emails for campaigns or mailing lists, or for automatic replies to incoming mail. When users involved with CRM activities create a mass email by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_80_00|Mass Emails] ([~/?ScreenId=CR308000|CR308000]) form, they can select in the '''From''' box the system email account to which they have access (for details, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CRM_Mktg_Managing_Emails_Activities_Mapref|Managing Emails and Activities]). When a user clicks '''Send''' on the form toolbar, the SMTP server associated with the selected system email account generates each message of the mass email in accordance with the specified template and replaces placeholders in the email properties and the message body with the data of one of the recipients on the list, until the complete mailing list is processed. However, no emails are actually sent as a result of this process.{br}

To initiate the sending of outgoing emails, use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_50_70_10|Send and Receive Email] ([~/?ScreenId=SM507010|SM507010]) form. To send the emails selectively, use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_50_70_00|Emails Pending Processing] ([~/?ScreenId=SM507000|SM507000]) form. {br}

Once the system accounts are configured, you can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_50_70_10|Send and Receive Email] ([~/?ScreenId=SM507010|SM507010]) form to initiate the receipt of incoming emails and schedule the operations of sending and receiving mail. To process selected incoming and outgoing emails, use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_50_70_00|Emails Pending Processing] ([~/?ScreenId=SM507000|SM507000]) form.{br}

To allow the system to automatically resend outgoing emails whose processing has failed, you can use the '''Automatic Resend Attempts''' setting on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_01|Email Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM204001|SM204001]) form. This setting defines the number of times that the scheduled processing is allowed to fail for an email before the email's status changes from ''Pending Processing'' to ''Failed''. However, the system ignores this setting if a critical error (that is, an error whose code starts with 5, such as 550) occurs on the mail server or if you run the processing manually.((({S:Hint}You can suspend the operations of sending and receiving emails for all system email accounts at once by selecting the '''Suspend Email Processing''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_01|Email Preferences] form. You may need to do this if you have troubles with your mail servers and need to suspend all operations on these servers to diagnose the problem.

To send the emails selectively, use the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM507000|SM507000]) Emails Pending Processing (SM507000) form.  Once the system accounts are configured, you can use the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM507010|SM507010]) Send and Receive Email (SM507010) form to initiate the receipt of incoming emails and schedule         the operations of sending and receiving mail. To process selected incoming and outgoing         emails, use the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM507000|SM507000]) Emails Pending Processing (SM507000) form. To allow the system to automatically resend outgoing emails whose processing has failed,         you can use the  Automatic Resend Attempts  setting on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM204001|SM204001]) Email Preferences (SM204001) form. This setting defines the number of times         that the scheduled processing is allowed to fail for an email before the email's status         changes from  Pending Processing  to  Failed . However, the system ignores this         setting if a critical error (that is, an error whose code starts with 5, such as 550) occurs         on the mail server or if you run the processing manually. You can suspend the operations of sending and receiving emails for all         system email accounts at once by selecting the  Suspend Email Processing  check box on         the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM204001|SM204001]) Email Preferences form. You may need to do this if you have troubles with         your mail servers and need to suspend all operations on these servers to diagnose the         problem. ]]></column>

Over time, system email accounts may accumulate an extremely large number of emails, both incoming and outgoing, which may result in considerable system slowdown, especially if incoming mail processing has been enabled for these accounts.{br}

In Acumatica ERP, you can archive emails that are too old to be relevant. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_01|Email Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM204001|SM204001]) form, you can enable email archiving by specifying the minimum age of emails to be archived. The actual archiving is performed when you apply this setting to a particular system email account by executing the ''Send All'', ''Receive All'', or ''Send/Receive All'' action, which you can do on any of the following forms:[anchor|#ul_kfs_4m2_dr]
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_02|System Email Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=SM204002|SM204002]): On this form, you can process only one email account at a time.
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_50_70_10|Send and Receive Email] ([~/?ScreenId=SM507010|SM507010]): On this form, you can process multiple email accounts at once.
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_20|Automation Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=SM205020|SM205020]): You can use this form to create an automation schedule for the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_50_70_10|Send and Receive Email] form so that you can regularly process the selected email accounts. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\EM__HOW_To_Create_a_Send_and_Receive_Schedule|To Create a Send and Receive Email Schedule].

Only emails that have the ''Processed'' status can be archived. After the archiving process is completed, the archived emails disappear from the lists on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CO_40_90_00|Incoming] ([~/?ScreenId=CO409000|CO409000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\CO_40_90_80|Sent] ([~/?ScreenId=CO409080|CO409080]) forms; instead, they are all listed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CO_40_90_30|Archived] ([~/?ScreenId=CO409030|CO409030]) form. Thus, archived emails do not get in your way when you are browsing through incoming or outgoing emails, although you still can search for an archived item, or even perform regular actions, such as '''Reply''' or '''Forward''', on it.{br}

Regardless of the settings specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_01|Email Preferences] form, you can use the '''Archive''' action on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CO_40_90_00|Incoming] and [HelpRoot_FormReference\CO_40_90_80|Sent] forms to archive selected emails at any time. Also, you can archive any email that has the ''Processed'' status by opening it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_15|Email Activity] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306015|CR306015]) form and using the '''Archive''' action on the form toolbar.((({S:Warn}After it has been archived, an email associated with a particular entity remains listed on the '''Activities''' tab of the respective data entry form. Also, if time tracking has been enabled for this email, the billable time spent on this email (if any) will be billed to the customer even if the email has been archived. (For more information on time tracking for activities, see [HelpRoot_Organization\EP__con_Time_Tracking|Time Activities].)

An archived email can be restored from the archive. When it has been restored, the email disappears from the table on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CO_40_90_30|Archived] form and is again listed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CO_40_90_00|Incoming] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\CO_40_90_80|Sent] form, depending on whether it is an incoming or outgoing email; the status of the email changes back to ''Processed''. You can restore an individual email by opening it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_15|Email Activity] form and clicking '''Actions''' > '''Restore from Archive''' on the form toolbar, or you can restore emails in bulk by selecting these emails in the table on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CO_40_90_30|Archived] form and clicking '''Restore from Archive''' on the form toolbar.

 Acumatica ERP provides functionality for managing various file attachments and their versions. For example, you can attach a picture of an inventory item to the related record in an inventory document, a scanned copy of handwritten instructions to a data entry form, or a copy of an original vendor invoice to a credit adjustment. Also, you can configure whether to store files locally or on external storage. {br}

This chapter discusses various aspects of using file attachments in Acumatica ERP. 
==In This Chapter==
*[HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_File_Attachment_Management|File Attachment Management]
*:With Acumatica ERP, you can conveniently store files, such as temporary internal instructions, inventory item images, or scanned images of original vendor invoices. You import the files to the system and attach them to ERP records, record details, documents, notification templates, and wiki articles. You can easily manage and track the imported files.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\SM_con_External_File_Storage|External File Storage]
*:By default, the system stores the files attached to documents in the Acumatica ERP SQL Server database. Alternatively, the system can store the files outside of the database—either in a local folder on the computer running the Acumatica ERP website, or in a public cloud using Azure Blob Storage or Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).
*[HelpRoot_Administration\DM__how_FileStorage_Azure|To Store Attached Files by Using the Azure Blob Service]
*:To store the attached files in Azure Blob storage, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_40|External File Storage] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202540|SM202540]) form to configure the Azure Blob provider and switch file storage to the provider. For more information about storing files, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_File_Attachment_Management|File Attachment Management].
*[HelpRoot_Administration\DM__how_FileStorage_AmazonS3|To Store Attached Files by Using the Amazon S3 Service]
*:To store the attached files in Amazon S3 storage, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_40|External File Storage] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202540|SM202540]) form to configure the Amazon S3 provider and switch file storage to the provider. For more information about storing files, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_File_Attachment_Management|File Attachment Management].
*[HelpRoot_Administration\DM__How_External_File_Storage|To Store Attached Files in a Local Folder]
*:To store files in a local folder, use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_40|External File Storage] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202540|SM202540]) form. For more information about storing files, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_File_Attachment_Management|File Attachment Management].
*[HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_How_to_Set_Up_Automatic_Synchronization_of_Files|To Set Up Automatic File Synchronization ]
*:You can use automation schedules to perform periodic synchronization between a file on an Acumatica ERP site and a file on a local computer or network.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\DM__How_Tracking_Files|To Manage Files]
*:In Acumatica ERP, you can import a file into the system and attach it to ERP records or documents (such as stock items or bills), record details, notification templates, and wiki articles. You can also manage these files in a variety of ways, as this article describes.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Delete_Attachment|To Delete an Attachment File]
*:Files can consume space unnecessarily, especially with the passage of time. To clean up the database so that it has sufficient space for needed operations to be performed, you can delete the files that you don't need. You can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_20|Search in Files] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202520|SM202520]) form to search for unneeded files, review these files, and delete them.

With Acumatica ERP, you can conveniently store files, such as temporary internal instructions, inventory item images, or scanned images of original vendor invoices. You import the files to the system and attach them to ERP records, record details, documents, notification templates, and wiki articles. You can easily manage and track the imported files.{br}{TOC}
==File Type and Size Preferences==
In Acumatica ERP, you can allow or deny the importing of specific file types (by their extensions) and set a maximum size for imported files. Use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_50|File Upload Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202550|SM202550]) form to view and edit the file types and sizes that users may import to the site.
==File Attachments==
You use the '''Files''' dialog box to import the file and attach it to the ERP record, document, notification template, wiki article, or record detail. {br}

Also, you can attach any other files that have been uploaded to the system. You click '''Add Link''' button in the '''Files''' dialog box and the system navigates you to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_20|Search in Files] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202520|SM202520]) form where you can search for needed files and attached them to the entity.{br}

For more information on importing and attaching files, see the following topics:[anchor|#ul_rk3_swm_5j]
*[HelpRoot_Interface\Attaching_Files_to_Forms_and_Records|To Attach a File to a Record] and [HelpRoot_Interface\Attaching_Files_to_Record_Details|To Attach a File to a Record Detail] in the Acumatica ERP Interface Guide
*[HelpRoot_Administration\DM__how_Wiki_Adding_Pictures|To Add a Graphic ] and [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Attach_Existing_Files_to_Entity|To Attach Existing Files to a Record or a Record Detail]

==Attachment of Scanned Files==
You can scan documents and attach these files to documents and document lines if the ''DeviceHub'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form and at least one scanner has been configured in Acumatica ERP through integration with the DeviceHub application. {br}

For more information on configuring scanners in DeviceHub, see the topics of the [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__mng_Configuring_DeviceHub_Tool|Configuring Hardware Devices in DeviceHub] chapter. For more information on scanning and attaching files, see [HelpRoot_Interface\UIG__how_Attach_File_Record|To Scan a File and Attach It to a Record] and [HelpRoot_Interface\UIG__how_Attach_File_Record_Detail|To Scan a File and Attach It to a Record Detail].
==File Name Changes==
When files are imported, the system modifies their names as follows: 
*For a file attached to a record (that is, an entity or a document created on a data entry form), the resulting name consists of the form name, a record ID in parentheses, a backslash, and the name of the file. Example: {{Journal Transactions (GL333234231)\Note.txt}} or {{Bills and Adjustments (INV0023572)\Orig_doc.jpeg}}.
*For a file attached to a record detail (a detail row or line of the entity or document), the resulting name consists of the form name, a record ID and record detail ID in parentheses, a backslash, and the name of the file. Example: {{Journal Transactions (GL333234231 3)\Note.txt}}.
*For a file attached to a wiki article, the resulting name consists of the wiki article name and the name of the file, separated by a backslash. Example: {{Role-Based Access\Users.gif}}.

==File Searches==
You can use the following forms to find the files imported to the system:
*[HelpRoot_Interface\SE_00_00_40|Search Form] ([~/?ScreenId=SE000040|SE000040]): On this form, you can search for a file by its name or part of the name, or by the comment specified during file upload. You can also search by the type of object it is attached to (article or system entity); you can also include in the search files not attached to any system entity.
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_20|Search in Files] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202520|SM202520]): By using this form, you can specify the following criteria in your search:
**What the file name (or part of it) is
**When the file was added
**Who added the file
**Who is editing the file (if the file is checked out for edit)
**What document type the file is attached to
*:When you first use the system, the tree in the left pane of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_20|Search in Files] form may contain only one root node, which is populated as users attach files to the records, record details, or wiki articles. A module appears on the site tree only after at least one file has been attached to a record (such as a batch, bill, or invoice) created on a form of the module.
*:((({S:Warn}The system doesn&rsquo;t check the access rights to file attachments for a user who searches the files by using this form.
)))

For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__How_Tracking_Files|To Manage Files].
==Version Maintenance==
You can import and maintain an unlimited number of versions for any file. For each new version of the file, provide a comment to inform users about modifications to it. This will help users find the file and file version they need. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__How_Tracking_Files|To Manage Files].
==Access Rights==
A single file attachment can be attached to multiple wiki articles, notification templates, and templates for email.{br}

By default, access rights are not set directly for file attachments. Access rights for the file attachment are inherited from their rights for the system entity it was first attached to. By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_10|File Maintenance] form, you can define the primary document or article from which roles inherit access rights to this file. Also, you can make the file available to all users. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__How_Tracking_Files|To Manage Files].
==File Deletions==
When you actively import files into the system, you can accumulate unnecessary files if either or both of the following is true:[anchor|#ul_dmw_hgc_tj]
*You don&rsquo;t delete the files that were attached to the ERP records, documents, notification templates, or wiki articles that were deleted from the system.
*You update the files with versioning turned on and leave the outdated versions of files.

It is a good practice to delete outdated and unnecessary files from the system to minimize the use of file storage. Try to delete these files (and versions of files, if applicable) regularly.{br}

By default, the system stores the files attached to documents in the Acumatica ERP SQL Server database. Alternatively, the system can store the files outside of the database—either in a local folder on the computer running the Acumatica ERP website, or in a public cloud using Azure Blob Storage or Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). {br}{TOC}
==External Storage Risks==
We recommend using the default solution provided with Acumatica ERP which automatically places attached files in the system database. This solution includes automated backups, versioning, file synchronization, integrated security, and is quite affordable.{br}

If you want to implement an external storage solution you should be aware of the following risks:[anchor|#_c4ae455f-8426-4634-9304-e26d70cf2756]
*Backups: Acumatica&rsquo;s standard SaaS backup procedures apply to files stored in the database. If files are moved outside the database then backups, disaster recovery, and support become the responsibility of the customer.
*Data migration: Acumatica ERP snapshots and backups do not include external files. When the database or snapshot is restored only database files are included.
*Testing and non-production environments: When you restore backups or snapshots to a non-production environment (when using an external storage solution), the file reference links will point to production storage. If you add or delete files during testing, you will impact the files in your production environment.
*Performance and reliability: Retrieving files from an external solution requires a high-speed connection to the external provider. If this connection in interrupted, you may experience errors or slower performance.
*Troubleshooting: Support and troubleshooting processes are more complex for customers who utilize external file storage.

A system administrator can disable configuration of an external file storage by adding to the <tt>appSettings</tt> section of the <tt>web.config</tt> file the <tt>DisableExternalFileStorage</tt> key set to {{true}}.
==External File Storage Configuration==
You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_40|External File Storage] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202540|SM202540]) form to configure external file storage providers and specify where files should be stored. With regard to file storage functionality, ''provider'' denotes the storage provider, which can be a local folder, Azure Blob service, or Amazon S3 service.((({S:Warn}To use an external file storage, you must have an account with the provider and configure the file storage to be used by your Acumatica ERP instance. For more information, see [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/storage-introduction/#blob-storage|Blob Storage] on the Microsoft Azure portal and [http://aws.amazon.com/s3/|Amazon S3].
)))
If you created multiple companies in your Acumatica ERP instance and want to store file attachments out of the database in any of these companies, you need to configure an external storage provider for each company individually. It can be the same provider for all companies or a separate provider for each company.{br}

By default, the system deletes a file in the external storage if a user deletes it in Acumatica ERP. A system administrator can disable deletion of files in external storage by adding to the <tt>appSettings</tt> section of the <tt>web.config</tt> file the <tt>DisableDeleteOnExternalFileStorage</tt> key set to {{true}}.{br}

See the following topics for the procedures of configuring external file storage in Acumatica ERP: [anchor|#ul_ghv_h1g_ms]

*[HelpRoot_Administration\DM__how_FileStorage_Azure|To Store Attached Files by Using the Azure Blob Service]
*[HelpRoot_Administration\DM__how_FileStorage_AmazonS3|To Store Attached Files by Using the Amazon S3 Service]

==File Synchronization==
You can use automation schedules to perform periodic synchronization between a file on an Acumatica ERP site and a file (or folder) on a local computer or network. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_How_to_Set_Up_Automatic_Synchronization_of_Files|To Set Up Automatic File Synchronization ].[anchor|#_a1123aae-c491-4a9c-883a-4a3201e869b3]((({S:Warn}If you synchronize files with an FTP server, you should use a login without the /, or \ characters in synchronization settings. Otherwise, Acumatica ERP will not be able to connect to the server.

If this connection in interrupted, you may           experience errors or slower performance. Troubleshooting: Support and troubleshooting processes are more complex for customers           who utilize external file storage. A system administrator can disable configuration of an external file storage by adding to         the  appSettings  section of the  web.config  file the            DisableExternalFileStorage  key set to  true . External File Storage Configuration You use the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202540|SM202540]) External File Storage (SM202540) form to configure         external file storage providers and specify where files should be stored. With regard to         file storage functionality,  provider  denotes the storage provider, which can be a         local folder, Azure Blob service, or Amazon S3 service. To use an external file storage, you must have an account with the         provider and configure the file storage to be used by your  Acumatica ERP instance. For more information, see  Blob Storage Blob Storage on the Microsoft Azure portal and  Amazon S3 Amazon S3. If you created multiple companies in your  Acumatica ERP instance and want to store file attachments out of the database in any of these         companies, you need to configure an external storage provider for each company individually.         It can be the same provider for all companies or a separate provider for each company. By default, the system deletes a file in the external storage if a user deletes it in  Acumatica ERP. A system administrator can disable deletion of files in external storage by adding to         the  appSettings  section of the  web.config  file the            DisableDeleteOnExternalFileStorage  key set to          true . See the following topics for the procedures of configuring external file storage in  Acumatica ERP:  To Store Attached Files in a Local FolderTo Store Attached Files by Using the Azure Blob ServiceTo Store Attached Files by Using the Amazon S3 ServiceFile Synchronization You can use automation schedules to perform periodic synchronization between a file on an            Acumatica ERP site and a file (or folder) on a local computer or network. For more information, see            To Set Up Automatic File Synchronization . If you synchronize files with an FTP server, you             should use a login without the /, or \ characters in synchronization settings.             Otherwise,  Acumatica ERP will not be able to connect to the server. ]]></column>

You can use automation schedules to perform periodic synchronization between a file on an Acumatica ERP site and a file on a local computer or network. {br}

You find the file whose synchronization you want to schedule by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_20|Search in Files] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202520|SM202520]) form, configure file synchronization by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_10|File Maintenance] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202510|SM202510]) form, and then schedule the synchronization on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_30|File Synchronization] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202530|SM202530]) form.
==Before You Proceed==
Before you start configuring synchronization between a file on your Acumatica ERP website and a file or folder on your local network, share the folder (which includes the file to be synchronized or which will itself be synchronized with the file on the Acumatica ERP website) through your operating system. Make sure the folder is shared with proper rights for writing. ((({S:Hint}Synchronization (of the ''export'' type) with a folder means that each time synchronization is performed, a new file with the appropriate date and time stamp is created in the specified folder. 
)))
==To Configure File Synchronization==
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_20|Search in Files] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202520|SM202520]) form.
#To find the file, on the form, do one of the following:
#*In the Selection area, specify criteria to help you find the file. This criteria can include the file name (or part of the file name), the time interval of the import, and the name of the user who imported the file or checked it out. The table in the right pane lists the files that match the criteria you specified.
#*In the left pane, navigate to and select the form to which the file is attached. The table in the right pane lists the files attached to the entities created by using the form you selected in the left pane.
#In the right pane, click the file to open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_10|File Maintenance] form for this file and view file properties.
#On the '''Synchronization''' tab, select the '''Synchronize''' check box.
#In the '''Synchronization Type''' box, select '''Shared Folder'''.
#In the '''Path''' box, enter the path to the shared folder on a local network computer.
#In the '''Login''' and '''Password''' boxes, type the login and password of an account with sufficient rights to allow system access to the shared folder.
#:((({S:Warn}If you synchronize files with an FTP server, you should use a login without the /, or \ characters in synchronization settings. Otherwise, Acumatica ERP will not be able to connect to the server.
)))
#To configure synchronization with the folder, do the following: 
##Select the '''Synchronize Folder Content''' check box.
##In the '''Import File Validation Mask''' box, enter a validation mask for the files in the folder that are involved in synchronization. 
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

==To Schedule File Synchronization==
After you have configured the file synchronization, you can perform synchronization manually by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_30|File Synchronization] form. Alternatively, you can assign it to a schedule to be performed automatically by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_20|Automation Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=SM205020|SM205020]) form. For more information about automation schedules, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Scheduled_Processing|Scheduled Processing].{br}

To schedule file synchronization, do the following:
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_30|File Synchronization] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202530|SM202530]) form.
#In the '''Operation''' box, select the synchronization operation to be performed, '''Import File''' or '''Export File'''. This displays (in the table in the lower part of the form) the pairs of files for which synchronization of the selected type has been configured.

You find the file whose synchronization you want to schedule by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202520|SM202520]) Search in Files (SM202520) form, configure file synchronization by 				using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202510|SM202510]) File Maintenance (SM202510) form, and then schedule the 				synchronization on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202530|SM202530]) File Synchronization (SM202530) form. Before You Proceed Before you start configuring synchronization between a file on your  Acumatica ERP website and a file or folder on your local network, share the folder (which 				includes the file to be synchronized or which will itself be synchronized with the 				file on the  Acumatica ERP website) through your operating system. Make sure the folder is shared with 				proper rights for writing.  Synchronization (of the  export  type) with a folder means that 				each time synchronization is performed, a new file with the appropriate date and 				time stamp is created in the specified folder.  To Configure File Synchronization Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202520|SM202520]) Search in Files (SM202520) form. To find the file, on the form, do one of the following: In the Selection area, specify criteria to help you find the file. This 							criteria can include the file name (or part of the file name), the time 							interval of the import, and the name of the user who imported the file 							or checked it out. The table in the right pane lists the files that 							match the criteria you specified. In the left pane, navigate to and select the form to which the file is 							attached. The table in the right pane lists the files attached to the 							entities created by using the form you selected in the left pane. In the right pane, click the file to open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202510|SM202510]) File Maintenance 					form for this file and view file properties. On the  Synchronization  tab, select the 						 Synchronize  check box. In the  Synchronization Type  box, select  Shared 						Folder . In the  Path  box, enter the path to the shared folder on a 					local network computer. In the  Login  and  Password  boxes, type the 					login and password of an account with sufficient rights to allow system access 					to the shared folder. If you synchronize files with an FTP server, you             should use a login without the /, or \ characters in synchronization settings.             Otherwise,  Acumatica ERP will not be able to connect to the server. To configure synchronization with the folder, do the following:  Select the  Synchronize Folder Content  check 							box. In the  Import File Validation Mask  box, enter a 							validation mask for the files in the folder that are involved in 							synchronization.   On the form toolbar, click  Save . To Schedule File Synchronization After you have configured the file synchronization, you can perform synchronization manually 				by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202530|SM202530]) File Synchronization form. Alternatively, you 				can assign it to a schedule to be performed automatically by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM205020|SM205020]) Automation Schedules (SM205020) form. For more information about 				automation schedules, see  Scheduled Processing. To schedule file synchronization, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202530|SM202530]) File Synchronization (SM202530) form. In the  Operation  box, select the synchronization operation to be 					performed,  Import File  or  Export 						File . This displays (in the table in the lower part of the form) 					the pairs of files for which synchronization of the selected type has been 					configured. In the  Selected  column, select the check boxes for the files you want 					to have automatically updated.  On the form toolbar, click  Schedules Add . This opens the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM205020|SM205020]) Automation Schedules (SM205020) form as a pop-up. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM205020|SM205020]) Automation Schedules             form, in the  Description  box, enter a description of the new             schedule. On the  Details  tab, specify             the additional settings of the schedule: Optional: In the  Starts On  box of the                          Details  tab, select the start date. By default, the                     schedule execution starts on the current business date. Optional: If you need to specify an expiration date for the schedule, clear the                          No Expiration Date  check box, and specify the                     expiration date in the  Expires On  box. Do one of the following: If you want to limit the number of executions, in the                                  Execution Limit  box, specify the number of                             times the schedule should be executed. If you do not need to limit the number of executions, select the                                  No Execution Limit  check box. Optional: In the  Process with Branch  box, select the                     branch under which the schedule should be processed. For example, if documents                     are created by this schedule, the system creates these documents and specifies                     the selected branch for each document.  Optional: Change the time zone in which the schedule will operate. By default,                     the time zone specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) User Profile                     (SM203010) form for the currently signed-in user is selected.  On the  Schedule  tab, configure             the execution dates and time as follows: Specify how often the schedule execution should be performed: To execute the schedule daily or every  x  days, do the following:                                  In the  Schedule Type  section, select                                          Daily . Optional: In the  Schedule Details                                      section, in the  Next Execution Date  box,                                     select the date when the schedule should be executed next. In the  Every x Day(s)  box, type the                                     number of days between successive executions of the                                     schedule. To execute the schedule weekly or every  x  weeks, do the                             following:  In the  Schedule Type  section, select                                          Weekly . Optional: In the  Schedule Details                                      section, in the  Next Execution Date  box,                                     select the date when the schedule should be executed next. In the  Every x Week(s)  box, type the                                     number of weeks between successive executions of the                                     schedule. Select the appropriate check boxes for the day or days of the                                     week on which the schedule should be executed. To execute the schedule monthly or every  x  months, do the                             following:  In the  Schedule Type  section, select                                          Monthly . Optional: In the  Schedule Details                                      section, in the  Next Execution Date  box,                                     select the date when the schedule should be executed next. In the  Every x Month(s)  box, type the                                     number of months between successive executions of the                                     schedule. Select when the schedule should be executed: the day of the                                     month, or the week in the month and the day of the week (such as                                     the third Friday of the month). To execute the schedule once per financial period or every  x                              financial periods, perform the following steps:  In the  Schedule Type  section, select                                          By Financial Period . Optional: In the  Schedule Details                                      section, in the  Next Execution Date  box,                                     select the date when the schedule should be executed next. In the  Every x Period(s)  box, type the                                     number of financial periods between successive executions of the                                     schedule. Select the appropriate option button to indicate when the                                     schedules should be executed: at the end of the period, at the                                     start of the period, or on a fixed day of the period (which you                                     should specify if you select this option button). In the  Execution Time  section, specify the particular                     time of the day to start and stop the processing as follows: In the  Starts On  box, select the hour and minute                             when the first execution of the schedule should start. If you want the processing to be stopped at specific time or you want                             the processing to be repeated multiple times a day, in the                                  Stops On  box, select the hour and minute when                             the first execution of the schedule should stop.  If execution of the schedule should be repeated multiple times a day, in                             the  Every  box, select the interval between                             successive executions of the schedule. In the  Next Execution Time  box, make sure the                             next execution time is correct. If you want the system to execute the schedule at exactly the time                             specified in the  Next Execution Time  box, select                             the  Exact Time  check box. If the check box is                             cleared, the system may shift the next execution time of the schedule by                             multiple minutes.

You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_15_30|System Monitor] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201530|SM201530]) form for reporting current application operational data and statistics, as well as for reporting any potential or existing performance issues.{br}

If Acumatica ERP is used in the premises of your company or in your own data center you can correlate the environment limitations in which the system is operating in relationship to the data that is reporting on this form.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Monitor currently running processes, discover and analyze the threads that are currently frozen or no longer responding.
*Review active user list
*Track memory and CPU utilization
*Analyze log of system events
*Monitoring statuses of push notifications and business event queues
*Using the Request Profiler tool

==Applicable Scenarios==
You monitor system health in the following cases:[anchor|#_99d05406-08b5-4b2f-9707-1e38767c7ca9]
*You are a system administrator and monitoring system health is a part of your routine.
*Users of the system reported that the site performance slowed down.
*Users of the system reported that some tasks were failed to complete. For example, scheduled operations failed or at least one record has not been processed successfully.

==Monitoring Running Processes==[anchor|#_ac74e0a8-05db-4b45-9393-c431fbddf04a]
On the '''Running Processes''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_15_30|System Monitor] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201530|SM201530]) form, you can monitor all batch processing operations that are currently being performed in the system, such as the release of multiple transactions at once, preparation of dunning letters, generation of a report, creation of a tenant snapshot, or use of an import or export scenario. Your server may be slow because of a large number of such operations running simultaneously.{br}

By default, the table displays only the processes of the current user. To view the processes run by all users, you select the '''Show All Users''' check box on the tab toolbar.{br}

You can navigate to a form where a user launched a process by selecting the process in the table and clicking '''View Screen''' on the table toolbar. The system navigates you to the form where you can stop the operation or review occurred errors, if any. For details, on mass processing, see [HelpRoot_Interface\UIG__CON_New_UI_Processing_Popup_Window|Processing Pop-Up Window].{br}

You can abort any running process by selecting a process in the list and clicking '''Abort''' on the table toolbar.{br}

For long operations Acumatica ERP runs threads. You can discover and analyze the threads that are currently frozen or no longer responding by clicking '''Active Threads''' on the table toolbar and view details in the pop-up panel. If there is at least one active thread, the panel contains information about currently running threads. 
==Reviewing List of Active User==
You use the '''Active Users''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_15_30|System Monitor] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201530|SM201530]) form to review the list of currently active users. You can filter users by the way a user accessed the system, which can be one of the following:[anchor|#_e561d151-db02-4292-9f0c-1fe2f3556cea]
*''User Interface'': A user signed in by using their username and password either on the Acumatica ERP Sign-In page, or through the mobile application, or through single sign-on page provided that SSO with Google or Microsoft Account has been set up.
*''API'': A user is a client application that signed in by using the method for singing in of the contract-based SOAP API, contract-based REST API, or screen-based SOAP API, or by using OAuth 2.0 mechanism of authorization for applications.

You can select a user in the list, click '''View User''' on the table toolbar and the system navigates you to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) form, displaying information about the currently selected user.
==Tracking Resource Usage==
You use the '''Resource Usage''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_15_30|System Monitor] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201530|SM201530]) form to monitor how an Acumatica ERP instance is using memory and CPU of application server where the instance is installed.{br}

At the bottom of the form you can view charts that illustrate current CPU and memory usage of application server by the Acumatica ERP instance. You can switch off the Java script that performs automatic update of the charts by modifying value for the <tt>EnableResourceUsageAutoUpdate</tt> key in the <tt>web.config</tt> file.
==Analyzing System Event Log==
You use the '''System Events''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_15_30|System Monitor] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201530|SM201530]) form to analyze log of system events. The tab lists log records for multiple system events. You can explore the log for errors, warnings, or operations that consume excessive resources. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Monitoring_System_Health_System_Events_Concept|System Health: System Event Log].
==Monitoring System Queues==
You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_10|System Queues Monitor] ([~/?ScreenId=SM302010|SM302010]) form to monitor statuses of push notifications and business event queues. By using this form, you can clear queues and restart dispatchers both for push notification and business events.((({S:Warn}In a cluster environment you should access this form by node.
)))
==Using Request Profiler==
The Request Profiler is an embedded tool you can use to troubleshoot performance-related issues in Acumatica ERP or an Acumatica Framework-based application. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Monitoring_System_Health_Request_Profiler_Concept|System Health: Request Profiler].]]></column>

The [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_70|Request Profiler] ([~/?ScreenId=SM205070|SM205070]) is an embedded tool you can use to troubleshoot performance-related issues in Acumatica ERP or an Acumatica Framework-based application.
==Using the Request Profiler==
You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_70|Request Profiler]:[anchor|#ul_ysc_3gf_ks]
*To monitor the time and memory needed for any URL request performed in Acumatica ERP.
*To analyze the time needed for any SQL request of selected URL request.
*To obtain information about exceptions that have occurred in the Acumatica ERP instance, and to view its traces.

To monitor all URL requests in Acumatica ERP, in the '''Profiler Options''' section, select the '''Log Requests''' check box.{br}

To monitor only the long URL requests that need more than 1000 milliseconds to run, enter <tt>1000</tt> in the '''Svr Time Threshold''' box of the '''Filters''' section.{br}

To monitor URL requests with 500 or more SQL requests, enter <tt>500</tt> in the '''SQL Count Threshold''' box of the '''Filters''' section.{br}

To obtain information about SQL requests within URL requests, you select the '''Log SQL''' check box in the '''Profiler Options''' section. You use the '''SQL Profiler Pop-up Panel''' to view the information.[anchor|#_5f834f0a-296e-4428-8728-fee45c1aba7f]((({S:Hint}We recommend that you activate the ''Log SQL'' mode for only a limited period because it can degrade system performance.
)))
To obtain information about application exceptions within URL requests, you select the '''Log Trace Messages''' and '''Log Exceptions''' check boxes in the '''Profiler Options''' section. You use the '''Trace Profiler Pop-up Panel''' to view the information.
==Working in Cluster Mode==
The Request Profiler works in cluster mode. When you run the profiler on a cluster, it launches on all nodes of the cluster. The profiler settings apply to each cluster node.{br}

To specify the identifier of the cluster node, you can use one of the following approaches:[anchor|#ul_mnr_3lk_ls]
*In the <tt>appSettings</tt> tag of the <tt>web.config</tt> file, specify a string value for the <tt>ClusterNodeId</tt> attribute, such as the following.{{{{&lt;add key="ClusterNodeId" value="MyClusterNodeName" /&gt;
}}}}
*Create the <tt>...\App&#95;Data\WebsiteHeaders.txt</tt> file that contains the identifier.
*Do not specify the identifier; the system will automatically create a GUID for the cluster node.
{br}

If you need to identify a cluster node for the URL request on the Request Profiler form, use the '''Headers''' column of the log table. In cluster mode, the column contains the GUID or the identifier of the cluster node.]]></column>

Within Acumatica ERP, users can perform searches in help, wikis, and various ''entities'', such as vendors, customers, invoices, and contracts. To make the process quick and accurate, Acumatica ERP uses semantic search and search indexes.
==Semantic Search in Acumatica ERP==
 Acumatica ERP uses semantic search through SQL databases that allows the system to identify the key phrases in text or documents, discover similar or related documents, and provide information to explain how documents are similar or related.{br}

To employ semantic search in your Acumatica ERP instance, make sure that semantic search functionality is enabled in your SQL server. [anchor|#ul_qqk_15h_5r]
*In Microsoft SQL Server, the semantic search functionality is disabled by default. Enable the functionality, as described in [HelpRoot_Install\how__Semantic_Search|Enabling Semantic Search for Microsoft SQL Server] in Acumatica ERP Installation Guide.
*In MySQL Server, the semantic search functionality is enabled by default.

==Search Indexes==
The search indexes are used to accelerate searching in Acumatica ERP. When users perform the day-to-day operations, such as adding new documents or updating customer accounts, the new information is added to the appropriate search indexes automatically. You need to rebuild the search indexes in the following cases: [anchor|#_14537503-d814-46c2-aa6e-b00eeb7e4218]
*After you have upgraded your Acumatica ERP system from a version that did not include the search indexes
*After you have installed an Acumatica ERP tenant with demo data

For detailed procedure, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Search_indexes_update|To Build Search Indexes].{br}

The list of indexed entities, excluding the wikis, is available on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_95_00|Rebuild Full-Text Entity Index] ([~/?ScreenId=SM209500|SM209500]) form. {br}

The built-in help wikis are indexed automatically. The wikis created in your system are not indexes automatically; you must add search indexes for such wikis manually, as described [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__how_Wiki_Setting_Up_a_New_Wiki|To Add a Wiki]. Wiki search indexes are not displayed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_95_00|Rebuild Full-Text Entity Index] form.
==Known Limitations to Search Queries==
A semantic search does not find related entities if the search query includes word breakers, such as <tt>AND</tt> or <tt>FOR</tt>.{br}

 For example, suppose that you want to find related entities by using a description as a search query. The description includes at least one word breaker, so in this case, the search returns no results.

 Acumatica ERP and the Acumatica mobile app provides mechanisms to support two-factor authentication to prevent unauthorized system access. Security-conscious businesses require two-factor authentication to verify user identities before allowing them to access sensitive ERP data.((({S:Warn}This functionality is available only if the ''Two-Factor Authentication'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form.
)))
Access is granted only after the user successfully presents to the system additional evidence of authentication in addition to the user&rsquo;s credentials (that is, the username and password). At the system level, a system administrator can require two-factor authentication or turn off this authentication (the default setting). In addition, the administrator can specify different settings for individual users with regard to two-factor authentication; user settings take precedence over system-wide settings.{br}

If two-factor authentication is required, the user needs to authenticate the sign-in operation by using one of the methods displayed in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_c0b67561-4712-4c43-ae6b-30f6ef26b09e][image:UserGuide/Images/2019R1_RN_TwoFactor_2.png|popup|250px]{br}

By default, when two-factor authentication is enabled, the system uses the push notification method to authenticate the login operation.((({S:Warn}Push notifications are available only for instances with a valid license.
))){br}

The push notification method of authentication requires the Acumatica app to be set up on a mobile device.[anchor|#_386f2e44-3f7d-4d17-8308-64932c38f53f][image:UserGuide/Images/2019R1_RN_TwoFactor_1.png|popup|250px]{br}

You can specify whether the user confirms authentication in one of the following ways:[anchor|#_9658494d-2d2f-472c-ab92-fe59f1e01c69]
*By tapping '''Approve''' in Acumatica mobile app push notification.
*By email. This authentication method will be on the the login screen list if the administrator selects the ''Allow Email'' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_60|Security Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201060|SM201060]) form.
*Via SMS. This authentication method will be in on the the login screen list if the administrator selects the ''Allow SMS'' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_60|Security Preferences] form.
*By generating codes in Acumatica mobile app with the '''Generate Access Code''' command.
*By generating codes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) or User Profile (SM203010) form.
{br}

The '''Two-Factor Authentication Policy''' section on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_60|Security Preferences] form is used for setting up system-wide two-factor authentication preferences. The settings in this sentence affect all of the company's users that do not have their own settings specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] form. {br}

If two-factor authentication is required for a particular user, the first time that user signs in to the Acumatica mobile app, the system will request the security access code that will be sent to the user&rsquo;s email address when the user signs in to the web version of Acumatica ERP. The mobile app will also require PIN code or biometric verification when the user signs in. By invoking the '''Generate Access Code''' command in the account editing menu of the mobile app, the user can generate access codes for two-factor authentication.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Two-Factor Authentication  Acumatica ERP and the  Acumatica         mobile app provides mechanisms to support two-factor authentication to prevent unauthorized         system access. Security-conscious businesses require two-factor authentication to verify         user identities before allowing them to access sensitive ERP data. This functionality is available only if the  Two-Factor           Authentication  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features         form. Access is granted only after the user successfully presents to the system additional         evidence of authentication in addition to the user's credentials (that is, the username and         password). At the system level, a system administrator can require two-factor authentication         or turn off this authentication (the default setting). In addition, the administrator can         specify different settings for individual users with regard to two-factor authentication;         user settings take precedence over system-wide settings. If two-factor authentication is required, the user needs to authenticate the sign-in         operation by using one of the methods displayed in the following screenshot. By default, when two-factor authentication is enabled, the system uses the push         notification method to authenticate the login operation. Push notifications are           available only for instances with a valid license. The push notification method of authentication requires the  Acumatica         app to be set up on a mobile device. You can specify whether the user confirms authentication in one of the following ways: By tapping  Approve  in  Acumatica mobile app push notification. By email. This authentication method will be on the the login screen list if the             administrator selects the  Allow Email  check box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201060|SM201060]) Security Preferences (SM201060) form. Via SMS. This authentication method will be in on the the login screen list if the             administrator selects the  Allow SMS  check box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201060|SM201060]) Security Preferences form. By generating codes in  Acumatica mobile app with the  Generate Access Code  command. By generating codes on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) Users (SM201010) or User Profile             (SM203010) form. The  Two-Factor Authentication Policy  section on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201060|SM201060]) Security Preferences form is used for setting up system-wide two-factor         authentication preferences. The settings in this sentence affect all of the company's users         that do not have their own settings specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) Users form.          On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) Users form, in the  Two-Factor           Authentication  section, the administrator must select the  Override           Security Preferences  check box in order to override the system default         settings and specify the two-factor authentication mode for a specific selected user.         (Otherwise, the settings specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201060|SM201060]) Security Preferences form will be         used.) If two-factor authentication is required for a particular user, the first time that user         signs in to the  Acumatica         mobile app, the system will request the security access code that will be sent to the user's         email address when the user signs in to the web version of  Acumatica ERP. The mobile app will also require PIN code or biometric verification when the user signs         in. By invoking the  Generate Access Code  command in the account         editing menu of the mobile app, the user can generate access codes for two-factor         authentication. ]]></column>

Use an existing access code or a code generated by the mobile app. You can use                     one of codes from the list generated on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) Users or                           ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) User                         Profile User Profile form. Alternatively, if you are signed in the mobile app, use                     the  Generate Access Code  action on the mobile device (see                     the following screenshot). The Generate Access Code action in the mobile app When you sign in to the system after registration, a push notification with a sign-in                 request will be sent automatically to the registered mobile devices. You need to                 approve the request, and sign-in will be performed automatically. The other                 authentication methods (which are described above) also can be used if push                 notifications are not available at the moment of sign-in. When you sign in to the mobile app by using an account with two-factor authentication                 enabled, the app will always request to confirm your identity by using biometric                 authentication (if it is supported by the device) or by entering your PIN. You can disable push notifications with sign-in requests for a particular device or                 particular devices by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) Users or   ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) User                     Profile User Profile form as follows: On the  Devices  tab, you                 clear the check box in the  Send Confirmation Push  column. ]]></column>

 Acumatica ERP provides functionality that you can use to localize the system in multiple languages. You can maintain the user interface and wikis in multiple languages if you have multiple locales. The default locale of Acumatica ERP is U.S. English. {br}

Localization includes the usage of locale-specific settings and the translation of the strings used on the application interface. Starting with Acumatica ERP 6, you can translate user input to multiple languages and store translations in the database.{br}

In this topic, you will read about how locales and languages are handled in the system.{br}{TOC}
==Understanding Locales and Languages==
 Acumatica ERP uses the list of locales provided by Microsoft.NET. In most cases, a locale identifier has two parts:[anchor|#ul_tcp_kyd_jw]
*The ISO code of the language: The system retrieves the language code from the locale identifier to create a new entity language and associates the language with the locale. Note that the system associates multiple locales with a language if the identifiers of these locales contain the same ISO code of a language. For example, the <tt>en-US</tt>, <tt>en-GB</tt>, and <tt>en-AU</tt> locales are all associated with English, the language whose ISO code is <tt>en</tt>. 
*:You can use these languages to localize user input. The translations can be further used for printing reports and documents. For details, see [[#section_lqy_4c2_jw|Enabling Multilingual User Input].
*The ISO code of the region (or country): The system uses the region code of the identifier to define which resource libraries of the Microsoft .NET Framework to use when it applies region-specific settings, which include the date and time format, the format of numbers (such as the decimal separator and digit grouping), and the writing direction. In the previous example, <tt>US</tt>, <tt>GB</tt>, and <tt>AU</tt> are all ISO codes of the country.

In Acumatica ERP, the translations of the user interface and wiki articles are associated with a locale, and the translations of user input are associated with a language.[anchor|#section_v2q_4c2_jw]
==Adding New Locales to the System==
When Acumatica ERP is installed, one locale (U.S. English) is present by default. You can add other locales on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_50|System Locales] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200550|SM200550]) form. For the detailed procedure, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Add_Locale|To Add a New Locale]. When you activate multiple locales, a user may select his or her preferred locale on the Sign-In page before signing in the system.{br}

A newly added locale is inactive by default, which means the system does not display it in the list of locales on the Sign-In page. For an inactive locale, you can override locale preferences (region-specific settings). Also, you can use the Acumatica ERP translation functionality to translate the interface elements for the locale. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Translation_Process|Translation Process].{br}

After you activate the locale, it becomes available for selection on the Sign-In page. Once a user selects the locale and signs in to Acumatica ERP, the system displays the localized interface and applies the specified locale preferences by using the resource libraries provided for the selected locale by the Microsoft .NET Framework. {br}

Also, you can print localized versions of reports if you have translated the reports&rsquo; strings for the locale you are currently signed in with. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__CON_Usage_of_UserInput_Translations|Use of User Input Translations].{br}

When a user with a right to edit wiki articles is signed in with a locale, he or she can create locale-specific versions of the wiki articles. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Translation_Process#section_nq3_n3l_hw|Translating Wiki Articles] in [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Translation_Process|Translation Process].[anchor|#section_lqy_4c2_jw]
==Enabling Multilingual User Input==
Starting with Acumatica ERP 6, you can translate user input to multiple languages and store translations in the database. For example, you can enter descriptions of General Ledger accounts in multiple languages and then print a localized version of the trial balance report with the descriptions of accounts in the language of the locale you are currently signed in with.{br}

To make this functionality available, you perform the following steps:[anchor|#ul_egb_22j_gw]
#If the needed locales are not defined in the system, you add and activate them on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_50|System Locales] form. For step-by-step instructions, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Add_Locale|To Add a New Locale]. The system retrieves the ISO codes of languages from the locales (active and inactive) and forms the initial list of languages that you will use to define a set of languages to translate user input to.
#:((({S:Warn}The system associates multiple locales with a language if the identifiers of these locales contain the same ISO code of a language. 
)))
# You click the '''Set Up Languages''' button on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_50|System Locales] form toolbar that invokes the '''Languages''' dialog box. In the dialog box, you specify the languages in which you are going to translate user input and define the default language. For details, see the [[#section_vkn_2lm_hw|Setting Up Languages] section in this topic.

Once you have finished making the functionality available, you can translate user input for the boxes that have multi-language support. A link (for example, [anchor|#image_q2f_yvy_jw][image:UserGuide/Images/Translations_box_link.png]) is displayed next to these text boxes in the system. Clicking this link invokes the '''Translations''' dialog box (described in the [HelpRoot_Interface\UIG__CON_TranslationBoxes|Translations Dialog Box] topic of the Interface Guide). You enter translations for each language, close the dialog box, and click '''Save''' on the form toolbar.{br}

You can also add translations for text in the rich text editor (for example, a description of a stock item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form). On the formatting toolbar, you select languages for which you would like to add a translation one after another, enter a translation, and click '''Save''' on the form toolbar.{br}

The translation tool that is described in this section can also be used for translating filter tabs (see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Translate_Filter_Tabs|To Translate Filter Tab Captions]) and generic inquiry elements, such as column captions in the results grid (see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Translate_GI_Column_Captions|To Translate Column Captions for a Generic Inquiry]) and parameter display names (see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Translate_GI_Parameter_Names|To Translate Parameter Display Names for a Generic Inquiry]).{br}

For the list of boxes with this support, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__CON_Boxes_MultiLanguage|Boxes that Have Multi-Language Support]. You can upload translations from a file for those entities (such as account classes, ledgers, and financial periods) that support integration with Excel. You can also import values to these text boxes and export values from them by using integration scenarios. For details, see [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__con_IS_Multi-Language_Fields|Multi-Language Fields in Import and Export Scenarios].[anchor|#section_vkn_2lm_hw]
==Setting Up Languages==
In Acumatica ERP, a language can be marked as the default, an alternative, or not used in the localization of user input. When you specify the default language, multi-language support is enabled for the supported text boxes in the system. The default language and alternative languages form the list of languages for which you can provide translations in the ''' Translations''' dialog box.{br}

To define the set of languages to translate user input to, do the following:[anchor|#ol_jpk_bhg_rw]
#Click the '''Set Up Languages''' button on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_50|System Locales] form toolbar to invoke the '''Languages''' dialog box. The dialog box contains the list of languages, represented by their ISO codes, that the system retrieved from the list of locales (active and inactive).
#In the '''Default Language''' box, select the ISO code of the language that you want to mark as the default. The default language must be associated with an active locale. 
#In the table below the box, select the unlabeled check box for the languages you want to mark as alternatives and clear this check box for those languages that you want to exclude from the localization of user input.
((({S:Warn}If a language is associated with an inactive locale, the system does not display it in the ''' Translations''' dialog box.
)))
Once you apply the settings, in the table on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_50|System Locales] form, you can view which locales are associated with languages that are the default, alternatives, or not used in localization by adding to the table the '''Alternative Language''' and '''Default Language''' columns, which are hidden by default.{br}

After you set up languages, you can proceed with translating user input for the text boxes that have multi-language support.
==Disabling Locales and Multilingual User Input==
If you do not need a particular locale anymore, you can clear the '''Active''' check box for this locale on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_50|System Locales] form. The system then excludes this locale from the list of available locales (the '''Locale''' box) on the following forms:[anchor|#ul_sh2_p2t_jw]
*The Sign-In page
*Report forms
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_03|Notification Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=SM204003|SM204003])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_10_00|Customer Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR201000|AR201000])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_10_00|Vendor Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AP201000|AP201000])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000])

The system stores the translations you have added for the deactivated locale, so you can activate it again and view the associated translations of the user interface and wiki pages.{br}

If you deactivate all the locales but one, the system will not display the '''Locale''' box on the forms listed above.{br}

If you do not need to translate user input in a particular language, you do one of the following by using the '''Set Up Languages''' dialog box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_50|System Locales] form:[anchor|#ul_uzd_5xy_jw]
*If the language was marked as an alternative, you clear the unlabeled check box for the language.
*If the language was marked as the default, you select another language in the '''Default Language''' box and clear the unlabeled check box in the table for those languages that you want to exclude from the localization of user input.

The system stores the translations you have added for the excluded language, so you can activate it again and view the associated translations of the user input.

For the list of boxes with this support, see  Boxes that Have Multi-Language Support. You can upload translations from a file for those entities (such as account classes,         ledgers, and financial periods) that support integration with Excel. You can also import         values to these text boxes and export values from them by using integration scenarios. For         details, see  Multi-Language Fields in Import and Export Scenarios. Setting Up Languages In  Acumatica ERP, a language can be marked as the default, an alternative, or not used in the localization         of user input. When you specify the default language, multi-language support is enabled for         the supported text boxes in the system. The default language and alternative languages form         the list of languages for which you can provide translations in the             Translations  dialog box. To define the set of languages to translate user input to, do the following: Click the  Set Up Languages  button on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200550|SM200550]) System Locales form toolbar to invoke the  Languages            dialog box. The dialog box contains the list of languages, represented by their ISO codes,           that the system retrieved from the list of locales (active and inactive). In the  Default Language  box, select the ISO code of the language           that you want to mark as the default. The default language must be associated with an           active locale.  In the table below the box, select the unlabeled check box for the languages you want to           mark as alternatives and clear this check box for those languages that you want to exclude           from the localization of user input. If a language is associated with an inactive locale, the system does not display it in         the   Translations  dialog box. Once you apply the settings, in the table on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200550|SM200550]) System Locales form, you         can view which locales are associated with languages that are the default, alternatives, or         not used in localization by adding to the table the  Alternative           Language  and  Default Language  columns, which are hidden         by default. After you set up languages, you can proceed with translating user input for the text boxes         that have multi-language support. Disabling Locales and Multilingual User Input If you do not need a particular locale anymore, you can clear the            Active  check box for this locale on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200550|SM200550]) System Locales form. The system then excludes this locale from the list of         available locales (the  Locale  box) on the following forms: The Sign-In page Report forms  ([~/?ScreenId=SM204003|SM204003]) Notification Templates (SM204003)  ([~/?ScreenId=AR201000|AR201000]) Customer Classes (AR201000)  ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000)  ([~/?ScreenId=AP201000|AP201000]) Vendor Classes (AP201000)  ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors (AP303000) The system stores the translations you have added for the deactivated locale, so you can         activate it again and view the associated translations of the user interface and wiki         pages. If you deactivate all the locales but one, the system will not display the            Locale  box on the forms listed above. If you do not need to translate user input in a particular language, you do one of the         following by using the  Set Up Languages  dialog box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200550|SM200550]) System Locales form: If the language was marked as an alternative, you clear the unlabeled check box for the           language. If the language was marked as the default, you select another language in the              Default Language  box and clear the unlabeled check box in the           table for those languages that you want to exclude from the localization of user           input. The system stores the translations you have added for the excluded language, so you can         activate it again and view the associated translations of the user input. ]]></column>

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
Starting with Acumatica ERP 6, you can translate user input for multiple text boxes in the system. That is, you can maintain your data in multiple languages. These data translations can later be used in printed reports and documents.{br}

In this topic, you will read about how to print reports and documents, how to send notifications in the language preferred by the customer or vendor, and how the system searches for translations.{br}{TOC}[anchor|#section_qbt_bkm_jw]
==Printing Localized Reports==
If you have enabled multilingual user input and provided translations for the fields that supply data to a report, you can prepare a fully localized report—that is, a report whose strings (headers and footers) and data are localized. By default, the system prepares a report in the language associated with the locale you used to sign in. You can override this locale by specifying another locale on a report form in the '''Locale''' box.{br}

Before you prepare a localized report, you should make sure that all of the following preliminary steps have been completed:[anchor|#ol_kqb_h1b_bx]
#All the needed locales are added and activated on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_50|System Locales] form. For step-by-step instructions, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Add_Locale|To Add a New Locale]. 
#Multilingual user input is set up, as described in [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__CON_Locales_and_Languages#section_lqy_4c2_jw|Enabling Multilingual User Input].
#The user interface is localized, including reports. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Translation_Process|Translation Process] in the System Administration Guide and [HelpRoot_ReportingTools\Translating_Reports|Translating Reports] in the Acumatica Report Designer Guide.
#There are translations for the fields that supply data to the report.

Once you have finished, you can prepare a fully localized report as follows:[anchor|#ol_i1q_crg_rw]
#You select the needed locale in the '''Locale''' box on the report form.
#You run the report. 
#:The system prints the localized version of the report, where the report&rsquo;s strings and report&rsquo;s data are translated to the language of the locale you have selected on the report form.

If you have not selected a locale on the report form, the system prepares the report in the language of the locale you are currently signed in with.((({S:Warn}A user may specify a locale while constructing a report by using the Report Designer. The locale setting from the Report Designer overrides the locale you used to sign in, but not the locale you specified in the '''Locale''' box on the report form.
)))
For example, suppose that your company utilizes two locales: <tt>en-US</tt> and <tt>fr-CA</tt>. English is set up as the default language, and French is the alternative language. Some of the company&rsquo;s personnel speak English and some speak French. Also, the company&rsquo;s data—such as descriptions of GL accounts and descriptions in inventory items—is maintained in two languages. {br}

Further suppose that a user who prefers working under the English locale needs to prepare a report in French for his or her French-speaking manager. The user opens the report form, selects the French locale in the '''Locale''' box, and runs the report. The system prepares the report in French, regardless of the locale the user is currently signed in with.
==Printing Localized Documents==
You can associate a locale with a customer or vendor. If you do, with the enabled multilingual user input, when you create a document for this customer or vendor and add a document line with an inventory item, the system does the following:[anchor|#ul_zqc_bb3_nw]
*Populates the column with descriptions of inventory items in the language specified for the customer or vendor
*Applies to the document the region-specific settings defined for the locale you are currently signed in with
*Populates the boxes for which translations are available with the values in the language of the locale you used to sign in

For example, suppose that you work under the <tt>en-US</tt> locale. You associate a customer with some French locale, such as <tt>fr-CA</tt>, and enter translations of inventory item descriptions in French. Then you create an invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form, select the customer, and add an inventory item. The system populates the descriptions of credit terms, GL accounts and subaccounts, taxes, and the payment method of the customer in English. But the system populates the '''Transaction Descr.''' column with the item description in French. When you release the invoice, this item description in French is posted to the ledger as the GL transaction description.((({S:Warn}The system supports the described behavior for documents that you create on the following forms: [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_40_00|Quick Checks] ([~/?ScreenId=AP304000|AP304000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_40_00|Cash Sales] ([~/?ScreenId=AR304000|AR304000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]), and [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]).
)))
You may frequently need to print reports that are versions of documents created in Acumatica ERP, as with the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\AR_64_10_00|Invoice/Memo] ([~/?ScreenId=AR641000|AR641000]) and [HelpRoot_ReportReference\SO_64_10_10|Sales Order] ([~/?ScreenId=SO641010|SO641010]) reports. {br}

You can initiate the printing of a document directly from its entry form. If you are signed in with the locale that is specified for the customer or vendor and you have translated the strings of the report for this locale, the system will print a fully localized document. Otherwise, the system will print the document with only the description of the inventory items in a customer&rsquo;s preferred language.{br}

For example, suppose that a customer wants to receive sales orders in French. You should perform the following steps:[anchor|#ol_mgt_2wg_rw]
#Make sure that the strings of the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\SO_64_10_10|Sales Order] ([~/?ScreenId=SO641010|SO641010]) report, which corresponds to sales orders created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, are translated in French.
#Make sure that descriptions of inventory items, taxes, and credit and shipping terms have French translations.
#Specify <tt>fr-CA</tt> as the customer&rsquo;s locale. 
#Sign in with the <tt>fr-CA</tt> locale, and create a sales order for the customer on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form.
# Initiate printing of the sales order by using '''Reports''' > '''Print Sales Order/Quote''', and the system opens the ready-to-print sales order in French.

Also, you can print a document by using the corresponding report form. On the report form, you select the reference number of the document, specify locale of the customer or vendor in the '''Locale''' box, and run the report. The system opens the ready-to-print document in the language of the locale you have specified. For details, see the previous section in this topic. 
==Sending Localized Notifications==
Multilingual user input can also be used in correspondence you send to your customers and vendors by means of Acumatica ERP mailings, which are described in detail in [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__MNG_Notifications|Managing Mailings]. Starting with Acumatica ERP 6, you can specify a locale for a notification template. The system uses the assigned locale to apply region-specific settings to the text, dates, and digits in the body of the notification template. The system also retrieves the translations of the values needed to replace the placeholders in the body according to the language of the locale. {br}

If you want to send mailings in the language preferred by a customer or a vendor, you need to set up the system as follows:[anchor|#ol_ihn_ffh_kw]
#You create a dedicated notification template on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_03|Notification Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=SM204003|SM204003]) and specify the locale of the needed language in the '''Locale''' box. You also compose the notification text in the language of the locale. For details on creating a notification template, see [HelpRoot_Administration\EM__con_Notification_Templates|Notification Templates].
#If you want to send a document as an attachment, you create a dedicated report for this document type—for example, a copy of the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\AR_64_10_00|Invoice/Memo] ([~/?ScreenId=AR641000|AR641000]) report—by using the Report Designer. You enter the strings of the report (headers and footers) in the same language that you used to compose the notification and, in the report settings, specify the same locale as you specified for the notification template. For details, see [HelpRoot_ReportingTools\Creating_and_Modifying_the_Reports|Creating and Modifying the Reports] in the Acumatica Report Designer Guide.[anchor|#li_qdx_gjh_kw]
#You group the customers or vendors who prefer the same language to one customer or vendor class. For this class, you specify a locale that is associated with the language in the '''Locale''' box of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_10_00|Customer Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR201000|AR201000]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_10_00|Vendor Classes] (AP2010100) form. 
#:((({S:Warn}The system will assign the locale to the new customer or vendor accounts automatically when you select the customer or vendor class for the account on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form. For existing vendors and customers, you need to manually select the preferred locale for each account.
)))
#You configure the mailing settings for the customer or vendor class on the '''Mailing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_10_00|Customer Classes] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_10_00|Vendor Classes] form. For a mailing, you specify the notification template and report you have created.
#:((({S:Warn}The customer or vendor class provides the default settings for the customer or vendor accounts of the class, but you can override these default settings to make the mailing configuration more specific. Mailings modified for specific accounts on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] form are marked by the system as overridden (that is, the '''Overridden''' check box is selected on the form). If you change the configuration of a mailing for a customer or vendor class, these changes affect the mailings of all customer or vendor accounts of this class, except those mailings that were modified specifically for a customer or vendor account (overridden).
)))

Once you have performed these configuration steps, when you initiate emailing by using a mass processing form or the corresponding action on an entry form, the system does the following:[anchor|#ul_df3_zmj_nw]
#Generates emails from the notification template you have created in the preferred language and specified for the customer or vendor on the '''Mailing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] form.
#Applies region-specific settings to each email body.
#Replaces any placeholders with the corresponding translations (if placeholders are used for the values for which translations are available).
#Attaches the report that you have created in the preferred language and specified for the customer or vendor on the '''Mailing Settings''' tab.

As a result, customers and vendors receive notifications in their preferred languages.[anchor|#_847db9a7-b760-4bef-a7b2-8ebeb3e05ff3]
==Troubleshooting User Input Translations==
Once you have entered translations for multiple boxes that have multi-language support and you start using these translations in documents or reports, you may realize that some translations are missing. In most cases, this means that you have not entered a translation, and the system is displaying the value entered for the default language or another alternative language. The system searches for a translation as follows:[anchor|#ol_cwc_q21_kw]
#If a locale is specified for the applicable customer, vendor, or report, the system searches for a translation available for the language of the locale. If this translation is available, the system ends the search and displays the translation.
#If a translation for the language of the locale assigned to the customer, vendor, or report is not available or a locale is not specified for these entities, the system searches for a translation specified for the language of the locale you used to sign in. If a translation for the locale language is available, the system ends the search and displays the translation.
#If a translation for the locale language is not available, the system searches for a translation specified for the language selected as the default on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_50|System Locales] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200550|SM200550]) form. If a translation for the default language is available, the system ends the search and displays the translation.
#If the translation for the default language is not available, the system searches for a translation specified for any language selected as an alternative on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_50|System Locales] form, in the sequence specified for alternative languages in the '''Sequence''' column on this form. If a translation for some alternative language is available, the system ends the search and displays the translation.
#If no translation is available, the system displays an empty value. 

When the system displays a translation of a value in a box with multi-language support, it always displays the ISO code of the corresponding language on the right side of the box.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Use of User Input Translations Starting with  Acumatica ERP     6, you can translate user input for multiple text boxes in the system. That is, you can maintain     your data in multiple languages. These data translations can later be used in printed reports     and documents. In this topic, you will read about how to print reports and documents, how to send     notifications in the language preferred by the customer or vendor, and how the system searches     for translations. Printing Localized Reports If you have enabled multilingual user input and provided translations for the fields that     supply data to a report, you can prepare a fully localized report—that is, a report whose     strings (headers and footers) and data are localized. By default, the system prepares a report     in the language associated with the locale you used to sign in. You can override this locale by     specifying another locale on a report form in the  Locale  box. Before you prepare a localized report, you should make sure that all of the following     preliminary steps have been completed: All the needed locales are added and activated on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200550|SM200550]) System Locales form.      For step-by-step instructions, see  To Add a New Locale.  Multilingual user input is set up, as described in  Enabling Multilingual User Input. The user interface is localized, including reports. For details, see  Translation Process in the System Administration Guide and  Translating Reports in the Acumatica Report Designer Guide. There are translations for the fields that supply data to the report. Once you have finished, you can prepare a fully localized report as follows: You select the needed locale in the  Locale  box on the report      form. You run the report.  The system prints the localized version of the report, where the       report's strings and report's data are translated to the language of the locale you have       selected on the report form. If you have not selected a locale on the report form, the system prepares the report in the     language of the locale you are currently signed in with. A user may specify a locale while constructing a report by using the Report Designer. The     locale setting from the Report Designer overrides the locale you used to sign in, but not the     locale you specified in the  Locale  box on the report form. For example, suppose that your company utilizes two locales:  en-US  and      fr-CA . English is set up as the default language, and French is the alternative     language. Some of the company's personnel speak English and some speak French. Also, the     company's data—such as descriptions of GL accounts and descriptions in inventory     items—is maintained in two languages.  Further suppose that a user who prefers working under the English locale needs to prepare a     report in French for his or her French-speaking manager. The user opens the report form, selects     the French locale in the  Locale  box, and runs the report. The system     prepares the report in French, regardless of the locale the user is currently signed in     with. Printing Localized Documents You can associate a locale with a customer or vendor. If you do, with the enabled multilingual     user input, when you create a document for this customer or vendor and add a document line with     an inventory item, the system does the following: Populates the column with descriptions of inventory items in the language specified for the      customer or vendor Applies to the document the region-specific settings defined for the locale you are      currently signed in with Populates the boxes for which translations are available with the values in the language of      the locale you used to sign in For example, suppose that you work under the  en-US  locale. You associate a customer     with some French locale, such as  fr-CA , and enter translations of inventory item     descriptions in French. Then you create an invoice on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos     (AR301000) form, select the customer, and add an inventory item. The system populates the     descriptions of credit terms, GL accounts and subaccounts, taxes, and the payment method of the     customer in English. But the system populates the  Transaction Descr.      column with the item description in French. When you release the invoice, this item description     in French is posted to the ledger as the GL transaction description. The system supports the described behavior for documents that you create on the following     forms:   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000),   ([~/?ScreenId=AP304000|AP304000]) Quick Checks     (AP304000),   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000),   ([~/?ScreenId=AR304000|AR304000]) Cash Sales     (AR304000),   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000), and   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000). You may frequently need to print reports that are versions of documents created in  Acumatica ERP,     as with the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR641000|AR641000]) Invoice/Memo (AR641000) and   ([~/?ScreenId=SO641010|SO641010]) Sales Order(SO641010) reports.  You can initiate the printing of a document directly from its entry form. If you are signed in     with the locale that is specified for the customer or vendor and you have translated the strings     of the report for this locale, the system will print a fully localized document. Otherwise, the     system will print the document with only the description of the inventory items in a customer's     preferred language. For example, suppose that a customer wants to receive sales orders in French. You should     perform the following steps: Make sure that the strings of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO641010|SO641010]) Sales Order (SO641010) report,      which corresponds to sales orders created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000)      form, are translated in French. Make sure that descriptions of inventory items, taxes, and credit and shipping terms have      French translations. Specify  fr-CA  as the customer's locale.  Sign in with the  fr-CA  locale, and create a sales order for the customer on the         ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders form.  Initiate printing of the sales order by using  Reports Print Sales Order/Quote , and the system opens the ready-to-print sales order in French. Also, you can print a document by using the corresponding report form. On the report form, you     select the reference number of the document, specify locale of the customer or vendor in the       Locale  box, and run the report. The system opens the ready-to-print     document in the language of the locale you have specified. For details, see the previous section     in this topic.  Sending Localized Notifications Multilingual user input can also be used in correspondence you send to your customers and     vendors by means of  Acumatica ERP     mailings, which are described in detail in  Managing Mailings. Starting     with  Acumatica ERP     6, you can specify a locale for a notification template. The system uses the assigned locale to     apply region-specific settings to the text, dates, and digits in the body of the notification     template. The system also retrieves the translations of the values needed to replace the     placeholders in the body according to the language of the locale.  If you want to send mailings in the language preferred by a customer or a vendor, you need to     set up the system as follows: You create a dedicated notification template on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM204003|SM204003]) Notification Templates      (SM204000) and specify the locale of the needed language in the        Locale  box. You also compose the notification text in the language of      the locale. For details on creating a notification template, see  Notification Templates. If you want to send a document as an attachment, you create a dedicated report for this      document type—for example, a copy of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR641000|AR641000]) Invoice/Memo (AR641000)      report—by using the Report Designer. You enter the strings of the report (headers and      footers) in the same language that you used to compose the notification and, in the report      settings, specify the same locale as you specified for the notification template. For details,      see  Creating and Modifying the Reports in the Acumatica      Report Designer Guide. You group the customers or vendors who prefer the same language to one      customer or vendor class. For this class, you specify a locale that is associated with the      language in the  Locale  box of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR201000|AR201000]) Customer Classes (AR201000) or   ([~/?ScreenId=AP201000|AP201000]) Vendor Classes (AP2010100) form.  The system will assign the       locale to the new customer or vendor accounts automatically when you select the customer or       vendor class for the account on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000)       or   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors (AP303000) form. For existing vendors and       customers, you need to manually select the preferred locale for each account. You configure the mailing settings for the customer or vendor class on the        Mailing Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR201000|AR201000]) Customer Classes or   ([~/?ScreenId=AP201000|AP201000]) Vendor Classes form. For a mailing, you specify the      notification template and report you have created. The customer or vendor class provides       the default settings for the customer or vendor accounts of the class, but you can override       these default settings to make the mailing configuration more specific. Mailings modified for       specific accounts on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers or   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors form are marked by the system as overridden (that is,       the  Overridden  check box is selected on the form). If you change the       configuration of a mailing for a customer or vendor class, these changes affect the mailings       of all customer or vendor accounts of this class, except those mailings that were modified       specifically for a customer or vendor account (overridden). Once you have performed these configuration steps, when you initiate emailing by using a mass     processing form or the corresponding action on an entry form, the system does the following: Generates emails from the notification template you have created in the preferred language      and specified for the customer or vendor on the  Mailing Settings  tab of      the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers or   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors form. Applies region-specific settings to each email body. Replaces any placeholders with the corresponding translations (if placeholders are used for      the values for which translations are available). Attaches the report that you have created in the preferred language and specified for the      customer or vendor on the  Mailing Settings  tab. As a result, customers and vendors receive notifications in their preferred languages. Troubleshooting User Input Translations Once you have entered translations for multiple boxes that have multi-language support and you     start using these translations in documents or reports, you may realize that some translations     are missing. In most cases, this means that you have not entered a translation, and the system     is displaying the value entered for the default language or another alternative language.

If a translation for the language of the locale assigned to the customer, vendor, or report      is not available or a locale is not specified for these entities, the system searches for a      translation specified for the language of the locale you used to sign in. If a translation for      the locale language is available, the system ends the search and displays the translation. If a translation for the locale language is not available, the system searches for a      translation specified for the language selected as the default on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200550|SM200550]) System Locales (SM200550) form. If a translation for the default      language is available, the system ends the search and displays the translation. If the translation for the default language is not available, the system searches for a      translation specified for any language selected as an alternative on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200550|SM200550]) System Locales form, in the sequence specified for alternative      languages in the  Sequence  column on this form. If a translation for some      alternative language is available, the system ends the search and displays the      translation. If no translation is available, the system displays an empty value.  When the system displays a translation of a value in a box with multi-language support, it     always displays the ISO code of the corresponding language on the right side of the box. ]]></column>

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
 Acumatica ERP provides built-in localization functionality, so you can easily translate Acumatica ERP into any language without using third-party products. You can collect the strings used in the whole system or on a particular form, and translate them for any locale available in Acumatica ERP. {br}

This topic explains how to translate interface strings by using the built-in localization functionality of Acumatica ERP. {br}{TOC}
==Translating Application Strings==
In Acumatica ERP, various strings that are used on the application interface—such as element and column labels, error messages, and warnings—are stored within the code. Hence, the translation of the strings includes two steps: collecting strings and translating strings. {br}

During the string collection process, the system gathers the strings used in the system (including the strings in customized system elements, such as forms) and prepares a string collection for translation. You can collect all strings in the system or the strings bound to particular forms. Because the collection process is resource- and time-consuming, we recommend that you perform string collection on the whole system after you install the system and after updates to collect the new and updated strings. For details, see [[#section_rp3_5bc_gw|Collecting the Strings for Translation].{br}

Translation of the collected strings from U.S. English, which is used as the Acumatica ERP default language, to any other language can be performed directly in Acumatica ERP. Alternatively, the filtered list of strings may be exported to an Excel file, and imported back after being translated somewhere else. For more information, see [[#section_r5w_5bc_gw|Translating Strings].{br}

After you finish translating strings on the interface, when a user signs in to the system and selects a local language, the application will use strings translated to this language. For the strings that are not translated, the system will display the string value in the default language (U.S. English).[anchor|#section_rp3_5bc_gw]
==Collecting the Strings for Translation==
Source strings include element labels, toolbar and menu items, drop-down list options, error messages, dialog box captions, and form names. When you localize the system for the first time or after you update your instance, you should collect all the strings used in the system for translation as follows:[anchor|#ul_xw4_34m_vs]
*Click '''Collect Strings''' on the form toolbar on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) form.

If any system functionality is updated or customized in your system that was previously localized, you can collect the new strings used on a particular form (or multiple forms) for translation. To collect these strings, you should create a translation set that includes only the required forms, and then collect the strings used on these forms for translation on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_21_15_00|Translation Sets] ([~/?ScreenId=SM211500|SM211500]) form. For the detailed procedures, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Translation_Sets_Add|To Add a New Translation Set] and [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Translation_Sets_Collect|To Collect the Strings of a Translation Set]. {br}

You can also collect strings from multiple translation sets at once by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_51_15_00|Collect Translation Sets] ([~/?ScreenId=SM511500|SM511500]) form. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Translation_Sets_Collect_Multiple|To Collect Strings of Multiple Translation Sets].{br}

If you are collecting strings that were previously translated and if any of these strings has not been found during the new collection process, the system marks these strings as obsolete and displays them on the '''Obsolete''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] form. ((({S:Hint}String collection is a time-consuming operation that should be performed during off-peak hours and never attempted on a busy production system.
)))[anchor|#section_r5w_5bc_gw]
==Translating Strings==
Generally, translating strings is a straightforward process: In the '''Default Values''' table of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) form, type the translation for each string that must be translated in the ''&lt;Target Language&gt;'' column and select the '''Do Not Translate''' check box for each string that does not require translation. When you&rsquo;re finished, click '''Save'''. The fully translated (that is, translated into all languages defined in the system) strings and the strings that do not require translation are hidden from the '''Default Values''' table. {br}

Despite the simplicity, the translation process has its own particularities in how you filter strings to be translated and in what you translate or not. {br}

First of all, the strings you see on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] form are filtered in any case: You can see either ''bound'' or ''unbound'' strings. Bound strings are the strings associated with system resources bound to forms, such as table names. Unbound strings are the strings associated with resources that are not bound to forms, such as prompts. To translate all the strings on the interface, you should translate both the bound and unbound strings. The type of strings displayed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] depends on the '''Show Only Unbound''' check box in the Selection area of this form as follows:[anchor|#ul_x1p_gz3_5s]
*If the check box is cleared, the system displays only bound strings. For any bound string, you can get the context of the string: By using the '''Usage Details''' dialog box, you can view the list of forms on which you can find the string and quickly navigate to any form in the list.
*:((({S:Warn}In Acumatica ERP, the contents of a form may be content-related and may depend on system configuration and on selections on the form itself. If you don&rsquo;t see the string immediately, you can check the corresponding reference topic in help.
)))
*:Additionally, you can select a form in the '''Show Used in UI''' box in the Selection area of the form to view and translate only strings that are associated with the resources of the selected form.
*If the check box is selected, the system displays only unbound strings. Additionally, you can select which type (or types) of the unbound resources you want to view and translate.

To further narrow the displayed strings, you can use table filtering, described in detail in the [HelpRoot_Interface\IB_Filters|Filters] chapter of the Acumatica ERP Interface Guide.{br}

The next particularity of the translation process relates to the contents of the source values of strings. If you open the list of collected strings, you will see that strings include the text itself and may include special formatting. The examples of the special formatting include the following:[anchor|#ul_zwy_ltd_vs]
*The ''-&gt;'' character: For commands in lists, the ''-&gt;'' character separates the name of the list from the command (for example, ''State -&gt; Completed''; the ''State -&gt;'' part of the string is for informational purposes only). You should translate only the text after the ''-&gt;'' sign.
*HTML tags: Strings may include HTML tags that define the formatting of the string. For example, ''&lt;B&gt;'' and ''&lt;/B&gt;'' tags indicate that the enclosed text should be in bold type. You should keep these tags in the translated text in their respective places to keep the formatting.
*Placeholders that use the ''&rsquo;&#0123;&lt;number&gt;&#0125;&rsquo;'' format: These placeholders are replaced with text when a user who works with the document gets the message. You should copy the placeholders without changes in the respective places in the translation.
*The ''~'' (tilde) character: When a message that you want to translate contains multiline text, the end of each line is indicated by the ''~'' character. You should use the tilde in the translated multiline text to mark the ends of lines.
*:((({S:Warn}If you do not mark the ends of lines with tildes in the translated text, the message will be displayed as one line for messages translated directly in Acumatica ERP, or the translation of this text will not be imported for messages translated in an external file (for example, in a Microsoft Excel workbook).
)))
*The special wrapper {{[a type=ACTION][/a]}}: This wrapper is used along with messages that the system displays in tables when the table is empty. It converts the text into a hyperlink. When a user clicks this link, the system performs the action specified in the wrapper (such as {{clear}}). You should keep this wrapper in the translated text in its initial place to keep the formatting and the action.

One additional particularity is related to handling strings that should not be translated. In terms of the effect on the UI, there is no difference between a string with the '''Do Not Translate''' check box selected, and a string left untranslated and with the '''Do Not Translate''' check box cleared: Either way, the user will see the value of the string in the default language. However, based on whether you select this check box, these strings are processed differently:[anchor|#_b1b40b1b-7b8d-4ddb-9881-7b6ff0f2faca]
*A string with the '''Do Not Translate''' check box selected is hidden from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] form until you select the '''Show Excluded''' check box. Additionally, such strings are considered valid when you try to validate translation of strings on forms.
*A string that is not translated and for which with the '''Do Not Translate''' check box is cleared appears on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] form when you select a language for translation. Also, such strings are considered invalid and warnings about these strings appear on the form when you try to validate string translation on forms. 
*:((({S:Warn}For more information on validation of translation of strings, see the '''Reviewing the Translations on Forms''' section in this topic.
)))

For the detailed procedures, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Translate_Bound_Strings|To Translate Bound Strings], [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Translate_Unbound_Strings|To Translate Unbound Strings], and [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Translate_Exclude|To Exclude Strings from Translation].{br}

After you add translations for a string in all the languages defined in the system or mark a string as not requiring translation and save the result, the string is removed from the work area. You can see the fully translated strings and the excluded strings by selecting the '''Show Localized''' and '''Show Excluded''' check boxes, respectively, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] form. 
==Handling Multiple Occurrences of the Same String==
A string—such as an element label or a drop-down list option that is available on multiple forms—may be used in the interface multiple times. Depending on the context, the same string may require different translation. To address this situation, Acumatica ERP shows the resource or resources the string is associated with for each string listed in the '''Default Values''' table of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) form. These resources, which are displayed in the '''Key-Specific Values''' table, indicate the entities in which specific string is used. You can provide correct translations for each occurrence of the string depending on its context. ((({S:Warn}If you want to provide specific translations for different occurrences of a string, you must provide a generic translation in the '''Default Values''' table.
)))
The translation you specify in the '''Default Values''' table is generally applied to all occurrences of the string automatically. But if you specify specific translations for certain occurrences in the '''Key-Specific Values''' table, the system will use the specific translations. 
==Reviewing the Translations on Forms==
To check if all the strings on a form are translated into a language defined in the system, you can turn on validation of translations on forms for the language on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_50|System Locales] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200550|SM200550]) form. For the detailed procedure, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Activate_Validation|To Turn On Validation of Translations].{br}

With the validation active, when you sign in with the language and open a form that has untranslated strings, you see a warning with the quantity of the untranslated strings appear at the top of the form. ((({S:Warn}The warnings appear for all users of the system who sign in with the language.
)))
You can click the warning to expand the list. Each warning includes the type and the details of the resource with which the untranslated string is associated, and a link to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) form. You can click the link to quickly open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] form with the locale of the untranslated string selected, and then find and translate the string. ((({S:Warn}The strings with the '''Do Not Translate''' check box selected on the '''Collected''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] form are considered valid and are not listed in the warning.
)))
After you translate all strings into a language and validate the translations, you can turn off the validation of translations, as described in [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Deactivate_Validation|To Turn Off Validation of Translations].
==Exporting and Importing Strings==
You can export strings, translate them by using third-party applications, and import back into Acumatica ERP. Translated strings are loaded into the system as a locale dictionary and are immediately applied to the user interface once a user signs into the system using a specific locale. {br}

You can also import the file with the translations into a new instance to speed up the translation process. The new instance should have the locales translations that you want to import. ((({S:Warn}If the imported file includes strings that were not collected in the instance, these strings will be imported as unbound strings. This happens because the system is not able to reinstate the bounds between the forms and the system resources associated with the imported strings. Such strings are displayed on the interface similarly to the way other unbound strings are displayed, and you won&rsquo;t be able to use the '''Usage Details''' dialog box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) to quickly view the forms the strings are used on.
)))
To export and import strings, use the corresponding buttons on the table toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] form. ((({S:Warn}The exported file includes only the strings displayed in the table, based on the filtering applied on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] form.
)))
==Correcting Translations==
At any time during the translation process you may need to change the translation of a string—for example, to correct a typo. You can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) form to correct the translation. The steps to correct the translation depend on the string whose translation you want to correct:[anchor|#ul_vhj_rkj_5s]
*If the string has not been fully translated, use the filtering options to find it and correct the translation.
*If the string has been fully translated and is hidden on the form, select the '''Show Localized''' check box to make the fully translated strings appear on the '''Collected''' tab, and then find the string and correct the translation.
*If the string has been wrongly marked as not requiring translation, select the '''Show Excluded''' check box to make the strings that do not require translation appear on the '''Collected''' tab, and then find the string and clear the '''Show Excluded''' check box.

If you know when the translation has been added or modified, you can use filtering to view only strings with translations added and modified after the date by specifying the dates in the '''Created Since''' and '''Modified After''' boxes, respectively.
==Updating Translations==
Sometimes the values of particular strings change. For example, this may happen if the functionality of a form is changed during an update of your Acumatica ERP instance or if a customization has been applied to a form by the customizers in-house. When you collect strings, if any of the previously translated strings have not been found during the new collection process, these strings are considered obsolete and displayed on the '''Obsolete''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) form. Strings with new values appear on the '''Collected''' tab as untranslated strings.((({S:Warn}We recommend that you collect all strings in the system by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] form after every update of your Acumatica ERP instance.
)))
If any functionality is updated or customized in the system regularly, you may need to regularly collect the strings from the appropriate forms for translation. To do that, you should create a translation set in which you include a required form or forms by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_21_15_00|Translation Sets] ([~/?ScreenId=SM211500|SM211500]) form, and then add these sets to a schedule for automatic collection. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Scheduled_Processing|Scheduled Processing].[anchor|#section_nq3_n3l_hw]
==Translating Wiki Articles==
The Help wiki is created in the base language of Acumatica ERP, U.S. English. For a newly added locale, all articles will be displayed in this base language until you create locale-specific versions of the articles. For the detailed procedure, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Translate_Wiki_Article|To Create a Localized Version of an Article].{br}

After you translate an article, only the versions of the article created in the selected locale will be listed on the '''History''' tab when you open the article in [HelpRoot_FormReference\DM__con_Wiki_Wiki_Editor_Form_for_Articles|Wiki Editor Form for Articles]. {br}

For more information about wikis in Acumatica ERP, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__mng_Wikis|Managing Wikis].

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Translation Process  Acumatica ERP provides built-in localization functionality, so you can easily translate  Acumatica ERP into any language without using third-party products. You can collect the strings 				used in the whole system or on a particular form, and translate them for any locale 				available in  Acumatica ERP.  This topic explains how to translate interface strings by using the built-in 				localization functionality of  Acumatica ERP.  Translating Application Strings In  Acumatica ERP, various strings that are used on the application interface—such as element and 				column labels, error messages, and warnings—are stored within the code. Hence, the 				translation of the strings includes two steps: collecting strings and translating 				strings.  During the string collection process, the system gathers the strings used in the 				system (including the strings in customized system elements, such as forms) and 				prepares a string collection for translation. You can collect all strings in the 				system or the strings bound to particular forms. Because the collection process is 				resource- and time-consuming, we recommend that you perform string collection on the 				whole system after you install the system and after updates to collect the new and 				updated strings. For details, see  Collecting the Strings for Translation Collecting the Strings for Translation. Translation of the collected strings from U.S. English, which is used as the  Acumatica ERP default language, to any other language can be performed directly in  Acumatica ERP. Alternatively, the filtered list of strings may be exported to an Excel file, 				and imported back after being translated somewhere else. For more information, see 					 Translating Strings Translating Strings. After you finish translating strings on the interface, when a user signs in to the 				system and selects a local language, the application will use strings translated to 				this language. For the strings that are not translated, the system will display the 				string value in the default language (U.S. English). Collecting the Strings for Translation Source strings include element labels, toolbar and menu items, drop-down list 				options, error messages, dialog box captions, and form names. When you localize the 				system for the first time or after you update your instance, you should collect all 				the strings used in the system for translation as follows: Click  Collect Strings  on the form toolbar on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries (SM200540) form. If any system functionality is updated or customized in your system that was previously 				localized, you can collect the new strings used on a particular form (or multiple 				forms) for translation. To collect these strings, you should create a translation 				set that includes only the required forms, and then collect the strings used on 				these forms for translation on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM211500|SM211500]) Translation Sets (SM211500) 				form. For the detailed procedures, see  To Add a New Translation Set and  To Collect the Strings of a Translation Set.  You can also collect strings from multiple translation sets at once by using the 					  ([~/?ScreenId=SM511500|SM511500]) Collect Translation Sets (SM511500) form. For details, see  To Collect Strings of Multiple Translation Sets. If you are collecting strings that were previously translated and if any of these 				strings has not been found during the new collection process, the system marks these 				strings as obsolete and displays them on the  Obsolete  tab of 				the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries form.  String collection is a time-consuming operation that should be 				performed during off-peak hours and never attempted on a busy production 				system. Translating Strings Generally, translating strings is a straightforward process: In the  Default 					Values  table of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries 				(SM200540) form, type the translation for each string that must be translated in 				the  <Target Language>  column and select the  Do Not 					Translate  check box for each string that does not require 				translation. When you're finished, click  Save . The fully 				translated (that is, translated into all languages defined in the system) strings 				and the strings that do not require translation are hidden from the 					 Default Values  table.  Despite the simplicity, the translation process has its own particularities in how 				you filter strings to be translated and in what you translate or not.  First of all, the strings you see on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries form are 				filtered in any case: You can see either  bound  or  unbound  strings. 				Bound strings are the strings associated with system resources bound to forms, such 				as table names. Unbound strings are the strings associated with resources that are 				not bound to forms, such as prompts. To translate all the strings on the interface, 				you should translate both the bound and unbound strings. The type of strings 				displayed on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries depends on the  Show Only 					Unbound  check box in the Selection area of this form as follows: If the check box is cleared, the system displays only bound strings. For any 					bound string, you can get the context of the string: By using the 						 Usage Details  dialog box, you can view the list of 					forms on which you can find the string and quickly navigate to any form in the 						list. In  Acumatica ERP, the contents of a form may be content-related and may depend on system 						configuration and on selections on the form itself. If you don't see the 						string immediately, you can check the corresponding reference topic in 						help. Additionally, you can select a form in the  Show 							Used in UI  box in the Selection area of the form to view and 						translate only strings that are associated with the resources of the 						selected form. If the check box is selected, the system displays only unbound strings. 					Additionally, you can select which type (or types) of the unbound resources you 					want to view and translate. To further narrow the displayed strings, you can use table filtering, described in detail in 				the  Filters chapter of the  Acumatica ERP Interface Guide. The next particularity of the translation process relates to the contents of the 				source values of strings. If you open the list of collected strings, you will see 				that strings include the text itself and may include special formatting. The 				examples of the special formatting include the following: The  ->  character: For commands in lists, the  ->  character 					separates the name of the list from the command (for example,  State -> 						Completed ; the  State ->  part of the string is for 					informational purposes only). You should translate only the text after the 						 ->  sign. HTML tags: Strings may include HTML tags that define the formatting of the 					string. For example,  <B>  and  </B>  tags indicate that the 					enclosed text should be in bold type. You should keep these tags in the 					translated text in their respective places to keep the formatting. Placeholders that use the  '{<number>}'  format: These placeholders are 					replaced with text when a user who works with the document gets the message. You 					should copy the placeholders without changes in the respective places in the 					translation. The  ~  (tilde) character: When a message that you want to translate 					contains multiline text, the end of each line is indicated by the  ~  					character. You should use the tilde in the translated multiline text to mark the 					ends of lines. If you do not mark the ends of lines with tildes in the 						translated text, the message will be displayed as one line for messages 						translated directly in  Acumatica ERP, or the translation of this text will not be imported for messages 						translated in an external file (for example, in a Microsoft Excel 						workbook). The special wrapper  [a type=ACTION][/a] : This wrapper is used 					along with messages that the system displays in tables when the table is empty. 					It converts the text into a hyperlink. When a user clicks this link, the system 					performs the action specified in the wrapper (such as  clear ). 					You should keep this wrapper in the translated text in its initial place to keep 					the formatting and the action. One additional particularity is related to handling strings that should not be translated. In 				terms of the effect on the UI, there is no difference between a string with the 					 Do Not Translate  check box selected, and a string left 				untranslated and with the  Do Not Translate  check box cleared: 				Either way, the user will see the value of the string in the default language. 				However, based on whether you select this check box, these strings are processed 				differently: A string with the  Do Not Translate  check box selected is 					hidden from the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries form until you select the 						 Show Excluded  check box. Additionally, such strings 					are considered valid when you try to validate translation of strings on 					forms. A string that is not translated and for which with the  Do Not 						Translate  check box is cleared appears on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries form when you select a language for translation. 					Also, such strings are considered invalid and warnings about these strings 					appear on the form when you try to validate string translation on forms. 						 For more information on validation of translation of strings, see the 							 Reviewing the Translations on Forms  section in 						this topic. For the detailed procedures, see  To Translate Bound Strings, 					 To Translate Unbound Strings, and  To Exclude Strings from Translation. After you add translations for a string in all the languages defined in the system or 				mark a string as not requiring translation and save the result, the string is 				removed from the work area. You can see the fully translated strings and the 				excluded strings by selecting the  Show Localized  and  Show 					Excluded  check boxes, respectively, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries form.  Handling Multiple Occurrences of the Same String A string—such as an element label or a drop-down list option that is available on 				multiple forms—may be used in the interface multiple times. Depending on the 				context, the same string may require different translation. To address this 				situation,  Acumatica ERP shows the resource or resources the string is associated with for each string 				listed in the  Default Values  table of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries (SM200540) form. These resources, 				which are displayed in the  Key-Specific Values  table, 				indicate the entities in which specific string is used. You can provide correct 				translations for each occurrence of the string depending on its context.  If you want to provide specific translations for different occurrences of a 				string, you must provide a generic translation in the  Default 					Values  table. The translation you specify in the  Default Values  table is generally 				applied to all occurrences of the string automatically. But if you specify specific 				translations for certain occurrences in the  Key-Specific 					Values  table, the system will use the specific translations.  Reviewing the Translations on Forms To check if all the strings on a form are translated into a language defined in the 				system, you can turn on validation of translations on forms for the language on the 					  ([~/?ScreenId=SM200550|SM200550]) System Locales (SM200550) form. For the detailed procedure, 				see  To Turn On Validation of Translations. With the validation active, when you sign in with the language and open a form that 				has untranslated strings, you see a warning with the quantity of the untranslated 				strings appear at the top of the form.  The warnings appear for all users of the system who sign in with the 				language. You can click the warning to expand the list. Each warning includes the type and the details 				of the resource with which the untranslated string is associated, and a link to the 					  ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries (SM200540) form. You can click the link to 				quickly open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries form with the locale of the 				untranslated string selected, and then find and translate the string.  The strings with the  Do Not Translate  check box selected on 				the  Collected  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries form 				are considered valid and are not listed in the warning. After you translate all strings into a language and validate the translations, you 				can turn off the validation of translations, as described in  To Turn Off Validation of Translations. Exporting and Importing Strings You can export strings, translate them by using third-party applications, and import 				back into  Acumatica ERP. Translated strings are loaded into the system as a locale dictionary and are 				immediately applied to the user interface once a user signs into the system using a 				specific locale.  You can also import the file with the translations into a new instance to speed up 				the translation process. The new instance should have the locales translations that 				you want to import.  If the imported file includes strings that were not collected in the instance, these 				strings will be imported as unbound strings. This happens because the system is not 				able to reinstate the bounds between the forms and the system resources associated 				with the imported strings. Such strings are displayed on the interface similarly to 				the way other unbound strings are displayed, and you won't be able to use the 					 Usage Details  dialog box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries (SM200540) to quickly view the forms the strings 				are used on. To export and import strings, use the corresponding buttons on the table toolbar of 				the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries form.  The exported file includes only the strings displayed in the table, based on the 				filtering applied on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries form. Correcting Translations At any time during the translation process you may need to change the translation of a 				string—for example, to correct a typo. You can use the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries (SM200540) form to correct the translation. The steps to correct the 				translation depend on the string whose translation you want to correct: If the string has not been fully translated, use the filtering options to find it and 					correct the translation. If the string has been fully translated and is hidden on the form, select the 						 Show Localized  check box to make the fully translated 					strings appear on the  Collected  tab, and then find the 					string and correct the translation. If the string has been wrongly marked as not requiring translation, select the 						 Show Excluded  check box to make the strings that do 					not require translation appear on the  Collected  tab, and 					then find the string and clear the  Show Excluded  check 					box. If you know when the translation has been added or modified, you can use filtering to view 				only strings with translations added and modified after the date by specifying the 				dates in the  Created Since  and  Modified 					After  boxes, respectively. Updating Translations Sometimes the values of particular strings change. For example, this may happen if the 				functionality of a form is changed during an update of your  Acumatica ERP instance or if a customization has been applied to a form by the customizers 				in-house. When you collect strings, if any of the previously translated strings have 				not been found during the new collection process, these strings are considered 				obsolete and displayed on the  Obsolete  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries (SM200540) form. Strings with new values appear on 				the  Collected  tab as untranslated strings. We recommend that you collect all strings in the system by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries form after every update of your  Acumatica ERP instance. If any functionality is updated or customized in the system regularly, you may need to 				regularly collect the strings from the appropriate forms for translation. To do 				that, you should create a translation set in which you include a required form or 				forms by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM211500|SM211500]) Translation Sets (SM211500) form, and then add 				these sets to a schedule for automatic collection. For more information, see  Scheduled Processing. Translating Wiki Articles The Help wiki is created in the base language of  Acumatica ERP, U.S. English. For a newly added locale, all articles will be displayed in this 				base language until you create locale-specific versions of the articles. For the 				detailed procedure, see  To Create a Localized Version of an Article. After you translate an article, only the versions of the article created in the 				selected locale will be listed on the  History  tab when you open the article 				in  Wiki Editor Form for Articles.

If the string has multiple occurrences in the system, do the                                 following: In the  [Target language]  column of the in                                     the  Default Values  table, type the                                     translation that suits most of the occurrences. In the  [Target language]  column of the in                                     the  Key-Specific Values  table, type the                                     translations for specific occurrences that differ from the                                     translation in the  Default Values                                      table.

In any ERP system, such tasks as the processing of documents or the validation of accounts require significant time and system resources. As such, they should be processed at times when there are no employees at work, such as weekends or nights. Other processing, such as releasing or posting documents, takes less time but also should be performed regularly, with a frequency determined by your business needs. {br}

In Acumatica ERP, if the ''Scheduled Processing'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can set up automated processing for most processing forms instead of initiating the processing manually. You can handle the scheduling in one of the following ways:
*From the target processing form: Here you configure the appropriate processing. You then invoke the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_20|Automation Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=SM205020|SM205020]) form as a pop-up to create a new schedule for this processing.
*By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_30|Automation Schedule Statuses] form: On this form, you can set up both operations by using different tabs.

Generally, both ways deliver the same result, although the first way is a bit easier if you use predefined filters to display appropriate documents (or other entities) on the processing form. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Scheduling_the_Desired_Processing|To Schedule Processing].((({S:Warn}The system uses the ''admin'' user account to run scheduled processes. This account uses the first available system locale, which is specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_50|System Locales] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200550|SM200550]) form for the company with the schedule.
)))
The sections below describe the two ways you can configure automatic processing. When you set up an automatic processing, you&rsquo;ll have to create separate schedules for each set of documents you generally process (or for the most time-consuming ones) and manually process the rest of the documents. {br}{TOC}
==Configuring Processing Through a Specific Processing Form==
Generally, the scheduling of processing includes two operations: 
#The configuration of processing: Selecting documents by their date, total amount, customer or vendor, currency, or any other relevant property
#The scheduling itself: Specifying how often processing should be performed, at what time, and with or without a limit on the number of executions

On many of the processing forms, you can sort documents by specific criteria, such as posting period, document type, or processing type. When you perform the processing manually, you open the appropriate form and use the elements in the Selection area to select the documents or other objects for processing. You can create a filter or use an existing filter for the form to select documents by their properties, such as amounts in a specific range. {br}

To select the appropriate documents for automatic processing by using the processing form, you do the following: 
*Use the Selection area of the processing form to specify criteria.
*Optionally, apply a filter to select documents or objects by their properties.
*On the '''Schedule''' menu of the form toolbar, select ''Add''. This brings up the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_20|Automation Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=SM205020|SM205020]) form as a pop-up window; the values specified in the Selection area and the settings of the applied filter appear on the '''Conditions''' and '''Filter Values''' tabs of the form.
*Specify a name for the schedule, as well as its description, frequency, expiration information, and time of the day. Save the schedule.

==Configuring Processing Using the Automation Schedules Form==
By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_20|Automation Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=SM205020|SM205020]) form, you can configure scheduled processing for any processing form. To select documents for automatic processing by using this form, you do the following: 
#Select the processing form by its screen ID.
#Specify a name for the schedule, as well as its description, frequency, expiration information, and time of the day. 
#Specify the dates and the particular time to start processing. 
#:((({S:Hint}You can specify a start and end time for a processing session if you want the processing to be performed in sessions. Then the system, after stopping the processing at the end time, suspends it during the specified interval and resumes processing when a new session starts.
)))
#On the '''Conditions''' tab, specify the values that you would otherwise specify in the Selection area of the processing form.
#On the '''Filter Values''' tab, specify the filtering conditions based on the document or object properties.
#:((({S:Warn}If a field on the processing form is automatically filled in with a default value—for example, the '''Allocation Date''' field on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_50_45_00|Run Allocations] ([~/?ScreenId=GL504500|GL504500]) form, which by default has the current business date value—the system filters the entities that should be processed by this value. To reset the filter that uses the field's default value, on the '''Filter Values''' tab, you need to add a new filter for this field and leave the value empty.
)))
#Save the schedule.

==Viewing the History of Schedules==
Once you have assigned the processing to the schedule, processing of the form will be performed automatically, in accordance with the assigned schedule. To view when and how it was performed, on the original processing form, use the '''Schedule''' menu (on the form toolbar): Select the '''History''' option, which allows you to view the history of schedule execution in a specified date range. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Scheduling_the_Desired_Processing|To Schedule Processing].

Select the appropriate option button to indicate when the                                     schedules should be executed: at the end of the period, at the                                     start of the period, or on a fixed day of the period (which you                                     should specify if you select this option button). In the  Execution Time  section, specify the particular                     time of the day to start and stop the processing as follows: In the  Starts On  box, select the hour and minute                             when the first execution of the schedule should start. If you want the processing to be stopped at specific time or you want                             the processing to be repeated multiple times a day, in the                                  Stops On  box, select the hour and minute when                             the first execution of the schedule should stop.  If execution of the schedule should be repeated multiple times a day, in                             the  Every  box, select the interval between                             successive executions of the schedule. In the  Next Execution Time  box, make sure the                             next execution time is correct. If you want the system to execute the schedule at exactly the time                             specified in the  Next Execution Time  box, select                             the  Exact Time  check box. If the check box is                             cleared, the system may shift the next execution time of the schedule by                             multiple minutes. Optional: On the  Conditions  tab, specify conditions to                     select the documents or objects by and for which there are no corresponding                     elements in the Selection area of the original processing form as follows: Make sure the  Active  check box is selected. In the  Field Name  column, select the field to                             which you want to apply the filter. In the  Condition  column, select the condition on                             the field. If the field selected in the  Field Name  column                             for this row is a date field and you want the date field to be relative                             with respect to the current business date, select the                                  Relative  check box. Select the filtering value in the  Value  column                             and, if  Is Between  is selected in the                                  Condition  column, in the  Value                                 2  column. Optional: On the  Filter Values  tab, review the list of                     elements with the values. Notice that all the listed elements have the values                     you have selected in the Selection area on the original processing form. Click  Save  on the form toolbar             to create the schedule. When you save a newly created schedule, the system gives it an             identifier in accordance with the built-in numbering sequence intended for automation             schedules.  To View or Edit the Schedules for the Form Open the processing form for which a schedule has been created (or multiple                     schedules have been created).

Some Acumatica ERP functionality is implemented through ''automation steps'', which are steps to be executed on an Acumatica ERP form for specific records or objects generated in the system, depending on the properties of the record or object. For a data entry Acumatica ERP form, you can create any number of automation steps that redefine the functionality of toolbar actions, add values to combo box lists, or provide default values for the form elements, based on the properties of the records under processing. For more details on automation capabilities, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Workflow_Customization|Workflow Customization by Means of Automation Steps]. ((({S:Warn}The functionality is available if the ''Workflow Automation'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
)))
A complete set of automation steps is considered an ''automation definition'' and can be saved under a user-defined name. Acumatica ERP is delivered with a number of standard automation definitions, depending on the package you buy. You can use a standard automation definition, or you can create a new one by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_10|Automation Definitions] ([~/?ScreenId=SM205010|SM205010]) form. On this form, you can create automation definitions that can be used as backups of various states of automation in your system. ((({S:Hint}We recommend that you not modify a standard definition. You should instead use the standard definition as a backup in case your automation is unsuccessful or yields unwanted consequences. To extend a standard definition, specify a new name, copy details from the standard definition, and then make modifications only in the new definition. 
))){br}{TOC}
==Saving the Current State of Automation==
You may need to create an automation definition to save the current state of automation in your system. ((({S:Hint}
Always create a definition of the current automation state before you perform an upgrade or begin major changes to automation. 
)))
To create a definition for the current state of your system, do the following on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_10|Automation Definitions] form: 
#Click '''Insert''' to clear the elements on the form.
#Specify an ID and a description for a new definition.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Populate Definition''' to load the details of existing automation steps.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save''' to save the definition.

==Restoring a State of Automation from a Definition==
You can revert the system to one of Acumatica ERP default automation definitions by taking the following actions on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_10|Automation Definitions] form: 
# In the '''Definition''' box, select the definition by its ID.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Activate Definition'''. This action removes the automation steps associated with the screens and assigns the steps from the selected definition. For screens not listed in the definition, all automation steps will be removed during activation.

==Creating a New Definition Based on an Existing One==
To create a definition based on an existing one, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_10|Automation Definitions] form, do the following: 
#Click '''Insert''' to clear the elements on the form.
#Specify an ID and a description for the new definition.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Copy Details''', which opens the '''Specify Source Definition''' dialog box.
#In the '''Source Definition''' box, select a definition by its ID.
#Click '''OK''' to close the dialog box and load the details of the selected definition.
#Remove from the definition each screen for which you do not want to maintain automation by selecting the row and clicking '''Delete''' on the table toolbar.
#Save the definition by clicking '''Save''' on the form toolbar.

After that, you can make necessary changes in the new definition and be sure that you have a backup to restore the system in case your changes didn&rsquo;t result in the expected automation state.

Along with visual customization tools that can be used to customize forms, Acumatica ERP provides the automation functionality, which you can use to change the functionality of forms. {br}

With functional customization, you can change the existing business logic associated with particular screens to fit your business processes and requirements. Using screen automation functionality, you can add document statuses, provide different default values for specific elements, or make some of the elements unavailable, depending on document statuses. For example, you can configure the system so that bills with small amounts will be automatically approved and paid on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form, while bills with large amounts will require approval that can be performed only by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_50_20_00|Approve Bills for Payment] ([~/?ScreenId=AP502000|AP502000]) form. ((({S:Warn}The functionality is available if the ''Workflow Automation'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
)))
Also, you can create automation schedules and set up document processing to be performed automatically according to schedules with only the documents matching specific conditions being processed. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Scheduled_Processing|Scheduled Processing]. {br}{TOC}
==Understanding Automation Steps==
As a rule, you can create documents or objects of different types with the help of data entry forms (screens). For example, by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form, you can create bills, credit adjustments, debit adjustments, and prepayments. Documents of different types are processed differently in the system, and most of the functionality is built in. For some of the data entry forms, specific business logic for documents of different types is implemented through the sets of automation steps created for these forms and can be further modified with the help of automation steps. {br}

An automation step is a set of conditions for a document that, when reached, causes particular actions defined for the step to be performed, or restrictions on the values to be applied. {br}

Only data entry forms can be customized with the help of automation steps. For example, for the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] form, six automation steps define which of the actions on the form toolbar are available and which of the elements are unavailable for documents of each type with different statuses. {br}

You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_00|Automation Steps] ([~/?ScreenId=SM205000|SM205000]) form to create functional automation for the appropriate data entry form. {br}

Once you selected the data entry form for automation, before you start to configure automation steps, think through all types of documents that can be created on the form and how different their workflows should be. Specify the conditions on which the particular actions should be performed, and set up the default values for the elements or the restrictions for the values of the elements (input mask or minimum and maximum values). 
==Defining Conditions for the Automation Step==
Automation steps are executed conditionally. On the '''Conditions''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_00|Automation Steps] form, specify the conditions for applying the automation step. You can specify one condition or multiple conditions joined by logical operators (''OR'' or ''AND''). If a form can be used to create documents of multiple types, conditions can be used to select documents of a particular type and with a particular status. {br}

If you select a lookup element for a condition, you can select any value from the list to be used in the condition. For example, if you set up a condition for the documents with the ''Balanced'' status, select ''Status'' as the '''Field Name''', ''Equal'' as the '''Condition''', and ''Balanced'' as the '''Value'''. {br}

If you select an input element in a condition, manually enter the value. 
==Redefining Actions for the Step==
Once conditions are specified, on the '''Actions''' tab, select the actions to be performed for the documents matching the specified conditions. You can reload all the actions available for the form and redefine some of them for the step. {br}

For each action available on the target form, you can select one of the following options: 
*Disable it on the form once conditions are met
*Run it automatically
*Hide the action from the toolbar
*Use the action in its default meaning
*Convert it to a menu with menu options (reports or inquiries) added by using the '''Fill with Values''' dialog box
*Run the action in batch mode for all matching documents

To convert an action on the toolbar to a menu, you need to add options to this menu by using the '''Fill With Values''' dialog box. You can add, for example, a report to the '''Reports''' menu or an inquiry to the '''Inquiries''' menu. To add a report, an inquiry, or another action, perform the following actions: [anchor|#ol_fwc_ldn_mq]
#In the '''Field Name''' box, type {{@reportID}}, or {{@inquiryID}}, or {{@ActionName}}.
#In the '''Value''' box, type the ID of the report (for example, {{SO641010}}), inquiry (for example, {{ViewActivities}}), or action (for example, {{AddTask}}).
#To save the changes and close the dialog box, click '''Close'''. 

You can also update the ''Notification'' action to attach multiple reports to one mailing. The attached reports may have different formats (for example, you can attach a PDF and an HTML report to the same email). To attach multiple reports to one mailing, do the following:[anchor|#ol_h1c_qzm_mq]
#On the '''Actions''' tab, open the '''Fill with Values''' dialog box for the ''Notification'' action.
#In the ''@notification'' line, in the '''Value''' column, specify the mailing IDs, separated by commas.

The mailing will be sent according to the recipients of the first mailing in the line. The recipients of the other mailings will be discarded.{br}

Also, for the automation step, you can specify what should happen on failure of the redefined action or on its success. To do this, click '''Flow''' on the Details toolbar and specify what actions from this automation step or other automation steps should be performed on failure or success of the step. 
==Redefining Fields for the Step==
On the '''Fields''' tab, you can specify how some of the fields should be redefined when the conditions are met. You can select a field and do one of the following: 
*Set a minimum value, a maximum value, or both
*Redefine a field as a combo box
*Assign a default value
*Set up an input mask to ensure that the correct data will be entered or the correct format will be used
*Disable the field
*Hide the field

By using the '''Combo Box Values''' action, which opens the dialog box of the same name, you can add new values to the existing list of combo box values or create a new list for an input field redefined as a combo box. Only user-defined values can be removed from a the combo box list.

For example, by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form, you can create bills, credit adjustments, 				debit adjustments, and prepayments. Documents of different types are processed 				differently in the system, and most of the functionality is built in. For some of 				the data entry forms, specific business logic for documents of different types is 				implemented through the sets of automation steps created for these forms and can be 				further modified with the help of automation steps.  An automation step is a set of conditions for a document that, when reached, causes 				particular actions defined for the step to be performed, or restrictions on the 				values to be applied.  Only data entry forms can be customized with the help of automation steps. For 				example, for the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments form, six automation 				steps define which of the actions on the form toolbar are available and which of the 				elements are unavailable for documents of each type with different statuses.  You use the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM205000|SM205000]) Automation Steps (SM205000) form to 				create functional automation for the appropriate data entry form.  Once you selected the data entry form for automation, before you start to configure 				automation steps, think through all types of documents that can be created on the 				form and how different their workflows should be. Specify the conditions on which 				the particular actions should be performed, and set up the default values for the 				elements or the restrictions for the values of the elements (input mask or minimum 				and maximum values).  Defining Conditions for the Automation Step Automation steps are executed conditionally. On the  Conditions  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM205000|SM205000]) Automation Steps form, specify the conditions for applying the 				automation step. You can specify one condition or multiple conditions joined by 				logical operators ( OR  or  AND ). If a form can be used to create 				documents of multiple types, conditions can be used to select documents of a 				particular type and with a particular status.  If you select a lookup element for a condition, you can select any value from the list to be 				used in the condition. For example, if you set up a condition for the documents with 				the  Balanced  status, select  Status  as the  Field Name , 					 Equal  as the  Condition , and  Balanced  as the  Value .  If you select an input element in a condition, manually enter the value.  Redefining Actions for the Step Once conditions are specified, on the  Actions  tab, select the actions to be performed 				for the documents matching the specified conditions. You can reload all the actions 				available for the form and redefine some of them for the step.  For each action available on the target form, you can select one of the following options:  Disable it on the form once conditions are met Run it automatically Hide the action from the toolbar Use the action in its default meaning Convert it to a menu with menu options (reports or inquiries) added by using the  Fill 						with Values  dialog box Run the action in batch mode for all matching documents To convert an action on the toolbar to a menu, you need to add options to this menu by using 				the  Fill With Values  dialog box. You can add, for example, a report to the 					 Reports  menu or an inquiry to the  Inquiries  menu. To add a report, 				an inquiry, or another action, perform the following actions:  In the  Field Name  box, type  @reportID , or 						 @inquiryID , or  @ActionName . In the  Value  box, type the ID of the report (for example, 						 SO641010 ), inquiry (for example, 						 ViewActivities ), or action (for example, 						 AddTask ). To save the changes and close the dialog box, click  Close .  You can also update the  Notification  action to attach multiple reports to one mailing. 				The attached reports may have different formats (for example, you can attach a PDF 				and an HTML report to the same email). To attach multiple reports to one mailing, do 				the following: On the  Actions  tab, open the  Fill with 						Values  dialog box for the  Notification  action. In the  @notification  line, in the  Value  column, specify the 					mailing IDs, separated by commas. The mailing will be sent according to the recipients of the first mailing in the line. The 				recipients of the other mailings will be discarded. Also, for the automation step, you can specify what should happen on failure of the redefined 				action or on its success. To do this, click  Flow  on the Details toolbar and 				specify what actions from this automation step or other automation steps should be 				performed on failure or success of the step.  Redefining Fields for the Step On the  Fields  tab, you can specify how some of the fields should be redefined 				when the conditions are met. You can select a field and do one of the following:  Set a minimum value, a maximum value, or both Redefine a field as a combo box Assign a default value Set up an input mask to ensure that the correct data will be entered or the 					correct format will be used Disable the field Hide the field By using the  Combo Box Values  action, which opens the dialog box of the same name, you 				can add new values to the existing list of combo box values or create a new list for 				an input field redefined as a combo box. Only user-defined values can be removed 				from a the combo box list.   ([~/?ScreenId=SM205000|SM205000])  ([~/?ScreenId=SM205010|SM205010])  ([~/?ScreenId=SM205020|SM205020]) ]]></column>

In Acumatica ERP, you can define attributes for flexible, meaningful classification of leads, opportunities, customers, and inventory items in your company. An attribute is a property (such as age or industry) that enables you to specify additional information for objects in the system. For some entities, attributes are defined in the context of a class, which is a grouping of the business accounts (including leads, opportunities, customers, and cases), projects, and stock and non-stock items by one or more of their properties. For other entities, attributes can be added directly to a corresponding data entry form.{br}

For each class, you can define a list of attributes to gather class-specific information about members of the class; for example, attributes may carry the information about product brand, manufacturer, lead age, gender, or industry. You can use attributes for entities related to the following functionality:[anchor|#_6d3e1e28-4f7c-4d94-9e3a-afdd7d7ec5e3]
*'''Customer Management''': Attributes enable you to define additional elements to store information about individual leads, contacts, cases, opportunities, business accounts, and marketing campaigns. For more details, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CR__con_Classification_of_Business_Accounts|Classes and Attributes in CRM].
*'''Inventory''': Attributes store additional properties of stock and non-stock items. You define a list of attributes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form for each class, and then you fill in attribute values for individual inventory items on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) forms.
*'''Projects''': You use attributes to define additional elements to gather and store information about projects, tasks, equipment, and account groups.
*'''Organization''': You can use attributes for additional classification of employees. You define a list of attributes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_20_00|Employee Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=EP202000|EP202000]) form and then fill in attribute values for each particular employee on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form.
*'''Accounts Payable''': Attributes may be used for storing additional information about vendors. You define a list of attributes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_10_00|Vendor Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AP201000|AP201000]) form and then fill in attribute values for a vendor on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form.
*'''Accounts Receivable''': Attributes store additional properties of contracts and information about customers. You define a list of attributes for customers on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_10_00|Customer Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR201000|AR201000]) form and then fill in attribute values for particular customers on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form. For contracts, you use [HelpRoot_FormReference\CT_20_20_00|Contract Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=CT202000|CT202000]) to define the list of attributes and then use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CT_30_10_00|Customer Contracts] ([~/?ScreenId=CT301000|CT301000]) form to fill in attribute values for each individual contract.
*'''Service Management''': Attributes store additional properties of service orders and appointments. You define a list of attributes for service orders and appointments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_23_00|Service Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) form and then fill in attribute values on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_51_00|Service Contract Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=FS305100|FS305100]), and [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_56_00|Route Service Contract Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=FS305600|FS305600]) form. 
*'''Equipment Management''': Attributes store additional properties of equipment and service contracts. You define a list of attributes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_08_00|Equipment Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS200800|FS200800]) form for each equipment type and on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_20_00|Project Attributes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM202000|PM202000]) form for contracts. You then fill in attribute values for equipment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_50_00|Equipment] ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) form. For service contracts, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_57_00|Service Contracts] ([~/?ScreenId=FS305700|FS305700]) form to fill in attribute values.
*'''Route Management''': You can use attributes to store additional properties of vehicles, route executions, and route service contracts. You define a list of attributes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_42_00|Vehicle Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS204200|FS204200]) form for each vehicle type, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_37_00|Routes] ([~/?ScreenId=FS203700|FS203700]) form for each route, and on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_20_00|Project Attributes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM202000|PM202000]) form for route service contracts. You then fill in attribute values for vehicles on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_36_00|Vehicles] ([~/?ScreenId=FS203600|FS203600]) form. For route executions, you fill in attribute values on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_40_00|Route Document Details] ([~/?ScreenId=FS304000|FS304000]) form. For route service contracts, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_08_00|Route Service Contracts] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300800|FS300800]) form to fill in attribute values.

Attributes assigned to an entity are displayed on the '''Attributes''' tab of a corresponding data entry form. Also, attributes can be added as boxes to an additional tab (the '''User-Defined Fields''' tab) of a data entry form. {br}{TOC}
==Attributes in Classes==
A class contains a set of attributes that must be available in any instance of the class. For example, any lead of a given class must contain all the attributes defined for the lead class.{br}

The sets of attributes for specific classes is defined on the following forms: [anchor|#_76cbb740-364b-42a5-ac9a-009071b3d5d0]
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_70_00|Lead Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR207000|CR207000])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_50_00|Contact Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR205000|CR205000])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_90_00|Opportunity Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR209000|CR209000])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_60_00|Case Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR206000|CR206000])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_80_00|Business Account Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR208000|CR208000])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_25_00|Campaign Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR202500|CR202500])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_20_00|Project Attributes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM202000|PM202000])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_20_00|Employee Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=EP202000|EP202000])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_10_00|Vendor Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AP201000|AP201000])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_10_00|Customer Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR201000|AR201000])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CT_20_20_00|Contract Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=CT202000|CT202000])

For each attribute in a given class, you can specify whether the attribute is required. When creating an instance of the class, you must define the values for all the required attributes.{br}

You specify the attributes for a class by selecting the attributes from the attributes available in the system. If you need an attribute that is not available in the system, you can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_50_00|Attributes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) form to create the attribute, as well as any other attributes you may need. Then you will be able to select the new attribute in any class.{br}

You can deactivate an obsolete attribute for a particular entity class by clearing the '''Active''' check box for this attribute on the entity class form. In this case, the deactivated attribute will no longer be displayed for records of the class, but all attribute values that have already been specified for existing records still will be stored in the database. If you re-activates the attribute, its values will become visible in the system again. However, if it is not necessary to preserve the data related to an obsolete attribute, you can deactivate the attribute and then delete it by using the Delete Row button on the table toolbar. In this case, the attribute will be permanently deleted from the class and all attribute values will be cleared for the records of the class.
==Import of Records with Attributes==
When a record with attributes is being imported to the system through an import scenario, an error may occur if the target class of the record does not include any of the attributes specified for the record. If this is the case, you may need to verify whether the attribute is correctly specified in the source record or consider adding the attribute to the target class.
==Attribute Types==
For each attribute created by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_50_00|Attributes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) form, you need to specify its type, which can be one of the following: [anchor|#_0cabb526-3ef6-4316-83de-61466eeb3dc1]
*''Text'': A text box into which the user can type text
*''Combo'': A list box users can use to type or select options
*''Multi Select Combo'': A list box where users can select multiple options
*''Checkbox'': A check box users can select or clear
*''Datetime'': An element for selecting date and time

For a ''Text'' attribute, you can specify an input validation rule based on an input mask or a regular expression. Input validation ensures that the entered data is valid and usable. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Examples_Mask_and_RegExp_Usage|Examples of Masks and Regular Expressions Usage ].{br}

For a ''Combo'' and ''Multi Select Combo'' attribute, you can create a list of possible values, so that the user can select (respectively) one value or multiple values from the drop-down list. You can also specify the order of the values listed.

For route 					executions, you fill in attribute values on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS304000|FS304000]) Route Document Details 					(FS304000) form. For route service contracts, you use the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300800|FS300800]) Route Service Contracts (FS300800) form to fill in attribute values. Attributes assigned to an entity are displayed on the 					 Attributes  tab of a corresponding data entry form. Also, 				attributes can be added as boxes to an additional tab (the  User-Defined 					Fields  tab) of a data entry form.  Attributes in Classes A class contains a set of attributes that must be available in any instance of the 				class. For example, any lead of a given class must contain all the attributes 				defined for the lead class. The sets of attributes for specific classes is defined on the following forms:   ([~/?ScreenId=CR207000|CR207000]) Lead Classes (CR207000)  ([~/?ScreenId=CR205000|CR205000]) Contact Classes (CR205000)  ([~/?ScreenId=CR209000|CR209000]) Opportunity Classes (CR209000)  ([~/?ScreenId=CR206000|CR206000]) Case Classes (CR206000)  ([~/?ScreenId=CR208000|CR208000]) Business Account Classes (CR208000)  ([~/?ScreenId=CR202500|CR202500]) Campaign Classes (CR202500)  ([~/?ScreenId=PM202000|PM202000]) Project Attributes (PM202000)  ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000)  ([~/?ScreenId=EP202000|EP202000]) Employee Classes (EP202000)  ([~/?ScreenId=AP201000|AP201000]) Vendor Classes (AP201000)  ([~/?ScreenId=AR201000|AR201000]) Customer Classes (AR201000)  ([~/?ScreenId=CT202000|CT202000]) Contract Templates (CT202000) For each attribute in a given class, you can specify whether the attribute is 				required. When creating an instance of the class, you must define the values for all 				the required attributes. You specify the attributes for a class by selecting the attributes from the 				attributes available in the system. If you need an attribute that is not available 				in the system, you can use the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) Attributes 				(CS205000) form to create the attribute, as well as any other attributes you may 				need. Then you will be able to select the new attribute in any class. You can deactivate an obsolete attribute for a particular entity class by clearing 				the  Active  check box for this attribute on the entity class form. In this 				case, the deactivated attribute will no longer be displayed for records of the 				class, but all attribute values that have already been specified for existing 				records still will be stored in the database. If you re-activates the attribute, its 				values will become visible in the system again. However, if it is not necessary to 				preserve the data related to an obsolete attribute, you can deactivate the attribute 				and then delete it by using the Delete Row button on the table toolbar. In this 				case, the attribute will be permanently deleted from the class and all attribute 				values will be cleared for the records of the class. Import of Records with Attributes When a record with attributes is being imported to the system through an import 				scenario, an error may occur if the target class of the record does not include any 				of the attributes specified for the record. If this is the case, you may need to 				verify whether the attribute is correctly specified in the source record or consider 				adding the attribute to the target class. Attribute Types For each attribute created by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) Attributes 				(CS205000) form, you need to specify its type, which can be one of the following:  Text : A text box into which the user can type text Combo : A list box users can use to type or select options Multi Select Combo : A list box where users can select multiple 					options Checkbox : A check box users can select or clear Datetime : An element for selecting date and time For a  Text  attribute, you can specify an input validation rule based on an 				input mask or a regular expression. Input validation ensures that the entered data 				is valid and usable. For details, see  Examples of Masks and Regular Expressions Usage . For a  Combo  and  Multi Select Combo  attribute, you can create a list of 				possible values, so that the user can select (respectively) one value or multiple 				values from the drop-down list. You can also specify the order of the values 				listed. ]]></column>

The functionality of attributes is not available for all entities. For some of these entities, your organization may want to add user-defined fields directly to their corresponding data entry forms. Also, attributes can be added as boxes to an additional tab (the '''User-Defined Fields''' tab) of a data entry form. {br}

 If you add user-defined fields, the original information of a record is displayed on the '''Document''' tab of the applicable form, and the added user-defined fields are displayed on the '''User-Defined Fields''' tab. {br}{TOC}
==User-Defined Fields==
You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_50_00|Attributes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) form to create new attributes that will serve as the user-defined fields, or you can use attributes already defined in the system. To add an attribute as a user-defined field to a data entry form, you need access to the '''Customization''' menu on the form toolbar; this access is provided by the ''Customizer'' user role. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\Admin_HOW_AddUserField|To Add User-Defined Fields to a Form].
==Forms That Support User-Defined Fields==

Also, the system reminds users about the event and notifies attendees if you make any changes to the event or cancel it.{br}{TOC}
==Event-Related Settings==
By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_40_70|Event Setup] ([~/?ScreenId=EP204070|EP204070]) form, you can configure automatic notifications about events to be held by your company employees. You can configure either simple (built-in) notifications or template-based notifications that allow users to send personalized emails. A template can include placeholders that are replaced by each addressee's personal data, such as the first and last names and position, when the system generates event notification emails.{br}

You can create the following templates: [anchor|#ul_u3r_jwy_w3]
*''Invitation template'': This template can be used to send personalized email invitations to the persons listed on the '''Attendees''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_30|Event] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306030|CR306030]) form. If the user adds new potential attendees to the list after sending initial invitations and saves the event, the system will prompt the user to send invitations to the added potential attendees.
*''Rescheduling template'': This template can be used if the event date or time has been changed. Emails based on the template are sent to all invited persons automatically once the event is shifted to a new start time.
*''Cancellation template'': This template is used if the invitation to the event is canceled for a particular potential attendee (for instance, if the event planner sent the invitation to this person in error) or for all potential attendees.

==Creation of New Events==
Users can view existing events by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_40_41_00|Events] ([~/?ScreenId=EP404100|EP404100]) form. Clicking the '''Add Event''' button on the table toolbar invokes the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_30|Event] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306030|CR306030]) form (as a pop-up window), which lets you create a new event. {br}

When creating an event, the user may configure a ''reminder'' for it, specifying the day and time when all invited attendees will be reminded about the event (by the '''Automatic Reminder''' dialog box popping up). 
==Event-Related Notification Emails==
If a user creating an event specifies potential attendees, notification emails will be sent at the following times to the specified parties: [anchor|#ul_rz2_zht_w3]
*When the event is being saved for the first time: To all potential attendees
*When new attendees are added: To only newly added attendees
*When the event is rescheduled: To all potential attendees
*When the event is canceled: To all potential attendees
*When the invitation is canceled: To the selected potential attendees

You use the business event functionality for monitoring business events that occur in the system as users perform business processes. Business events are particular actions, data changes, or conditions that require user attention in your company. By setting up business event monitoring, you ensure that these business events will not be missed without individual users needing to spend their time performing manual monitoring.{br}

The topics of this chapter explain how to configure the system to monitor a business process and perform a specified action.
==In This Chapter==
*[HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Using_Business_Events_GeneralInfo|Business Events: General Information]
*:In Acumatica ERP, various business processes are executed, which may require the monitoring of particular activities and conditions in the system. To eliminate the need for a user to monitor the business processes, you can configure the system to monitor the company data and to perform an action (such as sending an email notification or performing the instructions defined by an import scenario) or multiple actions in the system.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Using_Business_Events_GI_Source_Concept|Business Events: Generic Inquiry as Source]
*:You create a generic inquiry to retrieve data from the database fields that you want the system to monitor. Also, you could instead use an existing generic inquiry if one exists that retrieves the needed data.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Using_Business_Events_Data_Entry_Source_Concept|Business Events: Data-Entry Form as Source]
*:You can use a data-entry form as a source of data that you need to monitor. The created business events act as notifications for the events on the forms.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Using_Business_Events_Event_By_Data_Change|Business Events: Data Change Processing]
*:You can configure the system to perform actions when a change of the data related to a business process has occurred. In this topic, you can find information about the processing of the business events related to data changes.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Using_Business_Events_By_Schedule|Business Events: Scheduled Event Processing]
*:When a business event is configured and is active—that is, the '''Active''' check box is selected for it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_50|Business Events] ([~/?ScreenId=SM302050|SM302050]) form—and the next schedule execution date comes, the system executes the generic inquiry. If the generic inquiry returns any data, the system checks whether the returned records satisfy the conditions specified on the '''Trigger Conditions''' tab. If there are records that satisfy the conditions (which means that the business event has occurred), the system processes the subscribers of the event that are specified on the '''Subscribers''' tab.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Using_Business_Events_Emails_Concept|Business Events: Email Notifications]
*:If a subscriber to a business event is an email notification, when the business event occurs, the system sends an email (or multiple emails) to particular recipients, based on the settings of the notification template that you have specified for the business event.
*[HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Using_Business_Events_Push_Concept|Business Events: Push Notifications]
*:If a subscriber to a business event is a push notification, when the business event occurs, the system sends a push notification or multiple push notifications to the mobile devices of particular recipients, based on the settings of the notification template that you have specified for the business event.

To eliminate the need for a user to monitor the business processes, you can configure the system to monitor the company data and to perform an action (such as sending an email notification or performing the instructions defined by an import scenario) or multiple actions in the system. {br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Create business events to monitor data changes of selected set of database fields and notify involved parties about the changes
*Create business events to monitor events on a particular data-entry form and notify involved parties about the events
*Configure the system to monitor fulfillment of a set of conditions on schedule and perform specified actions

==Applicable Scenarios==
You use business events in the following cases:[anchor|#_7165d0ed-fbf9-4bca-b563-a0155c7a9310]
*You need to monitor specific data being changed in the system and make the system to perform some actions based on the change. For example, in contract management, you can configure the system to send an email notification to the customer when the customer&rsquo;s contract is activated. 
*You need to monitor the meeting of particular conditions, which the system checks for at the schedule you specify and make the system to perform some actions in this case. For example, in the management of opportunities, you can configure the system to send an email to the owner of an opportunity when it is one month from its estimated close date and the opportunity hasn&rsquo;t been updated for more than seven days. The system performs this monitoring once a day.
*You need to help your employees and selected external contacts to track key developments that occur within the organization. Some examples include the following: 
**A sales manager may want the system to notify a customer contact when a sales order has been shipped to the customer.
**Your company might want to tell customers about changes in their blanket purchase orders.
**A manager may want to know when a specific purchase order has received all the required approvals.
**A credit manager may want to know when a sales order is created for a particular customer that is approaching its credit limit.
**A customer service manager may want to be informed when a new employee is assigned a case of a specific type, to give the employee assistance with this type of case.

==Types of Business Events==[anchor|#_779e6a00-5bff-46aa-af3a-d7fc15f65705]
To configure the system to monitor a business process, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_50|Business Events] ([~/?ScreenId=SM302050|SM302050]) form, you define a ''business event'' that relates to this business process and that causes the system to perform an action or multiple actions in the system. {br}

The business event can be one of the following:[anchor|#_a23c3105-3cb8-4120-be64-00620fe5c2ef]
*Data change: You create a business event of the ''Trigger by Record Change'' type.
*Occurrence of a particular event (fulfillment of a set of conditions), which the system checks for at the schedule: You create a business event of the ''Trigger by Schedule'' type.

Then for each business event you specify a source for monitoring, conditions to trigger actions, and actions (event subscribers) to be performed when conditions are met. If you want the system to monitor a business process at schedule, you additionally specify a schedule for the event.
==Source for Monitoring==
The system needs a source to monitor data changes or the occurrence of particular events. The source defines a set of database fields whose values are to be monitored. The system triggers the event processing, if a value changes or a set of values met specified conditions.{br}

In Acumatica ERP you can use the following sources to retrieve the data you want to monitor:[anchor|#_7bab1d57-2b23-4784-a711-20bde46970e8]
*Generic inquiry: You create a generic inquiry to retrieve data from the database fields that you want the system to monitor. Also, you could instead use an existing generic inquiry if one exists that retrieves the needed data. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Using_Business_Events_GI_Source_Concept|Business Events: Generic Inquiry as Source].
*:((({S:Warn}You can use a generic inquiry as a data source for all available types of business events and subscribers.
)))
*Data-entry form: You can use a data-entry form as a source of data that you need to monitor, for example, [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]), and [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]). The created business events act as notifications for the events on the forms. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Using_Business_Events_Data_Entry_Source_Concept|Business Events: Data-Entry Form as Source].
*:((({S:Warn}[anchor|#_6a5cefa3-421f-422c-910a-62c380663554]You can use a data-entry form as a source for business events of the ''Trigger by Record Change'' type only. Also, using an import scenario as a subscriber is not available if such source is selected. 
)))

You start creation of a business event with specifying a generic inquiry or a data-entry form that defines the data for the system to monitor, in the '''Screen Name''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_50|Business Events] ([~/?ScreenId=SM302050|SM302050]) form. For a generic inquiry, you can also select an advanced filter (if one has been defined for the it). For details on advanced filters, see [HelpRoot_ReportingTools\GI_Reusable_Filters_Mapref|Managing Advanced Filters].
==Conditions to Trigger Actions==
After you have specified a data source for the event, you configure the conditions when the system should perform actions related to the business process, on the '''Trigger Conditions''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_50|Business Events] form. You can configure the conditions that are applied to any of the following: [anchor|#_b28880ac-077b-495e-8dfc-563493797c77]
*The results of the monitoring before the data change (the old field values).
*The results of the monitoring after the data has been changed (the new field values).
*The comparison of these results. That is, the condition can check whether a field value has been changed, or a record has been added, removed, or updated.

The action is performed if the values of monitored fields have been changed according to the specified conditions.{br}

In the '''Raise Event''' box of the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_50|Business Events] form, you can also select how the system should generate the business event: for each record that satisfies the trigger conditions or for the whole set of records that satisfy the trigger conditions.
==Actions to Perform on Event Occurrence (Event Subscribers)==
To define the actions that the system should perform in the system once the business event has occurred, you specify the ''subscribers'' of this business event, on the '''Subscribers''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_50|Business Events] form. A subscriber of a business event is an entity in the system that the system processes when the business event occurs. The following types of subscribers are supported.[anchor|#_e24f6f46-0346-4880-8a8e-d4e19bf94862]
*''Import Scenario'': If the subscriber is an import scenario, the system executes the sequence of instructions defined by the import scenario that you have specified for the business event. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Using_Business_Events_Import_Scenarios_Concept|Business Events: Import Scenarios].
*:((({S:Warn}The ''Import Scenario'' type is not available for a business event if a data-entry form is selected as a source for monitoring. 
)))
*''Email Notification''
* ''Mobile Push Notifications''
* ''Mobile SMS Notifications''
*:If the subscriber is an email, a push notification or an SMS notification, the system sends the needed emails, push or SMS notifications based on the settings of the notification template that you have specified for the business event. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Using_Business_Events_Emails_Concept|Business Events: Email Notifications], [HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Using_Business_Events_Push_Concept|Business Events: Push Notifications] and [HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Using_Business_Events_SMS_Concept|Business Events: SMS Notifications].

You can configure a subscriber before you create a business event, then you select a subscriber that has been configured; if needed, you can select multiple subscribers (one in each row). {br}

To create a new subscriber, you click '''Create Subscriber''' and click the menu command corresponding to the type of the subscriber, which causes the system to open a corresponding Acumatica ERP form (for an email, push or SMS notification to a mobile device) or the dialog box and form (for an import scenario script) to create the subscriber.{br}

If you have specified multiple subscribers on the '''Subscribers''' tab for the business event, you can select the '''Stop on Error''' check box in the row of a subscriber to direct the system to process subsequent subscribers in the list only if no error has occurred while the system was processing the current subscriber. 
==Schedules to Monitor Business Process==
To dictate when the system should check whether the data meets the specified conditions, you configure a schedule or schedules. You can monitor a business process on schedule only if a generic inquiry is selected as data source in the '''Screen ID''' box of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_50|Business Events] form.{br}

On the '''Schedules''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_50|Business Events] form, you select a schedule that has been configured; if needed, you can select multiple schedules (one in each row).{br}

If the needed schedule has not been configured beforehand, you click '''Create Schedule''', which causes the system to open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_20|Automation Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=SM205020|SM205020]) form. On this form, you configure the schedule by which the system should check the conditions on the data for monitoring. {br}

A customer service manager may want to be informed when a new employee is assigned a case        of a specific type, to give the employee assistance with this type of case. Types of Business Events To configure the system to monitor a business     process, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM302050|SM302050]) Business Events (SM302050) form, you define a       business event  that relates to this business process and that causes the system to     perform an action or multiple actions in the system.  The business event can be one of the following: Data change: You create a business event of the  Trigger by Record Change  type. Occurrence of a particular event (fulfillment of a set of conditions), which the system      checks for at the schedule: You create a business event of the  Trigger by Schedule       type. Then for each business event you specify a source for monitoring, conditions to trigger     actions, and actions (event subscribers) to be performed when conditions are met. If you want     the system to monitor a business process at schedule, you additionally specify a schedule for     the event. Source for Monitoring The system needs a source to monitor data changes or the occurrence of particular events. The     source defines a set of database fields whose values are to be monitored. The system triggers     the event processing, if a value changes or a set of values met specified conditions. In  Acumatica ERP     you can use the following sources to retrieve the data you want to monitor: Generic inquiry: You create a generic inquiry to retrieve data from the database fields that      you want the system to monitor. Also, you could instead use an existing generic inquiry if one      exists that retrieves the needed data. For details, see  Business Events: Generic Inquiry as Source. You can use a       generic inquiry as a data source for all available types of business events and       subscribers. Data-entry form: You can use a data-entry form as a source of data that you need to monitor,      for example,   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000),   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000), and   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000). The created business events act as      notifications for the events on the forms. For details, see  Business Events: Data-Entry Form as Source. You can use a data-entry form as a source for business events of the  Trigger by Record Change  type only. Also, using an import scenario as a subscriber is not available if such source is selected.  You start creation of a business event with specifying a generic inquiry or a data-entry form     that defines the data for the system to monitor, in the  Screen Name  box     on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM302050|SM302050]) Business Events (SM302050) form. For a generic inquiry, you     can also select an advanced filter (if one has been defined for the it). For details on advanced     filters, see  Managing Advanced Filters. Conditions to Trigger Actions After you have specified a data source for the event, you configure the conditions when the     system should perform actions related to the business process, on the  Trigger      Conditions  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM302050|SM302050]) Business Events form. You can configure the     conditions that are applied to any of the following:  The results of the monitoring before the data change (the old field values). The results of the monitoring after the data has been changed (the new field values). The comparison of these results. That is, the condition can check whether a field value has      been changed, or a record has been added, removed, or updated. The action is performed if the values of monitored fields have been changed according to the     specified conditions. In the  Raise Event  box of the Summary area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM302050|SM302050]) Business Events form, you can also select how the system should generate     the business event: for each record that satisfies the trigger conditions or for the whole set     of records that satisfy the trigger conditions. Actions to Perform on Event Occurrence (Event Subscribers) To define the actions that the system should perform in the system once the business event has     occurred, you specify the  subscribers  of this business event, on the       Subscribers  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM302050|SM302050]) Business Events     form. A subscriber of a business event is an entity in the system that the system processes when     the business event occurs. The following types of subscribers are supported. Import Scenario : If the subscriber is an import scenario, the system executes the      sequence of instructions defined by the import scenario that you have specified for the      business event. For more information, see  Business Events: Import Scenarios. The         Import Scenario  type is not available for a business event if a data-entry form is       selected as a source for monitoring.  Email Notification Mobile Push Notifications Mobile SMS Notifications If the subscriber is an email, a push notification or an       SMS notification, the system sends the needed emails, push or SMS notifications based on the       settings of the notification template that you have specified for the business event. For more       information, see  Business Events: Email Notifications,  Business Events: Push Notifications and  Business Events: SMS Notifications. You can configure a subscriber before you create a business event, then you select a     subscriber that has been configured; if needed, you can select multiple subscribers (one in each     row).  To create a new subscriber, you click  Create Subscriber  and click the     menu command corresponding to the type of the subscriber, which causes the system to open a     corresponding  Acumatica ERP     form (for an email, push or SMS notification to a mobile device) or the dialog box and form (for     an import scenario script) to create the subscriber. If you have specified multiple subscribers on the  Subscribers  tab for     the business event, you can select the  Stop on Error  check box in the row     of a subscriber to direct the system to process subsequent subscribers in the list only if no     error has occurred while the system was processing the current subscriber.  Schedules to Monitor Business Process To dictate when the system should check whether the data meets the specified conditions, you     configure a schedule or schedules. You can monitor a business process on schedule only if a     generic inquiry is selected as data source in the  Screen ID  box of the        ([~/?ScreenId=SM302050|SM302050]) Business Events form. On the  Schedules  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM302050|SM302050]) Business Events form, you     select a schedule that has been configured; if needed, you can select multiple schedules (one in     each row). If the needed schedule has not been configured beforehand, you click  Create      Schedule , which causes the system to open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM205020|SM205020]) Automation Schedules     (SM205020) form. On this form, you configure the schedule by which the system should check the     conditions on the data for monitoring.  For details on configuring schedules, see  Managing Schedules. ]]></column>

You create a generic inquiry to retrieve data from the database fields that you want the system to monitor. Also, you could instead use an existing generic inquiry if one exists that retrieves the needed data. {br}

In this topic, you will read about recommendations and limitations on using a generic inquiry as a source for monitoring.{br}{TOC}
==General Recommendations==
A generic inquiry to be used as basis for monitoring a business process should be as simple as possible. We recommend that you check whether only the needed fields and tables are used in the generic inquiry you have decided to use. If the already-existing inquiry uses any fields and tables that are unnecessary for your specific business event, you should instead create a new inquiry and use it.{br}

Business events do not support generic inquiries that have grouping specified on the '''Grouping''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_80_00|Generic Inquiry] ([~/?ScreenId=SM208000|SM208000]) form. Thus, we recommend that you avoid unnecessary multiple joins and joins to the same tables. In most cases, you can exclude from the generic inquiry all the tables that are not used on the '''Results Grid''' tab of the corresponding generic inquiry.((({S:Warn}You must add all key fields of used tables to the '''Results Grid''' tab of the corresponding generic inquiry. You can make them hidden, if you do not need to view them on the inquiry form. For details on discovering key fields, see [HelpRoot_ReportingTools\GI_Manual_Configuration_of_Relations_Concept|Getting Data from Multiple DACs: Manual Configuration of Relations Between Tables].
)))
For details on working with generic inquiries, see [HelpRoot_ReportingTools\SM__MNG_Managing_Generic_Inquiry|Managing Generic Inquiries].
==Recommendations for Push Notifications==
If you plan to send push notifications to users of the Acumatica mobile app on mobile devices, make sure that the generic inquiry you have selected includes the <tt>NoteID</tt> data field for the entity that you plan to display when a user taps a notification on the mobile device. {br}

For example, suppose that you want to notify employees about new opportunities assigned to them, and when an employee taps this notification, the app should display the new opportunity. In this case, you should add the <tt>NoteID</tt> data field for the object <tt>CROpportunity</tt> on the '''Results Grid''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_80_00|Generic Inquiry] ([~/?ScreenId=SM208000|SM208000]) form. ]]></column>

If a subscriber to a business event is an email notification, when the business event occurs, the system sends an email (or multiple emails) to particular recipients, based on the settings of the notification template that you have specified for the business event.{br}

In this topic, you will read about creating a notification template to be used as a subscriber of a business event.{br}{TOC}
==Creating an Email Notification Subscriber==
The easiest way to create an email notification for a business event is to do so while you are creating the event on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_50|Business Events] ([~/?ScreenId=SM302050|SM302050]) form: On the table toolbar of the '''Subscribers''' tab, you click '''Create Subscriber''' > '''Email Notification'''. This causes the system to open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_03|Notification Templates] form with the correct value selected in the '''Screen Name''' box{br}

Also, you can open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_03|Notification Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=SM204003|SM204003]) form and configure a notification template that can be selected as a subscriber of the ''Email Notification'' type. On this form, you must specify the sender, the recipients of the notification emails, and the template for the email message. Also, in the '''Screen Name''' box, you specify the generic inquiry or data-entry form of the business event. 
==Using Placeholders for Email Notification Template==
In the notification template you define on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_03|Notification Templates] form, you can use placeholders for the values of the data fields, provided by a form or a generic inquiry in the '''Screen Name''' box of the form. If values are available in a record created with a data-entry form or in the results of the generic inquiry, the system retrieves these values and uses them to compose an email for sending.{br}

You can use placeholders to define the following settings:[anchor|#_f47f9a31-3a36-48b0-a1f0-656790342b1d]
*Recipients of the email in the '''To''', '''CC''', and '''BCC''' boxes
*The subject of the notification template in the '''Subject''' box
*The body of the notification template on the '''Message''' tab

For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\EM__con_Notification_Templates|Notification Templates].
==Attaching an Email as Activity==[anchor|#_7f4138a8-f9af-41e9-a74a-8ff66f47564a]
For a notification template that is used as a subscriber of a business event, you can specify whether the system should link a sent email as activity of the ''Email'' type to an entity defined in the system. For example, a customer, a vendor, a contact or a document.{br}

To attach a sent email as activity to an account or a contact, you specify the data fields that contain a business account ID (<tt>BAccountID</tt>) or a contact ID (<tt>ContactID</tt>) in the '''Link to Account''' or '''Link to Contact''' boxes, respectively. The system creates an activity of the ''Email'' type and links this activity to the specified business account or contact. {br}

To attach a sent email as activity to a system entity you use one of the following setting:[anchor|#_877bcb68-c9ac-4580-9c48-ac9332a26a7e]
*'''Attach Activity''': You select this check box to direct the system to link a sent email as activity of the ''Email'' type to an entity that was created using a data-entry form specified in the '''Screen Name''' box. 
*:For example, if the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form is specified in the '''Screen Name''' box and the notification template is used as subscriber of a business event configured to monitor data changes for this form, the system links the activity to a sales order that triggered the event.
*'''Link to Entity''': You specify in this box a data field for a unique identifier of an entity (<tt>NoteID</tt>) to direct the system to link a sent email as activity of the ''Email'' type to an entity that is in the results of a generic inquiry specified in the '''Screen Name''' box.

You can then view the activity on the '''Activities''' tab of the corresponding form or in the '''Tasks & Activities''' dialog box, which opens if you click '''Activities''' on the form title bar.

==Attaching a Report to Email Notification==
For notification templates that used as subscribers of business events, you can select a report or multiple reports to attach to the email on the '''Attached Reports''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_03|Notification Templates] form. On the tab, you can specify the report format and parameters. If the parameter values are not specified, the default value of parameters will be used when the report is generated.{br}

On the right pane, in the '''Reports Attached by Report ID''' table, in the '''Report ID''' box, you can select the report to be attached. In the '''Report Format''' box, you can select the format of the attached report: ''Excel'', ''HTML'', or ''PDF''. Selecting the ''HTML'' format makes the '''Embedded''' check box available. When this box is selected, the report will be inserted in the email body.{br}

On the right pane, in the '''Report Parameters''' table, for each added report you specify parameters to be passed to the report at the moment of the report generation process.{br}

Alternatively for an added report, you can select the '''Use Event as Data Source''' box on the left pane, the system can pass the business event data to the report, rather than selecting data from the database at the moment of the report generation process. The '''Use Event as Data Source''' check box is available and can be selected only if there are common tables in generic inquiry (specified in the '''Screen Name''' box) and in the report. If the check box is selected the '''Source Table''' box becomes available and contains the source tables for selection.{br}

Additionally, you can select a report to be attached in the '''Attach Report Opened by Action''' box. The system uses the list of reports available under the '''Reports''' action on the form toolbar of the data-entry from specified in the '''Screen Name''' of the form.
==Processing an Email Notification Subscriber==
When the business event occurs and the system processes the subscriber of the ''Email Notification'' type, the system extracts the values of the fields specified for placeholders of the template (from the results of the generic inquiry that satisfy the conditions) and inserts these values into the email. The system then sends the email or emails to the recipients.{br}

If the notification has been sent successfully, the system considers the subscriber to be successfully processed and adds a record on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_50_20_30|Business Event History] ([~/?ScreenId=SM502030|SM502030]) form. If any error has occurred during the processing of the notification template, the system displays the error on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_50_20_30|Business Event History] form for the business event.]]></column>
			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Business Events: Email Notifications If a subscriber to a business event is an email notification, when the business event         occurs, the system sends an email (or multiple emails) to particular recipients, based on         the settings of the notification template that you have specified for the business         event. In this topic, you will read about creating a notification template to be used as a         subscriber of a business event. Creating an Email Notification Subscriber The easiest way to create an email notification for a business event is to do so while you         are creating the event on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM302050|SM302050]) Business Events (SM302050) form: On the table         toolbar of the  Subscribers  tab, you click  Create Subscriber Email Notification . This causes the system to open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM204003|SM204003]) Notification Templates form with the correct value selected in the            Screen Name  box Also, you can open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM204003|SM204003]) Notification Templates (SM204003) form and         configure a notification template that can be selected as a subscriber of the  Email           Notification  type. On this form, you must specify the sender, the recipients of the         notification emails, and the template for the email message. Also, in the  Screen           Name  box, you specify the generic inquiry or data-entry form of the business         event.  Using Placeholders for Email Notification Template In the notification template you define on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM204003|SM204003]) Notification Templates         form, you can use placeholders for the values of the data fields, provided by a form or a         generic inquiry in the  Screen Name  box of the form. If values are         available in a record created with a data-entry form or in the results of the generic         inquiry, the system retrieves these values and uses them to compose an email for         sending. You can use placeholders to define the following settings: Recipients of the email in the  To ,  CC , and              BCC  boxes The subject of the notification template in the  Subject  box The body of the notification template on the  Message  tab For details, see  Notification Templates. Attaching an Email as Activity For a notification template that is used as a         subscriber of a business event, you can specify whether the system should link a sent email         as activity of the  Email  type to an entity defined in the system. For example, a         customer, a vendor, a contact or a document. To attach a sent email as activity to an account or a contact, you specify the data fields         that contain a business account ID ( BAccountID ) or a contact ID           ( ContactID ) in the  Link to Account  or            Link to Contact  boxes, respectively. The system creates an activity         of the  Email  type and links this activity to the specified business account or         contact.  To attach a sent email as activity to a system entity you use one of the following         setting: Attach Activity : You select this check box to direct the system           to link a sent email as activity of the  Email  type to an entity that was created           using a data-entry form specified in the  Screen Name  box.  For example, if the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form is specified in the  Screen Name  box and the notification template is used as subscriber of a business event configured to monitor data changes for this form, the system links the activity to a sales order that triggered the event. Link to Entity : You specify in this box a data field for a unique           identifier of an entity ( NoteID ) to direct the system to link a sent           email as activity of the  Email  type to an entity that is in the results of a           generic inquiry specified in the  Screen Name  box. You can then view the activity on the  Activities  tab of the         corresponding form or in the  Tasks & Activities  dialog box, which         opens if you click  Activities  on the form title bar. For details         about activities, see  Managing Emails and Activities: General Information. Attaching a Report to Email Notification For notification templates that used as subscribers of business events, you can select a         report or multiple reports to attach to the email on the  Attached           Reports  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM204003|SM204003]) Notification Templates form. On the         tab, you can specify the report format and parameters. If the parameter values are not         specified, the default value of parameters will be used when the report is generated. On the right pane, in the  Reports Attached by Report ID  table, in         the  Report ID  box, you can select the report to be attached. In the            Report Format  box, you can select the format of the attached         report:  Excel ,  HTML , or  PDF . Selecting the  HTML  format makes the            Embedded  check box available. When this box is selected, the report         will be inserted in the email body. On the right pane, in the  Report Parameters  table, for each added         report you specify parameters to be passed to the report at the moment of the report         generation process. Alternatively for an added report, you can select the  Use Event as Data           Source  box on the left pane, the system can pass the business event data to         the report, rather than selecting data from the database at the moment of the report         generation process. The  Use Event as Data Source  check box is         available and can be selected only if there are common tables in generic inquiry (specified         in the  Screen Name  box) and in the report. If the check box is         selected the  Source Table  box becomes available and contains the         source tables for selection. Additionally, you can select a report to be attached in the  Attach Report Opened           by Action  box. The system uses the list of reports available under the            Reports  action on the form toolbar of the data-entry from specified         in the  Screen Name  of the form. Processing an Email Notification Subscriber When the business event occurs and the system processes the subscriber of the  Email           Notification  type, the system extracts the values of the fields specified for         placeholders of the template (from the results of the generic inquiry that satisfy the         conditions) and inserts these values into the email. The system then sends the email or         emails to the recipients. If the notification has been sent successfully, the system considers the subscriber to be         successfully processed and adds a record on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM502030|SM502030]) Business Event History (SM502030)         form. If any error has occurred during the processing of the notification template, the         system displays the error on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM502030|SM502030]) Business Event History form for the business         event. ]]></column>

If a subscriber to a business event is a push notification, when the business event occurs, the system sends a push notification or multiple push notifications to the mobile devices of particular recipients, based on the settings of the notification template that you have specified for the business event.{br}

In this topic you will read about configuring and processing of push notifications created as subscribers of business events.
==Configuring Push Notification as Subscriber==
The easiest way to create a push notification for a business event is to do so while you are creating the event on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_50|Business Events] ([~/?ScreenId=SM302050|SM302050]) form: On the table toolbar of the '''Subscribers''' tab, you click '''Create Subscriber''' > '''Mobile Push Notification'''. This causes the system to open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_04|Mobile Notifications] form with the ''Push'' option selected in the '''Delivery Method''' box and the correct value selected in the '''Screen''' box.{br}

Also, you can open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_04|Mobile Notifications] ([~/?ScreenId=SM204004|SM204004]) form and configure a notification template that can be selected as a subscriber of the ''Mobile Push Notification'' type. On this form, you must specify the push delivery method, the description, the recipients of the notifications, and the template for the message. Also, in the '''Screen''' box, you specify the generic inquiry of the business event. {br}

In the notification template you define on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_04|Mobile Notifications] form, you can use placeholders for the values of the form elements. As the placeholders, you can use the data fields available in the results of the generic inquiry of the business event as follows:[anchor|#_9bff3da5-d8a6-4ff2-b526-bc8da8a248c7]
*To specify the recipients of the notification (in the '''To''' box), you can use the data fields (as the placeholders, separated with semicolons) that hold user identifiers and whose values are retrieved when the business event occurs. For example, if you need to monitor cases and send notifications to assignees, you can use a placeholder for the identifier of the assignee, such as {{((CRCase_ownerID!PKID))}}. 
*You use the needed fields to specify which entity should be opened by the mobile app after a user taps the notification (in the '''Destination Entity ID''' box). Make sure that the {{NoteID}} data field is present in the results of the generic inquiry for the entity. For example, suppose that you selected ''Sales Orders'' in '''Destination Screen ID''' and want to open a particular order for the user; then you need to select the {{NoteID}} data field for the {{SOOrder}} object in '''Destination Entity ID'''.
*To specify the subject ('''Title''') of the notification template, you can use any data fields whose values are retrieved when the business event occurs. For example, the subject could be {{Opportunity ((CROpportunity_opportunityID)) has been assigned to you}}. 
*In the body of the notification template (on the '''Message''' tab), you can click '''Insert Data Field''' on the formatting toolbar to insert as a placeholder any data field whose value is retrieved when the business event occurs. Also, you can click '''Insert Previous Data Field''' to insert as a placeholder any data field whose value was retrieved before the business event occurred. You can use this ability to demonstrate how the value of the data field has changed, for example, a case status has changed from ''New'' to ''Open''.

==Processing a Push Notification as Subscriber==
When the business event occurs and the system processes the subscriber of the ''Mobile Push Notification'' type, the system extracts the values of the fields specified for placeholders of the template (from the results of the generic inquiry that satisfy the conditions) and inserts these values into the notification. The system then sends the push notification or notifications to appropriate mobile devices of the recipients.{br}

If the notification has been sent successfully, the system considers the subscriber to be successfully processed and adds a record on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_50_20_30|Business Event History] ([~/?ScreenId=SM502030|SM502030]) form. If any error has occurred during the processing of the notification template, the system displays the error on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_50_20_30|Business Event History] form for the business event.]]></column>

In this topic you will read about configuring and processing of SMS notifications created as subscribers of business events.{br}{TOC}
==Configuring an SMS Notification as Subscriber==
The system uses an SMS service account configured on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_35|SMS Providers] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203535|SM203535]) form to send mobile text notifications. You can configure an account with the Amazon or Twilio service provider.{br}

The easiest way to create a text notification for a business event is to do so while you are creating the event on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_50|Business Events] ([~/?ScreenId=SM302050|SM302050]) form: On the table toolbar of the '''Subscribers''' tab, you click '''Create Subscriber''' > '''Mobile SMS Notification'''.

Also, you can specify phone numbers explicitly, separated with semicolons. 
*:For example, if you want to send a text about a shipment confirmation to a customer, you can use a placeholder for the identifier of the customer&rsquo;s phone number, such as {{((SOShipment_customerID!DefContactID!Phone1))}}.
*In the body of the notification template (on the '''Message''' tab), you can click '''Insert Data Field''' on the formatting toolbar to insert as a placeholder any data field whose value is retrieved when the business event occurs. Also, you can click '''Insert Previous Data Field''' to insert as a placeholder any data field whose value was retrieved before the business event occurred. 
*:For example, suppose that you would like to notify a customer that the status of the case has changed to another one. You insert the {{((CRCase_status))}} data field, which represents the placeholder of the case status and whose value will be retrieved when the business event occurs. To show the previous status of the case, you click '''Insert Previous Data Field''' and select the same data field; the system will insert the placeholder with the {{PREV}} function, which in our example is {{PREV((CRCase_status))}}.

Processing an SMS Notification as Subscriber When the business event occurs and the system processes the subscriber of the  Mobile SMS           Notification  type, the system extracts the values of the fields specified for         placeholders of the template (from the results of the generic inquiry that satisfy the         conditions) and inserts these values into the notification. The system then sends the text         notification or notifications to the mobile devices of the recipients. If the notification has been sent successfully, the system considers the subscriber to be         successfully processed and adds a record on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM502030|SM502030]) Business Event History (SM502030)         form. If any error has occurred during the processing of the notification template, the         system displays the error on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM502030|SM502030]) Business Event History form for the business         event. ]]></column>

==Configuring an Import Scenario as Subscriber==
You configure a subscriber of the ''Import Scenario'' type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) form. We recommend that you open this form to create the subscriber from the '''Subscribers''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_30_20_50|Business Events] ([~/?ScreenId=SM302050|SM302050]) form: You click '''Create Subscriber''' > '''Import Scenario''' on the table toolbar and specify the name of the scenario in the '''Create Import Scenario Subscriber''' dialog box, which opens. {br}

When you enter the name and click '''OK''' to close the dialog box, the system automatically creates on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_15|Data Providers] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206015|SM206015]) form a data provider of the ''Business Process Provider'' type for the import scenario (if the provider has not been created earlier for the generic inquiry of the business event). For this provider, the ''ScreenID'' parameter on the '''Parameters''' tab is set to the generic inquiry of the business event. The provider has two schema objects on the '''Schema''' tab: ''Results'' and ''PreviousResults''. Each object includes all fields of the results of the generic inquiry. The ''Results'' object returns the values of these fields when the business event occurs. The ''PreviousResults'' object returns the values of these fields before the business event has occurred. {br}

When the data provider has been created, the system opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) form with the import scenario name and the data provider specified. On the form, you complete creation of the import scenario by specifying the following:[anchor|#_817444ab-02a3-42b6-b456-a5fcd1dcaf9c]
*In the '''Screen Name''' box, the target Acumatica ERP form (which can be any Acumatica ERP form) on which the system should execute the sequence of instructions when the business event occurs.
*In the '''Provider Object''' box, the ''Results'' provider object or the ''PreviousResults'' provider object, depending on whether you want the system to extract the values before the business event has occurred or the values when the business event has occurred. The system uses the specified results of the generic inquiry to perform the sequence of instructions on the target form. 
*On the '''Mapping''' tab, the mapping of the import scenario—that is, the sequence of instructions that the system should perform on the target form when the business event occurs. When you are mapping fields, you should first map the key fields: the fields that the system uses to distinguish records that belong to different documents. After you have mapped the key fields, you should map other fields in the order in which you would fill them in on the form. At the end of the mapping of the scenario that creates or updates data in the system, to save the record to the database, you have to insert a row with the ''&lt;Action: Save&gt;'' action. For details about import scenario mapping, see [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__mng_Scenario_Mapping|Configuring Scenario Mapping].

You can also specify other parameters of the import scenario and source and target restrictions. For more information about import scenario configuration, see [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__mng_Configuring_Import_Scenarios|Configuring Import Scenarios].
==Processing an Import Scenario as Subscriber==
When the business event occurs and the system processes the ''Import Scenario'' subscriber, the system extracts the values (either the values before the business event has occurred or the values when the business event has occurred, depending on the provider object you specified for the import scenario) of the fields of the generic inquiry results and uses them as the source fields of the import scenario. The system executes on the target Acumatica ERP form the sequence of instructions defined by the import scenario. {br}

If the scenario has been executed successfully, the system considers the subscriber to be successfully processed and adds a record on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_50_20_30|Business Event History] ([~/?ScreenId=SM502030|SM502030]) form. If any error has occurred during the processing of the import scenario, the system displays the error on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_50_20_30|Business Event History] form for the business event.]]></column>

The user interface of Acumatica ERP provides predefined user interface elements, such as workspaces and workspace tiles and links, which you can configure to adjust the user interface to the business processes of your organization. Because the employees of your organization can locate the forms they use most right away, they can perform their working tasks related to Acumatica ERP more easily. {br}

For the description of the user interface elements, see [HelpRoot_Interface\UIG__con_New_UI| Acumatica ERP User Interface].{br}

In this topic, you will read about the capabilities in the system for customizing the user interface.{br}{TOC}
==User Role for the Customizing the User Interface==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_60|Security Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201060|SM201060]) form in the '''Menu Editor Role''' box you can specify any available user role. A user with this role will be able to customize the user interface (in particular, main menu and workspace links) in the special Menu Editing mode. The changes made in this mode are applied to all users of Acumatica ERP. ((({S:Warn}We recommend creating a dedicated role and assign it to those users who should have access to the user interface modification.
)))
==Customization of the User Interface==
You can customize the user interface as follows:[anchor|#_60b6fc42-9307-4431-a8e8-bb30a142e528]
*Adjust the list of workspaces that are items on the main menu: You can keep in the user interface only the workspaces that correspond to the business processes of your organization. To perform this task, you can add new workspaces and populate them with items (tiles and links that provide access to forms and reports), delete existing menu items for workspaces that do not comply with your business processes, and rename existing workspaces. For details, see [[#_67fc05a9-d987-4260-93c5-fb47ecc8ea40|Management of the Workspaces Listed on the Main Menu].
*Change the items of a workspace: You can customize a workspace so that only the items that your employees use in their work are displayed there. You can change the list of forms, reports, and dashboards in a workspace, regroup the links to forms and reports in a workspace, reorder the links to forms and reports in a category, remove unnecessary tiles and links to forms, reports, and dashboards from a workspace, and reorder tiles in a workspace. For more information, see [[#_334a2f9f-1e24-42b1-a323-1dff1dd42040|Management of Workspace Tiles and Links].

By using Menu Editing mode, you can customize the user interface in a variety of ways. To switch to this mode, on the main menu, you click the configuration menu button ([anchor|#_55f9375f-7fbb-4a10-a2f2-cdbb78a3972d][image:UserGuide/Images/Main_Menu_Dots.png|25px]) and then click '''Edit Menu'''.{br}

If you customize the user interface in this mode and then decide to return the initial state of the main menu and all workspaces, you can reset the menu settings to default. Changes in the following menu elements will be reset: [anchor|#_2857f336-086f-46e8-934e-9315ddc8785c]
*The list of workspaces that are items on the main menu and the '''More Items''' menu
*Items in each workspace, including categories, tiles, and links to forms, reports, and dashboards
*Items in quick menu of each workspace for all users of the system
*Workspaces pinned to the main menu and unpinned from the main menu for all users of the system
((({S:Hint}If your changes are not applied immediately after refreshing the page, we recommend clearing browser cache and loading the page again.
)))
For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\AS__how_Reset_Menu_Settings|To Reset Menu Settings].[anchor|#_67fc05a9-d987-4260-93c5-fb47ecc8ea40]
==Management of the Workspaces Listed on the Main Menu==
The main menu is the primary navigation tool that you and the employees of your organization use when you start working in Acumatica ERP. The system provides you with predefined workspaces list that is displayed in the main menu. The list of workspaces that a user sees by default is determined by the features enabled based on your Acumatica ERP license and the access rights of the user roles assigned to the particular user account.((({S:Warn}You must configure access rights for users to each form and report that belongs to a workspace. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\User_Roles_Mapref|Configuring User Roles].
)))
If the default list of workspaces (that is, the items on the main menu) does not correspond to the business processes of your organization, you can configure the list as follows:[anchor|#_8aa21377-c78c-41aa-b793-7188779a49df]
*Rename existing workspaces: If a title of any existing workspace is not optimal for your company&rsquo;s users, you can change the title to help users easily find the forms and reports they need. For the steps you need to perform to rename a workspace, see [HelpRoot_Administration\AS__how_Rename_Workspace|To Rename a Workspace].
*Delete existing workspaces: If a predefined workspace does not fit the business processes of your organization and will not be needed by system users, you can completely delete it from the system. When you delete a workspace, the system completely deletes tiles that belonged to the workspace, but forms, reports, and dashboards that belonged to the workspace remain in the system; you can add to other workspaces links to these forms, reports, and dashboards. For the procedure that describes how to delete a workspace, see [HelpRoot_Administration\AS__how_Delete_Workspace|To Delete a Workspace].
*Add new workspaces: If your organization has a specific business process that requires forms, reports, and dashboards from different functional areas to be gathered on one menu for employees&rsquo; convenience, you can create a custom workspace and pin it to the main menu panel. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\AS__how_Add_Configure_Workspace|To Add and Configure a Workspace].
[anchor|#_334a2f9f-1e24-42b1-a323-1dff1dd42040]
==Management of Workspace Tiles and Links==
Workspaces are used in the system to organize links to forms, reports, and dashboards in a way that is convenient to users. By default, each workspace contains tiles (buttons that provide users with quick access to frequently used forms) and links to forms, reports, and dashboards grouped by categories (such as '''Profiles''', '''Reports''', and '''Preferences'''). Each organization has its own business processes and uses sets of Acumatica ERP forms, reports, and dashboards based on these processes.{br}

To make a workspace convenient for the employees of your organization, you can do the following:[anchor|#_ca8ce07c-2db6-4669-bf80-122b539f3ed4]
*Change the default list of links to forms, reports, and dashboards displayed in a workspace: If you need different forms, reports, and dashboards to be displayed in a workspace, you can change the default list by showing the items that are hidden by default and hiding the items that are displayed by default. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\AS__how_Display_Hide_Forms_in_Workspace_Menu|To Display and Hide Forms in a Workspace].
*Add new links to forms, reports, and dashboards to a workspace: If a link to a form, report, and dashboard is not on a workspace by default but the employees of your organization want to have it in this workspace, you can add the required link to any Acumatica ERP form, report, or dashboard to the workspace. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\AS__how_Add_Form_to_Workspace_Menu|To Add a Link to a Workspace].
*:((({S:Warn}If a link to a form or report has not been added to any of workspaces, you cannot find this form or report by using the '''Search''' box on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen.
)))
*Regroup links to forms, reports, and dashboards in a workspace: If the default grouping of links to forms, reports, and dashboards in a workspace is inconvenient for the employees of your organization, you can move these links to other existing categories, or create a category that fits the terminology used by your employees. Changes to grouping settings affect only the workspace in which they are changed. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\AS__how_Regroup_Items_In_Workspace_Menu|To Regroup Forms and Reports in a Workspace ].
*:((({S:Warn}If you need to move a link to an existing category, which is displayed in a workspace, in the Menu Editing mode, you can simply drag the link to the category.
)))
*Reorder links to forms, reports, and dashboards in a category: In the Menu Editing mode, you can reorder links to forms, reports, and dashboards in a category by dragging each link to a necessary position.
*Remove links to forms, reports, and dashboards from a workspace: If you are sure that users will not need a particular link to a form, report, or dashboard in a workspace, you can remove this link from the workspace. (The form, report, or dashboard will remain in the system.) For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\AS__how_Remove_Form_From_Workspace_Menu|To Remove a Form or Report from a Workspace ].
*Delete preconfigured tiles: If the employees of your organization do not use functions preconfigured in tiles, you can delete the tiles from a workspace to have more space in the workspace. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\AS__how_Delete_Tile_from_Workspace_Menu|To Delete a Tile from a Workspace ].
*:((({S:Hint}After you delete a tile, you will be able to restore it only when restoring menu settings to default.
)))
*Reorder tiles in a workspace: In the Menu Editing mode, you can reorder tiles in a workspace by dragging each tile to a necessary position.

Some companies may want to customize the Acumatica ERP interface style—that is, the look and feel of the user interface—to make it better fit their professional image. One facet of the interface style is the theme of the user interface: the color selections of different parts of the screen. An administrative user can select one of the predefined themes or a custom theme created for the company. The theme represents the package of the files that work together to determine the appearance of the system. {br}

In addition to changing the theme of the user interface, an administrative user can change the logo of each specific branch and the images displayed on the Sign-In page.{br}{TOC}
==Changing the Theme Used in the System==
In Acumatica ERP, an administrative users that has access to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_05|Site Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200505|SM200505]) form can change the theme of the interface the company uses. The theme is selected in the '''Interface Theme''' box of the '''General Defaults''' section. There are two predefined themes available in the system:[anchor|#_231a32ef-ed05-434f-9bbe-29d8e888ae79]
*''Default'': This theme, which is applied by default, consists primarily of warmer blue, light gray, and white colors. 
*''Indigo'': This theme consists primarily of cooler blue, cold gray, and white colors. 

You can select the name of a custom theme in this box, if one has been created. (The next section describes the creation process.){br}

When you select the ''Default'' theme on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_05|Site Preferences] form, the '''Primary Color''' box appears under the '''Interface Theme''' box. You can leave the default color defined in the theme or select a different primary color to be used for the user interface. For multibranch companies, a different color can be specified for each branch to make it easier for employees to distinguish between these branches.((({S:Warn}You can reset the changed primary color to the default color by clicking the '''Reset to Default Colors''' button next to the '''Interface Theme''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_05|Site Preferences] form. The system will reset the primary color for all companies and branches.
)))
You change the color palette of the user interface by using the '''Primary Color''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_05|Site Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200505|SM200505]) form. The selected color palette is applied to all companies and branches, unless in the settings of a specific company or branch, the ability to override the site color is enabled and another color is selected. To change the color for a specific company or a branch, you do the following:[anchor|#_f105bc57-c4f2-4382-9fb0-9cf896a65cc7]
*For a company: On the '''Theme''' section of the '''Visual Appearance''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) form, you first select the '''Override Colors for the Selected Company''' check box, and then select the needed color in the '''Primary Color''' box or specify the hexadecimal number of the color in the box next to the '''Primary Color''' box.
*For a branch: On the '''Theme''' section of the '''Visual Appearance''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_20_00|Branches] ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) form, you first select the '''Override Colors for the Selected Branch''' check box, and then select the needed color in the '''Primary Color''' box or specify the hexadecimal number of the color in the box next to the '''Primary Color''' box.

If a company has multiple branches, you can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] or the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_20_00|Branches] ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) form to select the needed color. The color palette selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] form for the company with multiple branches is applied to all branches of a company unless in the settings of a specific branch, an override of the site color is enabled and another color is selected. 
==Creating a Custom Theme==
Users that have administrative access to the site database that is located on the server can edit the existing themes or create their own to apply them in the system. All themes are saved in the <tt>App&#95;Themes</tt> folder on the path that was specified for the site while the product was installed. When you insert a new folder into the <tt>App&#95;Themes</tt> folder, Acumatica ERP detects this folder and displays its name (which is also the name of the theme) in the list of the themes in the '''Interface Theme''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_05|Site Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200505|SM200505]) form. We highly recommend that you create new themes rather than edit the existing ones to avoid issues with the look and feel of the site. {br}

The following two files define the look and feel of the Acumatica ERP site:[anchor|#_50311acb-19a2-4564-9ee3-9e71cb913f35]
*<tt>00&#95;Controls.css</tt>: Defines the formatting of the forms that appear on the UI. This file can be found through the following path: <tt>C:\Program Files\Acumatica ERP\MySite\App&#95;Themes\ThemeName</tt>.
*<tt>Site.css</tt>: Defines the formatting of the navigation panels, tooltips, headers, and footers of the UI. This file can be found through the following path: <tt>C:\Program Files\Acumatica ERP\MySite\Content</tt>.

To create a custom theme, you copy the folder with the existing theme, insert it into the <tt>App&#95;Themes</tt> folder, and rename the copied folder to <tt>MyTheme</tt>, where ''MyTheme'' is the name you want to use for the theme being created. Then you copy the <tt>Site.css</tt> file and rename it to <tt>SiteMyTheme.css</tt>, where ''MyTheme'' is replaced by the name you want to use for the theme you are creating. To modify the look and feel of the forms, change the color scheme in the <tt>00&#95;Controls.css</tt> file of the folder that has the name of your theme, and save the changes. To modify the look and feel of the other elements of the UI, change the color scheme in the <tt>SiteMyTheme.css</tt> file (where ''MyTheme'' is the name you want to use for the theme being created) and save the changes. {br}

For instance, if you want to name your new theme ''Green'', you copy the <tt>Default</tt> theme folder and rename it to <tt>Green</tt>. Then you copy the <tt>Site.css</tt> file and you rename it to <tt>SiteGreen.css</tt> so that the system can detect that they are interconnected. {br}

When all files have been configured, you can select the created theme in the '''Interface Theme''' box of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_05|Site Preferences] form to apply the changes. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__how_To_Change_Default_Theme|To Change the Default Theme of Acumatica ERP].
==Changing the Company Logo==
A company logo is a unique graphical symbol of the company that makes this company recognizable among others. Administrative users can change the site logo by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) form (for companies of the ''Without Branches'' type) and the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_20_00|Branches] ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) form (for companies of the ''With Branches Not Requiring Balancing'' and ''With Branches Requiring Balancing'' type), on the '''Logo''' tab of both forms. The recommended size of the uploaded image is 210 by 50 pixels. 
==Changing the Images on the Sign-In Page==
Users that have administrative access to the site database that is located on the server can also customize the images displayed on the left side of the Sign-In page. The system displays a custom image from a set of images stored in the <tt>Icons</tt> folder (from <tt>login&#95;bg1.jpg</tt> to <tt>login&#95;bg9.jpg</tt>) on the path that was specified for the site while the product was installed. We recommend that you save the images that you will use for the Sign-In page with the same names as the original images have and that you reserve the original images for future use by changing the extension of these files from <tt>.jpg</tt> to <tt>.bak</tt>. The recommended size of each image is 1500 by 1000 pixels.[anchor|#_c372ac2e-893a-4fda-b037-be51ed038b7c]
==Inspecting Elements of the Webpage==
While creating a custom theme, a user may wonder how to find the selector that is responsible for the formatting of a specific user interface element. Each browser has a set of web development and debugging tools called Developer Tools. These Developer Tools display the document object model (DOM) of the webpage or the DOM of a separate element on that page. On the '''Elements''' tab of the Developer Tools, the user can find the name of the source file where the code of the element is specified and the line of this code.{br}

 On the needed page, a user can press F12 to open the '''Developer Tools''' window. To view the node for a specific element, the user can click the '''Select Element''' tool button (''Microsoft Internet Explorer'') on the '''Command Menu''' bar of the '''Developer Tools''' window and select that specific element on the webpage. The HTML node of the selected element appears on the '''Elements''' tab of the '''Developer Tools''' window. The CSS code of the selected element is displayed on the '''Styles''' tab on the right side of the same window. The following screenshot shows how the system displays the HTML and CSS code of the selected element.[anchor|#_8b01e94c-593a-4c36-a19e-092ee69252c1][image:UserGuide/Images/SourceCode.jpg|popup|600px]
The following table displays the list of browsers and the name of the tool for each particular browser.[anchor|#_afc19e8c-272b-487c-9ef3-af3d4414ff04]

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Interface Style of  Acumatica ERPSome companies may want to customize the  Acumatica ERP interface style—that is, the look and feel of the user interface—to make it         better fit their professional image. One facet of the interface style is the theme of the         user interface: the color selections of different parts of the screen. An administrative         user can select one of the predefined themes or a custom theme created for the company. The         theme represents the package of the files that work together to determine the appearance of         the system.  In addition to changing the theme of the user interface, an administrative user can change         the logo of each specific branch and the images displayed on the Sign-In page. Changing the Theme Used in the System In  Acumatica ERP, an administrative users that has access to the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200505|SM200505]) Site Preferences         (SM200505) form can change the theme of the interface the company uses. The theme is         selected in the  Interface Theme  box of the  General           Defaults  section. There are two predefined themes available in the system: Default : This theme, which is applied by default, consists primarily of warmer           blue, light gray, and white colors.  Indigo : This theme consists primarily of cooler blue, cold gray, and white           colors.  You can select the name of a custom theme in this box, if one has been created. (The next         section describes the creation process.) When you select the  Default  theme on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200505|SM200505]) Site Preferences form, the            Primary Color  box appears under the  Interface           Theme  box. You can leave the default color defined in the theme or select a         different primary color to be used for the user interface. For multibranch companies, a         different color can be specified for each branch to make it easier for employees to         distinguish between these branches. You can reset the changed primary color to the default color by clicking the            Reset to Default Colors  button next to the  Interface           Theme  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200505|SM200505]) Site Preferences form. The system will reset         the primary color for all companies and branches. You change the color palette of the user interface by using the  Primary           Color  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200505|SM200505]) Site Preferences (SM200505) form.         The selected color palette is applied to all companies and branches, unless in the settings         of a specific company or branch, the ability to override the site color is enabled and         another color is selected. To change the color for a specific company or a branch, you do         the following: For a company: On the  Theme  section of the  Visual             Appearance  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) Companies           (CS101500) form, you first select the  Override Colors for the Selected             Company  check box, and then select the needed color in the              Primary Color  box or specify the hexadecimal number of the color           in the box next to the  Primary Color  box. For a branch: On the  Theme  section of the  Visual             Appearance  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) Branches           (CS102000) form, you first select the  Override Colors for the Selected             Branch  check box, and then select the needed color in the  Primary             Color  box or specify the hexadecimal number of the color in the box next to           the  Primary Color  box. If a company has multiple branches, you can use the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) Companies or the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) Branches         (CS102000) form to select the needed color. The color palette selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) Companies form for the company with multiple branches is         applied to all branches of a company unless in the settings of a specific branch, an         override of the site color is enabled and another color is selected.  Creating a Custom Theme Users that have administrative access to the site database that is located on the server         can edit the existing themes or create their own to apply them in the system. All themes are         saved in the  App_Themes  folder on the path that was specified for the         site while the product was installed. When you insert a new folder into the            App_Themes  folder,  Acumatica ERP detects this folder and displays its name (which is also the name of the theme) in the         list of the themes in the  Interface Theme  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200505|SM200505]) Site Preferences (SM200505) form. We highly recommend that you create new themes         rather than edit the existing ones to avoid issues with the look and feel of the site.  The following two files define the look and feel of the  Acumatica ERP site: 00_Controls.css : Defines the formatting of the forms that appear on           the UI. This file can be found through the following path:  C:\Program             Files\Acumatica ERP\MySite\App_Themes\ThemeName . Site.css : Defines the formatting of the navigation panels,           tooltips, headers, and footers of the UI. This file can be found through the following           path:  C:\Program Files\Acumatica ERP\MySite\Content . To create a custom theme, you copy the folder with the existing theme, insert it into the            App_Themes  folder, and rename the copied folder to            MyTheme , where  MyTheme  is the name you want to use for the         theme being created. Then you copy the  Site.css  file and rename it to            SiteMyTheme.css , where  MyTheme  is replaced by the name you         want to use for the theme you are creating. To modify the look and feel of the forms, change         the color scheme in the  00_Controls.css  file of the folder that has the         name of your theme, and save the changes. To modify the look and feel of the other elements         of the UI, change the color scheme in the  SiteMyTheme.css  file (where            MyTheme  is the name you want to use for the theme being created) and save the         changes.  For instance, if you want to name your new theme  Green , you copy the            Default  theme folder and rename it to  Green .         Then you copy the  Site.css  file and you rename it to            SiteGreen.css  so that the system can detect that they are         interconnected.  When all files have been configured, you can select the created theme in the            Interface Theme  box of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200505|SM200505]) Site Preferences form to         apply the changes. For more information, see  To Change the Default Theme of Acumatica ERP. Changing the Company Logo A company logo is a unique graphical symbol of the company that makes this company         recognizable among others. Administrative users can change the site logo by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) Companies (CS101500) form (for companies of the  Without Branches          type) and the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) Branches (CS102000) form (for companies of the  With           Branches Not Requiring Balancing  and  With Branches Requiring Balancing  type),         on the  Logo  tab of both forms. The recommended size of the uploaded         image is 210 by 50 pixels.  Changing the Images on the Sign-In Page Users that have administrative access to the site database that is located on the server         can also customize the images displayed on the left side of the Sign-In page. The system         displays a custom image from a set of images stored in the  Icons  folder         (from  login_bg1.jpg  to  login_bg9.jpg ) on the path         that was specified for the site while the product was installed. We recommend that you save         the images that you will use for the Sign-In page with the same names as the original images         have and that you reserve the original images for future use by changing the extension of         these files from  .jpg  to  .bak . The recommended         size of each image is 1500 by 1000 pixels. Inspecting Elements of the Webpage While creating a custom theme, a user may wonder how to find the selector that is         responsible for the formatting of a specific user interface element. Each browser has a set         of web development and debugging tools called Developer Tools. These Developer Tools display         the document object model (DOM) of the webpage or the DOM of a separate element on that         page. On the  Elements  tab of the Developer Tools, the user can find         the name of the source file where the code of the element is specified and the line of this         code.  On the needed page, a user can press F12 to open the  Developer           Tools  window. To view the node for a specific element, the user can click the            Select Element  tool button ( Microsoft Internet Explorer ) on         the  Command Menu  bar of the  Developer Tools          window and select that specific element on the webpage. The HTML node of the selected         element appears on the  Elements  tab of the  Developer           Tools  window. The CSS code of the selected element is displayed on the            Styles  tab on the right side of the same window. The following         screenshot shows how the system displays the HTML and CSS code of the selected element. The following table displays the list of browsers and the name of the tool for each         particular browser. Browser Tool Name Microsoft Internet Explorer Select Element Microsoft Edge Select Element Mozilla Firefox Select Element by Click Apple Safari Start Element Selection Google Chrome Select an element in the page to inspect it Each  .CSS  file has commented lines that indicate the name of the class         defined below these lines.

By using Acumatica ERP wikis, users can create, edit, and share information. Organizations can easily create specialized wikis for sharing information within project teams, within and across departments, or with external users. Wiki users can share policy and procedure manuals, employee manuals, business plans, individual plans, task lists, and other frequently updated documents. These users benefit from wiki version tracking and security. Also, users can attach files in any format to wiki articles. {br}

 Acumatica ERP wikis facilitate efficient content management practices. With Acumatica ERP wikis, digital content consists of articles organized logically within folders. Employees can easily:[anchor|#ul_v4c_ks3_jj]
*Set up wikis.
*Structure articles and folders within wikis to best fit users&rsquo; needs.
*Write and edit articles with ease and flexibility.
*Track changes.
*Implement preferred review procedures and standards before each article is published.

The Document Management module provides advanced functionality for wiki management.{br}{TOC}
==Help Wiki==
 Acumatica ERP provides a predefined wiki, Help, that includes the complete set of online documentation. As with any other wiki, the Help wiki can be modified, if needed. However, we strongly recommend that you restrict the ability to modify this wiki.
==User-Defined Wikis==
 Acumatica ERP supports user-created wikis. You can create a new wiki by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_20_05|Wiki] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202005|SM202005]) form. The functionality of the wiki is defined by the article type you select for the wiki (the ''Article'' type or ''KB Article'' type). You can also specify the access rights the roles have to the entire wiki. For more information about the process of adding a wiki, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__how_Wiki_Setting_Up_a_New_Wiki|To Add a Wiki]
==Display of a Wiki in Acumatica ERP==
In the user interface of Acumatica ERP, users with the appropriate level of access rights can add a wiki card to a Help dashboard. This capability makes information from the wiki available for other users, depending on the access rights defined for them on the '''Access Rights''' tab of the selected wiki. Alternatively, you can hide a wiki displayed on the Help dashboard if users no longer use it. For more information on how to add a wiki card to the Help dashboard or hide it on this dashboard, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__how_Wiki_Dispaying_in_the_Modern_UI|To Display and Hide a Wiki in the UI].
==User-Defined Wiki Templates==
In Acumatica ERP, users that have the ''Insert'', ''Publish'', and ''Delete'' levels of access rights can create templates for wiki articles to make it easier for users to quickly create articles with the needed formatting. Wiki templates are used to define the default style and components of the article, its printed version, its header, and its footer within the selected wiki. You create and save these templates in the wiki you want to apply them to. {br}

Templates are defined in the system as articles, and the system recognizes templates among other articles by the specific ID defined for them. To create the template for the article and the printing template, you type <tt>ContainerTemplate:</tt> before the template ID. To create the templates for headers and footers, you type <tt>GenTemplate:</tt> before the template ID. Do not use spaces in these IDs. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__how_Wiki_Creating_Template|To Create a Wiki Template].{br}

You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_20_05|Wiki] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202005|SM202005]) form to apply a template to the wiki. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__how_Wiki_Adding_Template|To Apply Templates to a Wiki]
==Presentation of Wiki Articles==
You can use Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to specify how the articles in the wiki will be displayed and printed. For style examples, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Style_Examples|Wiki Style Examples].
==Access to Wikis==
In Acumatica ERP, you configure access to all system entities, including wikis, by using roles. To allow users to view published articles or modify wikis, among other tasks, you have to create appropriate roles and configure each role to have the needed access rights for wikis. For more information on setting up the access that roles have to wikis, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Wiki_Access_Setup|Wiki Access Management].
==Wiki Content Management==
The management of wiki content may consist of multiple phases: creating new articles, editing the article text, publishing the articles so other users can read them, and removing outdated materials. Acumatica Wiki supports all the phases that apply in your organization.{br}

You can edit the article as a whole, including its properties, or make content edits to a particular section of the article.{br}

For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__mng_Wiki_How_To|Wiki Content Procedures].
==Wiki Markup==
In Acumatica ERP, to format the text of the articles, you use wiki markup, a straightforward syntax that uses special markup elements. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__con_Wiki_Using_Wiki_Markup|Wiki Markup Reference].
==Wiki Article Approval==
In most organizations, certain phases of content management involve the collaboration of multiple workgroups. For example, consider an article created by one author and edited by other users of the same group. Before the article can be published, your organization may require approval by one workgroup or multiple workgroups. In Acumatica ERP, you can configure approval procedures to ensure that articles are approved by authorized employees before they are published. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__con_Wiki_Configuring_Approval_Procedures|Wiki Approval Procedures].
==Categories for Wiki Articles==
You can use categories to mark the type of content that wiki articles contain. Categories, along with other features, help readers find necessary information when they perform searches. You can add and delete categories and select articles included in a category. For more information on managing categories, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__how_Wiki_Using_Categories|To Use Categories in Wikis].
==Products for Wiki Articles==
You can mark the articles that apply to different products or product versions. Products, along with other features, help readers find necessary information when they perform searches. You can add and delete products and select the articles that apply to the product. For more information on managing categories and products, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__how_Wiki_Using_Products|To Use Products in Wikis].
==Wiki Article Versions==
With article versioning turned on, each time you save an edited article, a new version of the article is created. You can view the history of revisions and switch to any version of the article. Also, you can compare article versions and review the statistics related to the comparison. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__how_Wiki_Tracking_Changes|To Track Changes in Wiki Articles] and [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__how_Wiki_Comparing_Article_Versions|To Compare Wiki Article Versions].
==Visibility in Acumatica ERP of a Wiki Article Created on the Self-Service Portal==
You can create a wiki article on Self-Service Portal and display it in Acumatica ERP. For example, suppose that you have added a FAQ article on Self-Service Portal and would like to make it visible to the support engineers of your organization who use Acumatica ERP. {br}

To make a wiki article created on Self-Service Portal visible in Acumatica ERP, you do the following:[anchor|#_2da12317-1682-4ca2-82a5-f15a4e0ecf04]
#Select the wiki that contains the article you want to display in Acumatica ERP.
#Add the wiki to the Acumatica ERP site map.
#Set up access rights to the wiki and the article for users who may need to view them during their work.

For the detailed procedure, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__how_Display_Wiki_Article_Created_on_Portal|To Make a Wiki Article Visible in Acumatica ERP].

To 				allow users to view published articles or modify wikis, among other tasks, you have 				to create appropriate roles and configure each role to have the needed access rights 				for wikis. For more information on setting up the access that roles have to wikis, 				see  Wiki Access Management. Wiki Content Management The management of wiki content may consist of multiple phases: creating new articles, 				editing the article text, publishing the articles so other users can read them, and 				removing outdated materials.  Acumatica Wiki supports all the phases that apply in your organization. You can edit the article as a whole, including its properties, or make content edits 				to a particular section of the article. For more information, see  Wiki Content Procedures. Wiki Markup In  Acumatica ERP, to format the text of the articles, you use wiki markup, a straightforward 				syntax that uses special markup elements. For more information, see  Wiki Markup Reference. Wiki Article Approval In most organizations, certain phases of content management involve the collaboration 				of multiple workgroups. For example, consider an article created by one author and 				edited by other users of the same group. Before the article can be published, your 				organization may require approval by one workgroup or multiple workgroups. In  Acumatica ERP, you can configure approval procedures to ensure that articles are approved by 				authorized employees before they are published. For more information, see  Wiki Approval Procedures. Categories for Wiki Articles You can use categories to mark the type of content that wiki articles contain. 				Categories, along with other features, help readers find necessary information when 				they perform searches. You can add and delete categories and select articles 				included in a category. For more information on managing categories, see  To Use Categories in Wikis. Products for Wiki Articles You can mark the articles that apply to different products or product versions. 				Products, along with other features, help readers find necessary information when 				they perform searches. You can add and delete products and select the articles that 				apply to the product. For more information on managing categories and products, see 					 To Use Products in Wikis. Wiki Article Versions With article versioning turned on, each time you save an edited article, a new 				version of the article is created. You can view the history of revisions and switch 				to any version of the article. Also, you can compare article versions and review the 				statistics related to the comparison. For more information, see  To Track Changes in Wiki Articles and  To Compare Wiki Article Versions. Visibility in  Acumatica ERP of a Wiki Article Created on the  Self-Service PortalYou can create a wiki article on  Self-Service Portal and display it in  Acumatica ERP. For example, suppose that you have added a FAQ article on  Self-Service Portal and would like to make it visible to the support engineers of your organization 				who use  Acumatica ERP.  To make a wiki article created on  Self-Service Portal visible in  Acumatica ERP, you do the following: Select the wiki that contains the article you want to display in  Acumatica ERP. Add the wiki to the  Acumatica ERP site map. Set up access rights to the wiki and the article for users who may need to view 					them during their work. For the detailed procedure, see  To Make a Wiki Article Visible in Acumatica ERP.  ([~/?ScreenId=SM201025|SM201025])  ([~/?ScreenId=SM202010|SM202010])  ([~/?ScreenId=SM202015|SM202015]) ]]></column>

In Acumatica ERP, you configure all access, including access to the wiki, by using roles. Each role is collection of functions a user with the role may access. Acumatica ERP provides several built-in roles and a number of predefined roles with names and abilities that vary by reseller. Your company may need to redefine roles or create new roles to effectively separate employee duties in accordance with established internal policies. {br}

Wiki access management involves configuring new roles, modifying existing roles, and assigning roles to users to allow them to perform the required tasks in the wikis. {br}{TOC}
==Role Setup==
Generally, for roles whose users work with wikis, access should be configured to the following: 
*Particular wikis for which the roles will edit, publish, or create new articles (which might include templates or announcements).
*Forms that users with the role will use to rename and move articles in the wiki site map, view and compare article versions, and publish articles.
*Forms to create new roles or modify existing ones for wiki users and to configure approval procedures.

For example, a small or mid-sized company might have the following wiki-related roles, which differ by the level of access to wikis and by the tasks users with the role may perform:[anchor|#ul_asp_wkg_x3]
*'''Internal User''': Users with this role can view system wikis (that is, wikis delivered with the system) and access their personal user settings. Such a role would be assigned to each internal user (one who is employed by your company) in the system. The rights of the role may be extended to provide access to other wikis that include public materials.
*'''Wiki Author''': These users can view and edit published and unpublished wiki articles, create new articles and folders, move articles between folders, and publish articles. The role may have access to system wikis (if the company policy allows modification of these wikis), to another wikis that contains the company internal instructions and manuals, or to other work documents.
*:((({S:Warn}We recommend setting the ''View Only'' access to wikis delivered with the system. Modification of system wiki articles will prevent their update during upgrades. The system will update only articles that have not been modified.
)))
*'''Wiki Administrator''': Users with this role manage the access rights other roles have to wikis, folders, and files. Users with the role may create new wikis and wiki styles and set up approval procedures for the publishing of articles. The role should have full access to all wikis.

Your company may create additional wikis for corporate use. When you create new wikis, wiki folders, and articles, the existing roles will not have access to them. You will need to establish proper access rights to those items by modifying existing roles or creating new ones.
==Access for Wiki Articles==
You set the access each role has to the wikis available in your company by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_20_15|Wiki Access by Role] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202015|SM202015]) form. If the company has multiple wikis, you set access for each of the wikis separately. You can set access rights to a particular article or folder by using the '''Access Rights''' tab when you open the article in the Wiki Editor form. {br}

The following levels of access rights are available for all items (wikis, folders, or articles) in all wikis. If a particular level of access rights is set for a wiki, by default, that level is inherited by all articles and folders in the wiki. You can, however, set different levels of access rights for articles and folders within the wiki.[anchor|#_gkk_jvd_rg]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="25%" ! Option
!width="74%" ! Description
|- 
| ''Not Set''
| If all roles has this level of access rights to a wiki, users with all roles have access to the new wiki. When another option is selected for at least one of the roles, this option denies access for roles that have not been explicitly set.
|- 
| ''Revoked''
| If a role has this level of access rights to a wiki, users with the role are denied access to the entire wiki and its items; for such users, the wiki is not displayed in the navigation pane. Other (more permissive) levels of access set for articles within the wiki won&rsquo;t allow users with the role to view those items in the navigation pane; these users can access the items only by using direct links to the items.
|- 
| ''View Only''
| If a role has this level of access rights to a wiki, a user with the role may view the published article, published articles within the folder, or published articles in the wiki, depending on the item to which the level is assigned. Access to the item is inherited by all articles within the item; if the item is an unpublished folder, a user with the role cannot see the published articles within it even if the role has permissive rights for these articles. If the role has the ''View Only'' level of access rights, the '''Edit Current Article''', '''Add New Article''', and '''Delete Article''' buttons are unavailable on the wiki toolbar for the user. 
|- 
| ''Edit''
| If a role has this level of access rights to a wiki, a user with the role may view and edit published and unpublished articles in the wiki. If a role has this level of access rights to an article in the wiki, users with the role may set higher and lower levels of access to the item. For folders and articles to which the user has this level of access, the '''Add New Article''' and '''Delete Article''' buttons are unavailable on the wiki toolbar for the user.
|- 
| ''Insert''
| If a role has this level of access rights to a wiki, a user with the role can edit articles and folders, create new articles, and initiate the approval process for publishing if approval is required for the wiki. If a role has this level of access rights to an item within the wiki, users with the role may set higher and lower levels of access for the item. For folders and articles to which the user has this level of access, the '''Add New Article''' button is available and the '''Delete Article''' button is unavailable on the wiki toolbar for the user.
|- 
| ''Publish''
| If a role has this level of access rights to a wiki, a user with the role may edit, create, and publish articles. If a role has this level of access rights to an item within a wiki, users with the role may set higher and lower levels of access to the item. For folders and articles to which the user has this level of access, the '''Add New Article''' button is available and the '''Delete Article''' button is unavailable on the wiki toolbar for the user.
|- 
| ''Delete''
| If a role has this level of access rights to a wiki, a user with the role may modify the access other users have to articles using the article properties, as well as edit, create, publish, and delete articles. If a role has this level of access rights to an item within the wiki, users with the role may set any level of access to the article. For folders and articles to which the user has this level of access, all the buttons are available, including the '''Delete Article''' button.
|}
For users whose roles allow them to edit articles (with ''Edit'' or higher access rights), you may want to grant access to the following forms, so that these users can insert and update graphics within articles:[anchor|#ul_fxy_5t1_lj]
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_20|Search in Files] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202520|SM202520]) 
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_10|File Maintenance] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202510|SM202510]) 
((({S:Warn}You can set the access rights of the role by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_25|Access Rights by Role] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201025|SM201025]) form. 
)))
==Role Configuration for Wikis==
When you configure a role for the users who will be working with wikis, you give access to:[anchor|#ul_f5h_5cb_xl]
*The wiki management forms by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_25|Access Rights by Role] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201025|SM201025]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_20|Access Rights by Screen] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201020|SM201020]), or [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_20_05|Wiki] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202005|SM202005]) form.
*The wiki articles by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_20_15|Wiki Access by Role] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202015|SM202015]) form. By using this form, a user will be able to configure access only to wikis this user has access to.

==Access to Help Topics==
Although most wikis are created to be modified by multiple users, Acumatica ERP Help (system wikis) should be protected from unnecessary modifications. We recommend setting the ''View Only'' access to wikis delivered with the system. Modification of system wiki articles will prevent their update during upgrades. The system will update only articles that have not been modified.
==Access to Wiki Management Forms==
Typically, content management may include the following tasks: creating articles or folders, editing the text, publishing the articles for other users to read, removing outdated materials, moving articles and folders, setting up a new wiki, and defining the styles. The users with any roles that performs such duties will require ''Edit'' (or higher) access rights to the following forms:
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_20_10|Wiki Site Map] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202010|SM202010]): Allows users with the role to move folders and articles between folders. 
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_20_05|Wiki] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202005|SM202005]): Allows users with the role to create new wikis and specify access rights for existing wikis. 
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_20_30|Wiki Style Sheets] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202030|SM202030]): Allows users with the role to define new styles and modify existing ones. 
((({S:Warn}You can set the access rights of the role by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_25|Access Rights by Role] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201025|SM201025]) form. 
)))
For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\User_Roles_Mapref|Configuring User Roles].
==Access to Wiki Administration==
You might want to give users with a particular role the ability to perform wiki administration, which involves the following tasks: 
*Configuring the access rights other users have to wikis, specific wiki folders, and articles
*Performing inquiries in the wikis
*Setting up approval routes and configuring approval procedures
*Creating new roles and configuring their access rights to forms in the Document Management module

The role should include access rights to the following forms:
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]): To create new user accounts
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_05|User Roles] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201005|SM201005]): To create new roles and assign them to users
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_25|Access Rights by Role] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201025|SM201025]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_20|Access Rights by Screen] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201020|SM201020]): To configure the access rights each role has to wikis, system forms that support wiki-related functionality and, if necessary, to the Document Management module forms
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_20_05|Wiki] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202005|SM202005]): To configure access rights each role has to wikis
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_20_15|Wiki Access by Role] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202015|SM202015]) form: To set the access of each role to wikis, their folders, and their articles
((({S:Warn}You can set the access rights for the role by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_25|Access Rights by Role] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201025|SM201025]) form.

If a role has                                 this level of access rights to an item within the wiki, users with                                 the role may set any level of access to the article. For folders and                                 articles to which the user has this level of access, all the buttons                                 are available, including the  Delete Article                                  button. For users whose roles allow them to edit articles (with  Edit  or higher access                 rights), you may want to grant access to the following forms, so that these users                 can insert and update graphics within articles:  ([~/?ScreenId=SM202520|SM202520]) Search in Files (SM202520)   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202510|SM202510]) File Maintenance (SM202510)  You can set the access rights of the role by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201025|SM201025]) Access Rights by Role (SM201025) form.  Role Configuration for Wikis When you configure a role for the users who will be working with wikis, you give                 access to: The wiki management forms by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201025|SM201025]) Access Rights by Role                     (SM201025),   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201020|SM201020]) Access Rights by Screen (SM201020), or   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202005|SM202005]) Wiki (SM202005) form. The wiki articles by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202015|SM202015]) Wiki Access by Role (SM202015)                     form. By using this form, a user will be able to configure access only to wikis                     this user has access to. Access to Help Topics Although most wikis are created to be modified by multiple users,  Acumatica ERP Help (system wikis) should be protected from unnecessary modifications. We                 recommend setting the  View Only  access to wikis delivered with the system.                 Modification of system wiki articles will prevent their update during upgrades. The                 system will update only articles that have not been modified. Access to Wiki Management Forms Typically, content management may include the following tasks: creating articles or folders,                 editing the text, publishing the articles for other users to read, removing outdated                 materials, moving articles and folders, setting up a new wiki, and defining the                 styles. The users with any roles that performs such duties will require  Edit                  (or higher) access rights to the following forms:  ([~/?ScreenId=SM202010|SM202010]) Wiki Site Map (SM202010): Allows users with the role to move                     folders and articles between folders.   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202005|SM202005]) Wiki (SM202005): Allows users with the role to                     create new wikis and specify access rights for existing wikis.   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202030|SM202030]) Wiki Style Sheets (SM202030): Allows users with the role to                     define new styles and modify existing ones.  You can set the access rights of the role by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201025|SM201025]) Access Rights by Role (SM201025) form.  For more information, see  Configuring User Roles. Access to Wiki Administration You might want to give users with a particular role the ability to perform wiki administration,                 which involves the following tasks:  Configuring the access rights other users have to wikis, specific wiki folders, and                     articles Performing inquiries in the wikis Setting up approval routes and configuring approval procedures Creating new roles and configuring their access rights to forms in the Document Management                     module The role should include access rights to the following forms:  ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) Users (SM201010): To create new user accounts  ([~/?ScreenId=SM201005|SM201005]) User Roles (SM201005): To create new roles and assign                     them to users  ([~/?ScreenId=SM201025|SM201025]) Access Rights by Role (SM201025) and   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201020|SM201020]) Access Rights by Screen (SM201020): To configure the                     access rights each role has to wikis, system forms that support wiki-related                     functionality and, if necessary, to the Document Management module forms  ([~/?ScreenId=SM202005|SM202005]) Wiki (SM202005): To configure access rights each                     role has to wikis  ([~/?ScreenId=SM202015|SM202015]) Wiki Access by Role (SM202015) form: To set the access of each                     role to wikis, their folders, and their articles You can set the access rights for the role by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201025|SM201025]) Access Rights by Role (SM201025) form.

Articles in a wiki must be published to be seen by all users. An organization may require articles to be approved by authorized employees before they may be published. In Acumatica ERP, you can configure approval procedures by using roles and wiki functionality, as described below. {br}{TOC}
==Approval by Using Roles==
In Acumatica ERP, access to any wiki is determined by the roles assigned to users. You can use roles to facilitate the approval of wiki articles by performing the following steps: 
*Configure a role for wiki authors that has access to the required wiki folders (or the entire wiki) at the ''Insert'' level. Users who have this role assigned will be able to create new articles and edit existing ones, but will not be able to publish articles.
*Configure a role for wiki publishers, and give the role access to the required wiki folders (or the entire wiki) at the ''Publish'' level. Users assigned to this role will be able to publish the articles after they approve of article content. Assign this role to users qualified to approve and publish articles. 
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_20_05|Wiki] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202005|SM202005]) form, make sure that the '''Require Approval''' check box is cleared for the wiki for which approval will be performed through roles.

A user with the wiki publisher role can publish an article by opening the Wiki Editor form for the article, clearing the '''Hold''' check box, and saving the article.
==Approval by Using Wiki Functionality==
You can also use built-in wiki functionality to enable wiki article approval. To make approval required for a specific wiki, do the following:[anchor|#ol_fvy_h53_mj]
#On the '''Configuration''' tab, click '''Document Management'''. In the left pane, click '''Manage''' > '''Wiki''' to open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_20_05|Wiki] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202005|SM202005]) form.
#In the Summary area, in the '''ID''' box, select the wiki.
#Select the '''Hold on Entry''' check box to assign ''Hold'' status to any article after it has been edited. If the article has versions, a new version with the ''Hold'' status is created and the last published version is still available to users with ''View Only'' access. If the article is not versioned, a new version with the ''Hold'' status overwrites the published article; this new version is not available to users with ''View Only'' access rights.
#Select the '''Require Approval''' check box.
#In the '''Approval Group''' box, select the workgroup to perform approvals for articles in the wiki. The default user of the group is initially specified as the approver, but you can select another member of the group in the '''Approver ID''' box.
#:((({S:Warn}You can configure the wiki approval groups by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_40_61|Company Tree] ([~/?ScreenId=EP204061|EP204061]) form.
)))
#In the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

To begin the process of publishing an article, the user who created or edited the article clears the '''Hold''' check box in the Summary area of the '''Contents''' tab of the Wiki Editor form. This changes the article status to ''Pending''. The approver periodically finds articles with the ''Pending'' status for viewing and editing by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_20_25|Wikis] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202025|SM202025]) form. The approver can view and edit any listed articles.{br}

This form also lets the approver process one or more articles. The approver can add keywords, change the parent folder, assign a category, and approve or reject the article. When the article is processed, its status changes as follows:[anchor|#ul_yvy_h53_mj]
*If approved, the article has the ''Published'' status, and the '''Approved''' check box (visible on the '''Content''' tab when the article is open in the Wiki Editor form) is selected for it.
*If rejected, the article has the ''On Hold'' status, and the '''Rejected''' check box (also on the '''Content''' tab) is selected for it.

==Escalation==
An article becomes escalated if its approval was requested but the article was not approved within the wait time specified for the workgroup assigned to approve articles in the wiki. Escalated articles become visible to users of the workgroup that is positioned at one level higher on the company tree. Escalated articles can be approved by the user they were initially assigned to or by a user from the group to which the approval was escalated.

==Paragraph Styles==
You can use spacing and headings to separate and organize paragraphs. Spacing between paragraphs make the text more readable, while headings provide visual cues that help users understand the structure of the article. Other styles, such as boxes and lists, make information easier to understand and remember.{br}

To increase spacing between paragraphs when you&rsquo;re editing, insert two line breaks in the wiki text. Single line breaks are ignored. {br}

The table below includes the paragraph styles you can use in wiki articles. ((({S:Hint}All the paragraph styles listed below should be used at the beginning of the line.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Wiki Markup Reference  You use wiki markup to create  Acumatica Wiki         articles. When you edit the text, you view the markup and can directly manipulate it. When         you view the article, the markup is hidden and the text is formatted based on your         specifications in the markup. This topic describes the text and paragraph style conventions used in wiki markup.  Text Styles To meet specific formatting needs, you can format your text using the markup styles listed         in the table below.  Style Type as View as Bold '''Bold text''' Italic ''Italic text'' Bold and italic '''''Bold and italic                   text''''' Underlined __Underlined Text__ Strikethrough --Strikethrough text-- Subscript X<sub>2</sub> Superscript X<sup>2</sup>  Fixed-width <tt>Enter</tt> Code listing or markup  {{Enter}} Increased font size <big> Big font text </big> Decreased font size <small> Small font text </small>  Ignored wiki markup <nowiki>--no strikethrough--</nowiki>  Comment not visible in article <!-- Comment here--> Special Symbols To insert a special symbols, you can use the corresponding HTML code. The following table         shows the most common special symbols and their codes.   Symbol Code Symbol Code Symbol Code Symbol Code &trade; &#0123; &lt; &#95; &copy; &#0125; &gt; &#124; &reg; &#91; &laquo; &#35; &cent; &#93; &raquo; &#42; &euro; &#45; &ldquo;  &#92; &yen; &#8211; &rdquo; &lsquo; &pound; &#8212; &para; &rsquo; Paragraph Styles You can use spacing and headings to separate and organize paragraphs. Spacing between         paragraphs make the text more readable, while headings provide visual cues that help users         understand the structure of the article. Other styles, such as boxes and lists, make         information easier to understand and remember. To increase spacing between paragraphs when you're editing, insert two line breaks in the         wiki text. Single line breaks are ignored.  The table below includes the paragraph styles you can use in wiki articles.  All the paragraph styles listed below should be used at the beginning of the         line.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
You can create new wikis to meet the evolving needs of your organization. You can use a wiki to easily share often-used content, such as an employee manual or internal processing instructions, that you need to change with minimal lag time. By using a wiki, you can also organize collaboration on a multi-participant project, such as a business plan or budget, that needs to be managed across distance and time. {br}

Whatever the purpose of your wiki, you can set it up easily by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_20_05|Wiki] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202005|SM202005]) form, as described below.[anchor|#_2ba242ad-9e58-4329-868c-c28987d29970]
==Before You Proceed==
Before you create a new wiki, you need to plan its use, usually in cooperation with other affected parties. You probably have already considered the most basic questions:[anchor|#_63a515af-8a9c-43a4-b353-2fd796cc741f]
*Who will use the wiki?
*How will these employees use it?
*What kind of information will it contain?
*Who will perform the writing, reviewing, and administering?

Before you begin setting up the wiki, you need to consider other questions as well, including the following: [anchor|#_78af0027-ea6a-4340-b6de-905fcd71e13c]
*What type of articles will the wiki consist of? In Acumatica Wiki, a wiki can consist of basic wiki articles or web pages.
*What categories will the wiki articles be placed into? Categories designate the type of content.
*What products will the wiki articles be applied to?
*What roles will have access rights for approving and publishing the wiki?
*What roles will have access rights for the wiki? What access rights should they have?
*Do you want the system to save versions of articles, either globally or for only particular articles?

Also, you will need to define the style (that is, the look and formatting) that will be used for all articles in the wiki. The style is defined by a file with the <tt>.css</tt> extension. For examples of styles, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Style_Examples|Wiki Style Examples].[anchor|#_0b0e2d90-95b7-4fbb-bbb4-ba6c9bfaf7fa]
==To Add a Wiki==
To create a wiki, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_20_05|Wiki] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202005|SM202005]) form. You can complete the setup of a wiki all at once or in stages, skipping the optional steps. To add a wiki and specify the required settings for it, do the following:[anchor|#_628fa2ed-99a7-433c-b4d1-e34a3cf3e89e]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_20_05|Wiki] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202005|SM202005]) form.
#In the '''ID''' box of the '''General''' section, enter the unique identifier of the wiki, and in the '''Name''' box, enter a name for the wiki.
#In the '''Approval''' section, do the following:
##Use the '''Hold on Edit''' check box to specify whether created articles should have the ''Hold'' status by default: 
##*Clear the check box (the default setting) to have the ''Published'' status assigned to new articles and to published articles each time they are edited, whether or not an article is versioned. 
##*Select the check box to have the ''Hold'' status assigned to new articles as well as to published articles each time they are edited. If the article is versioned, once it is saved with the '''Hold''' check box selected, a new version with the ''Hold'' status is created and the published version is still available to users with ''View Only'' access rights. If the article is not versioned, the published article is overwritten by a new version with the ''Hold'' status and is not available to users with ''View Only'' access rights.
##Use the '''Require Approval''' check box to specify the necessity of the approval of the selected wiki by the approval group:

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[To Add a Wiki You can create new wikis to meet the evolving needs of your organization. You can use                 a wiki to easily share often-used content, such as an employee manual or internal                 processing instructions, that you need to change with minimal lag time. By using a                 wiki, you can also organize collaboration on a multi-participant project, such as a                 business plan or budget, that needs to be managed across distance and time.  Whatever the purpose of your wiki, you can set it up easily by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202005|SM202005]) Wiki (SM202005) form, as described below. Before You Proceed Before you create a new wiki, you need to plan its use, usually in cooperation with other affected parties. You probably have already considered the most basic questions: Who will use the wiki? How will these employees use it? What kind of information will it contain? Who will perform the writing, reviewing, and administering? Before you begin setting up the wiki, you need to consider other questions as well, including the following:  What type of articles will the wiki consist of? In  Acumatica Wiki, a wiki can consist of basic wiki articles or web pages. What categories will the wiki articles be placed into? Categories designate the type of                     content. What products will the wiki articles be applied to? What roles will have access rights for approving and publishing the wiki? What roles will have access rights for the wiki? What access rights should they have? Do you want the system to save versions of articles, either globally or for only particular articles? Also, you will need to define the style (that is, the look and formatting) that will be used for                 all articles in the wiki. The style is defined by a file with the                      .css  extension. For examples of styles, see  Wiki Style Examples. To Add a Wiki To create a wiki, you use the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202005|SM202005]) Wiki (SM202005) form. You can complete the setup of a wiki all at                 once or in stages, skipping the optional steps. To add a wiki and specify the                 required settings for it, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202005|SM202005]) Wiki (SM202005) form. In the  ID  box of the  General                      section, enter the unique identifier of the wiki, and in the                          Name  box, enter a name for the wiki. In the  Approval  section, do the following: Use the  Hold on Edit  check box to specify whether                             created articles should have the  Hold  status by default:  Clear the check box (the default setting) to have the                                          Published  status assigned to new articles and to                                     published articles each time they are edited, whether or not an                                     article is versioned.  Select the check box to have the  Hold  status assigned to                                     new articles as well as to published articles each time they are                                     edited. If the article is versioned, once it is saved with the                                          Hold  check box selected, a new                                     version with the  Hold  status is created and the published                                     version is still available to users with  View Only  access                                     rights. If the article is not versioned, the published article                                     is overwritten by a new version with the  Hold  status and                                     is not available to users with  View Only  access                                     rights. Use the  Require Approval  check box to specify the                             necessity of the approval of the selected wiki by the approval group: Clear the  Require Approval  check box,                                     which is selected by default, if the selected wiki is not                                     subject to approval.  Select the  Require Approval  check box if                                     the selected wiki is subject to approval. In the                                          Approval Group  box, select the wiki                                     approval group, and in the  Approver ID                                      box, select the user in this group who is responsible for                                     approving the articles.  For more information about wiki                                         approvals, see  Wiki Approval Procedures. In the  Modern UI  section, do the following: Select the  Show on Help Dashboard  check box to                             display a card for the selected wiki on the Help dashboard. In the  Sequence  box, specify the whole or decimal                             number that defines the sequential position of the wiki on the Help                                     dashboard. Acumatica ERP doesn't verify the sequence number that you specify for each                                 wiki. We recommend that you use different sequence numbers for                                 different wikis to avoid unexpected results. Optional: In the  Default Article  box, select the                             article to be displayed by default when a user clicks                                  Explore  on the wiki card on the Help                             dashboard. If no article is selected here, the first article of the                             selected wiki is displayed by default.  On the  Wiki Settings  tab, in the                                  Dashboard Description  box, type an                             explanation of the content of the wiki, which will be used on the wiki                             card on the Help dashboard. In the description box, you can enter 255                             characters, but we recommend that you enter no more than 160 characters                             so that your description fits the wiki card displayed on the Help                             dashboard. In the  Classic UI  section, do the following: In the  Site Map Location  box, select the node of                             the site map in which the wiki will be located. In the  Site Map Title  box, type the title of wiki                             on the site map. On the  Wiki Settings  tab, apply the appropriate style                     options for the wiki by doing the following: In the  Style  box of the  Look and                                 Feel  section, select the prepared file with the CSS                             styles intended for displaying the articles of the wiki in a browser. If                             you specify no file, the browser-specific default styles will be                             used. In the  Print Style  box, select the prepared file                             with the CSS styles that define how a printed article of the wiki should                             look. If no file is specified, the browser-specific default styles will                             be used. In the  Article Type  box, select the type of                             articles that will make up the content of the wiki. The following                             options are available:  Article : The basic type of articles. This type of articles may contain various content                 (text, tables, graphics, and links). Usually this type is used for Help                 articles.

Skip the  Template ,  Print                     Template ,  Header , and                          Footer  boxes until you create wiki templates.                          You can apply templates to the wiki only after you create them for the                         selected wiki. For more information, see  To Create a Wiki Template and  To Apply Templates to a Wiki. Optional: In the  Miscellaneous  section of the                          Wiki Settings  tab, do the following: In the  Default Site Map Tag  box, select the tag                             to be used by default for new articles. (This step can be performed                             later, when at least one tag has been created.)  In the  Public Virtual Path  box, specify the web                             address of the wiki on a local website to be used for access outside of                             your local network. On the form toolbar, click  Save  to save the settings                     you've specified for the wiki so far.

This article describes what searches are available in Acumatica Wiki and how to perform the searches. When you search wikis, you can do a quick search or a full-text search. To perform a search, you can use the '''Search''' box (in the navigation pane) and the Search form. {br}

For more information on searching in Acumatica ERP, see [HelpRoot_Interface\Search_Options_and_the_Search_Form|Search].
==To Perform a Quick Search==
When you perform a quick search, the system searches article properties, such as article IDs, categories, names, summaries, and keywords. It does not search the text of articles. ((({S:Hint}For each article, a wiki author can specify a concise summary, an appropriate category (such as ''reference, overview,'' or ''procedure''), and a list of keywords, so that wiki users can quickly find the information they need, even if they do a quick search.
)))
To perform a quick search, do the following: 
#In the navigation pane, in the '''Search''' box, type a word, a part of a word, or a phrase you&rsquo;re searching for.
#Click '''Search'''.
#On the Search form, click '''All Wikis''' to open the [HelpRoot_Interface\SE_00_00_40|Search Form] ([~/?ScreenId=SE000040|SE000040]). On the form, you will see a list of articles in all wikis whose properties contain the search word or phrase you entered in Step 1.
#Optional: Click the '''All Wikis''' arrow and select a wiki to see a list of articles in the selected wiki whose properties contain the search word or phrase you entered in Step 1.
#Optional: If you selected a particular wiki, click '''Advanced''' and then select check boxes for the wiki-specific categories you want the system to search. (This option is unavailable for the '''All Wikis''' scope.)

==To Perform a Full-Text Search==
For a full-text search, the system searches article properties as well as the full text of articles. The full-text search takes longer and may return articles that do not contain the information you hope to find. To ease the process of finding the required information, start by searching for a more specific word or phrase and then search for broader words or phrases if needed. {br}

To perform a full-text search, do the following: 
#In the navigation pane, in the '''Search''' box, type the word, part of a word, or phrase you&rsquo;re searching for.
#Click '''Search'''.
#On the Search form, click '''All Wikis''' to open the [HelpRoot_Interface\SE_00_00_40|Search Form] with the list of articles in all wikis whose properties contain the search word you entered.
#Optional: On the Search form, click the '''All Wikis''' arrow and then select a particular wiki to search within it, or select '''All Wikis''' to again search in all wikis. This step defines the scope of the search.
#Select the '''Full-text search''' check box.
#Optional: If you selected a particular wiki, click '''Advanced''' and then select check boxes for the wiki-specific categories you want the system to search. (This option is unavailable for the '''All Wikis''' scope.)
#Click '''Go''' to start the search.

You can create links to places in the current article, to other articles in the same wiki, and to external websites. These links help users quickly access additional information they might need. 
==To Navigate Within an Article==
With a lengthy article, you might want to give users the ability to quickly navigate within the article. To do this, you first insert anchors to mark the beginnings of sections and other positions in the article to which you want to redirect users. You then insert anchor links, which users can click to easily navigate to the defined anchors. {br}

To define an anchor, do the following:[anchor|#ol_qw1_5d2_lj]
#Open the article.
#On the wiki toolbar, click '''Edit Current Article''' to open the article in the Wiki Editor form.
#Click the place within the article where you want to create the anchor.
#Add the anchor by using the following general syntax:{{{{[Anchor|#<i>AnchorID<i>]
}}}}
#:where ''AnchorID'' is the unique identifier you define for the anchor within the article. It can include any combination of numbers and uppercase and lowercase letters. For example, you can use sequential numbers or abbreviated versions of section names as IDs.

You can create as many anchors as you like in the article, but each ''Anchor ID'' must be unique.{br}

After you have added the anchor, you can insert as many links to the anchor as you need. To insert an anchor link, do the following:[anchor|#ol_xdb_tg2_lj]
#With the article still open in the Wiki Editor form, click the place within the article where you want to add the anchor link.
#Add the anchor link by using the following syntax:{{{{[#<i>AnchorID<i>|<i>LinkText<i>]
}}}}
#:where ''AnchorID'' is the identifier that you defined for the anchor, and ''LinkText'' is the text to be displayed as the link. The user clicks this link to navigate to the anchor.

For example, to enable users to return to the top of the article from a place within the article, create an anchor at the top of an article by adding the following syntax at the beginning of the article: {{{{[Anchor|#Top]
}}}}
Then add the following syntax to the article in the place where you want to create the link to the top of the article: {{{{[#Top|Return to the top]
}}}}
Now, each time users click the {{Return to the top}} link, they navigate to the top of the article.
==To Add Links to Articles and Websites==
You use wiki links to give users the ability to quickly access other articles within the Acumatica ERP instance.{br}

To add a link to another article, do the following: [anchor|#ol_t5w_qgg_lj]
#Open the article to which you want to add the link.
#Open the article for editing. Do one of the following:
#*On the wiki toolbar, click '''Edit Current Article''' to open the entire article in the Wiki Editor form.
#*Click '''Edit''' to the right of the section to which you want to add the link.
#On the formatting toolbar, click '''Link'''. This opens the '''Wiki Link Editor''' dialog box.
#In the '''Wiki Link Editor''' dialog box, specify the link parameters:
#*To configure a link to another article, do the following:
#*#In the Link Type box under the '''Wiki text''' box, select '''Article'''.
#*#In the box to the right of the Link Type box, select the article you want to add a link to.
#*#Optional: In the '''Caption''' box, type the text of the link, which the user will click to navigate to the article.
#*To configure a link to an external web site, do the following:
#*#In the Link Type box under the '''Wiki text''' box, select '''URL'''.
#*#In the box to the right of the Link Type box, type or paste the URL of the external website.
#*#In the '''Caption''' box, type the text of the link.
#Click anywhere in the '''Wiki text''' box to update the link, and then copy the link.
#Click '''OK''' to close the dialog box.
#Click the position in the text where you want the link to be, and then paste the link.
#In the formatting toolbar, click '''Save'''.
#:((({S:Warn}If you opened the article in the Wiki Editor form, alternatively, you can click '''Save''' in the Wiki Editor form toolbar to save your changes and exit the editing mode.
)))
#Check the link displayed in the article by clicking the link text.

In Acumatica Wiki, you use the following basic format for a link:{{{{[ArticleID|LinkText]
}}}}
where ''ArticleID'' is the identifier of the article, and ''LinkText'' is the text of the link. The user clicks on this word or phrase to navigate to the article for which you specify the identifier.{br}

Here are some examples of wiki links: 
*{{[Glossary]}}: This text is displayed as a link.
*{{[Glossary|This is a link to the Glossary]}}: This link is displayed with a custom link text ([HelpRoot_Interface\Glossary|This is a link to the Glossary]); clicking the link opens the Glossary article.
*{{[~/Pages/GL/GL202500.aspx|Chart of Accounts]}}: This link redirects the user to a form in the General Ledger module of Acumatica ERP. 

By using external links, you can redirect users to external websites and mail-to links. Here are some examples of external links:[anchor|#ul_qcl_2ng_lj]
*{{[http://google.com]}}: The system displays this link as a string with the external link icon: [http://google.com/].
*{{[mail@server.com]}}: The system displays this text as a mail-to link: [mail@server.com].
*{{[mail@server.com|Contact us]}}: The system displays this string as a mail-to link with a custom link text: [../UserGuide/mail@server.com|Contact us].

At times, you might want to illustrate the concepts or ideas in an article. To do this, you can import graphics to add them to articles. In the process, you can specify a variety of display options. [anchor|#section_jr1_qbc_tj]
==To Import a Graphic File==
Before you import your file, make sure that the size of your file does not exceed the maximum file size allowed and that the type of file is allowed. You can check the maximum allowable file size and the valid file extensions on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_50|File Upload Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202550|SM202550]) form.{br}

To import a graphic file for an article, do the following: [anchor|#ol_xr1_qbc_tj]
#Open the article to which you want to add the graphic.
#Open the article for editing. Do one of the following:
#*Click '''Edit''' to the right of the section to which you want to add the graphic.
#*On the wiki toolbar, click '''Edit Current Article''' to open the entire article in the Wiki Editor form.
#On the formatting toolbar, click '''Attach File'''.
#:((({S:Warn}Alternatively, if you opened the Wiki Editor form, you can click '''Attach''' on the Wiki Editor form toolbar. This opens the '''File Upload''' dialog box.
)))
#In the '''File Upload''' dialog box, click '''Browse''' to find the file, select the file, and then click '''Upload'''. This opens the '''File Link Editor''' dialog box.
# In the '''File Link Editor''' dialog box, specify the following options:[anchor|#image_bhc_z53_5g][image:UserGuide/Images/Adding_Pictures_Adding_PicturesFile_Link_Editor.gif|popup|File Link Editor Dialog Box|350px]
#*In the '''Type''' box, select one of the following display options: ''Not Set'', ''Thumb'', ''Frame'', or ''Border''.
#*In the '''Alignment''' box, select one of the following alignment options: ''Not Set'', ''Right'', ''Left'', or ''Center''.
#*In the '''Caption''' box, enter the caption for the graphic.
#*In the '''Size''' box, enter the display size (in pixels) of the graphic to be displayed.
#:For more information, see the [[#section_mcz_rys_kj|Customize a Graphic] section of this article.
#Click anywhere in the '''Wiki text''' box to update the link, and then copy the link.
#Click '''OK''' to close the dialog box.
#Click on the position in the text where you want to insert the graphic, and paste the link.
#Click '''Save'''.
#Check the graphic displayed in the article, and correct the options if needed. 

==To Update a Graphic File==
When you need to replace a graphic, do the following: [anchor|#_g3l_2td_rg]
#Open the wiki article with the graphic you want to update.
#Click the '''Edit''' link next to the graphic you want to replace. The system redirects you to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_10|File Maintenance] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202510|SM202510]) form with the file name of the graphic specified in the '''File''' box. The form displays the list of versions of the file. 
#Make sure the file name of the graphic begins with the correct article ID, separated from the graphic file name by a backslash (\). 
#:((({S:Hint}If the article ID has changed, delete the old link and create a new one.
)))
#On the form toolbar, click '''Check Out'''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Upload New Version'''.
#In the '''File Upload''' dialog box, click '''Browse''' and select the graphic you want to upload.
#Make sure the '''Check In''' check box is selected to check in the updated version of the file.
#Click '''Upload'''.

The system uploads the file and adds it to the list of file versions under the original file name (regardless of the name of the uploaded file). By default, the new version of the file will be displayed in the article. [anchor|#section_mcz_rys_kj]
==To Customize a Graphic==
You may need to change how a graphic is justified in the text, scale it, or alter other display options. This section describes the wiki markup syntax you use to customize an graphic.{br}

See below for the most basic syntax for adding a graphic to a wiki article: {{{{[image:<i>File name<i>]
}}}}
where ''File name'' has the following format: {{{{[<i>Article ID<i>\<i>Image file name<i>]
}}}}
For example, the following syntax displays the graphic without borders and a caption: {{{{[image:Graphic\Links.png]
}}}}
 The following graphic corresponds to the markup above: [anchor|#image_rtw_qb3_x3][image:UserGuide/Images/Graphic_without_border_caption.png|popup|File Link Editor Dialog Box|175px]
You use the following complete syntax to add a graphic to a wiki article:{{{{[Image:File name|Type|Location|Caption|Size|Noclick|]
}}}}
Follow these tips when you use these options, which the remainder of this article describes in detail: [anchor|#ul_ymk_3j2_vg]
*List the options in any order.
*Use no additional spaces before, between, or after any pipe sign (|) because spaces can cause errors when the system parses the link.
*Note that if the text between two pipe signs is not a valid option, the system interprets it as a caption.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[To Add a Graphic  At times, you might want to illustrate the concepts or ideas in an article. To do this, you 				can import graphics to add them to articles. In the process, you can specify a 				variety of display options.  To Import a Graphic File Before you import your file, make sure that the size of your file does not exceed the maximum 				file size allowed and that the type of file is allowed. You can check the maximum 				allowable file size and the valid file extensions on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202550|SM202550]) File Upload Preferences (SM202550) form. To import a graphic file for an article, do the following:  Open the article to which you want to add the graphic. Open the article for editing. Do one of the following: Click  Edit  to the right of the section to which 							you want to add the graphic. On the wiki toolbar, click  Edit Current Article  							to open the entire article in the Wiki Editor form. On the formatting toolbar, click  Attach File . Alternatively, if 						you opened the Wiki Editor form, you can click  Attach  						on the Wiki Editor form toolbar. This opens the  File 							Upload  dialog box. In the  File Upload  dialog box, click 						 Browse  to find the file, select the file, and then 					click  Upload . This opens the  File Link 						Editor  dialog box.  In the  File Link Editor  dialog box, specify the following options: File Link Editor Dialog Box In the  Type  box, select one of the following 							display options:  Not Set ,  Thumb ,  Frame , or 								 Border . In the  Alignment  box, select one of the following 							alignment options:  Not Set ,  Right ,  Left , or 								 Center . In the  Caption  box, enter the caption for the 							graphic. In the  Size  box, enter the display size (in 							pixels) of the graphic to be displayed. For more information, see the  Customize a Graphic Customize a Graphic section of this 					article. Click anywhere in the  Wiki text  box to update the link, 					and then copy the link. Click  OK  to close the dialog box. Click on the position in the text where you want to insert the graphic, and 					paste the link. Click  Save . Check the graphic displayed in the article, and correct the options if needed. 				 To Update a Graphic File When you need to replace a graphic, do the following:  Open the wiki article with the graphic you want to update. Click the  Edit  link next to the graphic you want to replace. The 					system redirects you to the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202510|SM202510]) File Maintenance (SM202510) form with the file name of the graphic 					specified in the  File  box. The form displays the list of versions of the 					file.  Make sure the file name of the graphic begins with the correct article ID, separated from 					the graphic file name by a backslash (\).  If the article ID 						has changed, delete the old link and create a new one. On the form toolbar, click  Check Out . On the form toolbar, click  Upload New Version . In the  File Upload  dialog box, click 						 Browse  and select the graphic you want to 					upload. Make sure the  Check In  check box is selected to check in the updated 					version of the file. Click  Upload . The system uploads the file and adds it to the list of file versions under the 				original file name (regardless of the name of the uploaded file). By default, the 				new version of the file will be displayed in the article.  To Customize a Graphic You may need to change how a graphic is justified in the text, scale it, or alter other 				display options. This section describes the wiki markup syntax you use to customize 				an graphic. See below for the most basic syntax for adding a graphic to a wiki article:  [image: File name ] where  File name  has the following format:  [ Article ID \ Image file name ] For example, the following syntax displays the graphic without borders and a caption:  [image:Graphic\Links.png]  The following graphic corresponds to the markup above:  You use the following complete syntax to add a graphic to a wiki article: [Image:File name|Type|Location|Caption|Size|Noclick|] Follow these tips when you use these options, which the remainder of this article describes in 				detail:  List the options in any order. Use no additional spaces before, between, or after any pipe sign (|) because spaces can 					cause errors when the system parses the link. Note that if the text between two pipe signs is not a valid option, the system interprets it 					as a caption. Options Available for Wiki Graphics Option Description Type Specifies the type of the graphic. Use one of the following values:  thumb , 									 frame ,  border,  and  popup . This is an example of the syntax for a thumbnail of a 											graphic:  [image:Adding Pictures\Favorites.GIF|thumb|Favorites] The graphic is scaled down to 180 pixels and has a box 											around it, as shown in the screenshot below. The caption 											provided by the string ( Links ) is shown below the 											graphic and inside the box. Thumbnail of a Graphic  If you click the graphic, the system opens a new blank 											page and displays the graphic at its actual size, as 											shown in the screenshot below. To return to the article, 											click the  Back  button of the browser. Graphic at Actual Size This is an example of the syntax for a graphic with a 											frame around it:  [image:Graphic\Links.png|frame|Links] The system displays the graphic corresponding to the 											above syntax in its original size, with a box (frame) 											around it, as shown in the screenshot below. Notice the 											caption below the graphic and inside the box.  Framed Graphic This is an example of the syntax for a graphic with a 											border:  [image:Graphic\Links.png|Links|border] With the above syntax, the system displays the graphic in 											its original size with no caption, even if one is 											specified. The system adds a border around the graphic, 											as shown in the screenshot below. Graphic with Border This is an example of the syntax for a pop-up graphic:  [image:Graphic\Links.png|popup|150px|Links] The graphic is displayed at the specified size (150 											pixels). Thumbnail of a Pop-up Graphic When you click the graphic, the system opens the graphic 											in its original size in a pop-up dialog box with a dark 											gray background. To return to the article, press 											Esc. Pop-up Graphic Location Defines the horizontal placement of the graphic on the page. Use one of the following 								values:  right ,  left , or  center . By default, the 								system displays graphics left-aligned.  This is an example of the 									syntax for a centered graphic:  [image:Graphic\Links.png|Links|center] Centered Graphic Caption Specifies the tooltip shown when a user points to the graphic. This is an example of 								the syntax for a graphic with the  caption  option: 									 [image:Graphic\Links.png|Links] The 									corresponding image is shown in the screenshot below. 										The  Links  text, interpreted as a caption, is shown 									when you point to the image. Graphic with Caption Size Gives you the ability to scale the graphic in either of the following ways:  To the specified width, with the aspect ratio as in the original graphic: The syntax is 											 N px, where  N  is a number of pixels. To both the specified width and height: The syntax is  N x M px, where 											 N  specifies the number of pixels for the width 										and  M  specifies the number of pixels for the 										height. This is an example of the syntax for a graphic with the specified height and width:  [image:Graphic\Links.png|100x50px|Links] The graphic is scaled down to 100 pixels in width and 50 pixels 									in height, as shown in the screenshot below. Scaled Graphic If you click the scaled graphic, the system opens the graphic in its actual size on a 									blank page. To return to the article, click the  Back  									button of the browser. Graphic at Actual Size NoClick Prohibits the user from displaying the graphic in its actual size. See the following 									example of the syntax for a graphic with the  noclick  									option:  [image:Graphic\Links.png|100px|Links|noclick] The syntax above results in the graphic being scaled down proportionally to 100 pixels in 									width. When you click this graphic, the system does not open the 									graphic in its actual size. Graphic with Noclick Option To Attach Already Imported Files You can easily attach one file to different articles. To attach a file that is already imported into the system, do the following: Open the wiki article with the graphic you want to use. Open the article for editing. Do one of the following: Click  Edit  to the right of the section to where 							the graphic is located. On the wiki toolbar, click  Edit Current Article  							to open the entire article in the Wiki Editor form. Select and copy the image link. Click  Cancel . Open the wiki article where you want to insert the graphic. Open the article for editing. Do one of the following: Click  Edit  to the right of the section to which 							you want to add the graphic. On the wiki toolbar, click  Edit Current Article  							to open the entire article in the Wiki Editor form. On the formatting toolbar, click  Attach 						File . Alternatively, if you opened the Wiki Editor form, 						you can click  Attach File  on the Wiki Editor form 						toolbar. This opens the  File Upload  dialog 						box. In the  File Upload  dialog box, select  Link to 						existing file  option, paste the link into the 						 Existing File  dialog box, and then click 						 Upload . This opens the  File Link 						Editor  dialog box. Follow Steps 5 through 10 of the  Importing Graphic Files Importing Graphic Files procedure.

You can easily build a table by using wiki markup.
==To Understand Table Markup==
See below for descriptions of the basic wiki markup for tables, which you should use at the beginning of a line. [anchor|#table_cp1_5tk_mj]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="21%" ! Markup Element
!width="78%" ! Description
|- 
|  &#0123;|
| The beginning of the table. Table parameters may be defined on the first line.
|- 
|  |+
| The table title (caption) line.
|- 
|  |&#0125;
| The end of the table.
|- 
|  !
| A column heading.
|- 
|  !!
| A column heading separator if headings are all specified on one line.
|- 
|  |
| The beginning of a table cell.
|- 
|  ||
| A cell separator if all cells are specified on one line.
|- 
|  |-
| A table row separator.
|- 
|  width=&ldquo;x%&ldquo;
| Column width, where ''x'' is the predefined width in %. 
Insert the attribute before the column name, with column heading separators on both sides.
|}
==To Define a Simple Table==
 See below for an example of the wiki markup to define a simple table. This example shows all the column headings in one line, separated by {{!!}}, with the row headings ({{1.x}} and {{2.x}}) on separate lines. All cells for each row are listed in one line. {{{{{| 
! X !! x.1 !! x.2
|-
! 1.x
| Cell 1.1 || Cell 1.2
|-
! 2.x
| Cell 2.1 || Cell 2.2
|}
}}}}
If you have long phrases in the cells or in the headings, you can define each cell in a separate line, as shown below. {{{{{|
! X 
! x.1 
! x.2
|-
! 1.x
| Cell 1.1 
| Cell 1.2
|-
! 2.x
| Cell 2.1 
| Cell 2.2
|}
}}}}
 Both of the syntax examples above generate the same table, as shown below.[anchor|#_c4j_zsz_wg][image:UserGuide/Images/Adding_Tables_sample1.png|popup|150px]
 You can use parameters, described in the following sections, to affect how the table looks. 
==To Define Table Borders==
You specify the parameters of the table borders, among other parameters, after the &#0123;| characters that designate the start of the table. See the following examples of the syntax to define table borders: 
*{{border="1"}}: Adds an overall border around the table and borders between the cells.
*{{border="1" style="border: solid 5px #000000;"}}: Adds borders as the previous example does, but makes the outer border black and 5 pixels thick.

Use the syntax below to generate a table with a border around the outside and between cells.{{{{{| border="1" 
! X !! x.1 !! x.2
|-
! 1.x
| Cell 1.1 || Cell 1.2
|-
! 2.x
| Cell 2.1 || Cell 2.2
|}
}}}}[anchor|#_shm_qsz_wg][image:UserGuide/Images/Adding_Tables_sample2.png|popup|150px]
Use the syntax below to generate the table with a thick red border.{{{{{| border="1" style="border: solid 5px Red;"
! X !! x.1 !! x.2
|-
! 1.x
| Cell 1.1 || Cell 1.2
|-
! 2.x
| Cell 2.1 || Cell 2.2
|}
}}}}[anchor|#image_dmn_ck3_x3][image:UserGuide/Images/Adding_Tables_sample3.png|popup|150px]
==To Add Cell Spacing and Padding==
To add space to the cells and between cells, use the ''cellspacing'' and ''cellpadding'' parameters, as shown in the following examples: 
*{{cellspacing="10"}}: The ''cellspacing'' parameter defines space between cells. (The default value is 1 pixel.) When ''cellspacing'' is set to &ldquo;0&ldquo;, as in this example, the borders of the neighboring cells merge into one line.
*{{cellpadding="4"}}: The ''cellpadding'' parameter adds space to the cells, padding them in all directions. This example adds 4 pixels to cell space in each of 4 directions: above, below, right, and left.

Use the following syntax to generate the table (shown below the syntax) with enlarged spacing in the cells and between the cells.{{{{{| cellspacing="10" cellpadding="4" border="1" style="border: solid 1px #000000;"
! X !! x.1 !! x.2
|-
! 1.x
| Cell 1.1 || Cell 1.2
|-
! 2.x
| Cell 2.1 || Cell 2.2
|}
}}}}[anchor|#_dft_msz_wg][image:UserGuide/Images/Adding_Tables_sample4.png|popup|150px]
==To Use Color==
Use the syntax below to generate a table (shown below the syntax) with text color set to brown, background color set to yellow, and enlarged spacing in the cells.{{{{{| cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1" style="color:brown;background-color:yellow;" 
! X !! x.1 !! x.2
|-
! 1.x
| Cell 1.1 || Cell 1.2
|-
! 2.x
| Cell 2.1 || Cell 2.2
|}
}}}}[anchor|#_o3g_1sz_wg][image:UserGuide/Images/Adding_Tables_sample5.png|popup|150px]
Use the syntax below to generate a table with a gray background color for the table heading (shown below the syntax).{{{{{| cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1"
|- style="background-color: #D0D0D0;"
! X !! x.1 !! x.2
|-
! 1.x
| Cell 1.1 || Cell 1.2
|-
! 2.x
| Cell 2.1 || Cell 2.2
|}
}}}}[anchor|#_fxx_prz_wg][image:UserGuide/Images/Adding_Tables_sample6.png|popup|150px]
 You can also add color to the row headings. The following syntax sets the background color of the table heading to black, the text color of the table heading to gray, and the background color of the row headings to a different shade of gray.{{{{{| cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1" style="border: solid 6px Blue;"
|- style="background-color: #000000; color: #CCCCCC;" 
! X !! x.1 !! x.2
|-
| style="background-color: #D0D0D0;" | 1.x
| Cell 1.1 || Cell 1.2
|-
| style="background-color: #D0D0D0;"  | 2.x
| Cell 2.1 || Cell 2.2
|}
}}}}
 The syntax above generates the table below. [anchor|#_o3s_vsz_wg][image:UserGuide/Images/Adding_Tables_sample7.png|popup|150px]]]></column>

|} To Add Cell Spacing and Padding To add space to the cells and between cells, use the  cellspacing  and 					 cellpadding  parameters, as shown in the following examples:  cellspacing="10" : The  cellspacing  parameter defines space 					between cells. (The default value is 1 pixel.) When  cellspacing  is set to 					"0", as in this example, the borders of the neighboring cells merge into one 					line. cellpadding="4" : The  cellpadding  parameter 					adds space to the cells, padding them in all directions. This example adds 4 					pixels to cell space in each of 4 directions: above, below, right, and 					left. Use the following syntax to generate the table (shown below the syntax) with enlarged spacing 				in the cells and between the cells. {| cellspacing="10" cellpadding="4" border="1" style="border: solid 1px #000000;"
! X !! x.1 !! x.2
|-
! 1.x
| Cell 1.1 || Cell 1.2
|-
! 2.x
| Cell 2.1 || Cell 2.2
|} To Use Color Use the syntax below to generate a table (shown below the syntax) with text color set to 				brown, background color set to yellow, and enlarged spacing in the cells. {| cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1" style="color:brown;background-color:yellow;" 
! X !! x.1 !! x.2
|-
! 1.x
| Cell 1.1 || Cell 1.2
|-
! 2.x
| Cell 2.1 || Cell 2.2
|} Use the syntax below to generate a table with a gray background color for the table heading 				(shown below the syntax). {| cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1"
|- style="background-color: #D0D0D0;"
! X !! x.1 !! x.2
|-
! 1.x
| Cell 1.1 || Cell 1.2
|-
! 2.x
| Cell 2.1 || Cell 2.2
|}  You can also add color to the row headings. The following syntax sets the background 				color of the table heading to black, the text color of the table heading to gray, 				and the background color of the row headings to a different shade of gray. {| cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1" style="border: solid 6px Blue;"
|- style="background-color: #000000; color: #CCCCCC;" 
! X !! x.1 !! x.2

When an article is also a folder, the article appears as a node in the wiki tree and may contain articles.
==To Define an Article as a Folder==
You can define a new or existing article as a folder. For more information about creating a new folder—that is, creating an article and defining it as a folder—see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__how_Wiki_Creating_a_New_Article|To Add an Article]. To define an existing article as a folder, do the following: [anchor|#ol_s51_f2z_mj]
#Open the article.
#On the wiki toolbar, click '''Edit''' to open the Wiki Editor form.
#On the '''Content''' tab, select the '''Folder''' check box.
#On the Wiki Editor form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

After you have defined an article as a folder, if you open the article in the Wiki Editor form, you can see the '''Subarticles''' tab. 
==To Add Articles to a Folder==
You can populate a folder with articles by moving existing articles into the folder or by creating new articles in the folder. To move existing articles to the folder, use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_20_10|Wiki Site Map] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202010|SM202010]) form. If you're creating a new article, open the article in the Wiki Editor form, and on the '''Contents''' tab, specify the folder in the '''Parent Folder''' box.
==To Convert a Folder into an Article==
A folder can be converted to an article only if the folder doesn&rsquo;t contain any articles. For more information about moving the articles to another folder, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__how_Wiki_Moving_an_Article_to_Another_Folder|To Move an Article].{br}

To convert a folder into an article, do the following: 
#Open the folder you want to convert.
#On the wiki toolbar, click '''Edit Current Article''' to open the Wiki Editor form.
#On the '''Content''' tab, clear the '''Folder''' check box. 
#On the Wiki Editor form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

Some processes in Acumatica ERP require multiple tasks to be executed to complete the whole process. These include the processes of implementing the Acumatica ERP modules (one-time processes), or business processes performed in different modules, such as closing the financial periods in the modules of the Finance suite (recurrent processes).{br}

The business process scenarios tool gives you the ability to simplify the execution of such complex processes. By using this tool, you can create a scenario that contains the list of tasks required for completing some process. Executing the scenario according to these tasks allows you to control the execution of the whole process.{br}

Each scenario has a hierarchical structure. You can create the tasks and subtasks, and set the order of their execution (if needed), which depends on the system configuration, your enabled features, or your business needs.{br}

While configuring a scenario, you can apply the role-based approach by specifying an access role for each scenario. By using this approach, you can manage an access to every scenario, so that only the users that are granted by this role can access it.{br}

Configuration of a scenario includes the following steps, each of which is described in greater detail below:[anchor|#ol_yzb_2bk_cp]
#Reviewing enabled features
#Creating a scenario
#Adding the tasks to the scenario
{br}{TOC}
==Reviewing Enabled Features==
Before you start adding a scenario, make sure that the features on which the scenario will be based are enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. For more information on Acumatica ERP features, see [HelpRoot_Implement\config_SA_Prep_Instance_for_Implem_Instance_Activation_and_Licensing|Preparing Instance: Activation and Licensing].
==Creating a Scenario==
The first step of configuring a scenario is specifying its general settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\WZ_20_10_00|Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=WZ201000|WZ201000]) form:[anchor|#ul_cdd_123_jp]
*'''Scenario Name''': You should enter any appropriate name, which will be displayed on the Acumatica ERP interface, on the main menu or in the navigation pane (depending on the location, which you define next).
*'''Site Map Location''': You should define the location of the scenario on the site map, where it will be available to users for execution. You can specify any appropriate location, depending on the type of the process to be executed.
*'''Role Name''' (optional): You can limit user access to the scenario by specifying an access role. Only users granted by this role will have access to this scenario. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\User_Roles_Mapref|Configuring User Roles]. If you do not specify an access role, the scenario will be available to all users under the defined site map location.
((({S:Warn}The execution date and execution period will be entered automatically by the system after the first scenario execution.
)))
Then you should save the scenario by clicking '''Save''' on the form toolbar.{br}

After that, you need to add the tasks to the scenario.
==Adding the Tasks to the Scenario==
The second step of configuring a scenario is adding the tasks to the scenario on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\WZ_20_20_00|Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=WZ202000|WZ202000]) form. You can open this form by clicking the scenario name on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\WZ_20_10_00|Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=WZ201000|WZ201000]) form or by navigating to the Tasks (EP404000) form, and then selecting the required scenario in the '''Scenario Name''' box.{br}

To add each task, you need to click '''Add Task''' on the tree pane toolbar, and in the '''Task Summary''' area, specify the task-related settings, which are described in detail below:[anchor|#ul_x5n_shk_cp]
*'''Name''' box: You should enter the task name.
*'''Status''' box: You should leave the default task status. The status of the task will be updated automatically, depending on the actions you perform during task execution or the features enabled in your system. For a detailed description of task statuses, see [HelpRoot_FormReference\WZ_20_20_00|Tasks].
*'''Optional''' check box: You should select this check box if the task you are creating is optional and its completion is not required to complete the whole process. Whether execution of the task is optional depends on the settings made in your system and your business needs. If you select this check box, during scenario execution, the user will be able to skip this task (by clicking '''Skip''' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\WZ_20_15_10|&lt;Scenario Name&gt; - &lt;Task Name&gt;] ([~/?ScreenId=WZ201510|WZ201510]) form). 
*'''Assigned To''' box: You can assign the task to any user for execution, or reassign the task, if needed. 
*:((({S:Warn}You can perform this action after the scenario is already configured and activated in the system (that is, in the beginning of its execution or at any appropriate moment during the process).
)))
*'''Details''' tab: You can add any information that can be useful for task execution, such as instructions or links to help topics.
*'''Screen Details''' tab: You can specify the ID of the form where the task should be executed. In the '''Screen ID''' box, specify the ID of the form that will be opened when a user clicks the '''Go to Screen''' button on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\WZ_20_15_10|&lt;Scenario Name&gt; - &lt;Task Name&gt;] ([~/?ScreenId=WZ201510|WZ201510]) form. You can also specify the import scenario, if the task requires you to automatically upload data (for example, to upload the list of customers). For that, you need to specify the appropriate form ID in the '''Screen ID''' box, and then select the scenario in the '''Import Scenario''' box. In that case, when a user clicks the '''Go to Screen''' button on the task execution form, the system will navigate to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_36|Import by Scenario] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206036|SM206036]) form. For details, see the [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__mng_Configuring_Import_Scenarios|Configuring Import Scenarios].
*:((({S:Warn}You can leave these boxes blank if the task does not involve any form or report for its execution. In that case, the '''Go to Screen''' button will be absent on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\WZ_20_15_10|&lt;Scenario Name&gt; - &lt;Task Name&gt;] ([~/?ScreenId=WZ201510|WZ201510]) form.
)))
*'''Predecessors''' tab: You need to specify the tasks that have to be completed before the execution of the task you are configuring (if any). Specifiyng tasks on this tab is required when the tasks in the scenario have to be performed in a strict order. The task will be available for execution (its status will change to ''Open'') only when the predecessor tasks are completed.
*'''Successors''' tab: Do nothing; the list of tasks (if any) is filled in automatically. These are the tasks that can be performed only after the execution of the task you are currently configuring.
*'''Subtasks''' tab: Do nothing; the list of subtasks (if the task has subtasks) is filled in automatically. If any subtask has the ''Pending'', ''Open'', or ''In Progress'' status, the parent task cannot be completed.
*'''Features''' tab: You need to select the features that have to be enabled in the system for task execution. If the required features are not activated, the task will be marked as ''Disabled'' during activation of the scenario.

After you have added all required tasks, save the scenario by clicking '''Save''' on the form toolbar.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\WZ_20_20_00|Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=WZ202000|WZ202000]) form, you can add, delete, and edit the tasks associated with the scenario.
==Activating a Scenario==
To make a scenario available to users on the defined site map location, you should activate it by clicking the '''Activate Scenario''' button. This button is available on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\WZ_20_10_00|Scenarios] form, the [HelpRoot_FormReference\WZ_20_20_00|Tasks] form, or the screen at the defined site map location.{br}

After activation, all the tasks that do not have predecessors and can be executed right away are marked as ''Open''. The tasks that depend on features that haven&rsquo;t been activated are marked as ''Disabled''. The tasks for which required features are activated but that have uncompleted predecessor tasks are marked as ''Pending''. {br}

You can start scenario execution with any of the ''Open'' tasks. {br}

((({S:Warn}When the scenario is activated, you cannot add new tasks to it, modify the order of tasks, change the list of required features, and edit the list of predecessor tasks.

For more         information on  Acumatica ERP features, see  Preparing Instance: Activation and Licensing. Creating a Scenario The first step of configuring a scenario is specifying its general settings on the   ([~/?ScreenId=WZ201000|WZ201000]) Scenarios (WZ201000) form: Scenario Name : You should enter any appropriate name, which will           be displayed on the  Acumatica ERP interface, on the main menu or in the navigation pane (depending on the location, which           you define next). Site Map Location : You should define the location of the scenario           on the site map, where it will be available to users for execution. You can specify any           appropriate location, depending on the type of the process to be executed. Role Name  (optional): You can limit user access to the scenario           by specifying an access role. Only users granted by this role will have access to this           scenario. For details, see  Configuring User Roles. If you do not specify an           access role, the scenario will be available to all users under the defined site map           location. The execution date and execution period will be entered automatically by the system         after the first scenario execution. Then you should save the scenario by clicking  Save  on the form         toolbar. After that, you need to add the tasks to the scenario. Adding the Tasks to the Scenario The second step of configuring a scenario is adding the tasks to the scenario on the   ([~/?ScreenId=WZ202000|WZ202000]) Tasks (WZ202000) form. You can open this form by clicking the scenario         name on the   ([~/?ScreenId=WZ201000|WZ201000]) Scenarios (WZ201000) form or by navigating to the Tasks         (EP404000) form, and then selecting the required scenario in the  Scenario           Name  box. To add each task, you need to click  Add Task  on the tree pane toolbar,         and in the  Task Summary  area, specify the task-related settings,         which are described in detail below: Name  box: You should enter the task name. Status  box: You should leave the default task status. The status           of the task will be updated automatically, depending on the actions you perform during           task execution or the features enabled in your system. For a detailed description of task           statuses, see   ([~/?ScreenId=WZ202000|WZ202000]) Tasks. Optional  check box: You should select this check box if the task           you are creating is optional and its completion is not required to complete the whole           process. Whether execution of the task is optional depends on the settings made in your           system and your business needs. If you select this check box, during scenario execution,           the user will be able to skip this task (by clicking  Skip  on the               ([~/?ScreenId=WZ201510|WZ201510]) &lt;Scenario Name&gt; - &lt;Task Name&gt; (WZ201510) form).  Assigned To  box: You can assign the task to any user for           execution, or reassign the task, if needed.  You can perform this action after the             scenario is already configured and activated in the system (that is, in the beginning of             its execution or at any appropriate moment during the process). Details  tab: You can add any information that can be useful for           task execution, such as instructions or links to help topics. Screen Details  tab: You can specify the ID of the form where the           task should be executed. In the  Screen ID  box, specify the ID of           the form that will be opened when a user clicks the  Go to Screen            button on the   ([~/?ScreenId=WZ201510|WZ201510]) &lt;Scenario Name&gt; - &lt;Task Name&gt; (WZ201510) form. You can also specify the           import scenario, if the task requires you to automatically upload data (for example, to           upload the list of customers). For that, you need to specify the appropriate form ID in           the  Screen ID  box, and then select the scenario in the              Import Scenario  box. In that case, when a user clicks the              Go to Screen  button on the task execution form, the system will           navigate to the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM206036|SM206036]) Import by Scenario (SM206036) form. For details, see the              Configuring Import Scenarios. You can leave these boxes blank if the task does not involve any form or report             for its execution. In that case, the  Go to Screen  button will be             absent on the   ([~/?ScreenId=WZ201510|WZ201510]) &lt;Scenario Name&gt; - &lt;Task Name&gt; (WZ201510) form. Predecessors  tab: You need to specify the tasks that have to be           completed before the execution of the task you are configuring (if any). Specifiyng tasks           on this tab is required when the tasks in the scenario have to be performed in a strict           order. The task will be available for execution (its status will change to  Open )           only when the predecessor tasks are completed. Successors  tab: Do nothing; the list of tasks (if any) is filled           in automatically. These are the tasks that can be performed only after the execution of           the task you are currently configuring. Subtasks  tab: Do nothing; the list of subtasks (if the task has           subtasks) is filled in automatically. If any subtask has the  Pending ,  Open ,           or  In Progress  status, the parent task cannot be completed. Features  tab: You need to select the features that have to be           enabled in the system for task execution. If the required features are not activated, the           task will be marked as  Disabled  during activation of the scenario. After you have added all required tasks, save the scenario by clicking            Save  on the form toolbar. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=WZ202000|WZ202000]) Tasks (WZ202000) form, you can add, delete, and edit the         tasks associated with the scenario. Activating a Scenario To make a scenario available to users on the defined site map location, you should activate         it by clicking the  Activate Scenario  button. This button is available         on the   ([~/?ScreenId=WZ201000|WZ201000]) Scenarios form, the   ([~/?ScreenId=WZ202000|WZ202000]) Tasks form, or         the screen at the defined site map location. After activation, all the tasks that do not have predecessors and can be executed right         away are marked as  Open . The tasks that depend on features that haven't been         activated are marked as  Disabled . The tasks for which required features are activated         but that have uncompleted predecessor tasks are marked as  Pending .  You can start scenario execution with any of the  Open  tasks.  When the scenario is activated, you cannot add new tasks to it, modify the order of           tasks, change the list of required features, and edit the list of predecessor           tasks. ]]></column>

Scenario execution is managed under the site map location specified during scenario configuration. To execute a scenario, you need to complete the tasks on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\WZ_20_15_00|&lt;Scenario Name&gt;] ([~/?ScreenId=WZ201500|WZ201500]) form. On this form, you can view the list of tasks with their current statuses. The statuses are assigned to the tasks during scenario activation and indicate whether the task is available for execution. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Scenario_Configuration|Scenario Configuration]. {br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\WZ_20_15_00|&lt;Scenario Name&gt;] form, you can view the following lists of tasks by clicking the appropriate tab:[anchor|#ul_vmb_bxj_jp]
*'''All Records''': The list of all tasks included in the scenario
*'''My Tasks''': The list of tasks assigned to you (the currently signed-in user)
*'''Not Completed Tasks''': The list of tasks that are not executed yet

You can start the scenario execution with any of the ''Open'' tasks. When you click the task name, the [HelpRoot_FormReference\WZ_20_15_10|&lt;Scenario Name&gt; - &lt;Task Name&gt;] ([~/?ScreenId=WZ201510|WZ201510]) form opens. This form may contain the following tabs, which are described in more detail below:[anchor|#ul_uj1_whj_jp]
*'''Summary''' tab: Contains the description of the task or the instructions for execution of the task (if it was specified during scenario configuration).
*'''Optional Subtasks''': Contains the list of optional subtasks. This tab is absent if there are no optional subtasks for the selected task. If an optional subtask exists, you can skip it by clicking the '''Skip''' button.
*'''Predecessors''' tab: Contains the list of tasks that have to be completed to make the selected task be available for execution (its status will change to ''Open'')—that is, the tasks on which the selected task depends on. This tab is absent if there are no predecessor tasks for the selected task.
*'''Successors''' tab: Contains the list of tasks that are not available for execution until the current task is completed—that is, the tasks that are blocked by the selected task. This tab is absent if there are no successor tasks for the selected task.
*'''Details''' tab: Contains the task details, such as the task status, the employee ID to whom the task is assigned (if any), the ID of the employee who completed the task, and the start and end dates of task execution.

You should execute the task by using the instructions located on the '''Summary''' tab or by opening the appropriate form specified for task execution. To do this, you should click the '''Go to Screen''' button (if it is available). ((({S:Warn}If the task has subtasks, you should execute the subtasks first, starting with those that have the ''Open'' status. After all subtasks have been completed, you can complete the parent task.
)))
To indicate that the task is in progress, you can click the '''Start Task''' button on the form toolbar. With this, the task status will change from ''Open'' to ''In Progress''.((({S:Warn}This step is not required, but can be convenient if multiple users execute the scenario. It allows the users to find out whether a task is in progress. In other cases, you can complete any ''Open'' task without using the '''Start Task''' button.
)))
If the task or subtask is optional, you can skip it by clicking the '''Skip''' button, and complete the scenario without completing the optional tasks or subtasks.{br}

After you have executed the task, click the '''Mark As Completed''' button. The status of the task will change to ''Completed'', and the successor tasks (if any) will become available for execution. {br}

When you complete all the tasks, the scenario will be marked as ''Completed'' automatically. As a result, the whole multistep process is completed without any tasks beeing overlooked.

With Acumatica ERP, you can schedule the activation of the scenarios that have to be performed on a periodic basis. You can create a schedule for a scenario or multiple scenarios that meets your business needs. A schedule defines how many times and how often specific scenarios should be activated in the system. You can assign multiple scenarios to one schedule, or you can create a separate schedule for each scenario.{br}

The schedules can be run manually or automatically. These approaches are described in greater detail in the following sections of this topic.{br}{TOC}
==Creating a Schedule==
To schedule the activation of the recurring scenarios, you need to create a schedule and specify schedule parameters for the particular scenario or scenarios. The parameters define the periods when the scenarios assigned to the schedule should be activated. {br}

To create a schedule, you should use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\WZ_30_10_00|Recurring Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=WZ301000|WZ301000]) form. On that form, you define the start date and expiration date of using the schedule, or define that it should never expire by selecting the '''Never Expires''' check box. You can also limit the number of schedule execution sessions and set up the frequency of running the schedule. To set up this frequency, you need to select one of the following options:[anchor|#ul_obs_yqc_cp]
*'''Daily''': A scenario should be activated every day or every ''x'' days.
*'''Weekly''': A scenario should be activated every week or every ''x'' weeks, on the selected day or days of the week.
*'''Monthly''': A scenario should be activated once per month or every ''x'' months, on the specified day of the month.
*'''By Financial Period''': A scenario should be activated once per financial period or every ''x'' periods, on the specified day of the period.

After you have defined all the required parameters, you can assign the appropriate scenarios to that schedule. To do that, you need to click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar and add scenarios to the schedule. You then save the schedule.{br}

As a result of this operation, you have created a schedule for the scenario or scenarios activation. To run the schedule, you need to click the '''Run Now''' button. When you run the schedule, the system determines whether it should activate the scenario depending on the business date and the next execution date specified in the schedule. The scenario will not be activated if the next execution date has not occurred yet. Otherwise, the scenario will be activated and the system will update the '''Last Executed''' date in the schedule.{br}

For example, suppose that you schedule the scenario to be activated monthly on the first Tuesday of each month. If you run the schedule the first Tuesday of every month, the scenario will be activated each time. If you run this schedule every day, the scenario will be activated only on the first Tuesday of the month.
==Activating Recurring Scenarios==
If you have multiple scenarios that should be activated according to different schedules, it would be quite difficult to remember to run all these schedules on time. In that case, you can automate the process of running the scenario schedules by creating the automation schedule. According to this schedule, the system will run the scenario schedules automatically.{br}

To create an automation schedule, you should click the '''Schedules''' button on the toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\WZ_50_10_00|Activate Recurring Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=WZ501000|WZ501000]) form, and then click the '''Add''' item in the menu. After that, the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_20|Automation Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=SM205020|SM205020]) form opens. On this form, you should specify the schedule parameters and save the schedule. For details, see the [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Scheduled_Processing|Scheduled Processing] and [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Scheduling_the_Desired_Processing|To Schedule Processing] topics.{br}

For example, suppose that there are two recurring scenarios configured in your system. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\WZ_30_10_00|Recurring Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=WZ301000|WZ301000]) form, you have created the schedules for activation these scenarios. The first scenario has to be activated on the first Monday of every month, and the second one has to be activated on the last Friday of each month. To automate the process of running these schedules, you create an automation schedule by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\WZ_50_10_00|Activate Recurring Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=WZ501000|WZ501000]) form. According to this automation schedule, each scenario schedule will be run automatically, so that the scenarios will also be activated automatically. In our example, the first scenario will be activated every month on the first Monday, and the second scenario will be activated every month on the last Friday.((({S:Warn}Only scenarios with the ''Pending'' or ''Completed'' status can be activated by running the schedule.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Scenario Scheduling With  Acumatica ERP,     you can schedule the activation of the scenarios that have to be performed on a periodic basis.     You can create a schedule for a scenario or multiple scenarios that meets your business needs. A     schedule defines how many times and how often specific scenarios should be activated in the     system. You can assign multiple scenarios to one schedule, or you can create a separate schedule     for each scenario. The schedules can be run manually or automatically. These approaches are described in greater     detail in the following sections of this topic. Creating a Schedule To schedule the activation of the recurring scenarios, you need to create a schedule and     specify schedule parameters for the particular scenario or scenarios. The parameters define the     periods when the scenarios assigned to the schedule should be activated.  To create a schedule, you should use the   ([~/?ScreenId=WZ301000|WZ301000]) Recurring Scenarios (WZ301000) form.     On that form, you define the start date and expiration date of using the schedule, or define     that it should never expire by selecting the  Never Expires  check box. You     can also limit the number of schedule execution sessions and set up the frequency of running the     schedule. To set up this frequency, you need to select one of the following options: Daily : A scenario should be activated every day or every  x       days. Weekly : A scenario should be activated every week or every  x       weeks, on the selected day or days of the week. Monthly : A scenario should be activated once per month or every        x  months, on the specified day of the month. By Financial Period : A scenario should be activated once per      financial period or every  x  periods, on the specified day of the period. After you have defined all the required parameters, you can assign the appropriate scenarios     to that schedule. To do that, you need to click  Add Row  on the table     toolbar and add scenarios to the schedule. You then save the schedule. As a result of this operation, you have created a schedule for the scenario or scenarios     activation. To run the schedule, you need to click the  Run Now  button.     When you run the schedule, the system determines whether it should activate the scenario     depending on the business date and the next execution date specified in the schedule. The     scenario will not be activated if the next execution date has not occurred yet. Otherwise, the     scenario will be activated and the system will update the  Last     Executed  date in the schedule. For example, suppose that you schedule the scenario to be activated monthly on the first     Tuesday of each month. If you run the schedule the first Tuesday of every month, the scenario     will be activated each time. If you run this schedule every day, the scenario will be activated     only on the first Tuesday of the month. Activating Recurring Scenarios If you have multiple scenarios that should be activated according to different schedules, it     would be quite difficult to remember to run all these schedules on time. In that case, you can     automate the process of running the scenario schedules by creating the automation schedule.     According to this schedule, the system will run the scenario schedules automatically. To create an automation schedule, you should click the  Schedules  button     on the toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=WZ501000|WZ501000]) Activate Recurring Scenarios (WZ501000) form, and then click the       Add  item in the menu. After that, the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM205020|SM205020]) Automation Schedules     (SM205020) form opens. On this form, you should specify the schedule parameters and save the     schedule. For details, see the  Scheduled Processing and  To Schedule Processing topics. For example, suppose that there are two recurring scenarios configured in your system. On the        ([~/?ScreenId=WZ301000|WZ301000]) Recurring Scenarios (WZ301000) form, you have created the schedules for     activation these scenarios. The first scenario has to be activated on the first Monday of every     month, and the second one has to be activated on the last Friday of each month. To automate the     process of running these schedules, you create an automation schedule by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=WZ501000|WZ501000]) Activate Recurring Scenarios (WZ501000) form. According to this automation schedule, each     scenario schedule will be run automatically, so that the scenarios will also be activated     automatically. In our example, the first scenario will be activated every month on the first     Monday, and the second scenario will be activated every month on the last Friday. Only scenarios with the  Pending  or  Completed  status can be activated by     running the schedule. ]]></column>

To exclude the reasons that lead to performance slowdown most frequently, you should perform the substeps described in the sections that follow.[anchor|#_36238980-f793-4d0d-8b88-4cbcb9b6077b]
==1. Check Whether the Site Is Licensed==
The slowdown may be caused by the site not being licensed. Sites in trial mode allow only two concurrent users and limit the usage of hardware resources. {br}

If you have already registered the site, it could become unlicensed for the following reasons:[anchor|#_30b48afd-9009-4880-a0ed-9970400458eb]
*A user may be using a URL of an unregistered site—for example, if the user is accessing the site through a bookmark with that URL.
*Some hardware changes have been made to the application server—for example, more CPUs have been added, or the application pools have been changed.
{br}

Perform the following task to check whether the site is licensed.'''To check whether the site is licensed:'''[anchor|#_f9e44184-76ae-47a3-9a7b-6c58183c3edc]
#Check if the site is licensed in one of the following ways:
#*Make sure there is no message in the bottom of the browser window that says ''Your product is in the trial mode. Only two concurrent users are allowed. Activate''. See the message in the following screenshot.
#*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_15_10|Activate License] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201510|SM201510]) form, check the value of the '''Status''' element. An unregistered site has the ''Invalid'' status, as shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_47b6c4ba-82d7-4d0c-9e9f-aabcab40ac9e][image:UserGuide/Images/ActivateLicenseInvalid.png|popup|Invalid license|450px]
#Depending on the results of the previous instruction, do one of the following:
#*If the site is not licensed, activate the license by following the instructions in [HelpRoot_Install\Licensing_Acumatica|Licensing and Activating Acumatica ERP]. 
#*If the site is licensed, continue with the next substep.
[anchor|#_cacf2a39-2ffa-4729-af83-da68d6845964]
==2. Check the Speed from Other Browsers==
Another possible reason for the slowdown is that some properties of the browser may be preventing the site from running faster.{br}

Perform the following task to see whether this is the reason for the slowdown.{br}

'''To check the speed from other browsers:'''[anchor|#_32bf72be-e3af-4daf-879f-994f4c70655d]
#Try to access the site from another browser. 
#Depending on the results of the previous instruction, do one of the following:
#*If the issue is reproduced in only one browser, check the version of the browser, and try to reproduce the issue in the latest version of the browser. You can also try to turn off plug-ins in the browser. Collect more information on the slowdown, and send it to the Acumatica support team, as described in [HelpRoot_Administration\how_Troubleshoot_Performance_Step5|Step 5: Collect More Information] and [HelpRoot_Administration\how_Troubleshoot_Performance_Step6|Step 6: Submit a Case to Acumatica Support].
#*If the issue is reproduced in all browsers, continue with the next substep.
[anchor|#_e8fa44f8-311c-4d2a-a2e2-aabed4a155d5]
==3. Check the Speed from Other Locations==
Some network or internet service provider issues at the user’s end may be causing a performance slowdown.{br}

Perform the following task to see whether this is the reason for the slowdown.{br}

'''To check the speed from other locations:'''[anchor|#_84cfb397-a672-47ea-8e32-a085e8696330]
#Try to reproduce the slowdown issue on some computers at a different location.
#Depending on the results of the previous instruction, do one of the following:
#*If the issue is not reproduced on other computers, the problem is probably in the client’s network. Ask the client to check the network settings.
#*If the issue is reproduced on multiple computers, continue with the next substep.
[anchor|#_3f2ef842-3b6a-4c79-9be7-99cbb953f227]
==4. Check Automation Schedules==
Slowdowns may be caused by errors on active schedules, unprocessed emails, or insufficient time for a scheduled processes to complete before others begin. {br}

Perform the following tasks to check the automation schedules.{br}

'''To look for errors on the active schedules:'''[anchor|#_010e32e3-7a79-434d-9913-a51afa78ca99]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_30|Automation Schedule Statuses] ([~/?ScreenId=SM205030|SM205030]) form, look for errors on the active schedules. (For each schedule, see the '''Status''' and the '''Last Execution Result''' columns.)
#Depending on the results of the previous instruction, do one of the following:
#*If you found an error, either correct the error in the scheduled process or deactivate the schedule.
#*If there are no errors in automation schedules, continue with the next task.
{br}

'''To check the frequency of schedules:'''[anchor|#_c5924f68-8ce4-4494-9ee8-f6cff3492da4]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_30|Automation Schedule Statuses] form, make sure there are no schedules starting at the same time or within short intervals.
#Depending on the results of the previous instruction, do one of the following:
#*If you have found some overlap in the schedules, correct the execution times of any needed schedules. For example, we recommend that you leave at least 5 minutes between executions of the ''Send and Receive Email ''schedule, as shown in the following screenshot. [anchor|#_589132a7-43e1-4e9e-95ee-70c1db0590d1][image:UserGuide/Images/SendAndReceiveEmailSchedule.png|popup|Send and Receive Email schedule|450px]
#*If there is enough time for each process to finish before the start of the next scheduled process, continue with the next task.
{br}

'''To look for failed and old unprocessed emails:'''[anchor|#_485c91e5-155a-45b0-8fb1-fd15f9aabfb9]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CO_40_90_70|All Emails] ([~/?ScreenId=CO409070|CO409070]) form, look for failed and old unprocessed emails.
#Depending on the results of the previous instruction, do one of the following:
#*If you have found failed or old unprocessed emails, delete them.
#*If there are no failed or unprocessed emails, continue with the next substep.
[anchor|#_ba43ed97-9782-4aea-9b48-820b14cfb5fe]
=='''5. Explore the Running Processes'''==
The slowdown could be caused by some process that is hung and is running in an endless loop.{br}

Perform the following tasks to check the running processes.{br}

'''To Check the Running Processes in Acumatica ERP'''{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_15_30|System Monitor] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201530|SM201530]) form, check the list of all ongoing processes for all users as follows:[anchor|#_fa80ebe7-1d2a-4e88-acba-f90143c2a5b5]
#Look for processes that have been going on for a long time (typically you should look for processes running longer than 30 minutes) to see if the process is hung and running in an endless loop.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Step 1: Check the Most Basic Causes To exclude the reasons that lead to performance slowdown most frequently, you should                 perform the substeps described in the sections that follow. 1. Check Whether the Site Is                 Licensed The slowdown may be caused by the site not being licensed. Sites                 in trial mode allow only two concurrent users and limit the usage of hardware                 resources.  If you have already registered the site, it could become                 unlicensed for the following reasons: A user may be using a URL of an unregistered site—for example, if the user                         is accessing the site through a bookmark with that URL. Some hardware changes have been made to the application server—for example,                         more CPUs have been added, or the application pools have been changed. Perform the following task to check whether the site is                 licensed. To check whether the site is licensed: Check if the site is licensed in one of the following ways: Make sure there is no message in the bottom of the browser window that                             says  Your product is in the trial mode. Only two concurrent users are                                 allowed. Activate . See the message in the following                             screenshot. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201510|SM201510]) Activate License (SM201510) form,                             check the value of the  Status  element. An                             unregistered site has the  Invalid  status, as shown in the                             following screenshot. Invalid license Depending on the results of the previous instruction, do one of the                         following: If the site is not licensed, activate the license by following the                             instructions in  Licensing and Activating Acumatica ERP.  If the site is licensed, continue with the next substep. 2. Check the Speed from Other Browsers Another possible reason for the slowdown is that some properties of the browser may                 be preventing the site from running faster. Perform the following task to see whether this is the reason for the slowdown. To check the speed from other browsers: Try to access the site from another browser.  Depending on the results of the previous instruction, do one of the                             following: If the issue is reproduced in only one browser, check the version of                                 the browser, and try to reproduce the issue in the latest version of                                 the browser. You can also try to turn off plug-ins in the browser.                                 Collect more information on the slowdown, and send it to the  Acumatica support team, as described in  Step 5: Collect More Information and  Step 6: Submit a Case to Acumatica Support. If the issue is reproduced in all browsers, continue with the next                                 substep. 3. Check the Speed from Other Locations Some network or internet service provider issues at the user’s end may be causing a                 performance slowdown. Perform the following task to see whether this is the reason for the slowdown. To check the speed from other locations: Try to reproduce the slowdown issue on some computers at a different                         location. Depending on the results of the previous instruction, do one of the                             following: If the issue is not reproduced on other computers, the problem is                                 probably in the client’s network. Ask the client to check the                                 network settings. If the issue is reproduced on multiple computers, continue with the                                 next substep. 4. Check Automation Schedules Slowdowns may be caused by errors on active schedules, unprocessed emails, or                 insufficient time for a scheduled processes to complete before others begin.  Perform the following tasks to check the automation schedules. To look for errors on the active schedules: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM205030|SM205030]) Automation Schedule Statuses (SM205030) form, look                         for errors on the active schedules. (For each schedule, see the                              Status  and the  Last Execution                             Result  columns.) Depending on the results of the previous instruction, do one of the                             following: If you found an error, either correct the error in the scheduled                                 process or deactivate the schedule. If there are no errors in automation schedules, continue with the                                 next task. To check the frequency of schedules: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM205030|SM205030]) Automation Schedule Statuses form, make sure there                         are no schedules starting at the same time or within short intervals. Depending on the results of the previous instruction, do one of the                             following: If you have found some overlap in the schedules, correct the                                 execution times of any needed schedules. For example, we recommend                                 that you leave at least 5 minutes between executions of the  Send                                     and Receive Email  schedule, as shown in the following                                 screenshot.  Send and Receive Email schedule If there is enough time for each process to finish before the start                                 of the next scheduled process, continue with the next task. To look for failed and old unprocessed emails: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CO409070|CO409070]) All Emails (CO409070) form, look                         for failed and old unprocessed emails. Depending on the results of the previous instruction, do one of the                             following: If you have found failed or old unprocessed emails, delete                                 them. If there are no failed or unprocessed emails, continue with the next                                 substep. 5. Explore the Running Processes The slowdown could be caused by some process that is hung and is running in an                 endless loop. Perform the following tasks to check the running processes. To Check the Running Processes in  Acumatica ERPOn the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201530|SM201530]) System Monitor (SM201530) form, check the list                 of all ongoing processes for all users as follows: Look for processes that have been going on for a long time (typically you                         should look for processes running longer than 30 minutes) to see if the                         process is hung and running in an endless loop. Depending on the results of the previous instruction, do the following: If some process is hung, select the process and click                                      Abort  on the form toolbar to end the                                 process, as shown in the following screenshot. If the situation                                 repeats, collect more information on the slowdown and send it to the                                      Acumatica support team, as described in  Step 5: Collect More Information and  Step 6: Submit a Case to Acumatica Support. Abort button If no process is hung, continue with the next task. To check the running processes in the operating system: In Task Manager, review the running processes as follows:  Check the memory consumption of the  w3wp.exe                                          process. Acumatica ERP runs under the  w3wp.exe  process, with the username                                     that is the name of the application pool.  Check whether other processes are executed at the same time and                                 review their memory consumption. Depending on the results of the previous, do one of the following: If  w3wp.exe  is using almost all memory, create a process                                 dump, as described in  If your site is completely non-responsive or extremely                                     slow If your site is completely non-responsive or extremely slow in Step 5. Try to restart the process. If another process takes too much time, either investigate the                                 reasons or end the process.  If memory consumption of the  w3wp.exe  is normal and no other                                 processes are taking too much time or using too much server memory,                                 continue with the next substep. 6. Check Whether Antivirus                     Software Is Blocking Some Functionality of the Site Some settings                 of antivirus software could be preventing the site from working                 normally. Perform the following task to see whether antivirus software is the                 reason for the slowdown. To check whether the antivirus software is blocking                 the site: Check the antivirus logs, and try to turn off the antivirus software, if                     any. Depending on the results of the previous instruction, do one of the                         following: If the antivirus software is blocking the site, change the antivirus                             settings. If the antivirus software is not blocking the site, continue with  Step 2: Investigate Application Server Time and Database Server Time in the Request Profiler . ]]></column>

If correction of Microsoft SQL Server settings does not improve the performance of the site, continue with [[#_370d83b1-6a5c-415a-b461-20adae300041|2. Run Performance Reports].{br}

Perform the following tasks to check Microsoft SQL Server configuration. {br}

'''To ensure that Microsoft SQL Server is not restricted on memory usage:'''{br}

In Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, right-click the database server instance and select '''Properties'''. In the '''Server Properties''' dialog box, click '''Memory'''. Set the value in the '''Maximum server memory (in MB)''' box to 75 to 80 percent of the total physical memory of the server, but leave at least 4 GB available for the operating system. For example, if your server has a total memory of 16 GB, you can set the maximum server memory to 12 GB (which is 75 percent but leaves 4 GB for the operating system).{br}

'''To schedule the weekly maintenance plan:'''{br}

By using the '''Maintenance Wizard''' in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, schedule the following tasks:[anchor|#_04d31a82-1dec-4938-8cd6-d49071029d0c]
*'''Database Integrity Check''': Checks the logical and physical integrity of the database
*'''Rebuild Index''': Helps remove gaps in data pages and eases the data retrieval process 
*'''Shrink Database''': Removes space by moving pages from the end of the file to the front, and then deallocates the excess space back to the file system
*'''Update Statistics''': Internally updates statistical information about tables and indexes used by SQL Query Optimizer during data retrieval requests

You can find more information on creating maintenance plans in [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms189953|https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms189953.aspx].

==2. Run Performance Reports==
Some SQL queries consume too many resources.{br}

To find out the top resource-consuming SQL queries, you should perform either or both of the following tasks. You should collect data on the resource-consuming SQL queries as quickly as possible after a performance slowdown occurs, because information in such reports is updated frequently during the process of server work.{br}

'''To find out the top resource-consuming SQL queries by using a standard report:'''[anchor|#_c4927b68-e955-4a9f-9235-26c7a2ac3283]
#In the '''Object Explorer''' of Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, right-click the server instance, and select '''Reports''' > '''Standard Reports''' > '''Performance - Top Queries by Average CPU Time'''. Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio opens the report.
#Right-click the report, select '''Export''', and select the format of the exported report.
#Send this report, along with other information on the slowdown, to the Acumatica support team. (See the list of information that you should provide to support in [HelpRoot_Administration\how_Troubleshoot_Performance_Step6|Step 6: Submit a Case to Acumatica Support].)

In this topic, you can find general recommendations for optimal performance of a MySQL database and a list of common problems and solutions.{br}

For more detailed information on MySQL settings, see the [https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/|MySQL Reference Manual].{br}{TOC}[anchor|#_9a11de24-75a0-45c2-95a2-5910127a571d]
==General Recommendations==
To optimize the performance of a MySQL database, do the following:[anchor|#_33204a39-4116-4abf-8b7f-0e222dc45a3f]
#Back up the database regularly.
#Change the default values of the parameters in the <tt>my.cnf</tt> file as follows (for numerical parameters, the minimum recommended values are specified, and you should specify values appropriate to your processing load):
##{{max_allowed_packet=10M}}
##:For this parameter, you specify the maximum size of a file that can be stored in the database. It is important that you limit the file size to prevent the database from becoming overfilled with large files.
##{{innodb_buffer_pool_size=256M}}
##:For this parameter, you specify the size of the buffer pool, which should be 70 to 80 percent of the available RAM.
##{{innodb_log_file_size=64M}}
##:For this parameter, you specify the size of the transaction log file for <tt>InnoDB</tt>. Large <tt>InnoDB</tt> transaction logs are crucial for good and stable writing performance, but larger log files mean that the recovery process will be slower if a crash occurs. You should find a balance between a reasonable recovery time and high performance in your system.
##{{innodb_log_buffer_size=16M}}
##:For this parameter, you specify the size of the buffer for the transaction log. <tt>InnoDB</tt> writes the changed data records into its log buffer, which is kept in memory. This buffer saves disk input and output operations for large transactions because it is not necessary for <tt>InnoDB</tt> to write the log of changes to disk before it commits a transaction.
##{{innodb_flush_method=O_DIRECT}}
##:For this parameter, you specify the method MySQL uses to flush files from RAM to a hard drive. When you use the {{O_DIRECT}} flush method, you avoid double buffering and reduce swap pressure, which improves performance.
##{{key_buffer_size=64M}}
##:For this parameter, you specify the amount of RAM you reserve for the database key buffer. This parameter is very important if you use MyISAM tables. You should specify the value of this parameter as 30 to 40 percent of available RAM if you use MyISAM tables exclusively.
##{{read_rnd_buffer_size=1M}}
##:For this parameter, you specify the size of the buffer that the database uses after a sort, when it is reading rows in sorted order. When the database is reading rows from a {{MyISAM}} table in sorted order following a key-sorting operation, the rows are read through this buffer to avoid disk seeks. If you use many queries with {{ORDER BY}}, you can increase this parameter value to improve performance.
##{{query_cache_size=0}}
##:For this parameter, you specify the RAM amount allocated for the query cache. The caching mechanism works ineffectively; therefore, we recommend that the query cache be switched off.
##{{innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=2}}
##:For this parameter, you specify how often the log buffer is flushed on disk. The default value of this parameter is ''1'', which means that each {{UPDATE}} transaction will be flushed to a hard drive and therefore this mode is resource-demanding. When you set this parameter to ''2'', the log buffer is flushed to the OS file cache on every transaction commit, which significantly increases the speed of writing to the database. The drawback of this mode is that the database can lose transactions for the last second or two if OS crashes.

Large  InnoDB                                  transaction logs are crucial for good and stable writing                                 performance, but larger log files mean that the recovery process                                 will be slower if a crash occurs.

InnoDB  writes the changed data records into                                 its log buffer, which is kept in memory. This buffer saves disk                                 input and output operations for large transactions because it is not                                 necessary for  InnoDB  to write the log of                                 changes to disk before it commits a transaction. innodb_flush_method=O_DIRECT For this parameter, you                                 specify the method MySQL uses to flush files from RAM to a hard                                 drive. When you use the  O_DIRECT  flush method, you                                 avoid double buffering and reduce swap pressure, which improves                                 performance. key_buffer_size=64M For this parameter, you specify                                 the amount of RAM you reserve for the database key buffer. This                                 parameter is very important if you use MyISAM tables. You should                                 specify the value of this parameter as 30 to 40 percent of available                                 RAM if you use MyISAM tables exclusively. read_rnd_buffer_size=1M For this parameter, you                                 specify the size of the buffer that the database uses after a sort,                                 when it is reading rows in sorted order.

If you use many queries with                                      ORDER BY , you can increase this parameter value                                 to improve performance. query_cache_size=0 For this parameter, you specify                                 the RAM amount allocated for the query cache. The caching mechanism                                 works ineffectively; therefore, we recommend that the query cache be                                 switched off. innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=2 For this parameter,                                 you specify how often the log buffer is flushed on disk. The default                                 value of this parameter is  1 , which means that each                                      UPDATE  transaction will be flushed to a hard                                 drive and therefore this mode is resource-demanding. When you set                                 this parameter to  2 , the log buffer is flushed to the OS file                                 cache on every transaction commit, which significantly increases the                                 speed of writing to the database. The drawback of this mode is that                                 the database can lose transactions for the last second or two if OS                                 crashes.

==Trace==
The Acumatica ERP trace log is the first place you should look when you face an issue in the application. You can view the trace log by clicking '''Tools''' > '''Trace''' on the form title bar.{br}

When you are working with reports or generic inquiries, the trace log contains relevant SQL statements that you can use for SQL debugging purposes.{br}

By default, the trace log is stored only in the current user session. However, you can also store the trace log in the file system. This possibility is useful when you are dealing with errors that cause Internet Information Services (IIS) to become unresponsive and result in a web server restart.{br}

To make the trace log stored in a file as well as in the current user session, edit the <tt>pxtrace</tt> section of the <tt>web.config</tt> file (which is located in the folder that contains the application instance website) similarly to the code block shown below.{{{{&lt;pxtrace defaultProvider="PXSessionTraceProvider"&gt;
    &lt;providers&gt;
        &lt;remove name="PXSessionTraceProvider" /&gt;
        &lt;add name="PXSessionTraceProvider" type="PX.Data.PXSessionTraceProvider, PX.Data" 
             url="../Frames/Trace.aspx" /&gt;
        &lt;remove name="PXFileTraceProvider" /&gt;
        &lt;add name="PXFileTraceProvider" type="PX.Data.PXFileTraceProvider, PX.Data" 
             file = "C:\Out\AcumaticaTraceInfo.txt" /&gt;
    &lt;/providers&gt;
&lt;/pxtrace&gt;
}}}}
In this case, the log file will be stored in <tt>C:\Out\AcumaticaTraceInfo.txt</tt>. You should create the folder for the log file manually.((({S:Warn}You will have to monitor the size of the log file manually and delete its contents from time to time to avoid excessive growth of the file.
)))
If you prefer to store the trace log only in a file and not in the current user session, edit the <tt>pxtrace</tt> section of the <tt>web.config</tt> file similarly to the code block shown below.{{{{&lt;pxtrace defaultProvider="PXFileTraceProvider"&gt;
    &lt;providers&gt;
        &lt;remove name="PXFileTraceProvider" /&gt;
        &lt;add name="PXFileTraceProvider" type="PX.Data.PXFileTraceProvider, PX.Data" 
             file = "C:\Out\AcumaticaTraceInfo.txt" /&gt;
    &lt;/providers&gt;
&lt;/pxtrace&gt;
}}}}[anchor|#_7462e6fa-d30a-4d53-a65b-364d128602ea]
==First-Chance Exception Log==
 Acumatica ERP has a mechanism for catching and logging all exceptions in the system. You can activate it by editing the appropriate line in the <tt>appSettings</tt> section of the <tt>web.config</tt> file (which is located in the folder that contains the application instance website) to read as follows.{{{{&lt;add key="EnableFirstChanceExceptionsLogging" value="true" /&gt;
}}}}
You can edit the file name for the log in the following line of the same section. (By default, the log will be stored in <tt>&lt;Site&#95;Folder&gt;\App&#95;Data\firstchanceexceptions.log</tt>, where ''&lt;Site&#95;Folder&gt;'' is the path to the folder that contains the application instance website.){{{{&lt;add key="FirstChanceExceptionsLogFileName" value="firstchanceexceptions.log" /&gt;
}}}}((({S:Warn}The first-chance exception log contains records of all exceptions, including those that the system has already caught and handled without issues, so the log file will grow rapidly and may reach an unmanageable size in minutes. Because of this, we recommend that you activate this logging mechanism for only short periods of time. In addition, you may want to erase the contents of the file once the error has been replicated and you have determined the required call stack.
)))
When you are facing a problem of an unknown origin, we recommend that you use this logging mechanism before trying other solutions—that is, you enable the mechanism, replicate the error, disable the mechanism to stop the log file from growing too much, and view the resulting log.[anchor|#_8e4da825-a68e-454f-bccd-7bc584e54a8a]
==Configuration Wizard Logs==
If an error occurs when you are using the Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard or Acumatica Framework                             Configuration Wizard, you can find the details of the error in the corresponding wizard log:[anchor|#_36819958-ff35-4dde-9aaf-a17231ec240c]
* Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard: <tt>&lt;Application&#95;Installation&#95;Folder&gt;\log.txt</tt>
* Acumatica Framework                             Configuration Wizard: <tt>&lt;Framework&#95;Installation&#95;Folder&gt;\log.txt</tt>

In particular, if you are performing an upgrade by using the Acumatica ERP Configuration                             Wizard, the log contains all errors that have occurred during the upgrade, including all failed SQL statements.((({S:Warn}If a log file becomes too large, you can create a backup and delete the file.
)))[anchor|#_9edb70eb-081b-4dfa-a76c-2f2b5a5e7369]
==Maintenance Logs==
In the maintenance logs, you can find details for issues that occur when you perform an upgrade in the Acumatica ERP application. The maintenance logs are stored in the following locations:[anchor|#_29120b3a-7abe-4315-800f-bb17737cfa95]
*The <tt>UPErrors</tt> database table: This table contains all errors that occur during an update of the database performed in the Acumatica ERP application. The table is displayed on the '''Update History''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_35_10|Apply Updates] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203510|SM203510]) form.

==JetBrains dotTrace==
JetBrains dotTrace is a tool for analyzing the performance of your application. In particular, by using this tool, you can view the average running time for the methods in your application.[anchor|#_df009414-950b-45fb-b639-14807e10cb38]
==.NET Memory Profiler==
.NET Memory Profiler is another tool for monitoring and analyzing issues on your server. By using this tool, you can take snapshots of the Acumatica ERP memory and isolate memory leaks.[anchor|#_095a927e-d9fe-4e3b-99a0-38013003f013]
==WinDbg==
WinDbg is a powerful tool that can open and analyze process dump files.{br}

To use WinDbg, you first need to obtain two .dll files from the .NET Framework version installed on the machine where the dump file was created. You then load these files into WinDbg by using the {{.load}} command, and use the {{.symfix}} system command to set the symbol storing path, as shown below.{{{{.load c:\sos\sos.dll
.load c:\sos\mscordacwks.dll
.symfix
}}}}
You can then analyze all objects in the memory by using the following commands:[anchor|#_e9205ac3-87cd-4db2-9020-e680acd5e6a5]
*{{!dumpheap -stat}} (summary for objects of all types)
*{{!dumpheap -type System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection}} (objects of a specific type)
*{{!do 000007feeeca24a0}} (object at a specific address)

By exploring the memory this way, you can obtain the value of each object instance in the current process, which may help you find the reason why the application is not working correctly.]]></column>
