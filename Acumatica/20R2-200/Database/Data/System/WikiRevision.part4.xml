 Acumatica ERP provides a number of predefined sales order types for common processing operations, such as sales with shipment, sales without shipment, sales by cash, sales by check, and customer returns of inventory items. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form, you activate the order types your company will use and make sure they are configured to fit your company's processes.{br}

When you create a new order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, you select the appropriate order type, which determines the information to be entered on the form, the processing operations to be performed for the order to be completed, and the documents to be generated during the order processing.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Activate an order type with the minimum required settings
*Specify optional settings that affect how an order of the type is processed

==Applicable Scenarios==
You configure order types in any of the following cases:[anchor|#_d5d6e791-c6de-47d1-94ef-a6d344c2d011]
*When you initially configure order management in Acumatica ERP, you have to activate at least one order type to be able to create and process sales orders in the system
*When you need to activate any of the predefined order types that are not yet active to support the corresponding business process

==Order Type for Recording Expected Sales==
If you want to track your company&rsquo;s expected future sales, your employees can prepare orders of the ''QT'' type (quotes) that later can be converted to sales orders or canceled if the sale is no longer expected to happen. Quotes can also be used as templates for repeating orders for a particular customer. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_scn_Sale_Quote|Processing Pre-Sale Quotes].
==Order Types for Processing Sales==
 Acumatica ERP provides predefined order types for the processes that are used most frequently in sales. The predefined order types for sales can be divided into two major groups—those that are processed through shipments, and those that are processed directly to invoices without shipments. The need for shipment processing depends on the business requirements of the company. {br}

For an order of order type that requires shipping, you can process a shipment of items with single shipment document, or with multiple partial shipment documents, each of which may be invoiced individually. For shipments, you can print labels with carrier tracking numbers. Also, from the shipment document, you can print the pick list for the warehouse worker (for verification of the shipped and received quantities) and the shipment confirmation for the buyer. {br}

You choose which types of the sales orders to activate and configure depending on the processes established in your company. The following table shows a comparison of predefined order types for sales.[anchor|#_cb99b299-eac0-4b96-91d0-f43d2d374017]

==Order Types for Processing Customer Returns==
 Acumatica ERP provides return order types for the most frequently used return processes, such as return for credit, return for cash, or return for replacement. In the system, sales returns can be processed through a simple workflow, in which you create a return order and then process the invoice directly from the order, or through the full workflow, in which you process the receipt of the returned item, process the shipment of the replacement item, and then prepare the invoice.{br}

You choose which types of return orders to activate and configure depending on your return policies. The following table shows a comparison of the predefined order types for returns of sold goods.[anchor|#_f78242f5-6c17-49d7-9bce-b50c2c7d896d]

|}
==Order Type for Processing Transfers==
In a system with multiple warehouses or multiple warehouse locations, you may need to create and process transfer orders of the ''TR'' order type for goods that are reserved in remote warehouses and need to be moved from one warehouse to another before a sales order can be fulfilled. Also, transfer orders can be generated in the process of replenishment, to move goods from the source warehouse to the destination warehouse. ]]></column>

Large carriers operating over a broad geographical area—such as FedEx, USPS, and UPS—provide shipping solutions to clients with whom they have service agreements. A user can access the carrier&rsquo;s system, enter package details, get actual rates, print authorized labels for shipments, and track the delivery of shipments. If you configure integration with the carrier, your users do not need to enter the same information into both Acumatica ERP and the carrier&rsquo;s system.{br}

The functionality of integrating with carriers is available only if the ''Shipping Carrier Integration'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}{TOC}
==Carrier-Specific Plug-ins and Their Parameters==
Before you configure integration with a carrier, your company should have an account with the carrier and a signed service agreement. For each of the plug-ins, you specify parameters that are specific to the carrier, including the account number and password for authorization with the carrier&rsquo;s system. Such services as ''FedEx SmartPost'' and ''UPS SurePost'' require additional service contracts to be signed with the respective carriers. These services employ the USPS for final delivery of low-weight packages to customers in the residential areas.{br}

To configure integration with a carrier, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_77_00|Carriers] ([~/?ScreenId=CS207700|CS207700]) form. On this form, you specify a name to be used for this carrier in your system, select the appropriate plug-in, and enter the values for the parameters, which are specific to the plug-in you have selected. Some parameters are used for authentication with the carrier's system, while others are used to print carrier labels. All plug-ins include a parameter that can be used if recipient's signature is required to confirm shipments.{br}

 Acumatica ERP provides the following plug-ins for integration with nationwide and worldwide carriers through the carriers&rsquo; APIs: [anchor|#ul_ull_zjy_ls]
*{{PX.ShipEngineCarrier.ShipEngineCarrier}}: For use with the ShipEngine service
*{{PX.UpsCarrier.UpsCarrier}}: For use with UPS
*:((({S:Warn}This plug-in does not support international shipments.
)))
*{{PX.FedExCarrier.FedExCarrier}}: For use with FedEx
*:((({S:Warn}This plug-in does not support international shipments.
)))
*{{PX.StampsCarrier.StampsCarrier}}: For use with USPS
((({S:Hint}Plug-ins for other carriers can be developed on request.
)))
For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Integrate_FedEx|To Set Up Integration with FedEx], [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Integrate_UPS|To Set Up Integration with UPS], [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__how_Integrate_USPS|To Set Up Integration with USPS via Stamps.com], and [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Integrate_ShipEngine|To Set Up Integration with ShipEngine].
== Ship via Codes Based on Carrier Service Methods==
Generally, carriers provide multiple service methods. Each service method has its own rates and time frame for delivery. In Acumatica ERP, for each service method of the integrated carrier to be used by your company, you can define a ship via code by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_75_00|Ship via Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]) form. Then, when a user creates a sales order, the user can easily select the appropriate carrier and its service method by specifying the appropriate ship via code.{br}

You also can specify for each ship via code whether shipment confirmation for each box is required and whether at least one package (box) is required to confirm a shipment. For details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Create_Ship_Via_Codes|To Create Ship via Codes for the Integrated Carrier].
==Use of Customer Accounts with Carriers==
You can set up billing of the customers, rather than your company, for shipping if the customers provide information about their accounts with the carrier. On the '''Customer Accounts''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_77_00|Carriers] ([~/?ScreenId=CS207700|CS207700]) form, create a list of customers with their locations and their accounts with the integrated carrier. Only customers with the '''Active''' check box selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form can be billed by the carrier. For each customer, you can view the list of customer accounts with carriers on the '''Delivery Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form.
==Automatic Packaging ==
For effective integration with carriers, you can configure the system to automatically suggest packaging options for sales orders and then for shipments based on item quantities, weights, or volumes. To use this functionality, you need to enable the ''Automatic Packaging'' feature on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Automated_Shipments|Automatic Packaging for Integrated Carriers].
==Freight Calculation==
Once integration with carriers is configured, the system will be able to automatically evaluate freight cost on shipping the sales orders via integrated carriers. On the '''Shipping Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, for each sales order, you can click the '''Shop for Rates''' button to view the estimated freight costs for the specified packages if they are sent by different methods of the selected carrier available for this particular shipment. You can then select the most appropriate ship via code for this shipment. {br}

The freight that a system calculates for a sales order is approximate. The full freight amount you charge your customers may include not only the freight cost, but also insurance, handling, packaging, and premium freight amounts defined by your shipping terms, which is received from the carrier when a shipment for the sales order is being processed. Thus, the final freight charges calculated for the shipment may differ from those calculated for the sales order. {br}

For details on defining and calculating freight, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\CS__con_Freight_Calculation|Freight Calculation].

To automate the processing of sales orders, you can configure the system to automatically determine the optimal set of boxes for sales orders and for shipments to be sent via the integrated carriers. For detailed instructions on configuring integration with the carriers, refer to [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__CNF_Int_Carriers|Configuring Carriers, Packaging, and Freight ].((({S:Warn}To be able to use the automatic packaging functionality, make sure the ''Automatic Packaging'' feature is enabled on [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.

 The configuration of automatic packaging is described in detail in [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Configure_Automatic_Packaging|To Configure Automatic Packaging].
))){br}{TOC}
==Package Calculation for a Sales Order==
Once the automatic packaging functionality has been configured, you can use it when you prepare a sales order for shipping or create a consolidated shipment. {br}

Because the calculation of packages is resource-intensive, the system calculates packages only when the user requests this calculation. As you are preparing a sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form and adding items, the system calculates the weight and volume of the sales order. Once you specify the shipping information on the '''Shipping Settings''' tab—including the ship via code of the integrated carrier, the shipping terms, and the shipping zone—and save the order, the system determines the set of boxes and the weight and volume of each package. {br}

The system uses an heuristic algorithm (one that is not guarantee to find the best set of boxes, but quickly finds a satisfactory set for these purposes) and the following information to make suggestions about the boxes required for the order:[anchor|#ul_exb_r2x_jm]
*The lists of boxes assigned to each ship via code, with the maximum weight and volume each box can hold and the weight of the box (which must include the weight of any packaging material)
*For each stock item in the order, the quantity in base units, the weight and volume of the base unit of the item, and the option instructing the system how to pack this item

To view carrier charges, you can click the '''Shop for Rates''' button on the '''Shipping Settings''' tab. When you click '''Shop for Rates''', the system performs the following actions:[anchor|#ol_zl3_gg4_lm]
#Sends the information about the calculated packages (box ID, weight, volume, linear dimensions, declared value, and COD) to the carrier system
#Requests rates from the carriers and calculates carrier charges for the order for each ship via code associated with the carrier

 Based on the system&rsquo;s suggestions, you can select the ship via code with lowest cost for the order. {br}

 In some cases, you may need to edit the packages manually. If you select the '''Manual Packaging''' check box, you can adjust information about the boxes and their contents to match the quantities and weights of actual packages. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Manual_Packaging|Manual Packaging of Items]. If you have specified the declared values or changed the COD settings for any packages of the order, selecting the '''Manual Packaging''' option will prevent the system from automatically recalculating these packages and thus resetting the specified values.
==Package Calculation for Consolidated Shipments==
When you initiate a shipment creation for the order, the system recalculates the packages and the carrier charges based on the selected ship via code because there may be insufficient quantities of items listed in the order. Information about particular boxes used for the shipment becomes available for reviewing on the '''Packages''' tab. Packages will not be recalculated if the '''Manual Packaging ''' option has been selected for the order. {br}

You can create shipments for multiple orders by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) form. If multiple orders are consolidated in one shipment, you can recalculate the packages initially determined for sales orders by clicking the '''Refresh Packages''' button on the table toolbar on the '''Packages''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form. Once the set of boxes is determined for the consolidated shipment, you can review and edit this list if needed on the '''Packages''' tab. You can manually specify the declared values and COD amounts for packages if needed.

With integration between Acumatica ERP and carriers, you can initiate printing carrier labels for particular packages (boxes) by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form. If RMA orders are used in your system, you can also print carrier labels for RMA orders. Labels are generated by the carrier services and are received (through the integration between the carrier and Acumatica ERP) as images ready for printing. In Acumatica ERP, labels are printed by using the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\SO_64_50_00|Carrier Labels] ([~/?ScreenId=SO645000|SO645000]) report.((({S:Warn}Any information you type in the '''Custom Ref.

))){br}{TOC}
==Process of Generating Tracking Numbers and Labels==
The general process of generating tracking numbers and labels is the following:[anchor|#_3f4686ec-ef5b-4db2-afdc-5811d563da52]
#A user confirms a shipment in Acumatica ERP.
#The carrier&rsquo;s service generates a tracking number and a label for each package of a shipment and sends this information to Acumatica ERP.
#:Users can view the generated tracking numbers in the '''Tracking Number''' column on the '''Packages''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] form. Labels can be found in the '''Files''' column of each shipment line.
#A user initiates printing labels in Acumatica ERP by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] form, as described in [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Print_Label|To Print a Label].

==Configuration of Label Printing==
To configure the printing of carrier labels, you do the following:[anchor|#_a665623b-d1ad-4a91-a376-db7aa46ee536]
#Register file extensions for labels as described in [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Set_UP_Regular_Printer|To Register the Label File Extension].
#Configure printing in one of the following ways:
#*If you use DeviceHub, configure printing as described in [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__mng_Configuring_DeviceHub_Tool|Configuring Hardware Devices in DeviceHub]. 
#*:In addition, if a carrier you work with uses labels of specific size, you can configure the system so that it uses a particular printer for printing the labels of this carrier.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Carrier Labels and Tracking Numbers With integration between  Acumatica ERP and carriers, you can initiate printing carrier labels for particular packages (boxes) by         using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) form. If RMA orders are         used in your system, you can also print carrier labels for RMA orders. Labels are generated         by the carrier services and are received (through the integration between the carrier and            Acumatica ERP) as images ready for printing. In  Acumatica ERP, labels are printed by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO645000|SO645000]) Carrier Labels (SO645000)         report. Any information you type in the  Custom Ref. Number 1  and            Custom Ref. Number 2  columns on the  Packages          tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments form will be printed on the         labels. Process of Generating Tracking Numbers and Labels The general process of generating tracking numbers and labels is the following: A user confirms a shipment in  Acumatica ERP. The carrier's service generates a tracking number and a label for each package of a           shipment and sends this information to  Acumatica ERP. Users can view the generated tracking numbers in the  Tracking               Number  column on the  Packages  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments form. Labels can be found in the                Files  column of each shipment line. A user initiates printing labels in  Acumatica ERP by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments form, as described in  To Print a Label. Configuration of Label Printing To configure the printing of carrier labels, you do the following: Register file extensions for labels as described in  To Register the Label File Extension. Configure printing in one of the following ways: If you use DeviceHub, configure printing as described in  Configuring Hardware Devices in DeviceHub.  In addition, if a carrier you                 work with uses labels of specific size, you can configure the system so that it uses                 a particular printer for printing the labels of this carrier. These settings are                 specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) User Profile (SM203010) form. For more                 information, see  To Specify Default Printers for Selection. If you do not use DeviceHub, you configure printing as described in  To Set Up the Printing of Carrier Labels on a Thermal Printer. ]]></column>

For thermal printers, the carriers usually provide labels in EPL or ZPL formats. {br}

You can create a batch file for the operating system so that the system sends the label file to the thermal printer once you double-click the label file. To create the batch file, follow the steps in the following sections. 
==To Share a Printer==
Connect the printer to a local network computer by using a USB cable, and turn the printer on. To share the printer on the network, do the following: [anchor|#ul_ynj_hv5_rs]
*For Windows XP: 
*#Open the '''Start''' > '''Printers and Faxes''' window, right-click the thermal printer, and select '''Sharing'''.
*#Select the '''Share this printer''' option, write down the shared printer name (or copy it to the clipboard), and click '''OK''' to close the dialog box.
*For Windows 7: 
*#Open the '''Start''' > '''Devices and Printers''' window, right-click the thermal printer, and select the '''Printer Properties''' option.
*#On the '''Sharing''' tab on the '''Printer Properties''' dialog box, select the '''Share this printer''' option, write down the shared printer name (or copy it to the clipboard), and click '''OK''' to close the dialog box.

==To Prepare a Batch File for Label Printing==
On the computer to which the printer is connected, create the batch file {{PrintLabels.bat}} that will handle the printing. (You can change the suggested batch name if needed.) {br}

If you will use a USB printer, create the file as follows: [anchor|#ol_urj_hv5_rs]
#Open Notepad, and type the following text:{{{{Net use LPT2: \\%ComputerName%\SharedPrinterName
Copy %1 LPT2
Net use LPT2: /Delete

}}}}
#Replace {{<tt>SharedPrinterName</tt>}} with the shared printer&rsquo;s actual name that you wrote down or copied earlier. Do not change <tt>%ComputerName%</tt>; the system will replace it automatically with your computer name.
#Save the file as {{PrintLabels.bat}} to the appropriate location. Make sure that you select ''All Files'' for the '''Save as Type''' action. 

If you will use a network printer, take these steps: [anchor|#ol_rtj_hv5_rs]
#In Notepad, type the following text:{{{{print /d:\\ServerName\PrinterName %1 

}}}}
#Replace {{ServerName}} with the name of your network server.
#Replace {{PrinterName}} with the name of your network thermal printer. 
#Save the file as {{PrintLabels.bat}} to the appropriate location. Make sure that you select ''All Files'' for the '''Save as Type''' action. 

==To Associate the File Extension with the Created Batch File==
You can register the file extension with the Windows operating system as follows: [anchor|#ul_xxj_hv5_rs]
*For Windows XP: 
*#Open '''Start''' > '''Control Panel''' > '''Folder Options''' and select the '''File Types''' tab.
*#Click '''New''' to register the extension of the carrier&rsquo;s file.
*#Select the extension from the list of extensions and click the '''Change''' button under the details section.
*#Select the {{PrintLabels.bat}} batch that you’ve created earlier. 
[anchor|#ul_d1k_hv5_rs]
*For Windows 7: 
*#Click '''Start''' and type '''Index''' in the search text box. On the list of search results, that appears as you type, select '''Indexing Options'''.
*#On the '''Indexing Options''' dialog box, click the '''Advanced''' button.
*#Open the '''File Types''' tab and add the carrier file&rsquo;s extension to the list.
*#Click '''OK''' to save the settings and close the dialog box.
*#Open '''Start''' > '''Default Programs''' > '''Associate a file type or protocol with a specific program''', select the added extension. In the '''Current Default''' columns, select the {{PrintLabels.bat}} batch that you’ve created earlier. 

Connect the printer and load the label stock. Now the system will be able to attach carrier labels to the appropriate lines in the shipment documents.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[To Set Up Integration with FedEx Before you configure integration with FedEx, your organization should have an account                 with the carrier and a signed service agreement. The SmartPost service requires an                 additional service contract signed with FedEx. The settings for the plug-in are                 specified in accordance with the information available in the agreement.  To configure integration between  Acumatica ERP and FedEx—a carrier that provides shipping services nationwide—you use the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS207700|CS207700]) Carriers (CS207700) form. On this form, specify a                 name to be used for this carrier in your system, select the appropriate plug-in                 developed for this integration, and enter the values for the plug-in parameters.                 Some parameters are used for authentication with the carrier's system, while others                 are used for printing carrier labels or enabling recipient notifications.  To Set Up Integration with FedEx Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS207700|CS207700]) Carriers (CS207700) form. In the  Carrier ID  box, type a name for FedEx. Provide a description for this carrier.

To send shipments via different delivery services and carriers, including integrated carriers (UPS, or FedEx), you need to define the types of boxes used by each of the carriers. You can define boxes by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_76_00|Boxes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS207600|CS207600]) form. 
==To Define a Box==[anchor|#ol_hsh_t55_rs]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_76_00|Boxes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS207600|CS207600]) form.
#On the table toolbar, click '''Add Row'''.
#In the '''Box ID''' column, type a unique identifier for the box.
#In the '''Description''' column, specify a description for this box.
#In the '''Box Weight''' column, specify the weight of the box in the selected UOM. 
#In the '''Max. Weight''' column, specify the maximum weight the box can hold.
#In the '''Max Volume''' column, specify the maximum volume that the box can hold.
#If the box will be used for shipping via an integrated carrier, specify the box&rsquo;s '''Length''', '''Width''', and '''Height'''. 
#If the box is used by an integrated carrier, in the '''Carrier&rsquo;s Package''' column, provide the identifier used for this box by the carrier.
#Make sure the '''Active by Default''' check box is selected for the box if boxes of this type are used for shipping by most of the carriers and should appear by default on the list of boxes used for any ship via code on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_75_00|Ship via Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]) form.
#Click '''Save''' on the form toolbar. 

==Notes About the Procedure==[anchor|#_d7faeed8-350d-44f8-b16a-353048e09af5]
The notes in this section describe the nuances of the UI elements available on the form, such as when an element is required and when it is not, and when the system fills in settings by default. This section can include other notes.{br}

Note the following about this procedure:[anchor|#_37fdd7f2-1723-4574-b0ba-ddfd929b017b]
*The measurement system that is used by the integrated carrier is specified in the '''Carrier Units''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_77_00|Carriers] ([~/?ScreenId=CS207700|CS207700]) form. If the linear UOM specified for the carrier differs from the company’s linear UOM specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) form, you must define conversion rules between these units of measure on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) form so that shipping rates can be calculated correctly.
*For boxes to be used for shipping by delivery services that are not integrated carriers, you can specify the linear dimensions (such as width, height,or length) for informational purposes only; the values are not used in any calculations.
*The '''Carrier&rsquo;s Package''' column is displayed only if the ''Shipping Carrier Integration'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.

If you use a set of standard boxes for shipping goods, you can configure the system to suggest boxes for each sales order and shipment based on the packaging options and weights specified for stock items. With Acumatica ERP, you can configure and use the automatic packaging functionality for all the local carriers used by your organization to ship the sales orders. To use the automatic packaging functionality, make sure the ''Automatic Packaging'' feature is enabled on [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}{TOC}
==Package Calculation for a Sales Order==
Once the automatic packaging functionality has been configured, you can use it when you prepare a sales order for shipping or create a consolidated shipment. {br}

Because the calculation of packages is resource-intensive, the system calculates packages only when the user requests this calculation. As you are preparing a sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form and adding items, the system calculates the weight and volume of the sales order. Once you specify the shipping information on the '''Shipping Settings''' tab—including the ship via code, the shipping terms, and the shipping zone—and save the order, the system determines the set of boxes, each package weight, the freight cost, and the freight charges. {br}

The system uses a heuristic algorithm (an algorithm that quickly finds a satisfactory set of boxes, however it does not guarantee that this set is the best one) and the following information to make suggestions about the boxes required for the order:[anchor|#ul_exb_r2x_jm]
*The lists of boxes assigned to each ship via code, with the maximum weight and volume each box can hold and the weight of the box (which must include the weight of any packaging material)
*The quantity of each stock item in base units, the weight and volume of the base unit of the item, and the option instructing the system about how to pack this item
*The quantity of each non-stock item in base units, and the weight and volume of the base unit of the item

You can view the particular packages on the '''Shop for Rates''' dialog box, which opens when you click the '''Shop for Rates''' button on the '''Shipping Settings''' tab. You can review the calculated totals on the '''Totals''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form. If freight for a specific ship via code should be specified manually, you can enter the total freight amount in the '''Freight''' box on the '''Totals''' tab.{br}

 In some cases, you may need to edit the packages manually. If you select the '''Manual Packaging''' check box, you can adjust information about the boxes and their contents to match the quantities and weights of actual packages. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Manual_Packaging|Manual Packaging of Items].
==Automatic Packaging Suggestions for Shipments==
If the automatic packaging is configured, once a shipment is generated for a sales order, the system updates the packages calculated for the order. You can view the suggested minimal set of boxes for a shipment on the''' Packages''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form. For packages that have been suggested automatically (those with ''Auto'' selected in the '''Type''' column on the '''Packages''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form), the system adds the weights of the boxes automatically. If needed, you can manually correct information about packages to match the quantities and weights of the actual packages, or select another box or boxes. {br}

You can create shipments for multiple orders by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) form. If multiple orders are consolidated into one shipment, you can recalculate the packages initially determined for sales orders by clicking the '''Refresh Packages''' button on the table toolbar on the '''Packages''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form. Once the set of boxes is determined for the consolidated shipment, you can review and edit this list if needed on the '''Packages''' tab.

To make sales order processing more effective, you can configure the system to automatically determine the optimal set of boxes for sales orders and for shipments to be sent via carriers, including integrated carriers. {br}

Configuration includes the following major steps.
==Before You Proceed==
Make sure the ''Automatic Packaging'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. 
==1. Create the Weight and Volume UOMs ==
Start by compiling a list of the units of measure used in your system to measure weights and volumes for different stock items that are usually shipped via carriers. {br}

Then make sure that all these UOMs are defined in the system on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) form. If any UOM is not listed among the predefined UOMs, define it. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\UOMs_Implem_Activity|Units of Measure: Implementation Activity].
==2. Specify the Base UOMs to Measure Weights and Volumes==
Decide on the base unit of measure (UOM) to be used for weight and the base unit of measure to be used for volume in your system; for more information, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_BaseWeightVolumeUOMs|Units of Weight and Volume]. After you have created the UOMS that you planned to use as the base UOMs for weights and volumes, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) form to select these UOMs as the base weight and volume UOMs as follows:[anchor|#ol_ipz_z1y_jm]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] form.
#In the '''Weight UOM''' box, specify the UOM to be used to measure the weights of the stock items.
#In the '''Volume UOM''' box, specify the UOM to be used to measure the volumes of the stock items.
#Click '''Save''' on the form toolbar. 

==3. Specify the Rule for Converting the Base UOM to the Carrier UOM for Weight==
If integration with any carrier system is configured in your system, notice the UOM (in the '''UOM''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_77_00|Carriers] ([~/?ScreenId=CS207700|CS207700]) form) selected as the unit that is equal to the UOM specified for the carrier in the '''Carrier Unit of Weight''' box. Make sure that the conversion rules from the base weight UOM to the UOM (which is equal to the carrier unit of weight) are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) form.{br}

For more information on setting up integration with carriers, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Integrate_FedEx|To Set Up Integration with FedEx], and [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Integrate_UPS|To Set Up Integration with UPS].
==4. Define the Boxes to Be Used for Shipping==
To make it possible for the system to make packaging suggestions for sales orders, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_76_00|Boxes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS207600|CS207600]) form, list all the available boxes with their own weights (which may include the weight of all packaging materials) and their capacities for weight and volume. For each box that will be used for the integrated carrier, you must specify the box's linear dimensions (height, width, and length) because dimensions may affect the rates.((({S:Warn}By selecting the carrier&rsquo;s unit of weight, you also select the UOM to be used to specify the linear dimensions (height, width, and length) of boxes used by the carrier. If the carrier uses ''SI Units (Kilogram)'', the UOM for linear dimensions is ''centimeter''; if the carrier uses ''US Units (Pound)'', the UOM is inch. 
))){br}

For carriers that are not integrated with your system, linear dimensions for boxes are optional, and because they can be used for information purposes only, the UOM for measurement can be selected arbitrary. {br}

For details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Define_Carrier_Packages|To Define a Box].
==5. Create Ship via Codes and Assign Boxes==
For each delivery service used by your organization, create a ship via code by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_75_00|Ship via Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]) form, specify the freight calculation method and freight rates, and create a list of boxes on the '''Packages''' tab. The rates of different carriers or different delivery services for boxes of the same capacity may vary significantly, and some services may be available for only packages with specific weights, volumes, or dimensions. For more details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Create_Ship_Via_Codes_NIC|To Create a Ship via Code ].{br}

If your system is integrated with any carrier, also create a ship via code for each service method of each carrier that your organization uses, and assign the boxes. For details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Create_Ship_Via_Codes|To Create Ship via Codes for the Integrated Carrier].
==6. Configure Stock Items for Automatic Packaging ==
For each stock item, on the '''Packaging Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, specify the weight and volume of the base unit and the packaging option that defines how this stock item should be packed:[anchor|#ul_k2f_dfx_jm]
*By quantity, separately from other items 
*By weight, separately from other items
*By weight, not necessarily separately from other items
*By weight and volume, generally with other items
*Manually

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
When you provide delivery service to customers of your organization, you need to calculate the freight price to charge customers. The freight price usually depends on any number of the following factors, most of which affect the freight costs to your company: the shipping rates of the third-party carriers whose services your organization uses, the shipping zones, the weight or volume of goods, and the total amount of the applicable order.{br}

In Acumatica ERP, you can configure the system so that it calculates the freight price automatically on sales documents. Also users can enter the freight price manually for each document. If automatic freight calculation is set up, in most cases, users can still override the automatically calculated freight price on a sales order or shipment.{br}

In this topic, you will read about the calculation of freight costs and prices in Acumatica ERP.{br}{TOC}
==Configuration of Automatic Freight Calculation==
If you want to calculate freight cost and price automatically for particular order types, you do the following:[anchor|#_17a8efcc-c939-4db1-bcd2-e906ec322481]
#You enable automatic freight calculation for each applicable order type by selecting the '''Calculate Freight''' check box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. For shipments of sales orders of this type, this setting applies to only those with the ''Issue'' operation—that is, to only shipments for which ''Issue'' is selected in the '''Operation''' box in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form.
#For shipments of the ''Receipt'' operation (in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] form) shipped via a local carrier, you specify that the freight charges must be calculated and applied to these shipments by selecting the '''Calculate Freight on Returns''' check box for the applicable ship via code on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_75_00|Ship via Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]) form.
#You create shipping settings for each shipping method by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_75_00|Ship via Codes] form. Shipping settings depend on the carrier. For details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Create_Ship_Via_Codes|To Create Ship via Codes for the Integrated Carrier] and [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Create_Ship_Via_Codes_NIC|To Create a Ship via Code ].
#You create shipping terms, which the system will use to calculate freight price depending on the order amount, by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_80_00|Shipping Terms] ([~/?ScreenId=CS208000|CS208000]) form. For details, see [[#_beeed649-3493-45fd-b8f0-6601b2f4f5a1|Freight Price Calculation].
[anchor|#_beeed649-3493-45fd-b8f0-6601b2f4f5a1]
==Freight Price Calculation==
The ship via code specified on a sales order defines the freight cost. To calculate the freight price, the system uses either default shipping terms that can be specified for a customer on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form or shipping terms that you specify manually on the sales order. The freight price may include insurance, handling fees, or line handling fees.{br}

To encourage larger orders, you can configure shipping terms so that customers won&rsquo;t pay freight on orders with total amounts greater than a specified value. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_80_00|Shipping Terms] ([~/?ScreenId=CS208000|CS208000]) form, you can create tiers (or break points) based on shipping amount and specify the lower freight price for larger amounts.{br}

The freight price is calculated similarly for all ship via codes, as shown below.{{{{FreightPrice = (FreightCost * FreightCost% / 100) + 
             (LineTotal x InvoiceAmt% / 100) + 
              ShippingHandling + 
             (NumberOfLines x LineHandling)
}}}}
==Freight Information on Sales Documents==
The first sales document that contains freight information is the sales order. If the sales process in your organization includes shipments, you can edit the freight information on shipments (or leave the information if it is correct for the shipment). An invoice (or multiple invoices) based on a sales order or shipment can contain the freight price copied from the sales order or the shipment. For each shipping term, you can specify which document will provide freight information to an invoice with this shipping term—a sales order or shipment—by selecting the corresponding option in the '''Invoice Freight Price Based On''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_80_00|Shipping Terms] ([~/?ScreenId=CS208000|CS208000]) form.((({S:Warn}The value of the '''Invoice Freight Price Based On''' box on this form cannot be changed for the shipping terms after any order or shipment has been created with these shipping terms.
)))
If the freight price can be determined when the sales order is entered, you can select ''Sales Order'' in this box, so that changes of freight information on any shipment created for this sales order do not influence the freight price on the invoice or invoices for the sales order. If the freight price should instead be defined during shipping, you can select ''Shipment'' as the base document for freight price.
==Freight Cost for Integrated Carriers==
National carriers, such as UPS or FedEx, allow direct access to their automated systems to provide real-time information about rates for their clients. In Acumatica ERP, you can configure integration with these carriers, so they are referred to as ''integrated carriers''. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\CS__con_Integration_with_Carriers|Integration with Carriers].{br}

With integrated carriers, the freight cost is calculated on the carrier&rsquo;s side based on the specified shipping settings and the dimensions and weights of packages. The full freight amount on the shipment is calculated based on the freight charged by the carrier and on the shipping terms that apply to the shipments.{br}

You can compare the freight amounts charged by various carriers by using the '''Shop for Rates''' dialog box, which you open from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form by clicking the '''Shop for Rates''' button on the '''Shipping Settings''' tab. You will be able to see the freight rates offered by all the integrated carriers and select the carrier with the lowest freight amount.{br}

The freight price the customer is charged for goods delivered by an integrated carrier is calculated as a sum of the bill amount for this delivery, the freight price calculated according to shipping terms, and the premium freight price.
==Freight Cost for Local Carriers==
If the goods for a sales order are shipped via a local carrier, the system estimates the freight cost based on the rates defined by the ship via code specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_75_00|Ship via Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]) form. You enter rates for each ship via code based on a local carrier on the '''Freight Rates''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_75_00|Ship via Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]) form. For details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Create_Ship_Via_Codes_NIC|To Create a Ship via Code ].((({S:Warn}The number of decimal places for freight rates is defined by the value in the '''Price/Cost Decimal Places''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) form.
)))
When a user enters a sales order with goods to be shipped by a local carrier, the system estimates the freight cost for the order based on the ship via code—that is, based on the predefined rates you have specified for the carrier. The weight of each order is calculated automatically in the same weight UOM that is specified in the '''Weight UOM''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] form. For details on setting up the weight calculation of a sales order, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Automated_Shipments_NICarriers|Automatic Packaging for Local Carriers].{br}

By default, the currency of the freight is the base currency.{br}

Rates are specified for shipping zones based on the weight of the total shipment and, optionally, the volume. The weight of an order is compared to break points, and the first break point that is less than the order weight determines the freight rate. {br}

The system calculates the freight cost based on the calculation method selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_75_00|Ship via Codes] form for the carrier as follows:
*For the ''Per Unit'' calculation method:{{{{FreightCost = BaseRate + (FreightRate x Weight)
}}}}
*For the ''Net'' calculation method:{{{{FreightCost = BaseRate + FreightRate
}}}}
*:Here, {{FreightRate}} is equal to the rate defined for a specific range of the shipment&rsquo;s weight and volume, as specified on the '''Freight Rates''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_75_00|Ship via Codes] form.

==Manual Entry of Freight Amounts==
You can configure the system so that users can manually enter the freight cost, the freight price, or both of these on a sales order or shipment.{br}

To set up the ability to enter freight cost manually on sales orders, you select ''Manual'' in the '''Calculation Method''' box of the '''Details''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_75_00|Ship via Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]) form for a ship via code of a local carrier. With this setting, you can specify the freight cost manually in the '''Freight Cost''' box on the '''Totals''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form.{br}

As an alternative to creating a ship via code, you can enter a freight price manually in a sales order or shipment. The system preserves the manually entered freight price in the sales order or shipment, and does not recalculate the price if any of the order lines (in particular, the quantities, extended price, or amount) are modified. You can do the following to enter the freight price manually for the particular document type:[anchor|#_164a0437-78b9-4ff7-932a-946de4b0823b]
*Sales order: On the '''Totals''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, you select the '''Override Freight Price''' check box, and in the '''Freight Price''' box, you type the freight price for this sales order.
*Shipment: On the '''Shipping Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form, you select the '''Override Freight Price''' check box, and in the '''Freight Price''' box, you type the freight price for this shipment.

The '''Override Freight Price''' check box is available for documents that meet any of the following conditions:[anchor|#_e45f3877-6385-4f52-9046-0ef2dda33ae2]
*The '''Shipping Terms''' box is empty for the sales order or shipment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] form, respectively.
*''Sales Order'' is specified in the '''Invoice Freight Price Based On''' box on the '''Totals''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form for the sales order.
*''Shipment'' is specified in the '''Invoice Freight Price Based On''' box on the '''Shipping Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] form for the shipment.

==Freight Amount on Partial Shipments==
A sales order can be fulfilled by multiple shipments if the ''Back Order Allowed'' option is selected in the '''Shipping Rule''' box of the '''Shipping Settings''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. With multiple shipments, you can define how the freight amount (that is, the freight price and the premium freight price, if one is specified) should be allocated among shipments by selecting one of the following options in the '''Freight Allocation on Partial Shipping''' box of the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form:[anchor|#_84e22c28-4c29-4ff0-aee7-2ccae3ebca34]
*''Full Amount First Time'' to assign the freight amount to the first shipment created for the order
*''Allocate Proportionally'' to distribute the freight amount among shipments proportionally to partial shipment amounts

==Correction of Freight Price==
If you want to charge a customer for any additional conditions, such as extreme fragility or unusual dimensions, you can enter a premium freight price that the system will add to the order total. The premium freight price is specified for a sales order as a flat amount on the '''Totals''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form.{br}

Sometimes the real cost of freight and handling becomes known only after all shipments have been completed and the actual shipping charges for all packages have been provided by the carrier. With local carriers, the probability of change is higher because the rates used can become obsolete, while integrated carriers provide real-time rates at the time of shipment.{br}

If you need to correct the excessive freight charges that were specified in one of the earlier orders, you can manually adjust the premium freight price in the current order by decreasing it by an adjustment amount or by entering a negative freight amount. If you need to adjust the total freight price in an invoice, you can specify the needed positive or negative value in the '''Premium Freight Price''' column of the shipment line on the '''Freight Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form.((({S:Warn}The order&rsquo;s total amount after you adjust the premium freight price must be greater than zero or, at minimum, equal to zero—otherwise, the invoice that is later generated for the order cannot be released.
)))
==Posting Settings for Freight Amounts==
You can specify the General Ledger accounts that the system uses for posting freight amounts in the settings of the following entities:[anchor|#_2e6b5766-c733-4d2f-aba2-05eb5b0d2b45]
*Order type
*Customer location
*Ship via code

You select the source of the freight account in the '''Use Freight Account From''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. The freight account that you specify on this form in the '''Freight Account''' box is used as the default freight account. If the ''Subaccounts'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the freight subaccount to record freight is generated according to the rule specified in the '''Combine Freight Sub. From''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] form.{br}

If you need to post a freight cost to an expense account, you specify this account in the '''Freight Expense Account''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_75_00|Ship via Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]) form. The freight cost determined for a sales order is not recorded to any expense account until a bill from the carrier is processed. A bill from the carrier may include freight charges for all the sales orders that were shipped by the carrier during a specific time interval (a week, two weeks, or a month). If the bills are created for each ship via code used for shipping, the freight expense account can be manually selected on the appropriate lines of the bill.

For shipments of the  Receipt  operation (in the Summary area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments form) shipped via a local carrier, 					you specify that the freight charges must be calculated and applied to these 					shipments by selecting the  Calculate Freight on Returns  					check box for the applicable ship via code on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]) Ship via Codes (CS207500) form. You create shipping settings for each shipping method by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]) Ship via Codes form. Shipping settings depend on 					the carrier. For details, see  To Create Ship via Codes for the Integrated Carrier 					and  To Create a Ship via Code . You create shipping terms, which the system will use to calculate freight price 					depending on the order amount, by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS208000|CS208000]) Shipping Terms (CS208000) form. For details, see  Freight Price Calculation Freight Price Calculation. Freight Price Calculation The ship via code specified on a sales order defines the freight cost. To calculate 				the freight price, the system uses either default shipping terms that can be 				specified for a customer on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers 				(AR303000) form or shipping terms that you specify manually on the sales order. The 				freight price may include insurance, handling fees, or line handling fees. To encourage larger orders, you can configure shipping terms so that customers won't 				pay freight on orders with total amounts greater than a specified value. On the 					  ([~/?ScreenId=CS208000|CS208000]) Shipping Terms (CS208000) form, you can create 				tiers (or break points) based on shipping amount and specify the lower freight price 				for larger amounts. The freight price is calculated similarly for all ship via codes, as shown below. FreightPrice = (FreightCost * FreightCost% / 100) + 
             (LineTotal x InvoiceAmt% / 100) + 
              ShippingHandling + 
             (NumberOfLines x LineHandling) Freight Information on Sales Documents The first sales document that contains freight information is the sales order. If the sales 				process in your organization includes shipments, you can edit the freight 				information on shipments (or leave the information if it is correct for the 				shipment). An invoice (or multiple invoices) based on a sales order or shipment can 				contain the freight price copied from the sales order or the shipment. For each 				shipping term, you can specify which document will provide freight information to an 				invoice with this shipping term—a sales order or shipment—by selecting the 				corresponding option in the  Invoice Freight Price Based On  				box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS208000|CS208000]) Shipping Terms (CS208000) form. The value of the  Invoice Freight Price Based On  box on this form 				cannot be changed for the shipping terms after any order or shipment has been 				created with these shipping terms. If the freight price can be determined when the sales order is entered, you can select 					 Sales Order  in this box, so that changes of freight information on any 				shipment created for this sales order do not influence the freight price on the 				invoice or invoices for the sales order. If the freight price should instead be 				defined during shipping, you can select  Shipment  as the base document for 				freight price. Freight Cost for Integrated Carriers National carriers, such as UPS or FedEx, allow direct access to their automated systems to 				provide real-time information about rates for their clients. In  Acumatica ERP, you can configure integration with these carriers, so they are referred to as 					 integrated carriers . For more information, see  Integration with Carriers. With integrated carriers, the freight cost is calculated on the carrier's side based on the 				specified shipping settings and the dimensions and weights of packages. The full 				freight amount on the shipment is calculated based on the freight charged by the 				carrier and on the shipping terms that apply to the shipments. You can compare the freight amounts charged by various carriers by using the  Shop 					for Rates  dialog box, which you open from the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form by clicking the 					 Shop for Rates  button on the  Shipping 					Settings  tab. You will be able to see the freight rates offered by 				all the integrated carriers and select the carrier with the lowest freight 				amount. The freight price the customer is charged for goods delivered by an integrated carrier is 				calculated as a sum of the bill amount for this delivery, the freight price 				calculated according to shipping terms, and the premium freight price. Freight Cost for Local Carriers If the goods for a sales order are shipped via a local carrier, the system estimates 				the freight cost based on the rates defined by the ship via code specified on the 					  ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]) Ship via Codes (CS207500) form. You enter rates 				for each ship via code based on a local carrier on the  Freight 					Rates  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]) Ship via Codes 				(CS207500) form. For details, see  To Create a Ship via Code . The number of decimal places for freight rates is defined by the value in the 					 Price/Cost Decimal Places  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) Companies (CS101500) form. When a user enters a sales order with goods to be shipped by a local carrier, the 				system estimates the freight cost for the order based on the ship via code—that is, 				based on the predefined rates you have specified for the carrier. The weight of each 				order is calculated automatically in the same weight UOM that is specified in the 					 Weight UOM  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) Companies 				form. For details on setting up the weight calculation of a sales order, see  Automatic Packaging for Local Carriers. By default, the currency of the freight is the base 				currency. Rates are specified for shipping zones based on the weight of the total shipment and, 				optionally, the volume. The weight of an order is compared to break points, and the 				first break point that is less than the order weight determines the freight rate.  The system calculates the freight cost based on the calculation method selected on 				the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]) Ship via Codes form for the carrier as 				follows: For the  Per Unit  calculation 					method: FreightCost = BaseRate + (FreightRate x Weight) For the  Net  calculation 						method: FreightCost = BaseRate + FreightRate Here, 							 FreightRate  is equal to the rate defined for a specific 						range of the shipment's weight and volume, as specified on the 							 Freight Rates  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]) Ship via Codes form. Manual Entry of Freight Amounts You can configure the system so that users can manually enter the freight cost, the freight 				price, or both of these on a sales order or shipment. To set up the ability to enter freight cost manually on sales orders, you select  Manual  				in the  Calculation Method  box of the 					 Details  tab on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]) Ship via Codes (CS207500) form for a ship via code of a local carrier. With 				this setting, you can specify the freight cost manually in the  Freight 					Cost  box on the  Totals  tab on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form. As an alternative to creating a ship via code, you can enter a freight price manually in a 				sales order or shipment. The system preserves the manually entered freight price in 				the sales order or shipment, and does not recalculate the price if any of the order 				lines (in particular, the quantities, extended price, or amount) are modified. You 				can do the following to enter the freight price manually for the particular document 				type: Sales order: On the  Totals  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, you select the 						 Override Freight Price  check box, and in the 						 Freight Price  box, you type the freight price for 					this sales order. Shipment: On the  Shipping Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) form, you select the 						 Override Freight Price  check box, and in the 						 Freight Price  box, you type the freight price for 					this shipment. The  Override Freight Price  check box is available for 				documents that meet any of the following conditions: The  Shipping Terms  box is empty for the sales order or shipment on 					the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders or   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments form, respectively. Sales Order  is specified in the  Invoice Freight Price Based On  					box on the  Totals  tab of the    ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders form for the sales order. Shipment  is specified in the  Invoice Freight Price Based On  					box on the  Shipping Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments form for the shipment. Freight Amount on Partial Shipments A sales order can be fulfilled by multiple shipments if the  Back Order Allowed  option 				is selected in the  Shipping Rule  box of the 					 Shipping Settings  tab on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form. With multiple shipments, 				you can define how the freight amount (that is, the freight price and the premium 				freight price, if one is specified) should be allocated among shipments by selecting 				one of the following options in the  Freight Allocation on Partial 					Shipping  box of the  General Settings  tab of 				the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences (SO101000) form: Full Amount First Time  to assign the freight amount to the first shipment 					created for the order Allocate Proportionally  to distribute the freight amount among shipments 					proportionally to partial shipment amounts Correction of Freight Price If you want to charge a customer for any additional conditions, such as extreme fragility or 				unusual dimensions, you can enter a premium freight price that the system will add 				to the order total. The premium freight price is specified for a sales order as a 				flat amount on the  Totals  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form. Sometimes the real cost of freight and handling becomes known only after all shipments have 				been completed and the actual shipping charges for all packages have been provided 				by the carrier. With local carriers, the probability of change is higher because the 				rates used can become obsolete, while integrated carriers provide real-time rates at 				the time of shipment. If you need to correct the excessive freight charges that were specified in one of the earlier 				orders, you can manually adjust the premium freight price in the current order by 				decreasing it by an adjustment amount or by entering a negative freight amount. If 				you need to adjust the total freight price in an invoice, you can specify the needed 				positive or negative value in the  Premium Freight Price  				column of the shipment line on the  Freight Details  tab of the 					  ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form. The order's total amount after you adjust the premium freight price must be greater than 				zero or, at minimum, equal to zero—otherwise, the invoice that is later generated 				for the order cannot be released. Posting Settings for Freight Amounts You can specify the General Ledger accounts that the system uses for posting freight amounts 				in the settings of the following entities: Order type Customer location Ship via code You select the source of the freight account in the  Use Freight Account 					From  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form. The 				freight account that you specify on this form in the  Freight 					Account  box is used as the default freight account. If the 					 Subaccounts  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features 				(CS100000) form, the freight subaccount to record freight is generated according to 				the rule specified in the  Combine Freight Sub. From  box on 				the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types form. If you need to post a freight cost to an expense account, you specify this account in the 					 Freight Expense Account  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]) Ship via Codes (CS207500) form. The freight cost determined for a 				sales order is not recorded to any expense account until a bill from the carrier is 				processed. A bill from the carrier may include freight charges for all the sales 				orders that were shipped by the carrier during a specific time interval (a week, two 				weeks, or a month). If the bills are created for each ship via code used for 				shipping, the freight expense account can be manually selected on the appropriate 				lines of the 				bill .  ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500])  ([~/?ScreenId=CS208000|CS208000])  ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) ]]></column>

Most businesses have their own processes of reviewing and approving sales orders. Generally, approval is required for sales performed on credit. In addition to credit checks, which can be set up to be performed automatically for all customers, your organization can configure the approval of specific sales orders—for instance, orders with greater than average amounts or orders that include specific items. {br}

With Acumatica ERP, you can set up as many approvals for specific types of sales orders and invoices as your company&rsquo;s policies require. {br}{TOC}
==Approval Support in the Sales Orders Module==
The functionality of approvals is available only if the ''Approval Workflow'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. If the feature is enabled, approvals can be configured for the following predefined order types: ''CS'', ''CR'', ''IN'', ''SO'', ''SA'', ''CM'', ''TR'', and ''QT''. The order types for which approval can be configured have the '''Supports Approval''' check box selected on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form.((({S:Warn} If custom order types are configured in your system, approval can be configured for orders of the types whose templates use the ''Sales Order'', ''Invoice'', and ''Quote'' automation behaviors. 
)))
If approval is required, when a sales order is taken off hold and saved, the system gives the order the ''Pending Approval'' status and selects an approver for the order, in accordance with the approval map used for approval assignment. Once each of the assigned persons approves the order on either the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) form, the order gets the ''Open'' status. If the approver rejects the order, the order gets the ''Rejected'' status. If the order is then edited and taken off hold, the system assigns it for approval according to the approval map.((({S:Warn}The orders with the ''Pending Approval'' and ''Open'' statuses cannot be edited.
)))
==Configuration of Approval for Sales Orders==
To set up the approval of sales orders, perform the following general steps:[anchor|#ul_fht_4q1_br]
#Identify the employees who will be reviewing sales orders of specific types, and plan the workgroups that will include these employees. Review your organization&rsquo;s hierarchy of workgroups on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_40_61|Company Tree] ([~/?ScreenId=EP204061|EP204061]) form, and add any new workgroups needed for approvals.
#For each type of sales order, define the rules for the assignment of specific orders to specific employees. Assignment can be done unconditionally or can be based on the specific properties of the order. Decide whether a single approval is required or multiple approvals are required; if multiple approvals are required, determine whether they should be performed in parallel or in multiple stages. Specify these rules by using approval maps, which are created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_55_00|Assignment and Approval Maps] ([~/?ScreenId=EP205500|EP205500]) form.
#:((({S:Hint}For each type of sales order for which approval is required, you should configure at least one approval map. If multiple parallel approvals are required for orders of the type, create multiple approval maps. 
)))
#If needed, create email templates to notify approvers about new sales orders pending approval—then once an order has been assigned to a specific employee or multiple employees for approval, the system generates a email or multiple emails (based on the template you created) that will be sent to the employees to notify them about the order pending approval. You can create email templates by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_03|Notification Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=SM204003|SM204003]) form.
{br}

For details on setting up the approval of sales orders, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Set_Up_Approval|To Set Up Approval of Sales Orders].
==General Rules for Configuring Parallel Approvals==
If your company requires multiple independent approvals for a sales order of a specific type, you can configure parallel approvals. In this case, every sales order of the type is approved by multiple employees in any order; the number of required approvals can depend on the document total, specific customer, or particular item. For example, in a small company, suppose that each sales order must be approved by the CEO, CFO, and CTO independently—in this case, you will need three maps, each of which assigns all orders unconditionally to one of these approvers. {br}

In Acumatica ERP, you will need multiple approval maps, developed by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_55_00|Assignment and Approval Maps] form, for each sales order type. For each type, the rules can be very simple if all orders are to be approved by the same persons, or more complicated if the approver is selected based on the properties of the order, such as the total amount or the specific products being sold. For more information on creating an approval map, see [HelpRoot_Organization\EP__con_Assignment_Automation|Managing Assignment and Approval Maps]. 
==Parallel Approval Workflow==
After parallel approval has been configured for a specific type of sales order in your system, an order of the type will be processed as follows: When a user saves a new sales order that has the '''Hold''' check box cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, the system uses all the applicable approval maps to select the appropriate approvers for the order and changes the status of the order to ''Pending Approval''. ((({S:Warn} Orders with the ''Pending Approval'' status cannot be edited. 
))){br}

If email templates are specified on the '''Approval''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form, emails are generated and sent to the employees who have been assigned as approvers.{br}

Each approver may approve or reject the order by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) form. If any approver rejects the order, the system assigns the ''Rejected'' status to the order. Rejected orders cannot be removed from the system; they are kept with the history of approvals. If your organization&rsquo;s policies allow rejected orders to be edited, the orders can be modified. Any modification removes all approval records for this order, and the process of approval starts again once the '''Hold''' check box is cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form. ((({S:Warn}If the system doesn&rsquo;t assign an approver to an order while applying the rules of assignment, the order gets the ''Open'' status. For instance, suppose that you designed an approval map that assigns an approver for orders with amounts greater than $500. If you create an order with an order total of $450, no approver will be assigned to it, and the order will get the ''Open'' status once you take it off hold.
)))
The order gets the ''Open'' status only after all required approvals (those specified on the '''Approval''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] form) have been performed. Open sales orders may be emailed, or printed and mailed, to the customer.
==General Rules for Configuring Multistage Approvals==
If a sales order of a specific type should be approved sequentially by multiple people (perhaps at different levels of the company hierarchy) in your company, you should configure multistage (sequential) approval of orders. ((({S:Warn}To configure multistage approval for orders of a specific type, you need to create only one approval map (which assigns approvers sequentially) and specify this map for orders of the type on the '''Approvals''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] form. 
))){br}

Consider an example of multistage approvals. You might require that all sales orders in your company be approved in the following stages:[anchor|#ul_twm_bzh_1w]
#By a senior accountant (with senior accountants belonging to ''Workgroup1'')
#By the manager of the accounting department (who belongs to ''Workgroup2'')
#For orders above $5000 only, by the CFO (the sole member of ''Workgroup3'')
The assignment rules for multistage approval should be designed so that an order, when it is saved, is assigned to ''Workgroup1'' only if its current approval group is ''none'', to ''Workgroup2'' when its current approval group is ''Workgroup1'', and then to ''Workgroup3'' when its current approval group is ''Workgroup2'' and its amount is greater than $5000. For each approval level, you can add conditions if needed (such as whether this order is from a specific customer or requests a specific item, or the document amount exceeds a specific threshold). {br}

For more details, see [HelpRoot_Organization\AP__How_To_Configure_Multistage_Approvals|To Create an Approval Map for Multistage Approvals]; the process of creating maps for sales orders is similar to that of creating approval maps for purchase orders. 
==Multistage Approval Workflow==
After multistage approval has been configured in your system, an order of the type will be processed as follows: When a user saves a sales order with the '''Hold''' check box cleared, the system applies the specified rules to select the initial approver for the order and changes the status of the order from ''On Hold'' to ''Pending Approval''. Orders with the ''Pending Approval'' status cannot be edited.((({S:Hint}Upon application of the approval map, if an order has not been assigned to anybody, its status changes to ''Open (Approved)''. For instance, if only orders with amounts that exceed a specific threshold should be approved, specify conditions that assign only orders with amounts exceeding this threshold. An order that does not exceed this threshold is given the ''Open'' status. 
)))
 Once the initial approver approves the order, the system assigns the next approver, and so forth. Each of the approvers can view the document at the appropriate stage in the approval process on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) form when the order is assigned to her or him. ((({S:Warn}If an order is first approved by an employee of a workgroup located higher (according to the company tree) than any of the assigned approvers, or by an assigned approver who belongs to an higher group than other approvers, the order is considered as getting all the required approvals at once. 
)))
If any of the approvers rejects the order, the system assigns the ''Rejected'' status to the order and the order will not appear in the lists for other approvals. Rejected orders cannot be removed from the system; they are kept with the history of approvals. If your organization&rsquo;s policies allow editing of the rejected orders, the orders can be modified. Any modification removes all approval records for this order, and the process of approval can be started again from the beginning—assigning approvers. {br}

Once the last approver approves the order, the status of the order changes to ''Open''. Open sales orders may be sent to the customer via email, printing and mailing, or both methods.((({S:Warn}Open orders cannot be edited.
)))

Review your organization's hierarchy           of workgroups on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP204061|EP204061]) Company Tree (EP204061) form, and add any new           workgroups needed for approvals. For each type of sales order, define the rules for the assignment of specific orders           to specific employees. Assignment can be done unconditionally or can be based on the           specific properties of the order. Decide whether a single approval is required or           multiple approvals are required; if multiple approvals are required, determine whether           they should be performed in parallel or in multiple stages. Specify these rules by using           approval maps, which are created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP205500|EP205500]) Assignment and Approval Maps (EP205500)           form. For each type of sales order for which approval is required,             you should configure at least one approval map. If multiple parallel approvals are             required for orders of the type, create multiple approval maps.  If needed, create email templates to notify approvers about new sales orders pending           approval—then once an order has been assigned to a specific employee or multiple           employees for approval, the system generates a email or multiple emails (based on the           template you created) that will be sent to the employees to notify them about the order           pending approval. You can create email templates by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM204003|SM204003]) Notification Templates (SM204003) form. For details on setting up the approval of sales orders, see  To Set Up Approval of Sales Orders. General Rules for Configuring Parallel Approvals If your company requires multiple independent approvals for a sales order of a specific         type, you can configure parallel approvals. In this case, every sales order of the type is         approved by multiple employees in any order; the number of required approvals can depend on         the document total, specific customer, or particular item. For example, in a small company,         suppose that each sales order must be approved by the CEO, CFO, and CTO independently—in         this case, you will need three maps, each of which assigns all orders unconditionally to one         of these approvers.  In  Acumatica ERP, you will need multiple approval maps, developed by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP205500|EP205500]) Assignment and Approval Maps form, for each sales order type. For each type,         the rules can be very simple if all orders are to be approved by the same persons, or more         complicated if the approver is selected based on the properties of the order, such as the         total amount or the specific products being sold. For more information on creating an         approval map, see  Managing Assignment and Approval Maps.  Parallel Approval Workflow After parallel approval has been configured for a specific type of sales order in your         system, an order of the type will be processed as follows: When a user saves a new sales         order that has the  Hold  check box cleared on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders         (SO301000) form, the system uses all the applicable approval maps to select the         appropriate approvers for the order and changes the status of the order to  Pending           Approval .   Orders with the  Pending Approval  status cannot be edited.          If email templates are specified on the  Approval  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences (SO101000) form, emails are generated and sent to the         employees who have been assigned as approvers. Each approver may approve or reject the order by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) Approvals (EP503010) form. If any approver rejects the order, the system assigns         the  Rejected  status to the order. Rejected orders cannot be removed from the system;         they are kept with the history of approvals. If your organization's policies allow rejected         orders to be edited, the orders can be modified. Any modification removes all approval         records for this order, and the process of approval starts again once the  Hold  check         box is cleared on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders form.  If the system doesn't assign an approver to an order while applying the rules of         assignment, the order gets the  Open  status. For instance, suppose that you designed         an approval map that assigns an approver for orders with amounts greater than $500. If you         create an order with an order total of $450, no approver will be assigned to it, and the         order will get the  Open  status once you take it off hold. The order gets the            Open  status only after all required approvals (those specified on the            Approval  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences form) have been performed. Open         sales orders may be emailed, or printed and mailed, to the customer. General Rules for Configuring Multistage Approvals If a sales order of a specific type should be approved sequentially by multiple people         (perhaps at different levels of the company hierarchy) in your company, you should configure         multistage (sequential) approval of orders.  To configure multistage approval for           orders of a specific type, you need to create only one approval map (which assigns           approvers sequentially) and specify this map for orders of the type on the              Approvals  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences form.          Consider an example of multistage approvals. You might require that all sales orders in         your company be approved in the following stages: By a senior accountant (with senior accountants belonging to  Workgroup1 ) By the manager of the accounting department (who belongs to  Workgroup2 ) For orders above $5000 only, by the CFO (the sole member of  Workgroup3 ) The assignment rules for multistage approval should be designed so that an order, when         it is saved, is assigned to  Workgroup1  only if its current approval group is            none , to  Workgroup2  when its current approval group is  Workgroup1 ,         and then to  Workgroup3  when its current approval group is  Workgroup2  and its         amount is greater than $5000. For each approval level, you can add conditions if needed         (such as whether this order is from a specific customer or requests a specific item, or the         document amount exceeds a specific threshold).  For more details, see  To Create an Approval Map for Multistage Approvals; the         process of creating maps for sales orders is similar to that of creating approval maps for         purchase orders.  Multistage Approval Workflow After multistage approval has been configured in your system, an order of the type will be         processed as follows: When a user saves a sales order with the  Hold  check box         cleared, the system applies the specified rules to select the initial approver for the order         and changes the status of the order from  On Hold  to  Pending Approval . Orders         with the  Pending Approval  status cannot be edited. Upon application of the approval map, if an order has not been assigned to         anybody, its status changes to  Open (Approved) . For instance, if only orders with         amounts that exceed a specific threshold should be approved, specify conditions that assign         only orders with amounts exceeding this threshold. An order that does not exceed this         threshold is given the  Open  status.   Once the initial approver approves the order, the system assigns the next approver, and so         forth. Each of the approvers can view the document at the appropriate stage in the approval         process on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) Approvals (EP503010) form when the order         is assigned to her or him.  If an order is first approved by an employee of a workgroup located higher (according to         the company tree) than any of the assigned approvers, or by an assigned approver who belongs         to an higher group than other approvers, the order is considered as getting all the required         approvals at once.  If any of the approvers rejects the order, the system assigns the  Rejected  status to         the order and the order will not appear in the lists for other approvals. Rejected orders         cannot be removed from the system; they are kept with the history of approvals. If your         organization's policies allow editing of the rejected orders, the orders can be modified.         Any modification removes all approval records for this order, and the process of approval         can be started again from the beginning—assigning approvers.  Once the last approver approves the order, the status of the order changes to  Open .         Open sales orders may be sent to the customer via email, printing and mailing, or both         methods. Open orders cannot be edited.  ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000])  ([~/?ScreenId=EP204061|EP204061])  ([~/?ScreenId=EP205500|EP205500]) ]]></column>

==Configuration of Approval for Purchase Orders==
To make it possible to set up the approval of purchase orders, perform the following general steps:[anchor|#ul_fht_4q1_br]
#Identify the employees who will be reviewing purchase orders of specific types, and plan the workgroups that will include these employees. Review the organization&rsquo;s hierarchy of workgroups on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_40_61|Company Tree] ([~/?ScreenId=EP204061|EP204061]) form, and add any new workgroups needed for approvals.
#Do the following for each type of purchase orders (if you will have different rules for different types): 
#*Decide whether a single approval is required or multiple approvals are required; if multiple approvals are required, determine whether they should be performed in parallel or in multiple stages. If multiple parallel approvals are required, you will need to create multiple approval maps.
#*Define the rules for assignment of specific orders to specific employees. Assignment can be done unconditionally or can be based on the specific properties of the order.
#*Specify these rules by using approval maps, which are created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_55_00|Assignment and Approval Maps] ([~/?ScreenId=EP205500|EP205500]) form.
#If needed, create email templates to notify approvers about new orders pending approval—then, once an order has been assigned to a specific employee or multiple employees for approval, the system generates a email or emails (based on such a template) that will be sent to the employees to notify them about the order pending approval. You can create email templates by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_03|Notification Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=SM204003|SM204003]) form.

For details on setting up the approval of purchase orders, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__how_Set_Up_Approval|To Set Up Approval of Purchase Orders].
==General Rules for Configuring Parallel Approvals==
If your company requires multiple independent approvals for a purchase order, you can configure parallel approvals. In this case, every purchase order is approved by multiple employees in any order; the number of required approvals can depend on the document total, specific vendor, or particular item. For example, in a small company, each purchase order might be approved by a buyer, purchasing manager, and CFO independently—in this case you will need three maps, each of which assigns all orders unconditionally to one of these approvers. {br}

In general, you will need multiple approval maps, developed by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_55_00|Assignment and Approval Maps] form, for each purchase order type: ''Normal'', ''Blanket'', and ''Standard''. For each type, the rules can be very simple if all orders are to be approved by the same persons, or more complicated if selection of the approver depends on the properties of the order, such as total amount, number of order lines, or specific products to be purchased. ((({S:Hint}For each order type, you should configure one approval map per required approval.
)))
For details, see [HelpRoot_Organization\AP__How_To_Configure_Parallel_Approvals|To Create Approval Maps for Parallel Approvals].
==Parallel Approval Workflow==
After parallel approval has been configured for a specific type of purchase orders in your system, an order of the type will be processed as follows. When a user saves a new purchase order that has the '''Hold''' check box cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, the system applies all the applicable approval maps to select the appropriate approvers for the order and changes the status of the order to ''Pending Approval''. {br}

If email templates are specified on the '''Approval''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form, emails are generated and sent to the employees who have been assigned as approvers.{br}

Each approver may approve or reject the order by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) form. If any approver rejects the order, the system assigns the ''Rejected'' status to the order. Rejected orders cannot be removed from the system; they are kept with the history of approvals. If your organization&rsquo;s policies allow editing of rejected orders, the orders can be modified. Any modification removes all approval records for this order, and the process of approval starts again once the '''Hold''' check box is cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form. ((({S:Warn}If the system (when applying the rules of assignment) doesn&rsquo;t assign an approver to an order, the order gets the ''Open'' status. For instance, suppose you created an approval map that assigns approver for orders with amounts greater than $500. If you create an order with an order total of $450, no approver will be assigned, and the order will get the ''Open'' status once you take it off hold.
)))
If purchase orders should be approved by multiple persons, order statuses do not indicate whether the orders are approved by some users or not yet approved at all. Once an order is assigned for approval, it has the ''Pending Approval'' status until all approvals have been completed. Detailed information about multiple approvals appears on the '''Approval Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form. The order gets the ''Open'' status only after all required approvals have been received. Open purchase orders may be emailed, or printed and mailed, to the vendor. 
==Configuration of Multistep Approvals==
If in your company a purchase order of a specific type should be approved sequentially by multiple people, you should configure multistage approval of orders. {br}

((({S:Warn}To configure multistep approval for orders of a specific type, you need to create only one approval map (which would assign approvers in multiple stages) and specify this map for orders of this type on the '''Approvals''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] form. 
))){br}

Consider an example of multistep approvals. You might require that all purchase orders in your company be approved by a buyer (a member of the Buyer Workgroup), then the orders should be approved by the purchase manager (who belongs to Purchase Manager Workgroup), and that the orders above $5000 then be signed by the CFO (the sole member of CFO). The assignment rules for multistage approval should be designed in such a way that an order, when it is saved, is assigned to ''Buyer '' workgroup only if its current approval group is ''none'', to ''Purchase Manager'' workgroup when its current approval group is ''Buyer'', and to the ''CFO'' workgroup when its current approval group is ''Purchase Manager'' and only if the order total is greater than $5000. For each approval level, you can add as many level-specific conditions as needed (such as whether the order amount exceeds specific threshold amount or whether the order lists specific items).{br}

For details, see [HelpRoot_Organization\AP__How_To_Configure_Multistage_Approvals|To Create an Approval Map for Multistage Approvals].
==Multistep Approval Workflow==
After multistep approval has been configured in your system, an order of the type will be processed as follows: When a user saves a purchase order with the '''Hold''' check box cleared, the system applies the specified rules to select the initial approver for the order and changes the status of the order from ''On Hold'' to ''Pending Approval''. ((({S:Hint}Upon approval map application, if an order has not been assigned to anybody, its status changes to ''Approved''. For instance, if only orders with amounts that exceed a specific threshold should be approved, specify conditions that assign only orders with amounts exceeding this threshold.
)))
 Once the initial approver approves the order, the system assigns the next approver, and so forth. Each of the approvers will be able to view the document at the appropriate time (upon assignment to the first approver, or after the previous approval for subsequent approvals) by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) form. ((({S:Warn}If an order is first approved by an employee of a workgroup located higher (according to the company tree) than any of the assigned approvers, or by an assigned approver who belongs to an higher group than other approvers, the order gets all the required approvals at once. 
)))
If any of the approvers rejects the order, the system assigns the ''Rejected'' status to the order. Rejected orders cannot be removed from the system because they are kept with the history of approvals. If your organization&rsquo;s policies allow editing of the rejected orders, the orders can be modified. Any modification removes all approval records for this order, and the process of approval can be started again from the lowest level. {br}

Once the last approver approves the order, the status of the order changes to ''Open''. Open purchase orders may be emailed, or printed and sent to the vendor by mail. 
==Approval Escalation==
Every workgroup has a ''wait time'' specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_40_61|Company Tree] ([~/?ScreenId=EP204061|EP204061]) form. If a document assigned to a specific workgroup for approval is not approved by any user of the workgroup during the group's wait time, then the document becomes escalated—visible to the group that is one level or multiple levels up in the company tree—and any user from this higher-level workgroup can review the document and approve or reject it. If an order that should be approved by multiple approvers in a multistage approval process has been approved only by an approver from the highest-level workgroup (specified for this approval process), the order gets the ''Open'' status and other approvals become unnecessary. {br}

For some groups on the company tree, you can specify whether escalation bypasses them.

For many businesses, approval of sales orders is required for sales performed on credit. You can set up approval for sales orders by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form.
==Before You Proceed==
Before you can set up the approval of sales orders, make sure the following steps are completed in your system:[anchor|#ul_fht_4q1_br]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form, make sure that the '''Supports Approval''' check box is selected for each order type for which you want to set up the approval of orders. 
#Review the organization&rsquo;s hierarchy of workgroups on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_40_61|Company Tree] ([~/?ScreenId=EP204061|EP204061]) form, and add new groups whose members are authorized to approve sales orders, if needed. 
#: Select the employee who will be the ''default owner'' of each workgroup—the member of the group to whom the documents will be assigned for approval by default. A group may include only one default owner.
#By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_55_00|Assignment and Approval Maps] ([~/?ScreenId=EP205500|EP205500]) form, create the approval maps that will be used to determine the employee or employees who should approve an order of a specific type with specific properties. For details on configuring approval maps, see [HelpRoot_Organization\AP__How_To_Configure_Parallel_Approvals|To Create Approval Maps for Parallel Approvals] and [HelpRoot_Organization\AP__How_To_Configure_Multistage_Approvals|To Create an Approval Map for Multistage Approvals]. 
#:((({S:Hint}For each type of sales orders for which approval is required, you should configure at least one approval map. If multiple parallel approvals are required, create an approval map for each required approval.
)))
#For each order type, create email templates for notifications about orders pending approval. These emails will be sent to employees authorized to approve sales orders of a specific type. You can create email templates by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_03|Notification Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=SM204003|SM204003]) form.

==To Set Up Approval ==[anchor|#ol_rhd_5qb_jr]

#On the '''Approval''' tab of this form, select the '''Require Approval''' check box. 
#For each order type for which you need to configure approval, add an approval map as follows:
##Click '''Add Row''' in the table.
##In the '''SO Type''' column, select the type of sales orders that requires approval.
##In the '''Approval Map''' column, select the approval map to be used for orders of the selected type.
##In the '''Pending Approval Notification''' column, select the email template you created for generating emails about orders of this type pending approval.
#If multiple parallel approvals are required for orders of the specific type, repeat Step 3 for each of the approval maps.
#Click '''Save''' on the form toolbar.

If in your company sales orders of specific type must be approved, you can configure approval of sales orders in Acumatica ERP. In general, you will need an approval map, developed by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_50_00|Assignment and Approval Maps] ([~/?ScreenId=EP205000|EP205000]) form.{br}

The rules can be very simple if all orders are to be assigned for approval to the same person, or more complicated if the selection of the approver depends on the properties of the order, such as the total amount, the specific products to be sold, or credit settings of the customer. {br}

A company structure (company tree) and approval maps that use the structure of company&rsquo;s workgroups may depend on many particular factors. In this topic, we describe how to create an approval map for the following simple example: In a small company, sales orders over $10000 of the ''SO'' type must be approved by the CFO if the customer credit limit is less than 50000. 
==Before You Proceed==
Review the company tree structure and decide whether you need to add workgroups that will be involved in the process of sales order approval. For our example, the company tree should have the ''CFO'' workgroup.{br}

Make sure that user and employee accounts are created for each of the persons involved in approval of purchase orders and that workgroups with the approvers as workgroup members are created. 
==To Create an Approval Map==[anchor|#ol_ohd_rtc_jr]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_50_00|Assignment and Approval Maps] ([~/?ScreenId=EP205000|EP205000]) form.
#In the '''Name''' box in the Summary area of the form, type a name for a new approval map, for example, <tt>Approval of Orders Over 10000</tt>.
#In the '''Entity''' box, expand the nodes: '''Distribution &gt; Purchase Orders &gt; Work Area &gt; Enter'''; click '''Sales Orders'''.
#Click '''Save''' on the form toolbar. Notice that the map name is shown now in the '''Map''' box.
# In the '''Rules''' pane (to the right in the lower part of the form), click Add Row.
#In the '''Type''' column, select ''Assign to''.
#In the '''Workgroup''' column, select the workgroup (in our example, ''CFO'') to which the orders will be assigned for approval. 
#In the '''Assign to''' column, make sure that the employee ID of the approver from the selected workgroup is displayed.
#In the pane, make sure ''All conditions are true'' is selected in the '''Rule Type''' box.
#in the '''Conditions''' table, click '''Add Row'''.
#in the '''Entity''' column, select the entity, ''Sales Order'', whose properties will be used in the conditions for assignment.
#In the '''Field Name''' column, select ''Order Total''.
#In the '''Condition''' column, select ''Greater Than''.
#In the '''Value''' column, type <tt>10000</tt>.
#in the '''Conditions''' table, click '''Add Row'''.
#in the '''Entity''' column, select the entity, ''Customer'', whose properties will be used in the conditions for assignment.
#In the '''Field Name''' column, select ''Credit Limit''.
#In the '''Condition''' column, select ''Is Less Than or Equal To''.
#In the '''Value''' column, type <tt>50000</tt>.
#Click '''Save''' on the form toolbar.

The order workflow in the Sales Orders module depends on the order type and your organizational requirements, and may include multiple operations, such as creating and confirming a shipment, creating an invoice, and preparing printed forms. In Acumatica ERP, users can simplify multistep processing and configure quick processing for a particular order type so that users can process the orders of this type with just one click. Quick order processing is mostly intended for use at points of sale with a single warehouse.{br}{TOC}
==Configuring Quick Processing for an Order Type==
For quick order processing to be used, a user must allow quick processing for a particular order type and configure the actions to be performed during quick processing. The user allows quick processing for a particular order type by selecting the '''Allow Quick Process''' check box on the '''Template Settings''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. This causes the '''Quick Process Settings''' tab to appear on the form. On this tab, the user configures the sequence of order processing actions to be used by default for orders of this type. For each particular order of the type being processed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, the list of actions to be performed can be changed. For step-by-step instructions on configuring an order type for quick processing, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Configure_Quick_Processing|To Configure Quick Processing for an Order Type].{br}

Quick processing can be configured for predefined and custom order types, except for order types that are based on the ''Quote'' and ''RMA Order'' automation behaviors (specified on the '''Template Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] form). Also, the sales order lines that are marked for purchasing—that is, those with the '''Mark for PO''' check box selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form—are excluded from quick processing because the creation of a purchase order is not included in the quick processing configuration flow.
==Configuring Quick Processing for an Order==
After quick processing is configured for a particular order type, a user can run quick processing from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. On the form toolbar of this form, the '''Quick Process''' button appears for the orders of this type. When a user clicks this button for an order with the ''Open'' status, the system opens the '''Process Order''' dialog box. In this dialog box, the user can change the following settings before quick processing an order:[anchor|#ul_enw_34b_wcb]
*The warehouse ID (if applicable for the order type) of the warehouse from which the goods will be shipped.
*The date on which the shipment will be prepared.
*:After the user specifies the shipment date, the system checks the availability of the ordered items for the specified date and displays the result in the '''Availability''' section of the dialog box. The following availability states may be displayed: 
**Green mark: The ordered items with the ''Ship Complete'' rule are available for shipping. The items with the ''Cancel Remainder'' shipping rule are partially available or not available at all.
**Yellow mark: The ordered items are partially available, and back-ordering is allowed for these items.
**Red mark: The ordered items are not available for shipment, so the order cannot be processed further.
*:The shipping and invoicing operations (if applicable for the order type) to be performed during quick processing. The user can change the default set of operations, which is copied from the settings of the order type.
*:((({S:Warn}If the printing or emailing settings of the customer specified in the order differs from the configured processing flow, the system will display a notification.
)))

After reviewing the processing details, the user clicks '''OK''' in the dialog box to launch quick processing of the order.
==Running Quick Processing==
When a user launches quick processing, the system performs the selected processing steps and notifies the user about the completion of each step in the '''Processing Results''' window. The window also shows links to all documents prepared during processing, so that after processing has completed, the user can click these links, review the created documents, and send them for printing. ((({S:Warn}For a particular order type, you can select the '''Open All Created Documents in New Tabs''' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form, to make the system open the prepared documents in new browser tabs after quick processing has finished.
)))
If a sales order contains items located in different warehouses, users need to run quick processing for each warehouse separately. For a particular sales order, the shipment from the previous processing must be completed before the next run of the quick processing can be performed. ]]></column>

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[An order with the ''CM'' order type, or a credit memo order, is used to account for unauthorized returns from customers; this order includes a reference to the original invoice. You can use credit memo orders to adjust completed sales orders and account for unauthorized returns. {br}{TOC}
==Order Type Activation==
To give users in the system the ability to create credit memo orders, you need to select the ''CM'' order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form, select the '''Active''' check box, and save your changes.
==Template Settings==[anchor|#_0e901dca-9376-4111-9621-368cbe26d4de]
Each predefined order type has an associated ''template'': a collection of settings that controls the processing of documents of the type, including what related documents it generates, whether it requires shipment, and how the automation behavior determines the conditions for changing the statuses of orders of the type. The template settings of the order type are displayed on the '''Template Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form.{br}

The ''CM'' order type has the following template settings:[anchor|#ul_xbj_rwx_bdb]
*'''Automation Behavior''': ''Credit Memo''
*:The system uses the predefined ''Credit Memo'' workflow for a credit memo order. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Customization\CG_GL_Items_WorkflowConcept|Creating Workflows].
*'''Default Operation''': ''Receipt''
*:This is the default inventory operation to be performed for a credit memo order.
*'''AR Document Type''': ''Credit Memo''
*:This setting means that an Accounts Receivable credit memo is generated during the processing of a credit memo order.
*'''Process Shipments''': Cleared
*:This setting means that no shipment is created during the processing of a credit memo order.

The template settings of the ''CM'' order type cannot be changed. If you want to modify the order processing, you can create a custom type based on the ''CM'' order type, and modify its settings based on your needs. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Custom_Order_Types|Custom Sales Order Types].
==Posting Settings==
In the posting settings of the order type, you specify the set of rules for defining which accounts and subaccounts should be used to post General Ledger transactions during the processing of an order of this type. You specify the posting settings on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''Posting Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_PostingSettings|Posting Settings in Sales Order Types].
==Quick Processing of Credit Memo Orders==
To give users the ability to quickly process a credit memo order from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, you need to select the '''Allow Quick Process''' check box on the '''Template Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Quick_Process_Workflow|Quick Processing of Sales Orders].
==Approval of Credit Memo Orders==
Approvals can be configured for credit memo orders, if needed, because the '''Supports Approval''' check box is selected (and cannot be cleared) for the ''CM'' order type on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form.{br}

If your organization&rsquo;s policies require that orders of the ''CM'' type should be approved before processing, you can set up approval of credit memo orders. After approval has been configured, when a credit memo order is saved on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, it will be assigned to an approver, and its status will change to ''Pending Approval''. If it has been rejected, the order should be corrected, and after the approver has edited the order, it will be automatically reassigned for approval. If it has been approved, the order may be processed to completion. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Approvals|Sales Order Approval].
==Calculation of Freight Charges==
By default, freight is not calculated on credit memo orders. This is indicated by the '''Calculate Freight''' check box, which is cleared by default for the ''CM'' order type on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. For more information on the configuration and calculation of freight, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\CS__con_Freight_Calculation|Freight Calculation].
==Configuration of Document Processing==
In the ''CM'' order type settings, you can specify how the system processes the orders of this type and related documents that are generated during the processing of a ''CM'' order. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_AffectingProcessingDocs|Changing the Processing of Sales Documents].]]></column>

To give users in the system the ability to create cash return orders, you need to select the ''CR'' order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form, select the '''Active''' check box, and save your changes.
==Template Settings==[anchor|#_5564b031-78cc-4220-b2c8-e39bbf95da5c]
Each predefined order type has an associated ''template'': a collection of settings that controls the processing of documents of the type, including what related documents it generates, whether it requires shipment, and how the automation behavior determines the conditions for changing the statuses of orders of the type. The template settings of the order type are displayed on the '''Template Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form.{br}

The ''CR'' order type has the following template settings:[anchor|#ul_fn5_rwx_bdb]
*'''Automation Behavior''': ''Invoice''
*:The system uses the predefined ''Invoice'' workflow for a cash return order. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Customization\CG_GL_Items_WorkflowConcept|Creating Workflows].
*'''Default Operation''': ''Receipt''
*:This is the default inventory operation to be performed for a cash return order.
*'''AR Document Type''': ''Cash Return''
*:This setting means that an Accounts Receivable cash return is generated during the processing of a cash return order.
*'''Process Shipments''': Cleared
*:This setting means that no shipment is created during the processing of a cash return.

Although the template settings of the ''CR'' order type can be edited, we do not recommend that you modify them. If you want to modify the order processing, you can create a custom type based on the ''CR'' order type, and modify its settings based on your needs. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Custom_Order_Types|Custom Sales Order Types].'''Posting Settings'''
In the posting settings of the order type, you specify the set of rules for defining which accounts and subaccounts should be used to post General Ledger transactions during the processing of an order of this order type. You specify the posting settings on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''Posting Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_PostingSettings|Posting Settings in Sales Order Types].

For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Quick_Process_Workflow|Quick Processing of Sales Orders].
==Approval of Cash Return Orders==
Approvals can be configured for cash return orders, if needed, because the '''Supports Approval''' check box is selected (and cannot be cleared) for the ''CR'' order type on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form.{br}

If your organization&rsquo;s policies require that orders of the ''CR'' type should be approved before processing, you can set up approval of cash return orders. After approval has been configured, when an order is saved on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, it will be assigned to an approver, and its status will change to ''Pending Approval''. If it has been rejected, the order should be corrected, and after the approver has edited the order, it will be automatically reassigned for approval. If it has been approved, the order may be processed further. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Approvals|Sales Order Approval].
==Calculation of Freight Charges==
By default, freight is calculated on cash return orders. This is indicated by the '''Calculate Freight''' check box, which is selected by default for the ''CR'' type on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. For more information on configuring and calculating freight, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\CS__con_Freight_Calculation|Freight Calculation].

Posting Settings In the posting settings of the order type,         you specify the set of rules for defining which accounts and subaccounts should be used to         post General Ledger transactions during the processing of an order of this order type. You         specify the posting settings on the  General Settings  tab           ( Posting Settings  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types         (SO201000) form. For more information, see  Posting Settings in Sales Order Types. Quick Processing of Invoice Orders To give users the ability to quickly process an invoice order from the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, you need to select the  Allow           Quick Process  check box on the  Template Settings  tab of         the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form. For more information, see  Quick Processing of Sales Orders. Approval of the Invoice Orders Approvals can be configured for invoice orders, if needed, because the  Supports           Approval  check box is selected (and cannot be cleared) for the  IN  order         type on the  General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form. If your organization's policies require that invoice orders be approved, you can set up         their approval, as described in  Sales Order Approval. If approval is         required, when an invoice order is taken off hold on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders         (SO301000) form, the system assigns an invoice order the  Pending Approval  status and         selects an approver for the order, in accordance with the approval map used for invoice         orders. If the approver approves the order, the order can be processed further. If the         approver rejects the order, the order is assigned the  Rejected  status. If it has been         rejected, the order should be corrected, and after the approver has edited the order, it         will be automatically reassigned for approval.  Calculation of Freight Charges By default, freight is not calculated on invoice orders. This is indicated by the            Calculate Freight  check box, which is cleared by default for the            IN  type on the  General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form. For more information on the configuration         and calculation of freight, see  Freight Calculation. Configuration of Document Processing In the  IN  order type settings, you can specify how the system processes orders of         this type and related documents that are generated during the processing of an  IN          order. For more information, see  Changing the Processing of Sales Documents. ]]></column>

A quote is a proposal of future sales to a particular customer for a specified price on the specified date. You can use order documents of the ''QT'' order type to plan production or sales orders and to register a customer&rsquo;s intention to buy particular goods. {br}{TOC}
==Order Type Activation==
To give users in the system the ability to create quotes, you need to select the ''QT'' order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form, select the '''Active''' check box, and save your changes.
==Template Settings==
[anchor|#_b02113c0-be1e-47cf-9c2b-c2cdc517de93]
Each predefined order type has an associated ''template'': a collection of settings that controls the processing of documents of the type, including what related documents it generates, whether it requires shipment, and how the automation behavior determines the conditions for changing the statuses of orders of the type. The template settings of the order type are displayed on the '''Template Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form.
The ''QT'' order type has the following template settings:[anchor|#ul_zxl_krx_bdb]
*'''Automation Behavior''': ''Quote''
*:The system uses the predefined ''Quote'' workflow for a quote order. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Customization\CG_GL_Items_WorkflowConcept|Creating Workflows].
*'''Default Operation''': ''Issue''
*:This is the default inventory operation to be performed for a quote order.
*'''AR Document Type''': ''No Update''
*:This setting means that no Accounts Receivable document is generated during the processing of a quote.
*'''Process Shipments''': Cleared
*:This setting means that no shipment is created during the processing of a quote.

The template settings of the ''QT'' order type cannot be changed. If you want to modify the order processing, you can create a custom type based on the ''QT'' order type, and modify its settings based on your needs. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Custom_Order_Types|Custom Sales Order Types].'''Posting Settings'''
In the posting settings of the order type, you specify the set of rules for defining which accounts and subaccounts should be used to post General Ledger transactions during the processing of an order of this type. You specify the posting settings on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''Posting Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_PostingSettings|Posting Settings in Sales Order Types]. {br}

When you create an order based on quote, the accounts and subaccounts specified in the quote are copied to the created order. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_scn_Sale_Quote|Processing Pre-Sale Quotes].
==Quick Processing of Quotes==
Quick processing cannot be configured for quotes because they are based on the ''Quote'' automation behavior, which does not support quick processing.
==Approval of Quote Orders==
Approvals can be configured for quotes, if needed, because the '''Supports Approval''' check box is selected (and cannot be cleared) for the ''QT'' order type on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. {br}

If your organization&rsquo;s policies require that quotes should be approved before processing, you can set up approval of ''QT'' orders. After approval has been configured, when a quote is saved on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, it will be assigned to an approver, and its status will change to ''Pending Approval''. If it has been rejected, the quote should be corrected, and after the approver has edited the order, it will be automatically reassigned for approval. If it has been approved, the quote may be processed further. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Approvals|Sales Order Approval].
==Calculation of Freight Charges==
Freight is calculated on quotes. This is indicated by the '''Calculate Freight''' check box, which is selected by default for the ''QT'' type on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. For more information on the configuration and calculation of freight, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\CS__con_Freight_Calculation|Freight Calculation].
==Configuration of Document Processing==
In the ''QT'' order type settings, you can specify how the system processes orders of this type and related documents that are generated during the processing of a ''QT'' order.

AR Document Type :  Invoice This setting means that an             Accounts Receivable invoice is generated during the processing of a merchandise             authorization return order. Process Shipments : Selected This setting means that the             processing of a merchandise authorization return order requires the creation of a             shipment. The template settings of the  RM  order type cannot be changed. If you want to modify         the order processing, you can create a custom type based on the  RM  order type, and         modify its settings based on your needs. For more information, see  Custom Sales Order Types. Posting Settings In the posting settings of the order type, you specify the set of rules for defining which         accounts and subaccounts should be used to post General Ledger transactions during the         processing of an order of this order type. For more information, see  Posting Settings in Sales Order Types. Quick Processing of the RM Orders Quick processing cannot be configured for merchandise authorization return orders because         they are based on the  RMA Order  automation behavior, which does not support quick         processing. Approval of the RM Orders Approvals cannot be configured for merchandise authorization return orders, because the            Supports Approval  check box is cleared (and cannot be selected) for         the  RM  order type on the  General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form.

You create an order with the ''RR'' type for the authorization of a customer return with an exact replacement of the returned goods. {br}{TOC}
==Activation of the Order Type==
To give users in the system the ability to create return orders with replacement, you need to select the ''RR'' order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form, select the '''Active''' check box, and save your changes.
==Template Settings==
[anchor|#_ffbe5e1a-b27f-423f-93ef-f6f1672b0b6c]
Each predefined order type has an associated ''template'': a collection of settings that controls the processing of documents of the type, including what related documents it generates, whether it requires shipment, and how the automation behavior determines the conditions for changing the statuses of orders of the type. The template settings of the order type are displayed on the '''Template Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form.
The ''RR'' order type has the following template settings:[anchor|#ul_fn5_rwx_bdb]
*'''Automation Behavior''': ''RMA Order''
*:The system uses the predefined ''RMA Order'' workflow for a return order with replacement. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Customization\CG_GL_Items_WorkflowConcept|Creating Workflows].
*'''Default Operation''': ''Receipt''
*:This is the default inventory operation to be performed for a return order with replacement.
*'''AR Document Type''': ''No Update''
*:This setting means that no Accounts Receivable document is generated during the processing of a return order with replacement.
*'''Process Shipments''': Selected
*:This setting means that the processing of a return with replacement order requires the creation of a shipment.

Although the template settings of the ''RR'' order type can be edited, we do not recommend that you modify them. If you want to modify the order processing, you can create a custom type based on the ''RR'' order type, and modify its settings based on your needs. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Custom_Order_Types|Custom Sales Order Types].'''Posting Settings'''
In the posting settings of the order type, you specify the set of rules for defining which accounts and subaccounts should be used to post General Ledger transactions during the processing of an order of this type. You specify the posting settings on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''Posting Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_PostingSettings|Posting Settings in Sales Order Types].
==Quick Processing of Return Orders with Replacement==
Quick processing cannot be configured for return orders with replacement because they are based on the ''RMA Order'' automation behavior, which does not support quick processing.
==Approval of Return Orders with Replacement==
Approvals cannot be configured for return orders with replacement, because the '''Supports Approval''' check box is cleared (and cannot be selected) for the ''RM'' order type on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form.
==Calculation of Freight Charges==
By default, freight is calculated on return with replacement orders. This is indicated by the '''Calculate Freight''' check box, which is selected by default on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. For more information on the configuration and calculation of freight, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\CS__con_Freight_Calculation|Freight Calculation].
==Configuration of Document Processing==
In the ''RR'' order type settings, you can specify how the system processes orders of this type and related documents that are generated during the processing of an ''RR'' order.

The template settings of the ''SA'' order type cannot be changed. If you want to modify the order processing, you can create a custom type based on the ''SA'' order type, and modify its settings based on your needs. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Custom_Order_Types|Custom Sales Order Types].
==Allocation of Items in Inventory==
When you save a new order of the ''SA'' type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, the specified quantities of the line items are automatically reserved specifically for this order. You can view the allocation for each line item, and change it, if needed. If there is an insufficient quantity in the specified warehouse, the system automatically splits the requested quantity into two allocation schedules: one with the available quantity reserved in the specified warehouse, and one with the remaining unallocated quantity, which you can allocate manually. 
==Posting Settings==
In the posting settings of the order type, you specify the set of rules for defining which accounts and subaccounts should be used to post General Ledger transactions during the processing of an order of this type. You specify the posting settings on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''Posting Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form.

To give users the ability to quickly process a sales order with allocation from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, you need to select the '''Allow Quick Process''' check box on the '''Template Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Quick_Process_Workflow|Quick Processing of Sales Orders].
==Approval of Sales Orders with Allocation==
Approvals can be configured for sales orders with allocation, if needed, because the '''Supports Approval''' check box is selected (and cannot be changed) for the ''SA'' order type on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. {br}

If your organization&rsquo;s policies require that orders of the ''SA'' type should be approved before they can be shipped, you can set up approval of sales orders with allocation. After approval has been configured, when a sales order is saved, it will be assigned to an approver, and its status will change to ''Pending Approval''. If it has been rejected, the order should be corrected, and after the approver edits the order, it will be automatically reassigned for approval. If it has been approved, the order may be processed further to completion. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Approvals|Sales Order Approval].
==Calculation of Freight Charges==
By default, freight is calculated on sales orders with allocation.

This means that once a sales order with allocation is saved, the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, the system checks the credit history of the customer to verify that the customer has not exceeded the specified credit limit or days past due. If the customer fails the credit check, the status of the order changes to ''Credit Hold''. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Credit_Check|Checking the Credit Limit in Sales Documents].
==Configuration of Document Processing==
In the ''SA'' order type settings, you can specify how the system processes orders of this type and related documents that are generated during the order processing.

If you want to modify the order processing, you can create a custom type based on the ''SO'' order type, and modify its settings based on your needs. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Custom_Order_Types|Custom Sales Order Types].'''Posting Settings'''
In the posting settings of the order type, you specify the set of rules for defining which accounts and subaccounts should be used to post General Ledger transactions during the processing of an order of this order type. You specify the posting settings on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''Posting Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_PostingSettings|Posting Settings in Sales Order Types].
==Quick Processing of Sales Orders==
To give users the ability to quickly process a sales order from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, you need to select the '''Allow Quick Process''' check box on the '''Template Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Quick_Process_Workflow|Quick Processing of Sales Orders].
==Approval of Sales Orders==
Approvals can be configured for sales orders with allocation, if needed, because the '''Supports Approval''' check box is selected (and cannot be cleared) for the ''SO'' type on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form.{br}

If your organization&rsquo;s policies require that orders of the ''SO'' type should be approved before they can be processed, you can set up approval of sales orders. After approval has been configured, when a sales order is saved, it will be assigned to an approver, and its status will change to ''Pending Approval''. If it has been rejected, the order should be corrected, and after the approver has edited the order, it will be automatically reassigned for approval. If it has been approved, the order may be processed to completion. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Approvals|Sales Order Approval].
==Calculation of Freight Charges==
Freight is calculated on sales orders of the ''SO'' type. This is indicated by the '''Calculate Freight''' check box, which by default is selected for the ''SO'' order type on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. For more information on the configuration and calculation of freight, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\CS__con_Freight_Calculation|Freight Calculation].
==Credit Verification for Sales Orders==
For the ''SO'' order type, the '''Hold Document on Failed Credit Check''' check box is selected by default on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. This means that once a sales order is saved the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, the system checks the credit history of the customer to verify that the customer has not exceeded the specified credit limit or days past due. If the customer fails the credit check, the status of the order changes to ''Credit Hold''. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Credit_Check|Checking the Credit Limit in Sales Documents].
==Configuration of Document Processing==
In the order type, you can specify how the system processes the orders of this type and related documents that are generated during the order processing. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_AffectingProcessingDocs|Changing the Processing of Sales Documents].

In addition to the predefined order types Acumatica ERP provides for common order processing operations, if the ''Custom Order Types'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can create more order types to support business processes in your company that cannot be supported with the predefined order types.{br}

You configure custom order types that are based on the available templates, which generally involves creating a new order type with a predefined template and making slight changes to the order type settings. Custom order types that you have configured appear for selection in the '''Order Type '''box of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. Users can then create new orders of custom types and process them in accordance with the workflow configured for the template. ((({S:Hint}Although the '''Template Settings''' tab is not hidden, we do not recommend that you modify the available templates. In exceptional cases, new custom templates can be created with the help of the Acumatica ERP development team, and custom order types can be based on those templates. 
)))
The sections below describe the creation of custom order types based on predefined templates and custom templates. {br}{TOC}
==Order Types Based on Predefined Templates==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form, you can view the settings of predefined order types and create new custom order types that are based on predefined templates. When you create a new order type based on a predefined template, you make minor modifications of the predefined template order type. For example, you can create separate quote order types, based on the ''QT (Quote)'' template, for the customer price classes of wholesale, retail, and catalog customers. These types might use different numbering sequences to determine order IDs and different sets of General Ledger accounts and subaccounts. Also, the types might have different processing options specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] form, such as the setting that determines whether the system performs a credit check when the quotes are entered. {br}

The following order type templates are available: [anchor|#ul_knm_j1m_1w]
*''CM (Credit Memo)'': The built-in template for the ''CM'' order type. You use documents of this type to adjust already-completed sales orders.
*''CR (Cash Return)'': The built-in template for the ''CR'' order type. Documents of this type are used when the customer returns goods from a cash sale order that did not involve shipping.
*''IN (Invoice)'': The built-in template for the ''IN'' order type. You use documents of this type to bill the customer for shipped goods.
*''CS (Cash Sale)'': The built-in template for the ''CS'' order type. You use documents of this type to register cash sales.
*''QT (Quote)'': The built-in template for the ''QT'' order type. Documents of this type register the customer&rsquo;s intention to buy goods in the specified quantity, on the specified date, and at the specified price.
*''RC (Return for Credit)'': The built-in template for the ''RC'' order type. You use documents of this type to register customer returns for credit without replacement.
*''RM (Generic Authorized Return)'': The built-in template for the ''RM'' order type. Documents of this type register customer returns with replacement for credit within the product&rsquo;s warranty period.
*''RR (Return with Replacement)'': The built-in template for the ''RR'' order type. You use documents of this type to register customer returns with exact replacement of goods.
*''SA (Sales Order with Allocation)'': The built-in template for the ''SA'' order type. You create documents of this type to record customers&rsquo; requests to purchase goods and to reserve the requested goods for the orders.
*''SO (Sales Order)'': The built-in template for the ''SO'' order type. Documents of this type are created to record customers&rsquo; requests to purchase goods that should then be shipped to the customer location.
*''TR (Transfer)'': The built-in template for the ''TR'' order type. You generate documents of this type to record stock replenishment by transferring goods from the source warehouse to a destination warehouse. 
*:This order type appears only if the ''Multiple Warehouses'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.

==Order Types Based on Custom Templates==
 The functionality of order types is implemented through specific workflows developed for each of the forms involved in order processing: [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders], [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]), and [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]). This functionality defines, for orders of specific types with each status, what actions are enabled and under what conditions. You can use the Workflow Visual                             Editor to make changes in the predefined workflows. For details, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Customization\CG_GL_Items_AddWorkflowDiagram|To Modify a Workflow by using the Workflow Visual Editor]. Workflows use various built-in order and shipment plans. The following predefined workflows are available: [anchor|#ul_gwm_j1m_1w]
*'''Sales Order''': Implements typical sales order and transfer processing with approval
*'''Invoice''': Implements typical invoice order and cash sale order processing with approval
*'''Quote''': Implements typical quote processing with approval
*'''Credit Memo''': Implements typical credit memo processing
*'''RMA Order''': Implements processing for typical types of customer returns: returns for credit, returns with replacement, and RMA returns

The settings in the '''Operations''' area on the '''Template Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form affect the integration of orders with the inventory and accounts receivable functionality. For example, for the ''RC (Return for Credit)'' template, the default inventory operation for receiving the returned goods will be ''Receipt'' and a credit memo will be generated on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form to reimburse the customer for the returned goods. With the ''RR (Return for Replacement)'' template, no accounts receivable document will be generated for an order of the type, while the release of the receipt (the default inventory operation for this order type) will initiate the creation of an issue to account for the replacement sent to the customer in the same quantity with the same price.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Custom Sales Order Types In addition to the predefined order types  Acumatica ERP provides for common order processing operations, if the  Custom Order Types  				feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, you can 				create more order types to support business processes in your company that cannot be 				supported with the predefined order types. You configure custom order types that are based on the available templates, which generally 				involves creating a new order type with a predefined template and making slight 				changes to the order type settings. Custom order types that you have configured 				appear for selection in the  Order Type  box of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form. Users can then create 				new orders of custom types and process them in accordance with the 				 workflow  				configured for the template.  Although the  Template Settings  tab is not hidden, we 				do not recommend that you modify the available templates. In exceptional cases, new 				custom templates can be created with the help of the  Acumatica ERP development team, and custom order types can be based on those templates.  The sections below describe the creation of custom order types based on predefined templates 				and custom templates.  Order Types Based on Predefined Templates On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form, you can view the 				settings of predefined order types and create new custom order types that are based 				on predefined templates. When you create a new order type based on a predefined 				template, you make minor modifications of the predefined template order type. For 				example, you can create separate quote order types, based on the  QT (Quote)  				template, for the customer price classes of wholesale, retail, and catalog 				customers. These types might use different numbering sequences to determine order 				IDs and different sets of General Ledger accounts and subaccounts. Also, the types 				might have different processing options specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types form, such as the setting that determines whether the 				system performs a credit check when the quotes are entered.  The following order type templates are available:  CM (Credit Memo) : The built-in template for the  CM  order type. You 					use documents of this type to adjust already-completed sales orders. CR (Cash Return) : The built-in template for the  CR  order type. 					Documents of this type are used when the customer returns goods from a cash sale 					order that did not involve shipping. IN (Invoice) : The built-in template for the  IN  order type. You use 					documents of this type to bill the customer for shipped goods. CS (Cash Sale) : The built-in template for the  CS  order type. You 					use documents of this type to register cash sales. QT (Quote) : The built-in template for the  QT  order type. Documents 					of this type register the customer's intention to buy goods in the specified 					quantity, on the specified date, and at the specified price. RC (Return for Credit) : The built-in template for the  RC  order 					type. You use documents of this type to register customer returns for credit 					without replacement. RM (Generic Authorized Return) : The built-in template for the  RM  					order type. Documents of this type register customer returns with replacement 					for credit within the product's warranty period. RR (Return with Replacement) : The built-in template for the  RR  					order type. You use documents of this type to register customer returns with 					exact replacement of goods. SA (Sales Order with Allocation) : The built-in template for the  SA  					order type. You create documents of this type to record customers' requests to 					purchase goods and to reserve the requested goods for the orders. SO (Sales Order) : The built-in template for the  SO  order type. Documents of 					this type are created to record customers' requests to purchase goods that 					should then be shipped to the customer location. TR (Transfer) : The built-in template for the  TR  order type. You 					generate documents of this type to record stock replenishment by transferring 					goods from the source warehouse to a destination warehouse.  This order type 						appears only if the  Multiple Warehouses  feature is enabled on the 							  ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. Order Types Based on Custom Templates  The functionality of order types is implemented through 				 specific 				workflows  developed for each of the forms involved in order 				processing:   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders,   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000), and   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000). This functionality defines, 				for orders of specific types with each status, what actions are enabled and under 				what conditions. 				 You can use 				the  Workflow Visual                             Editor to make changes in the predefined workflows. For details, see  To Modify a Workflow by using the Workflow Visual Editor.  Workflows  				use various built-in order and shipment plans. The following 				 predefined 				workflows  are available:  Sales Order : Implements typical sales order and transfer processing with 					approval Invoice : Implements typical invoice order and cash sale order processing 					with approval Quote : Implements typical quote processing with approval Credit Memo : Implements typical credit memo processing RMA Order : Implements processing for typical types of customer returns: 					returns for credit, returns with replacement, and RMA returns The settings in the  Operations  area on the  Template 					Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types 				(SO201000) form affect the integration of orders with the 				 i nventory 				and 				 a ccounts 				 r eceivable 				 functionality . 				For example, for the  RC (Return for Credit)  template, the default inventory 				operation for receiving the returned goods will be 				 Receipt  				and a credit memo will be generated 				 on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form 				 to 				reimburse the customer for the returned goods. With the  RR (Return for 					Replacement)  template, no 				 a ccounts 				 r eceivable 				document will be generated for an order of the type, while 				 the 				release of the receipt (the default inventory operation for this order type) will 				initiate the creation of an issue to account for the replacement sent to the 				customer in the same quantity with the same price.   ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000])  ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000])  ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000])  ([~/?ScreenId=SM205000|SM205000]) ]]></column>

In Acumatica ERP, you can require a user to perform additional steps during the processing of sales orders of a particular order type and related documents, by configuring order settings on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form, and by configuring module preferences on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form.{br}{TOC}
==Holding Documents on Entry==
In the settings of an order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form, you can configure the following settings, which specify whether the orders of this type and related documents should be on hold on creation:[anchor|#ul_xyk_sjb_3db]
*'''Hold Documents on Entry''': If the check box is selected for an order type, new orders of this type will be created with the ''On Hold'' status by default. Otherwise, if check box is cleared, a newly created order will be created with the ''Open'' status. 
*'''Hold Invoices on Entry''': If the check box is selected for an order type, new invoices prepared for the order of this type will be created with the ''On Hold'' status by default. Otherwise, if check box is cleared, invoices will be created with the ''Balanced'' status. 

==Holding Orders on a Failed Credit Check==
By default, a credit check is performed for sales orders of any type; the system displays a warning if the customer fails the credit check. If you want to instead hold sales orders on a failed credit check, you need to select the '''Credit Check on Entry''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form for the needed order type. Then if the customer fails the credit check, the order is assigned the ''Credit Hold'' status. {br}

Orders placed on credit hold can be released from credit hold if customer payments were entered or order amounts were appropriately decreased. To release these orders from credit hold, you select the orders on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) form, select the ''Release from Credit Hold'' action, and process the selected orders. This initiates credit checks for each selected order, and gives the order the ''Open'' status if the credit check is successful. For more details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Credit_Check|Checking the Credit Limit in Sales Documents].
==Holding Invoices on a Failed Credit Check==
New and edited invoices are put on credit hold for customers that fail credit check if the '''Hold Invoices on Failed Credit Check''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] form.
==Affecting the Processing of Inventory Issues==
Generated inventory issues are released automatically if the '''Automatically Release IN Documents''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form. If the check box is cleared, inventory issues are generated and saved with the ''Balanced'' status.
==Making the Entry of Orders Error-Proof==
You select the '''Require Control Total''' check box in the settings of an order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form to prevent the orders of this type from being processed until a user types the total order amount in the '''Control Total''' box, which is displayed on the data entry form if the check box is selected for an order type. The control total that the user enters must be equal to the order total calculated by the system.
==Making the Entry of Shipments Error-Proof==
You select the '''Validate Shipment Total on Confirmation''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form to prevent the shipment from being confirmed until a user types the total quantity of the items being shipped in the '''Control Quantity''' box, which is displayed on the data entry form if the check box is selected. The quantity that the user enters must be equal to the quantity calculated by the system.
==Causing the Documents to Be Processed Separately==
In the settings of an order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form, you can configure the following settings, which specify whether the orders of this type and related documents should be processed individually from other orders of this type:[anchor|#ul_olf_blb_3db]
*'''Bill Separately''': If this check box is selected, the system prepares individual Sales Orders invoices for each order of this type. Otherwise, if the check box is cleared, the system prepares consolidated invoices.
*'''Ship Separately''': If this check box is selected, the system prepares individual shipments for each order of this type. Otherwise, if the check box is cleared, the system prepares consolidated shipments.
*:((({S:Warn}The orders of the type for which the '''Ship Separately''' check box is selected can still be consolidated into a single shipment if you manually add them using the '''Add Order''' button on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form.
)))

==Affecting the Date of the Invoice Generation==
In the settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form, you can select the '''Use Shipment Date for Invoice Date''' check box, if you want to generate Sales Orders invoices with the date of shipment. Otherwise, if the check box is cleared, the system uses the current business date for invoice generation.]]></column>

The quantity that the user enters must be equal to the quantity         calculated by the system. Causing the Documents to Be Processed Separately In the settings of an order type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form,         you can configure the following settings, which specify whether the orders of this type and         related documents should be processed individually from other orders of this type: Bill Separately : If this check box is selected, the system             prepares individual Sales Orders invoices for each order of this type. Otherwise, if the             check box is cleared, the system prepares consolidated invoices. Ship Separately : If this check box is selected, the system             prepares individual shipments for each order of this type. Otherwise, if the check box             is cleared, the system prepares consolidated shipments. The orders of the type for               which the  Ship Separately  check box is selected can still be               consolidated into a single shipment if you manually add them using the  Add                 Order  button on the  Document Details  tab of the                   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) form. Affecting the Date of the Invoice Generation In the settings on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences (SO101000) form, you can select the            Use Shipment Date for Invoice Date  check box, if you want to         generate Sales Orders invoices with the date of shipment. Otherwise, if the check box is         cleared, the system uses the current business date for invoice generation. ]]></column>

You may need to reorder document lines in sales orders and invoices—for example, if you need the lines of the printed document to be in a specific order, or if the customer wants you to sort the document lines in some custom order (for example, by the shipment number and order number to make it easier to review a printable invoice). Also, you may need to reorder a line or multiple lines in an existing sales order, or add a new line at the beginning of a list or in the middle of it. The following sections describe how you can reorder lines in various sales documents.{br}{TOC}
==Reordering Lines in Sales Orders and Invoices==
The order number of each document line is shown in the '''Line Order''' column on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form for sales orders, and of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form for invoices. (On both forms, these columns are hidden by default, so you should use the '''Column Configuration''' dialog box to make the columns available before you reorder lines.) Once you reorder the lines, the system automatically regenerates the order numbers for each document line. {br}

You can select the lines to be reordered in any combinations, such as the following:[anchor|#ul_fjp_dyj_gz]
*A single document line (for example, line 3 or 8). To select a single line, click it. 
*Multiple non-contiguous lines (for example, lines 1, 3, and 7). To select these lines, hold Ctrl while clicking the row selector next to the needed lines.
*A contiguous group of document lines (for example, line 5 through line 9). To select a group of lines, select the first line in the group, and hold Shift while clicking the last line in the group. (Alternatively, you can click the first line and then press Shift+Down Arrow until all the needed lines are selected.)
*A group of some contiguous lines and some non-contiguous lines (for example, line 5 through line 7, and line 10). To select a non-contiguous group of lines, hold Ctrl while clicking the row selector next to the needed lines.

All selected document lines are grouped, and thus are moved contiguously, even if you have selected multiple non-contiguous document lines. After you have selected the needed lines, you move them to the new place in the table in one of the following ways:[anchor|#ul_g1n_vck_gz]
*Drag the selected document line or lines to the place where you want to move them. A thin red line between the lines shows where these lines will be inserted. Once you drag the selected lines, the system moves these lines and regenerates the '''Line Order''' numbers for all the lines in the table.
*When you need to move document lines between pages, cut the selected document lines and paste them to the new place in the table. To cut the lines, press Ctrl+X, or right-click the table and then click '''Cut Row'''. Then click the line above which the cut lines should be inserted, and press Ctrl+V; alternatively, you can right-click the table, and then click '''Insert Cut Row'''. 

Once you reorder the document lines, the system automatically regenerates the line number for each document line. These numbers are used for numbering lines in the printable reports, such as the printable sales order shown on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form or the printable invoice shown on the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\SO_64_30_00|Invoice / Memo] ([~/?ScreenId=SO643000|SO643000]) form. You can cancel the line reordering by clicking '''Cancel''' on the form toolbar before you save these changes. You can reorder the lines of a sales order until it has been completed; the lines of an invoice can be reordered until it has been released.
==Resetting the Line Order in Invoices==
The invoice lines that you add by using the '''Add Order''' dialog box, which opens when you click the '''Add Order''' button on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form, are added to the table in the order in which you have added them. If you need to rearrange the lines in the table to sort them by shipment numbers and order numbers, you can click the '''Reset Order''' button on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab. When you click this button, the system automatically sorts the invoice lines and regenerates '''Line Order''' numbers for all the lines in the table.
==Inserting New Lines into Sales Orders and Invoices==
You can insert a single line anywhere in the document. To do this, click the line above which the new line should be inserted and then press Shift+Insert, or right-click the needed line and then click '''Insert Row'''. The system adds a new blank line. When you finish populating the line information and save your changes, the system automatically regenerates the line numbers for all lines in the table.]]></column>

To simplify entering an order and minimize errors on data entry, you may start to create a sales order by copying and pasting another sales order, which you use as a template. In this case, you need to change the customer ID specified for the sales order to another one. You can change the customer ID in the '''Customer''' box of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form for a sales order that has one of the following statuses: [anchor|#ul_tfc_fvv_wx]
*''On Hold''
* ''Open'' (if the order is new)
*''Credit Hold'' (if the order is new)
*''Back Order'' (if the new order has been placed on back order manually)

You can also change the customer ID in a return order that does not have lines linked to invoices and in a sales quote that is not linked to a sales order.{br}

The following sections describe the specifics of changing the customer in a document.
==Information Kept After the Customer Is Changed==
When you change the customer ID in the sales order, the system preserves the following information: [anchor|#ul_pfq_czd_xx]
*Order type, order number, and description
*Currency ID, currency rate type, and currency rate
*Document date and date when the customer wants to receive the goods
*Order-level shipping rule, and shipping rules in the order lines
*Inventory IDs and warehouses specified in the order lines
*Hard allocations of inventory
*Notes, activities, and attachments

==Information Updated After the Customer Is Changed==
When you change the customer ID in the sales order, the system updates the following document information by using the settings of the newly selected customer:[anchor|#ul_kvg_swv_wx]
*Credit verification status
*Salesperson commissions
*Customer-specific settings on the '''Document Details''', '''Financial Settings''', '''Payment Settings''', and '''Shipping Settings''' tabs
*Taxes and freight tax category
*Group and document discounts
*Unit prices, except manual unit prices for which the '''Manual Price''' check box is selected in the document line
*Line discounts, except manual line discounts for which the '''Manual Discount''' check box is selected in the document line

The system does not automatically save the document after you change the customer ID, so you can easily cancel these changes.
==Restrictions on Customer Override==
There are some restrictions on changing the customer in a sales order. You cannot save the sales order after changing the customer in any of the following cases:[anchor|#ul_nmt_rfw_wx]
*The sales order has the ''Open'' status and is subject for approval.
*The sales order has a linked shipment, invoice, inventory issue, or drop-ship purchase order.
*Credit card payments have been authorized or captured for the sales order.
*Accounts Receivable payments or prepayments have been applied to the sales order.
*The currency of the newly selected customer differs from the currency that was previously specified in the sales order, and the system cannot override the currency in the sales order. (This could happen if the currency override is not allowed for the newly selected customer.) 

To avoid situations when the system does not allow you to override the customer, we recommend that you create order templates by currency and for each unique set of shipping rules, to make sure that shipments are processed as expected.]]></column>

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[This topic describes the credit check settings for sales orders and invoices. For details on setting up credit verification rules for customers, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__CON_Credit_Verification|Credit Verification].
==Credit Check for Sales Orders==
The system performs a credit check of the customer for sales orders of most predefined types. When a user selects a customer for the order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, the system performs the customer credit check. If the credit rules specified for the customer on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form have been violated (that is, if the customer has exceeded the credit limit, the days past due, or both), the system displays a yellow exclamation mark to the left of the '''Customer''' box. By pointing at the mark, the user can read the warning. {br}

You can use the '''Hold Document on Failed Credit Check ''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form to indicate to the system how the orders of the specific type should be processed if the customer fails the credit check: [anchor|#ul_ndy_pdw_dt]
*If this check box is selected for the order type, when an order of this type is saved (or taken off hold, depending on whether the '''Hold Orders on Entry''' check box is selected for the order type), it will be assigned the ''Credit Hold'' status. By default, the check box is selected only for the ''SA (Sales Orders with Allocation)'' order type.
*If the check box is cleared for the order type, when an order of this type is saved or taken off hold, it will be assigned the ''Open'' status. The order can be processed as the orders that passed the credit check can be processed.

If customer payments were entered or order amounts were decreased for a customer that had violated the credit rules, orders that were previously placed on credit hold can be released from it. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) form, you can select the ''Release from Credit Hold'' action (as long as your user account has access to this action), select the orders with the ''Credit Hold'' status in the table, and click '''Process''' on the form toolbar. This initiates credit checks for each order selected, and if the credit check is successful, the applicable order receives a status of ''Open''. {br}

If approval of sales orders is configured in your system, you may need to assign the orders that have been taken from credit hold for approval—in this case, add to the approval map a condition or multiple conditions that assign the orders with the ''Credit Hold'' status to specific approvers. Then on release from credit hold, the orders will get the ''Pending Approval'' status if the conditions are met. {br}

Alternatively, you can release each order from credit hold individually by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. If you as a user have access to the '''Actions &gt; Release from Credit Hold''' action on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form, you can click this action to change the status of the order to ''Open'' and process it further despite of the failed credit check. If when editing this order you increase the order amount, then when you save the order, it will get the ''Credit Hold'' status. If you do not change the amount, you can process the order further; an invoice generated for the order will not get the ''Credit Hold'' status (even if the '''Hold Invoices on Failed Credit Check''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form) and can be released.
==Credit Check for Invoices==
Generally, invoices are generated for sales orders that have passed the credit check; however, you may need to perform a separate credit check for invoices and hold invoices if the credit check has failed. Depending on your organization&rsquo;s business processes, the time range between shipment creation and invoice generation may be significant, and during this time, the prices may change. Also, services and warranties may be added manually to invoices, rather than to sales orders. {br}

A credit check is performed for each new invoice that is created by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form, and if the customer fails the credit check, the system displays a yellow exclamation mark to the left of the '''Customer''' box and a warning. However, you may want invoices to be placed on credit hold if they fail the credit check. You can select the '''Hold Invoices on Failed Credit Check''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form to indicate to the system that all invoices that fail the credit check should get the ''Credit Hold'' status. For invoices with the ''Credit Hold'' status, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_50_00|Process Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=SO505000|SO505000]) form, you can periodically perform the ''Release from Credit Hold'' action, which initiates a credit check and opens the invoices of those customers who have paid their outstanding balances fully or partially or have extended the credit limits.

For details       on setting up credit verification rules for customers, see  Credit Verification. Credit Check for Sales Orders The system performs a credit check of the customer for sales orders of most predefined         types. When a user selects a customer for the order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders         (SO301000) form, the system performs the customer credit check. If the credit rules         specified for the customer on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000) form have been         violated (that is, if the customer has exceeded the credit limit, the days past due, or         both), the system displays a yellow exclamation mark to the left of the            Customer  box. By pointing at the mark, the user can read the         warning.  You can use the  Hold Document on Failed Credit Check   check box on         the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form to indicate to the system how the orders         of the specific type should be processed if the customer fails the credit check:  If this check box is selected for the order type, when an order of this type is saved           (or taken off hold, depending on whether the  Hold Orders on Entry            check box is selected for the order type), it will be assigned the  Credit Hold            status. By default, the check box is selected only for the  SA (Sales Orders with             Allocation)  order type. If the check box is cleared for the order type, when an order of this type is saved or           taken off hold, it will be assigned the  Open  status. The order can be processed as           the orders that passed the credit check can be processed. If customer payments were entered or order amounts were decreased for a customer that had         violated the credit rules, orders that were previously placed on credit hold can be released         from it. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) Process Orders (SO501000) form, you can         select the  Release from Credit Hold  action (as long as your user account has access         to this action), select the orders with the  Credit Hold  status in the table, and         click  Process  on the form toolbar. This initiates credit checks for         each order selected, and if the credit check is successful, the applicable order receives a         status of  Open .  If approval of sales orders is configured in your system, you may need to assign the orders         that have been taken from credit hold for approval—in this case, add to the approval map a         condition or multiple conditions that assign the orders with the  Credit Hold  status         to specific approvers. Then on release from credit hold, the orders will get the  Pending           Approval  status if the conditions are met.  Alternatively, you can release each order from credit hold individually by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form. If you as a user have access to the  Actions > Release from Credit Hold  action on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders form, you         can click this action to change the status of the order to  Open  and process it         further despite of the failed credit check. If when editing this order you increase the         order amount, then when you save the order, it will get the  Credit Hold  status. If         you do not change the amount, you can process the order further; an invoice generated for         the order will not get the  Credit Hold  status (even if the  Hold Invoices           on Failed Credit Check  check box is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences (SO101000) form) and can be released. Credit Check for Invoices Generally, invoices are generated for sales orders that have passed the credit check; however,         you may need to perform a separate credit check for invoices and hold invoices if the credit         check has failed. Depending on your organization's business processes, the time range         between shipment creation and invoice generation may be significant, and during this time,         the prices may change. Also, services and warranties may be added manually to invoices,         rather than to sales orders.  A credit check is performed for each new invoice that is created by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form, and if the customer fails the credit check, the         system displays a yellow exclamation mark to the left of the  Customer          box and a warning. However, you may want invoices to be placed on credit hold if they fail         the credit check. You can select the  Hold Invoices on Failed Credit           Check  check box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences (SO101000) form to         indicate to the system that all invoices that fail the credit check should get the  Credit           Hold  status. For invoices with the  Credit Hold  status, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO505000|SO505000]) Process Invoices and Memos (SO505000) form, you can periodically perform the  Release           from Credit Hold  action, which initiates a credit check and opens the invoices of         those customers who have paid their outstanding balances fully or partially or have extended         the credit limits. ]]></column>

During the processing of orders, you may need to print copies of the processed documents. The printer the system uses for printing documents, must be configured, as described in [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__mng_Configuring_DeviceHub_Tool|Configuring Hardware Devices in DeviceHub]. The following sections describe which printable Sales Orders documents you can prepare in Acumatica ERP.{br}{TOC}
==Printing Orders and Quotes==
You can print a sales order or quote by clicking the '''Reports &gt; Print Sales Order/Quote''' action on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. This action opens the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\SO_64_10_10|Sales Order] ([~/?ScreenId=SO641010|SO641010]) report form with the printable form of the order or quote.
==Printing Pick Lists==
A pick list is a document that is printed for a warehouse worker. It contains the lines from the shipment with quantities, lot or serial numbers of items, and warehouse locations from which the items have to be collected; a pick list does not contain information about prices. The pick list is prepared based on item availability information and the pick priorities of warehouse locations. If the highest priority location has insufficient stock of any of the requested items, the system will search for another location with some quantity available for shipping to fill the remainder. On a pick list, items are ordered based on location, pick priority, and expiration dates of items. {br}

With Acumatica ERP, you can print a pick list for a particular shipment with the ''On Hold'' or ''Open'' status by clicking '''Action''' > '''Print Pick List''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form. For a step-by-step procedure on how to print a pick list for a particular shipment, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Print_Pick_List|To Print a Pick List for a Shipment].{br}

If you need to print pick lists for multiple shipments, you can select the ''Print Pick List'' action on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_30_00|Process Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO503000|SO503000]) form and process all the shipments on the list or only the selected shipments. For a step-by-step procedure on how to mass-print pick lists for multiple shipments, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Print_PickLists|To Print Pick Lists for Multiple Shipments].((({S:Warn}If a pick list was once printed for a shipment, the shipment will be listed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_30_00|Process Shipments] form for this processing only if the '''Show Printed''' check box is selected—this helps avoid double packing for the same shipment.
)))
==Printing Shipment Confirmations==
You can print a shipment confirmation for a particular shipment by clicking '''Reports &gt; Print Shipment Confirmation''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form. This action opens the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\SO_64_20_00|Shipment Confirmation] ([~/?ScreenId=SO642000|SO642000]) report form with the printable form of the shipment confirmation. For a step-by-step procedure on how to print a shipment confirmation, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_PrintShConfirm|To Print a Shipment Confirmation].{br}

For multiple shipments, you can print shipment confirmations by using the ''Print Shipment Confirmation'' action on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_30_00|Process Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO503000|SO503000]) form. For a step-by-step procedure on how to mass-print shipment confirmations, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Print_Confirmations|To Print Shipment Confirmations for Multiple Shipments].
==Printing Sales Orders Invoices==
You can print a Sales Orders invoice by clicking '''Reports &gt; Print Invoice''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form. This action opens the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\SO_64_30_00|Invoice / Memo] ([~/?ScreenId=SO643000|SO643000]) report form with the printable form of the Sales Orders invoice.{br}

You can mass-print multiple invoices by using the ''Print Invoices'' action on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_50_00|Process Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=SO505000|SO505000]) form. ]]></column>

When a company is integrating its e-commerce system with Acumatica ERP, sales orders and their applied payments are imported to Acumatica ERP. The payment amounts are then transferred to the SO invoices created for these sales orders. In some cases, a small discrepancy can occur between the payment amount applied to a sales order and the amount of SO invoice created for this sales order (for example, as a result of the system recalculating the applicable taxes in the SO invoice). You can configure the system to write off these small discrepancies automatically when the SO invoice is released.{br}

You configure the system to automatically generate adjustments on small discrepancies by doing the following:[anchor|#_ead0d004-8292-415a-b8ee-7977fc87a9a8]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_20_25_00|Chart of Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=GL202500|GL202500]) form, you configure an expense account (and subaccount, if needed) to be used for the small amounts that are written off.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_21_10_00|Reason Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS211000|CS211000]) form, you configure a reason code that specifies the account and subaccount to be used for writing off balances. For details, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__HOW_Add_Reason_Code|To Configure a Reason Code].
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]), you specify the reason code that you have configured in the '''Balance Write-Off Reason Code''' box. By default, the system will use this reason code for writing off balances.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form, you select a particular sales order type, and you allow write-offs for the orders of this type by selecting the '''Auto Write-Off''' check box on the '''General Settings''' tab.
#For each customer for whose documents you want to allow write-offs, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form, you select the customer, and then you do the following on the '''General Info''' tab:
##To allow write-offs for the documents for which this customer is selected, you select the '''Enable Write-Offs''' check box.
##:((({S:Warn}On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_10_00|Customer Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR201000|AR201000]) form, you can specify that write-offs are enabled (or not enabled) by default for customers of a particular class. (If needed, you can modify the default setting for any customer of the class.)
)))
##In the '''Write-Off Limit''' box, you specify the customer&rsquo;s write-off limit. The system processes a write-off for an invoice to the customer only if the calculated discrepancy does not exceed the customer&rsquo;s write-off limit.

After you configure the listed entities and settings, the system will automatically calculate small write-offs for SO invoices that are prepared for the orders of the order type for which you enabled write-offs, if the payment amount differs from the invoice amount, and this difference does not exceed the write-off limit specified for the customer. {br}

The write-off amount can be either positive (if the invoice amount is greater than the amount of its applied payment or payments) or negative (if the invoice amount is less than the amount of applied payment or payments). You can correct the calculated write-off amount, if needed, before releasing the SO invoice. When the SO invoice is released, the write-off amount is posted to the account specified in the reason code. Accounts are affected as shown below.[anchor|#table_mlv_rfv_5m]

Note that if a payment is applied to multiple sales orders, the system automatically creates a write-off only on the closing of the last payment application for the invoice that is related to the last sales order to which the payment is applicable. If multiple payments are applied to the same sales order, then the system writes off the discrepancy for the last payment application (the one that causes the SO invoice and the last payment to be closed).{br}

Also, you can manually process small write-offs by entering them directly on the '''Documents to Apply''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_20_00|Payments and Applications] ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) form before applying a payment. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__CON_PaymentApplication|Invoice Payments: Manual Payment Application].

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
Based on where items are ordered from, they may be subject to particular sales taxes. The rate and the amount of the sales taxes that apply to sales orders and SO invoices can depend on many factors, including the types of items purchased, the delivery address of the customer, the address of the selling branch, and the business presence of your organization in the customer location.{br}

If automatic calculation of taxes is configured in your system, the system determines the applicable taxes for each sales order or invoice based on the tax categories of the items sold and the tax zones assigned to customer locations. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Financials\Taxes_TaxZones_and_Categories_Mapref|Creating Tax Zones and Tax Categories]. {br}

With Acumatica ERP, to minimize tax-related errors that users make when they enter sales orders, cash sales, and invoices, you can provide default values for the tax zones used for tax calculation, as described in this topic.{br}{TOC}
==Sales Taxes on Sales Orders==
You enter customers&rsquo; sales orders on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. The system inserts the default tax zone (displayed in the '''Customer Tax Zone''' box on the '''Financial Details''' tab) into the sales order, copying it as follows:[anchor|#ol_qlt_w2h_2l]
#From the tax zone specified for the opportunity on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) form if the order has been created from an opportunity that has a tax zone specified.
#From the tax zone of the customer location, if one has been specified. Tax zones for customer locations can be specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_20|Customer Locations] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303020|AR303020]).
#From the tax zone determined by the ZIP code of the '''Ship To''' location specified in the sales order if no tax zone has been specified for this customer location and if the sales order will be shipped by an integrated carrier.
#:((({S:Warn}In the order, the ship via code denotes how the order is shipped. To check whether the ship via code denotes a delivery method of a common carrier, use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_75_00|Ship via Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]) form.
)))
#From the tax zone associated with the selling branch, which is specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_20_00|Branches] ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) form, if no tax zone has been specified for this customer location and if the order will not be shipped by an integrated carrier. If the ''Branch Accounting'' feature is not activated on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the tax zone assigned to your organization on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) form is used.
{br}

If you know exactly which tax zone should be used for a specific sales order, you can override the default setting and select it in the '''Customer Tax Zone''' box.
==Taxes Applicable to Freight Sales==
If your company provides freight as an additional service that is subject to taxes, you configure a ship via code for the shipping options provided by your company (that is, a ship via code with the '''Common Carrier''' check box cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_75_00|Ship via Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]) form), in the ship via code settings, you can specify the appropriate tax category that applies to freight. The list of taxes that apply to the freight includes the taxes that are present both in the tax category of the ship via code and in the tax zone of the branch that sold the goods. {br}

If the goods are being shipped by an integrated carrier, the tax category is applied to only the amount of freight that exceeds the freight cost. The list of taxes applied to the specified amount consists of the taxes from both the tax category and the tax zone of the customer&rsquo;s delivery address (the specified tax zone of the customer location or, if one has not been specified, the tax zone automatically determined by the ZIP code of the delivery address). 
==Sales Taxes on Sales Orders Invoices==
When a sales order is shipped, the system generates an SO invoice, which you can view on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form. For these invoices, the system copies all the details from the associated sales orders. Sales orders with different tax zones cannot be added to the same invoice. When you mass-create invoices for multiple sales orders by using the ''Prepare Invoice'' action on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) form, the system groups the sales orders by tax zone.((({S:Warn}When a user mass-prepares invoices to a customer that is assigned to the tax zone configured for Avalara, shipments that have different ship-to addresses can be consolidated into one SO invoice.
)))
Also, you can manually create invoices to bill customers for services rendered, or you can enter cash sales when the customer immediately pays for the services. You can create an invoice by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) or the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form. Cash sales can be created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_40_00|Cash Sales] ([~/?ScreenId=AR304000|AR304000]) form. {br}

The system inserts the default tax zone for the accounts receivable or SO invoice or cash sale (displayed in the '''Customer Tax Zone''' box on the '''Financial Details''' tab of the applicable form), copying it as follows:[anchor|#ol_npz_xch_2l]
#From the tax zone specified for the opportunity on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) form if the order has been created from an opportunity that has a tax zone specified.
#From the tax zone of the customer location specified on the document. Tax zones for customer locations can be selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_20|Customer Locations] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303020|AR303020]) form.
#From the tax zone associated with the selling branch if no tax zone is specified for this customer location. If the ''Branch Accounting'' feature is not activated on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the tax zone assigned to your organization on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_20_00|Branches] ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) form is used. 

If you know exactly which tax zone should be used on a specific invoice or cash sale document, you can override the default tax zone and select it in the '''Customer Tax Zone''' box.{br}

On release of the SO invoice, the system generates a batch of the following general ledger transactions.[anchor|#table_wlz_zx5_rr]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="33%" ! Account
!width="33%" ! Debit

|- 
| Tax Payable account
| 
| Tax amount
|}
==Tax Calculation with Specialized Third-Party Software==
If your system is integrated with the AvaTax service of Avalara or another third-party tax calculation software, the applicable taxes are calculated by this service or software and recorded to the sales order or invoice when you save the document. {br}

Once you remove a sales order or a SO invoice from hold, the system checks whether the customer location specified in the document is in the tax zone configured for the tax calculation software. If so, the system sends a request to the tax calculation software to determine the applicable taxes, based on the customer location address, entity code, available exemption certificates, and tax rules (if any). The tax amounts computed by the tax calculation software are sent to Acumatica ERP and can be reviewed on the '''Tax Details''' tab of the document entry form. ((({S:Warn}For sales orders, the taxes are shown for informational purposes only. Only taxes on invoices are actually reported. 
)))
The way the system applies taxes depends on the settings of the origin ('''From''') and destination ('''To''') addresses specified in a document (sales order or invoice). For the addresses that are specified in the document header, the system inserts the address of the company branch (as specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_20_00|Branches] ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) form) as the '''From''' address, and the address of the customer location specified in the document as the '''To''' address. {br}

The system inserts the '''From''' and '''To''' addresses of each sales order line by using the following rules:[anchor|#ul_f5j_hwd_5db]
*If the customer picks up the ordered item directly from a warehouse (that is, if the '''Will Call''' check box is selected on the '''Shipping Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form), the system uses the '''From''' and '''To''' addresses of the warehouse selected in the sales order line, as specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form.
*If the ordered item is shipped via a common carrier (that is, if the '''Will Call''' check box is cleared on the '''Shipping Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form), the system uses the warehouse address as the '''From''' address and the '''Ship-To''' address of the sales order as the '''To''' address.

In the lines of sales orders marked for drop-shipment, the system inserts the address of the default location of the vendor as the '''From''' address. The system inserts the '''Ship-To''' address specified in the sales order as the '''To''' address. In each related line of the drop-ship invoice, the system uses the vendor&rsquo;s location address in the related purchase receipt as the '''From''' address. The system inserts the '''Ship-To''' address in the related purchase order as the '''To''' address.
In a direct SO invoice, the system uses the '''From''' and '''To''' addresses of the warehouse selected in the sales order line, as specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form.
In an SO invoice that was created from a sales order, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form, the system uses the following rules to insert the from and ship-to information: [anchor|#_7013f79c-5b39-402d-95cb-101b32c478af]
*In the document header, the system uses the address of the company branch as the '''From''' address, and the '''Ship-To''' address of the SO invoice as the '''To''' address.
*In the document lines, if the SO invoice was prepared from a sales order that requires shipment, the system uses the address of the warehouse specified in the line as the '''From''' address, and the '''Ship-To''' address of the shipment as the '''To''' address.
*In the document lines, if the SO invoice was prepared from an order that does not require shipment, the system uses the address of the warehouse or branch specified in the line as the '''From''' address, and the '''Ship-To''' address of the sales order as the '''To''' address.
*If the SO invoice was prepared for multiple shipments, for each line, the system uses the address specified for the line in the corresponding shipment.
*:((({S:Warn}If multiple shipments or sales orders with different addresses are included in the SO invoice, the system selects the '''Multiple Ship-To Addresses''' check box on the '''Address Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] form. 
)))
*In a line added to the SO invoice without a link to sales order or shipment, the system inserts the address of the company branch as the '''From''' address, and the '''Ship-To''' address of the SO invoice as the '''To''' address.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Tax Application in Sales Documents Based on where items are ordered from, they may be subject to particular sales taxes. The rate     and the amount of the sales taxes that apply to sales orders and SO invoices can depend on many     factors, including the types of items purchased, the delivery address of the customer, the     address of the selling branch, and the business presence of your organization in the customer     location. If automatic calculation of taxes is configured in your system, the system determines the     applicable taxes for each sales order or invoice based on the tax categories of the items sold     and the tax zones assigned to customer locations. For more information, see  Creating Tax Zones and Tax Categories.  With  Acumatica ERP,     to minimize tax-related errors that users make when they enter sales orders, cash sales, and     invoices, you can provide default values for the tax zones used for tax calculation, as     described in this topic. Sales Taxes on Sales Orders You enter customers' sales orders on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form. The     system inserts the default tax zone (displayed in the  Customer Tax Zone      box on the  Financial Details  tab) into the sales order, copying it as      follows: From the tax zone specified for the opportunity on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) Opportunities       (CR304000) form if the order has been created from an opportunity that has a tax zone       specified. From the tax zone of the customer location, if one has been specified. Tax zones for       customer locations can be specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303020|AR303020]) Customer Locations (AR303020). From the tax zone determined by the ZIP code of the  Ship To  location       specified in the sales order if no tax zone has been specified for this customer location and       if the sales order will be shipped by an integrated carrier. In the order, the ship via        code denotes how the order is shipped. To check whether the ship via code denotes a delivery        method of a common carrier, use the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]) Ship via Codes (CS207500)       form. From the tax zone associated with the selling branch, which is specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) Branches (CS102000) form, if no tax zone has been specified for this       customer location and if the order will not be shipped by an integrated carrier. If the         Branch Accounting  feature is not activated on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features       (CS100000) form, the tax zone assigned to your organization on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) Companies (CS101500) form is used. If you know exactly which tax zone should be used for a specific sales order, you can override     the default setting and select it in the  Customer Tax Zone  box. Taxes Applicable to Freight Sales If your company provides freight as an additional service that is subject to taxes, you     configure a ship via code for the shipping options provided by your company (that is, a ship via     code with the  Common Carrier  check box cleared on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]) Ship via Codes (CS207500) form), in the ship via code settings, you     can specify the appropriate tax category that applies to freight. The list of taxes that apply     to the freight includes the taxes that are present both in the tax category of the ship via code     and in the tax zone of the branch that sold the goods.  If the goods are being shipped by an integrated carrier, the tax category is applied to only     the amount of freight that exceeds the freight cost. The list of taxes applied to the specified     amount consists of the taxes from both the tax category and the tax zone of the customer's     delivery address (the specified tax zone of the customer location or, if one has not been     specified, the tax zone automatically determined by the ZIP code of the delivery address).  Sales Taxes on Sales Orders Invoices When a sales order is shipped, the system generates an SO invoice, which you can view on the        ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form. For these invoices, the system copies all the     details from the associated sales orders. Sales orders with different tax zones cannot be added     to the same invoice. When you mass-create invoices for multiple sales orders by using the       Prepare Invoice  action on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) Process Orders (SO501000) form, the     system groups the sales orders by tax zone. When a user mass-prepares invoices to a customer that is assigned to the tax zone     configured for Avalara, shipments that have different ship-to addresses can be consolidated into     one SO invoice. Also, you can manually create invoices to bill customers for services rendered, or you can     enter cash sales when the customer immediately pays for the services. You can create an invoice     by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) or the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices     (SO303000) form. Cash sales can be created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR304000|AR304000]) Cash Sales (AR304000)     form.  The system inserts the default tax zone for the accounts receivable or SO invoice or cash sale     (displayed in the  Customer Tax Zone  box on the  Financial      Details  tab of the applicable form), copying it as follows: From the tax zone specified for the opportunity on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) Opportunities      (CR304000) form if the order has been created from an opportunity that has a tax zone      specified. From the tax zone of the customer location specified on the document. Tax zones for customer      locations can be selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303020|AR303020]) Customer Locations (AR303020) form. From the tax zone associated with the selling branch if no tax zone is specified for this      customer location. If the  Branch Accounting  feature is not activated on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, the tax zone assigned to your organization on the         ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) Branches (CS102000) form is used.  If you know exactly which tax zone should be used on a specific invoice or cash sale document,     you can override the default tax zone and select it in the  Customer Tax      Zone  box. On release of the SO invoice, the system generates a batch of the following general ledger     transactions. Account Debit Credit Accounts Receivable account Amount + Tax Amount Sales account Amount Tax Payable account Tax amount Tax Calculation with Specialized Third-Party Software If your system is integrated with the AvaTax service of Avalara or another third-party tax     calculation software, the applicable taxes are calculated by this service or software and     recorded to the sales order or invoice when you save the document.  Once you remove a sales order or a SO invoice from hold, the system checks whether the     customer location specified in the document is in the tax zone configured for the tax     calculation software. If so, the system sends a request to the tax calculation software to     determine the applicable taxes, based on the customer location address, entity code, available     exemption certificates, and tax rules (if any). The tax amounts computed by the tax calculation     software are sent to  Acumatica ERP     and can be reviewed on the  Tax Details  tab of the document entry form.  For sales orders, the taxes are shown for informational purposes only. Only taxes on     invoices are actually reported.  The way the system applies taxes depends on the settings of the origin      ( From ) and destination ( To ) addresses specified     in a document (sales order or invoice). For the addresses that are specified in the document     header, the system inserts the address of the company branch (as specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) Branches (CS102000) form) as the  From  address, and the     address of the customer location specified in the document as the  To      address.  The system inserts the  From  and  To  addresses of     each sales order line by using the following rules: If the customer picks up the ordered item directly from a warehouse (that is, if the        Will Call  check box is selected on the  Shipping       Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form), the system      uses the  From  and  To  addresses of the warehouse      selected in the sales order line, as specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses      (IN204000) form. If the ordered item is shipped via a common carrier (that is, if the  Will       Call  check box is cleared on the  Shipping Settings  tab of      the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders form), the system uses the warehouse address as the        From  address and the  Ship-To  address of the      sales order as the  To  address. In the lines of sales orders marked for drop-shipment, the system inserts the address of the     default location of the vendor as the  From  address. The system inserts     the  Ship-To  address specified in the sales order as the       To  address. In each related line of the drop-ship invoice, the system     uses the vendor's location address in the related purchase receipt as the       From  address. The system inserts the  Ship-To      address in the related purchase order as the  To  address. In a direct SO invoice, the system uses the  From  and       To  addresses of the warehouse selected in the sales order line, as     specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses (IN204000) form. In an SO invoice  that was     created from a sales order , on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000)     form, the system uses the following rules to insert the from and ship-to information:  In the document header, the system uses the address of the company branch as the        From  address, and the  Ship-To  address of the SO      invoice as the  To  address. In the document lines, if the SO invoice was prepared from a sales order that requires      shipment, the system uses the address of the warehouse specified in the line as the        From  address, and the  Ship-To  address of the      shipment as the  To  address. In the document lines, if the SO invoice was prepared from an order that does not require      shipment, the system uses the address of the warehouse or branch specified in the line as the        From  address, and the  Ship-To  address of the      sales order as the  To  address. If the SO invoice was prepared for multiple shipments, for each line, the system uses the      address specified for the line in the corresponding shipment. If multiple shipments or       sales orders with different addresses are included in the SO invoice, the system selects the         Multiple Ship-To Addresses  check box on the  Address        Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices form.  In a line added to the SO invoice without a link to sales order or shipment, the system      inserts the address of the company branch as the  From  address, and the        Ship-To  address of the SO invoice as the  To       address.

A third-party carrier used to deliver products from your company to a customer can charge your company specific freight amounts that depend on the weights or volumes of the packages in shipments. The carrier may also set restrictions on the weight or volume of packages. Landed costs incurred for shipments delivered from vendors to your company can be allocated by the weight or volume of the items in the shipment. {br}

In Acumatica ERP, you can configure the system to automatically calculate freight charges or suggest a box for packing the order for shipping based on the total weight and volume of stock and non-stock items in this order. Base units of weight and volume, which are used by default for each inventory item, are specified in the configuration settings of a company on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) form. For each particular inventory item, you can specify the weight and volume (and, optionally, change the units of weight and volume) on the '''Packaging''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. For each item, its ordered quantity specified in the sales units is calculated in the base units and multiplied by the weight of the base unit. You can view the calculated weight and volume totals for a sales order on the '''Totals''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. For more information on specifying base and item units of measure, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_BaseWeightVolumeUOMs|Units of Weight and Volume].{br}

If freight calculation is configured for a sales order, the system calculates freight charges by using freight rates that are based on the total shipment weight and (optionally) volume. The weight of a shipment is compared to break points, and the first one that is less than the shipment weight provides the freight rate. For more information on calculating freight charges, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\CS__con_Freight_Calculation|Freight Calculation].{br}

If the ''Automatic Packaging'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the system uses the packaging options of the ship via code and the items' weight and volume to determine the set of boxes for each shipment. If integration with any of the nationwide carriers is also configured, you can select the best rates for boxes and print labels with tracking numbers for each package.

Each order type has its own posting settings that specify to which accounts and subaccounts specific General Ledger transactions should be posted during the processing of orders of this order type. The following sections describe which accounts and subaccounts you can specify to be used for posting.{br}{TOC}
==Posting Settings of Order Types==
The system can obtain the accounts for transactions generated during the processing of a sales order from several sources, depending on the policies established in your company. For each order type, you can specify the source of the following accounts: [anchor|#ul_y31_vm3_kdb]
*The sales account (of the ''Income'' type) and subaccount to be used for each inventory item that is sold and issued from your company&rsquo;s inventory. The system can obtain the sales account from the settings of the inventory item, warehouse (if applicable), posting class, customer location (if applicable), or the reason code.
*:((({S:Warn}This setting overrides the posting settings of a sales account specified in the posting class assigned to an item.
)))
*The freight account (of the ''Income'' type) and subaccount to be used for recording the freight revenue for each item sold. The system can obtain the freight account from the settings of the order type, customer location (if applicable), or ship via code.
*The discount account (of the ''Income'' type) and subaccount to be used for recording the discounts provided for an order of this type. The system can obtain the discount account from the settings of the order type or the customer location (if applicable).

==Rules for Selecting Subaccounts==
If the ''Subaccounts'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you also need to specify for each order type how the system selects the appropriate subaccounts to be used for transaction posting. By default, for the subaccounts, the system uses the same sources as those for the corresponding accounts (as summarized in the previous section). You can configure the posting settings in an order type to combine the segment values of multiple subaccount segments from different sources to get subaccounts that would perfectly reflect all the details of the transaction. For more details on the rules for combining subaccounts, see [HelpRoot_Financials\config_Combined_Subaccounts_GeneralInfo|Combined Subaccounts: General Information].

The type of purchasing transaction for which a buyer pays at the time of delivery is generally referred to as ''cash on delivery (COD)'' or, because other methods of payment besides cash might be involved, ''collect on delivery (COD)''. Acumatica ERP provides you with functionality that you can use to account for payments made on delivery. {br}

This topic describes the basic workflow when you process a purchase order to be paid on delivery.
==Basic Process==
To process a purchase order that will be paid on delivery, you perform the following general steps:[anchor|#ol_zqc_nxg_bq]
#''Create a purchase order.''
#:On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, create a purchase order. Select the vendor, and provide all the required details about the goods and services to be purchased. Save the order. 
#:((({S:Warn}Depending on your company&rsquo;s policies, additional steps might follow the creation of the purchase order—for instance, for approval of the order.
)))
#''Create a prepayment request linked to the purchase order.''
#:While you are viewing the purchase order, on the '''Actions''' menu, select ''Create Prepayment''. The system opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form, with information filled in for a new prepayment request from the purchase order; the reference number of the purchase order is shown in the '''Vendor Ref.''' box. Save the prepayment request. For more details, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AP__how_Entering_a_Prepayment|To Enter a Prepayment in the Simplified Way]. Release the prepayment request.
#:((({S:Warn}An unreleased prepayment request is synchronized with a purchase order as follows: If you edit the details of the purchase order, the prepayment request is changed accordingly.
)))
#:Open the purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, and make sure that the reference number of the prepayment request is shown in the '''Prepayment Ref. Nbr.''' box. 
#''Prepare an AP check''.
#:On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form, open the prepayment request, and click ''Pay Bill/Apply Adjustment'' on the '''Actions''' menu. This action opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_20_00|Checks and Payments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP302000|AP302000]) form with information filled in for a new AP check, which is ready to be saved. Save and release the check.
#''Create a receipt for the purchase order''.
#:Once the goods are received and payment is made, you can create a receipt in either of the following ways:
#*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form, open the original purchase order. On the''' Actions''' menu, select '''Create Receipt'''. This opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] form with a ready-to-save receipt.
#*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] form, specify the vendor, and on the table toolbar of the '''Details''' tab, click '''Add PO'''. Select the original purchase order to add to the receipt. 
#:Save the receipt.
#''Release the receipt.''
#: On release of the receipt, the system generates an AP bill, applies prepayment to the purchase order, and changes the status of the purchase order to ''Closed''.

In the Purchase Orders module of Acumatica ERP, many elements on the data entry forms may have default values. If the default values you set are the values your organization uses most frequently, your users will save time and minimize errors. Users can, of course, override these values at any time. {br}

Some default settings are defined within the Purchase Orders module; others are defined in the modules that integrate closely with the Purchase Orders module: Inventory and Accounts Payable. {br}{TOC}
==Default GL Accounts==
To specify the default accounts for use in the Purchase Orders module, use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form. These default accounts include the following ones: 
*Account and subaccount for freight expenses: You need to specify the account and subaccount for the freight expenses incurred in the delivery of purchased goods from vendors. Enter the appropriate '''Freight Expense Account''' and '''Freight Expense Sub.''' values.
*Accounts used for purchase return operations: You can define the accounts and subaccounts used for purchase return operations by assigning a specific reason code for purchase returns in the '''PO Return Reason Code''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] form. Reason codes are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_21_10_00|Reason Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS211000|CS211000]) form.

For a detailed description of other settings that you can use to control the workflow of purchase orders and related documents, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_AffectingProcessingDocs|Changing the Processing of Purchase Documents].
==Vendor Defaults==
Once you select a vendor on a new purchase order, many elements on the order get default values. These values, specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form, are used as default values on data entry forms in the Accounts Payable and Purchase Orders modules. These settings include the following: 
*The currency used by the vendor. The currency can be overridden on particular documents, if this is allowed by vendor settings located on the '''General Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] form.
*The credit terms.
*The shipping terms.
*The vendor&rsquo;s shipping location.
*The carrier used by the vendor.
*The vendor&rsquo;s contact information.
*The payment settings used for payments made to vendors.
*GL accounts and subaccounts used to record expenses, freights, prepayments, and total liability.

A vendor&rsquo;s default settings also include the tax zone, which determines the taxes applicable to goods and services purchased from the vendor. You can also define the minimum and maximum percentage of ordered goods that can be accepted, and the actions to be performed if the ordered quantity differs from the received quantity when the quantities of received goods fall outside the specified range. 
==Inventory Item Defaults==
The inventory item records provide default values for purchase orders and receipts, such as the units of measure, vendor prices, and accounts involved. You can also provide the item settings associated with the specific warehouse that is used in purchase receipts created in the Purchase Orders module, and in the inventory receipts automatically generated to update the costs and availability data of the item. {br}

The default settings for stock items are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. For more information on configuring inventory items, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__mng_Configuring_Basic_Inventory|Configuring Basic Inventory].

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
 Acumatica ERP supports four purchase order types: normal, drop ship, blanket, and standard. For all these types, the same set of statuses is used; however, different processing steps can be configured for purchase orders of different types. {br}

The purchasing process usually starts when you create a purchase order in Acumatica ERP on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. You can add goods to the purchase order and specify the details for each line. The system changes the status of the purchase order during its processing. {br}

The following table describes each of the possible statuses and the ways they fit into purchase order processing; the statuses are listed in the order in which they occur, if applicable. [anchor|#table_cpp_fxt_mt]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="20%" ! Status
!width="80%" ! Description
|- 
| ''On Hold''
| 
A newly created purchase order that does not originate from a change order has a status of ''On Hold''. The system may also assign the purchase order this status if it has been rejected by the person assigned to approve it or if you have selected the '''Hold''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form. The purchase order can be left on hold for future editing, including the addition or removal of lines.{br}

If a purchase order has a line related to a project with the change order workflow enabled, you can select the '''Hold''' check box only if the purchase order has the ''Rejected'' status. You cannot select the '''Hold''' check box for a purchase order that has at least one related change order. For more information about change orders, see [HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_CO_Mapref|Managing Changes in Projects].{br}

When a purchase order is on hold, its totals and quantities of listed goods are not traced or checked. To move the ''On Hold ''purchase order to the next step in its processing and change its status, you clear the '''Hold''' check box. You can turn on the validation of totals for purchase orders of specific types by selecting the relevant check boxes in the '''Validate Total on Entry''' section on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form. This validation (if it is turned on for purchase orders of the specific type) is performed when you clear the '''Hold''' check box for the order.{br}

 Whether or not validation is performed, when you clear this check box, the system changes the status of the purchase order to ''Pending Approval'', ''Pending Printing'', ''Pending Email'', or ''Open'', depending on the purchase order approval rules specified in the system and your required processing steps.
|- 
| ''Pending Approval''
| 
Depending on your organization&rsquo;s approval rules for purchase orders as defined in Acumatica ERP, the status of a purchase order might be changed to ''Pending Approval'' after the '''Hold''' check box has been cleared. This status indicates that the purchase order requires approval. This status remains until all required approvals have been performed.{br}

To approve a purchase order with this status, an authorized user selects '''Actions''' > '''Approve''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form. When the user performing the last (or only) required approval invokes this action, the system changes its status to ''Pending Printing'', ''Pending Email'', or ''Open''.{br}

To reject a purchase order with this status, an authorized user selects '''Actions''' > '''Reject''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form. When this user invokes this action, the system changes its status to ''Rejected''.
|- 
| ''Rejected''
| 
Depending on your organization&rsquo;s approval rules for purchase orders as defined in Acumatica ERP, the status of a purchase order might be changed to ''Rejected'' after an employee who was assigned to approve the purchase order has rejected it.{br}

You can save a purchase order with the ''Rejected'' status with the ''On Hold'' status for further editing by selecting the '''Hold''' check box.
|- 
| ''Pending Printing''
| 
Printing a purchase order is an optional step in purchase order processing that is performed if the vendor prefers to receive printed purchase orders by fax or postal mail. Depending on the vendor settings, the status of the purchase order may be changed to ''Pending Printing'' from ''On Hold'' or ''Pending Approval'' to ''Pending Printing''. To require printing in the purchase order processing steps for a particular vendor, you select the '''Print Order''' check box on the '''Purchase Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form. The '''Printed''' check box on the '''Other Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form shows whether the order has been printed.{br}

A newly created purchase order that originates from a change order is assigned the ''Pending Printing'' status if the vendor&rsquo;s settings require the printing of purchase orders. The system also assigns the ''Pending Printing'' status to a purchase order if the vendor&rsquo;s settings require the printing of purchase orders and the purchase order, which had the ''Open'' status, has been changed by means of change orders.{br}

The ''Pending Printing'' status indicates that an employee must print the purchase order and then send or fax it to the vendor. To print the purchase order, you select '''Reports''' > '''Print Purchase Order''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form. This changes the status of the purchase order to ''Pending Email'' or ''Open''.
|- 
| ''Pending Email''
| 
Emailing a purchase order to the vendor is an optional step in purchase order processing that is performed if the vendor prefers to receive purchase orders by email. Depending on the vendor settings, the status of the purchase order may be changed to ''Pending Email'' from ''On Hold'', ''Pending Approval'', or ''Pending Printing''. To require emailing in the purchase order processing steps for a particular vendor, select the '''Email Order''' check box on the '''Purchase Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] form. The '''Emailed''' check box on the '''Other Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form shows whether the order has been emailed.{br}

A newly created purchase order that originates from a change order is assigned the ''Pending Email'' status if the vendor&rsquo;s settings require the emailing of purchase orders. The system also assigns the ''Pending Email'' status to a purchase order if the vendor&rsquo;s settings require the emailing of purchase orders and the purchase order, which had the ''Open'' status, has been changed by means of change orders.{br}

When a purchase order has the ''Pending Email'' status, the purchase order must be sent by email to the vendor. To complete this step, you select '''Actions''' > '''Email Purchase Order''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form. This changes the order status to ''Open''.
|- 
| ''Canceled''
| 
The status of the purchase order is changed to ''Canceled'' if the purchase order has been canceled by a user selecting '''Actions''' > '''Cancel Order''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form. This status means the purchase order cannot be edited, and no receipts can be created for it.{br}

The canceled purchase order keeps this status unless you change the status to ''On Hold'' by selecting the '''Hold''' check box for it. If the status is changed to ''On Hold'', the document can be edited, and the usual purchase order processing steps can be performed.
|- 
| ''Open''
| 
The status of the purchase order is changed to ''Open'' after any necessary approvals and any other required processing steps (printing the order, emailing it, or both) have been performed for the purchase order. If no approvals or optional processing steps are required, the status of the purchase order changes from ''On Hold'' to ''Open'' when the '''Hold''' check box is cleared.{br}

A newly created purchase order that originates from a change order is assigned the ''Open'' status if the vendor&rsquo;s settings do not require the printing or emailing of purchase orders.{br}

The ''Open'' status means that the quantity of the items on purchase receipts for this purchase order is less than the quantity required to complete the purchase order. In Acumatica ERP, you create the receipts for the ordered and received items by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form.{br}

When a purchase order has the ''Open'' status, the system traces the quantities of items received for the order and displays the item availability information on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_20_00|Inventory Allocation Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) form in accordance with the availability calculation rule assigned to the item class to which the item belongs. This rule is specified for the item class in the '''Availability Calculation Rule''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form.
|- 
| ''Completed''
| 
The status of the purchase order is changed from ''Open'' to ''Completed'' when all the lines of the purchase order have been completed based on the appropriate rules (that is, when the '''Completed''' check box is selected for all the purchase order lines). {br}

Also, you can manually complete the order by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Complete Order''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form.
|- 
| ''Closed''
| 
The status of the purchase order is changed from ''Completed'' to ''Closed'' when all the lines of the order have been received and billed in full.

You can add goods to the purchase     order and specify the details for each line. The system changes the status of the purchase order     during its processing.  The following table describes each of the possible statuses and the ways they fit into     purchase order processing; the statuses are listed in the order in which they occur, if     applicable.  Status Description On Hold A newly created purchase order that does not originate from a change order has a status          of  On Hold . The system may also assign the purchase order this status if it has been          rejected by the person assigned to approve it or if you have selected the            Hold  check box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form. The          purchase order can be left on hold for future editing, including the addition or removal of          lines. If a purchase order has a line related to a project with the change order workflow          enabled, you can select the  Hold  check box only if the purchase          order has the  Rejected  status. You cannot select the  Hold           check box for a purchase order that has at least one related change order. For more          information about change orders, see  Managing Changes in Projects. When a purchase order is on hold, its totals and quantities of listed goods are not          traced or checked. To move the  On Hold  purchase order to the next step in its          processing and change its status, you clear the  Hold  check box. You          can turn on the validation of totals for purchase orders of specific types by selecting the          relevant check boxes in the  Validate Total on Entry  section on the             ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) Purchase Orders Preferences (PO101000) form. This validation (if it is turned on          for purchase orders of the specific type) is performed when you clear the            Hold  check box for the order.  Whether or not validation is performed, when you clear this check box, the system          changes the status of the purchase order to  Pending Approval ,  Pending           Printing ,  Pending Email , or  Open , depending on the purchase order          approval rules specified in the system and your required processing steps. Pending Approval Depending on your organization's approval rules for purchase orders as defined in  Acumatica ERP, the status of a purchase order might be changed to  Pending Approval  after the            Hold  check box has been cleared. This status indicates that the          purchase order requires approval. This status remains until all required approvals have          been performed. To approve a purchase order with this status, an authorized user selects  Actions Approve  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form. When the          user performing the last (or only) required approval invokes this action, the system          changes its status to  Pending Printing ,  Pending Email , or  Open . To reject a purchase order with this status, an authorized user selects  Actions Reject  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form. When this          user invokes this action, the system changes its status to  Rejected . Rejected Depending on your organization's approval rules for purchase orders as defined in  Acumatica ERP, the status of a purchase order might be changed to  Rejected  after an employee          who was assigned to approve the purchase order has rejected it. You can save a purchase order with the  Rejected  status with the  On Hold           status for further editing by selecting the  Hold  check box. Pending Printing Printing a purchase order is an optional step in purchase order processing that is          performed if the vendor prefers to receive printed purchase orders by fax or postal mail.          Depending on the vendor settings, the status of the purchase order may be changed to            Pending Printing  from  On Hold  or  Pending Approval  to  Pending           Printing . To require printing in the purchase order processing steps for a particular          vendor, you select the  Print Order  check box on the            Purchase Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors (AP303000) form. The  Printed  check box on the            Other Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form          shows whether the order has been printed. A newly created purchase order that originates from a change order is assigned the            Pending Printing  status if the vendor's settings require the printing of purchase          orders. The system also assigns the  Pending Printing  status to a purchase order if          the vendor's settings require the printing of purchase orders and the purchase order, which          had the  Open  status, has been changed by means of change orders. The  Pending Printing  status indicates that an employee must print the purchase          order and then send or fax it to the vendor. To print the purchase order, you select  Reports Print Purchase Order  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form. This          changes the status of the purchase order to  Pending Email  or  Open . Pending Email Emailing a purchase order to the vendor is an optional step in purchase order processing          that is performed if the vendor prefers to receive purchase orders by email. Depending on          the vendor settings, the status of the purchase order may be changed to  Pending           Email  from  On Hold ,  Pending Approval , or  Pending Printing . To          require emailing in the purchase order processing steps for a particular vendor, select the            Email Order  check box on the  Purchase           Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors form. The            Emailed  check box on the  Other Information           tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form shows whether the order has been          emailed. A newly created purchase order that originates from a change order is assigned the            Pending Email  status if the vendor's settings require the emailing of purchase          orders. The system also assigns the  Pending Email  status to a purchase order if the          vendor's settings require the emailing of purchase orders and the purchase order, which had          the  Open  status, has been changed by means of change orders. When a purchase order has the  Pending Email  status, the purchase order must be          sent by email to the vendor. To complete this step, you select  Actions Email Purchase Order  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form. This          changes the order status to  Open . Canceled The status of the purchase order is changed to  Canceled  if the purchase order has          been canceled by a user selecting  Actions Cancel Order  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form. This status          means the purchase order cannot be edited, and no receipts can be created for it. The canceled purchase order keeps this status unless you change the status to  On           Hold  by selecting the  Hold  check box for it. If the status is          changed to  On Hold , the document can be edited, and the usual purchase order          processing steps can be performed. Open The status of the purchase order is changed to  Open  after any necessary approvals          and any other required processing steps (printing the order, emailing it, or both) have          been performed for the purchase order. If no approvals or optional processing steps are          required, the status of the purchase order changes from  On Hold  to  Open  when          the  Hold  check box is cleared. A newly created purchase order that originates from a change order is assigned the            Open  status if the vendor's settings do not require the printing or emailing of          purchase orders. The  Open  status means that the quantity of the items on purchase receipts for this          purchase order is less than the quantity required to complete the purchase order. In  Acumatica ERP, you create the receipts for the ordered and received items by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form. When a purchase order has the  Open  status, the system traces the quantities of          items received for the order and displays the item availability information on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) Inventory Allocation Details (IN402000) form in accordance with the availability          calculation rule assigned to the item class to which the item belongs. This rule is          specified for the item class in the  Availability Calculation Rule           box on the  General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000) form. Completed The status of the purchase order is changed from  Open  to  Completed  when all          the lines of the purchase order have been completed based on the appropriate rules (that          is, when the  Completed  check box is selected for all the purchase          order lines).  Also, you can manually complete the order by clicking  Actions Complete Order  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form. Closed The status of the purchase order is changed from  Completed  to  Closed  when          all the lines of the order have been received and billed in full. ]]></column>

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
By using the Purchase Orders module of Acumatica ERP, you can gauge how promptly and completely vendors fulfill the purchase orders. As you create purchase receipts and link them to purchase orders, you can track how the purchase orders are fulfilled.
==Linking Multiple Purchase Receipts to One Purchase Order==
Based on the availability and delivery dates of purchased goods, there may be multiple purchase receipts to fulfill a single purchase order—for example, when the vendor ships the ordered goods in several different lots. In Acumatica ERP, each purchase order can be linked with multiple purchase receipts or a single receipt, based on how you actually receive the goods. {br}

You can create a purchase receipt for the vendor that has supplied the ordered goods by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form and link a purchase receipt to purchase orders of the ''Normal'' or ''Drop-Ship'' types—you can add entire purchase orders to the receipt by using the '''Add Purchase Order Line''' action on the table toolbar, or you can copy separate lines from different purchase orders by using the '''Add Purchase Order Line''' action. If this is a partial receipt of the ordered items and more item quantities are expected, clear the '''Complete PO Line''' check box for the relevant purchase receipt lines.
==Completing an Order Line==
You can configure the system to take a specific action (''Accept but Warn'', ''Accept'', or ''Reject'') if the quantity of the items received from a particular vendor on a receipt is outside the limits specified for this vendor on the '''Purchase Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form. You can specify the minimum and the maximum receipt percents. These settings of the vendor provide the default values for the same-name settings on all purchase orders created for this vendor. On any order, the user can change these values if needed.{br}

With the ''Reject'' action selected on a purchase order line, a receipt cannot be saved if any line item quantity is greater than the maximum receipt quantity or less than the minimum receipt quantity (the minimum and maximum receipt quantities are calculated based on the line&rsquo;s ordered quantity and '''Max. Receipt (%)''' and '''Min. Receipt (%)''', respectively). {br}

With the ''Accept but Warn'', or ''Accept'' action selected, any partial quantities can be accepted. On each subsequent receipt, the system checks whether the order line has been completed by comparing the total received and the threshold quantities. {br}

In addition to the '''Min. Receipt (%)''' and '''Max. Receipt (%)''' values, you can specify the '''Receipt Threshold (%)''' value for the vendor on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] form. The threshold percent will provide the default value for the '''Complete at''' setting for purchase orders of the vendor and will be used as follows: Once the total received quantity is equal to or greater than the threshold quantity, the order line will be automatically completed.((({S:Warn}
When creating a new receipt on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, you can manually complete a line of the linked purchase order by selecting the '''Complete PO Line''' check box on the line of the purchase receipt.
)))
==Tracking the Open Quantity and Balance==
To check on the fulfillment of a purchase order, users can consult the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form, where the system automatically keeps data up to date as receipts are entered. When some purchased goods have not been delivered, the system tracks the open quantity and open balance, which can be found on the '''Other Information''' tab of the form. The open quantity is calculated as the difference between the quantity of ordered goods and the quantity of received goods on this purchase order (for purchase orders having the ''Normal'' or ''Drop-Ship'' type) or as the quantity of the ordered goods and the received quantities on the ''Normal'' type orders that are linked to this purchase order (for ''Blanket'' and ''Standard'' purchase orders if the ''Blanket and Standard Purchase Orders'' feature is enabled in your system). The open balance is calculated as the difference between the total amount of the ordered items and the amount of the received items (included in purchase receipts linked to the purchase order). {br}

When the open quantity and open balance values are calculated, only released receipt documents are taken into account. 
==Closing a Purchase Order==
Once you have received all ordered items, the relevant lines of the purchase order are completed and the '''Completed''' check box is selected for the lines. A purchase order does not receive the ''Closed'' status until all its lines are completed. When all ordered goods have been received on the purchase order (and, thus, all lines are completed), the system changes the purchase order&rsquo;s status to ''Closed''. To manually complete the purchase order lines, you can select the '''Completed''' check box on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form.

If the ''Blanket and Standard Purchase Orders'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the orders of the ''Blanket'' and ''Standard'' type become available for processing. {br}{TOC}
==Standard Orders==
Standard purchase orders are used as templates for normal orders. If your company regularly purchases from a vendor the same list of products in the same quantities, you can create a standard purchase order with those items listed in the required quantities by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. {br}

You can create multiple normal purchase orders that reference the standard purchase order. To do this, you add the entire standard sales order to a new normal purchase order, or add several lines from the standard sales order to a normal purchase order and edit the resulting item quantities. {br}

Unlike blanket purchase orders, standard orders have no expiration date, and their status does not change to ''Closed'' when all goods in the related normal orders are received. The quantities of items on standard orders do not update the items&rsquo; availability data. 
==Blanket Orders==
Blanket purchase orders are created for a longer time interval or a larger quantity of goods than your company currently needs. You may choose to order goods in larger volumes for reserved stock if considerable volume discounts are offered or the specified goods are not always available from the vendor. A blanket order has expiration date after which the order cannot be used for generating normal orders. {br}

A blanket order can be fulfilled through multiple normal orders. To do this, you create purchase orders with the ''Normal'' type that reference the blanket order. In this case, the open quantity on the blanket order is reduced by the quantity specified in the purchase orders with the ''Normal'' type, and the price is transferred to normal orders from the blanket order. When the entire quantity of goods included in the blanket order is purchased and received through normal orders, the blanket order&rsquo;s status changes to ''Closed''.

Drop-ship purchase orders are used for goods that will be delivered directly from the vendor to the customer that ordered the goods from your company. These goods are not received in the inventory at your company. Orders of this type are available only if the ''Drop Shipments'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. {br}

To create a drop-ship purchase order, you create a new purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form and select the ''Drop Ship'' type. If there are sales orders for the items your company plans to purchase from the vendor, you can create a drop-ship order by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_50_00|Create Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) form. Once you select an item and a vendor for a new drop-ship order, sales orders (if they include a line with the selected inventory item that has the '''Mark for PO''' check box selected) are available for selection and can be added as document lines on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_50_00|Create Purchase Orders] form. For details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\OrderMgmt_Drop_Shipment_Sale_GeneralInfo|Sales with Drop Shipment: General Information]. You can also add lines with the ''Service'' line type to drop-ship purchase orders to record extra charges without generating another invoice for the customer. {br}{TOC}
==Processing Different Line Types in Drop-Ship Orders==
Drop-ship orders can include lines of different types. The type a particular line has depends on the settings of the item selected in the '''Inventory ID''' box; the system processes lines of different types in different ways. The following line types are available in drop-ship orders:[anchor|#ul_vpl_d5k_x1b]
*''Goods for Drop-Ship'': The system assigns this line type to all stock items. Lines of this type are copied to purchase receipts, where each ''Goods for Drop-Ship'' line must be linked to a sales order document. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\OrderMgmt_Drop_Shipment_Sale_GeneralInfo|Sales with Drop Shipment: General Information].
*''Non-Stock for Drop-Ship'': The system assigns this line type to non-stock items that have both the '''Require Receipt''' and '''Require Shipment''' check boxes selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. Lines of this type are copied to purchase receipts, where each ''Non-Stock for Drop-Ship'' line must be linked to a sales order document. 
*''Non-Stock'': The system assigns this line type to non-stock items that have the '''Require Receipt''' check box selected and the '''Require Shipment''' check box cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form. The ''Non-Stock'' lines are copied to purchase receipts and do not need to be linked to a sales order document.
*''Service'': The system assigns this line type to non-stock items that have the '''Require Receipt''' check box cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form, and to lines in which no '''Inventory ID''' is specified. The way the system processes ''Service'' lines in drop-ship orders depends on whether the '''Process Service Lines from Drop-Ship Purchase Orders via Purchase Receipt''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form. For more details, see the next section.
*''Freight'': You can add a line without an '''Inventory ID''' specified and select this line type manually to record freight expenses for the order. Lines of this type are copied to purchase receipt, or could be added directly to purchase receipt, and do not need to be linked to a sales order document. The freight amount is posted to the Freight Expense account and subaccount specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] form.
*''Description'': You can add a line without an '''Inventory ID''' specified and select this line type manually. These lines are used for informational purposes. Lines of this type are not copied to purchase receipts.

==Processing Service Lines in Drop-Ship Orders==
Depending on your business processes, you can select which workflow the system should use for processing ''Service'' lines. You select the needed workflow by using the '''Process Service Lines from Drop-Ship Purchase Orders via Purchase Receipt''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form as follows:[anchor|#ul_qb5_mxk_x1b]
*If the check box is selected, you can process ''Service'' lines through purchase receipts: When you create a purchase receipt for the drop-ship purchase order, the non-stock lines of the ''Service'' type that haven&rsquo;t been billed to the vendor yet are copied to the created purchase receipt. You cannot create an Accounts Payable bill for the ''Service'' lines for which the purchase receipt has not been created yet. Also, you can add lines of the ''Service'' type directly to purchase receipts without linking them to a purchase order and sales order.
*:This setting gives you the ability to handle charges added by vendors of drop-ship orders when their goods are delivered to the customer. Your company will absorb these charges without again billing the customer for them. 
*If the check box is cleared (the default setting), processing ''Service'' lines doesn&rsquo;t involve creating a purchase receipt an Accounts Payable bill (or multiple bills) has to be created directly from the drop-ship order. These lines do not have to be linked to a sales order. 
*:((({S:Warn}When you create a purchase receipt for a purchase order with lines of different types, the system does not copy ''Service'' lines to a purchase receipt prepared from a purchase order. Also, ''Service'' lines cannot be added to the purchase receipt manually.
)))

==Approving Drop-Ship Purchase Orders==
Depending on the order processing flows established in your company, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) form to approve drop-ship purchase orders and the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_30_00|Print/Email Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO503000|PO503000]) form to email them to vendors or to print them for sending by mail. Optionally, the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form can be used by the users involved in this processing because the '''Actions''' menu includes the '''Approve''', '''Email Purchase Order''', and '''Print Purchase Order''' menu commands.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Drop-Ship Purchase Orders Drop-ship purchase orders are used for goods that will be delivered directly from the 				vendor to the customer that ordered the goods from your company. These goods are not 				received in the inventory at your company. Orders of this type are available only if 				the  Drop Shipments  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features 				(CS100000) form.  To create a drop-ship purchase order, you create a new purchase order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form and select the  Drop 					Ship  type. If there are sales orders for the items your company plans to 				purchase from the vendor, you can create a drop-ship order by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) Create Purchase Orders (PO505000) form. Once you select an item and a vendor 				for a new drop-ship order, sales orders (if they include a line with the selected 				inventory item that has the  Mark for PO  check box selected) 				are available for selection and can be added as document lines on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) Create Purchase Orders form.

When you add a stock item to a purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, the system inserts ''Goods for IN'' as the line type for this line. If a purchase order includes only stock items that are intended for inventory and not linked to a drop-ship order or any other sales order, its processing involves the creation of a purchase receipt (or multiple receipts if the order is fulfilled by multiple shipments from the vendor) and the preparation of an accounts payable bill. You can configure a particular vendor so that the AP bill for a purchase order can be created before the purchase receipt is processed.{br}

This topic describes how the system processes stock lines added to a purchase order.{br}{TOC}
==Processing of the Purchase Receipt for the Purchase Order==
You can create a receipt for a purchase order by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Enter PO Receipt''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. Alternatively, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, you can create a receipt and link it to an existing purchase order or a particular line of the order by clicking '''Add PO''' or '''Add PO Line''' on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab. You can also allocate the lines with the ''Goods for IN'' line type by clicking '''Allocations''' on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form. {br}

The inventory account that is used for a stock item on a receipt by default is selected according to the '''Use Inventory/Accrual Account from''' setting of the posting class. On release of each purchase receipt linked to the purchase order, the system automatically generates an inventory receipt for the items listed in the purchase receipt and calculates the quantities of the received goods for each order line. These values are displayed in the '''Qty. On Receipts''' column on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form. {br}

For each purchase receipt, you can create an AP bill or multiple bills.
==Processing of the Accounts Payable Bill for the Purchase Order==
The general workflow of processing purchase orders with lines of any type is to process a purchase receipt (if one is needed) before creating an AP bill (see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\OrderMgmt_Standard_Inventory_Purchase_GeneralInfo|Standard Inventory Purchases: General Information] for details). However, if you receive bills from a particular vendor before the ordered items are received to inventory, you can configure this vendor so that for the purchase orders of this vendor, you can create and process an AP bill before the purchase receipt is released. {br}

To do this, you need to select the '''Allow AP Bill Before Receipt''' check box in the vendor settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form; in addition, you can select this check box for a particular vendor location on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_10|Vendor Locations] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303010|AP303010]) form. The state of this check box is copied to each purchase order created for this vendor, and can be reviewed on the '''Other Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. For a detailed description on how to process a purchase order with the associated bill being prepared before the receipt, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\OrderMgmt_Purchase_Bill_Before_Receipt_GeneralInfo|Purchases with Billing Before Receipt: General Information].
==Rules for Closing and Completing Goods for IN Lines=={br}

 A ''Goods for IN'' line of a purchase order is considered closed on release of the purchase receipt or AP bill if the sum of the received quantity for all released purchase receipts prepared for this line is equal to the line quantity in all released AP bills prepared for this line, and the quantity in the AP bill lines is equal to or greater than purchase order line quantity &#42; ('''Complete On %'''/100). The line is also considered closed on release of the purchase receipt or AP bill if the sum of the received quantity for all released purchase receipts prepared for this line is equal to the line quantity in all released AP bills prepared for this line, and the user has selected the '''Completed''' check box manually.{br}

A ''Goods for IN'' line of a purchase order is completed in any of the following cases:[anchor|#_37dda7d2-6f03-479a-870a-e23da8230ea6]
*Automatically if the system has closed the line (that is, if the '''Closed''' check box is selected)
*On release of the purchase receipt prepared for the line if the user has selected the '''Completed''' check box manually
*If the sum of the received quantity for all released purchase receipts prepared for this line is equal to or greater than the quantity of the purchase order line &#42; ('''Complete On %'''/100)

If a user processes the lines of a purchase order partially, multiple related purchase receipts and AP bills can be prepared for a single purchase order. The system determines which purchase order lines should be added to the prepared purchase receipt or AP bill depending on the status of the '''Completed''' and '''Closed''' check boxes in each line, as follows:
*Completed purchase order lines are not added to the purchase receipt.
*Closed lines are added to neither purchase receipts, nor to AP bills.

If all purchase order lines have the '''Completed''' check box selected, and at least one line still has the '''Closed''' check box cleared, the purchase order is assigned the ''Completed'' status. If all purchase order lines have the '''Completed''' and '''Closed''' check boxes selected, the purchase order is assigned the ''Closed'' status.

For each non-stock item, you define whether a purchase receipt is required by selecting or clearing the '''Require Receipt''' check box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form.

In a purchase order line on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, when you select a non-stock item that requires a receipt, the system inserts ''Non-Stock'' as the line type.{br}

Processing a purchase order with ''Non-Stock'' lines always involves creating a receipt (or multiple receipts if the ordered items are not delivered at the same time). When you create a purchase receipt for a purchase order, the system copies all ''Non-Stock'' lines to the purchase receipt. {br}

This topic describes how the system processes purchase order lines for non-stock items requiring receipt.{br}{TOC}
==Processing of the Accounts Payable Bill for the Purchase Order==
The general workflow of processing purchase orders with lines of any type is to process the associated purchase receipt (if one is needed) before the creation of the associated AP bill (see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\OrderMgmt_Standard_Inventory_Purchase_GeneralInfo|Standard Inventory Purchases: General Information] for details). However, if you receive bills from a particular vendor before the purchased items are received to inventory, you can configure this vendor so that for its purchase orders, you can create and process an AP bill before the purchase receipt is released. {br}

To do this, you need to select the '''Allow AP Bill Before Receipt''' check box in the vendor settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form; in addition, you can select this check box for a particular vendor location on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_10|Vendor Locations] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303010|AP303010]) form. The state of this check box will be copied to each purchase order created to this vendor, and can be reviewed on the '''Other Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. For a detailed description on how to process a purchase order with the associated bill being prepared before the receipt, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\OrderMgmt_Purchase_Bill_Before_Receipt_GeneralInfo|Purchases with Billing Before Receipt: General Information].
==Posting Accounts for Non-Stock Lines==
For the ''Non-Stock'' lines on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form, in the '''Account''' column, the system inserts the Expense account defined by the '''Use COGS / Expense Account From''' setting of the posting class specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) form. If the ''Subaccounts'' feature is enabled in your system, the system also inserts the subaccount, which is composed as defined by the '''Combine COGS / Expense Sub From''' setting of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) form, in the '''Sub.''' column of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form. {br}

Accounts and subaccounts are used for processing ''Non-Stock'' lines as follows:[anchor|#ul_okt_f2w_nt]
*When a purchase order is created, the item amount is recorded to the Expense account (with the Expense subaccount).
*When a purchase receipt linked to the purchase order is released, the line amount is moved from the Expense account (with the Expense subaccount) to the PO Accrual account (with the PO Accrual subaccount).
*When a bill is created for the receipt, the amount is moved back from the PO Accrual account (with the PO Accrual subaccount) to the Expense account (with the Expense subaccount).

The Expense and PO Accrual accounts to be used for receipt-related transactions are defined by the posting class of the item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) form; the default accounts assigned to the item on the '''GL Accounts''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form will be used if the posting class's '''Use COGS / Expense Account From''' and '''Use PO Accrual Account From''' settings have the ''Inventory Item'' option selected. The Expense subaccount and PO Accrual subaccount are also defined by the settings of posting class of the item; the default subaccounts assigned to the item on the''' GL Accounts''' tab will be used as the segment value sources for the resulting subaccounts based on the '''Combine COGS / Expense Sub From''' and '''Combine PO Accrual Sub From''' rules. For more information, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Posting_Classes_GeneralInfo|Posting Classes: General Information].
==Rules for Closing and Completing Non-Stock Lines==
The way the lines of the ''Non-Stock'' type are completed and closed depends on the completion rule specified for the applicable non-stock item in the '''Complete PO Line''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. The system determines if a line of the ''Non-Stock'' type should be closed and completed by using the following rules: [anchor|#_857f97f2-07ea-4acf-b261-d816eb8ea88a]
*If ''By Quantity'' is selected in the '''Complete PO Line''' box for the item (the default option for non-stock items of the ''Non-Stock Item'' type), the purchase order line is considered completed in either of the following cases:
**If the sum of the received quantity for the released purchase receipts prepared for the line is equal to or greater than the quantity of the purchase order line &#42; ('''Complete On %'''/100)
**On release of the purchase receipt prepared for the line if the user has selected the '''Completed''' check box manually
*:With the ''By Quantity'' completion rule selected for the item, the line is considered closed on release of the purchase receipt or AP bill if the sum of the received quantity for all released purchase receipts prepared for this line is equal to the line quantity in all released AP bills prepared for this line, and the quantity in the AP bill lines is equal to or greater than purchase order line quantity &#42; ('''Complete On %'''/100). The line is also considered closed on release of the purchase receipt or AP bill if the sum of the received quantity for all released purchase receipts prepared for this line is equal to the line quantity in all released AP bills prepared for this line, and the user has selected the '''Completed''' check box manually in the purchase receipt line. 
*If ''By Amount'' is selected in the '''Complete PO Line''' box for the item (the default option for non-stock items of the ''Labor, Service, Charge'', and ''Expense'' types), the purchase order line is considered completed in either of the following cases:
**Automatically if the system has closed the line (that is, if the '''Closed''' check box is selected)
**On release of the purchase receipt prepared for the line if the user has selected the '''Completed''' check box manually
*:With the ''By Quantity'' completion rule selected for the item, the line is considered closed on release of the purchase receipt or AP bill if the sum of received quantity for all released purchase receipts prepared for this line is equal to the quantity in all released AP bills prepared for this line, and if the amount in the AP bill lines is equal to or greater than the amount of the purchase order line.

If a user processes the lines of a purchase order partially, multiple related purchase receipts and AP bills can be prepared for a single purchase order. The system determines which purchase order lines should be added to the prepared purchase receipt or AP bill depending on the status of the '''Completed''' and '''Closed''' check boxes in each line, as follows:[anchor|#_754bdfa6-cfdc-49aa-b7a9-0552abda029e]
*Completed purchase order lines are not added to the purchase receipt.
*Closed lines are added to neither purchase receipts nor AP bills.

If all purchase order lines have the '''Completed''' check box selected, and at least one line still has the '''Closed''' check box cleared, the purchase order is assigned the ''Completed'' status. If all purchase order lines have the '''Completed''' and '''Closed''' check boxes selected, the purchase order is assigned the ''Closed'' status.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Non-Stock Lines in Purchase Orders For each non-stock item, you define whether a purchase receipt is required by selecting or     clearing the  Require Receipt  check box on the  General      Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form. This setting     affects the processing of non-stock items that are included in purchase orders. In a purchase     order line on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form, when you select     a non-stock item that requires a receipt, the system inserts  Non-Stock  as the line     type. Processing a purchase order with  Non-Stock  lines always involves creating a receipt (or     multiple receipts if the ordered items are not delivered at the same time). When you create a     purchase receipt for a purchase order, the system copies all  Non-Stock  lines to the     purchase receipt.  This topic describes how the system processes purchase order lines for non-stock items     requiring receipt. Processing of the Accounts Payable Bill for the Purchase Order The general workflow of processing purchase orders with lines of any type is to process the     associated purchase receipt (if one is needed) before the creation of the associated AP bill     (see  Standard Inventory Purchases: General Information for details). However, if     you receive bills from a particular vendor before the purchased items are received to inventory,     you can configure this vendor so that for its purchase orders, you can create and process an AP     bill before the purchase receipt is released.  To do this, you need to select the  Allow AP Bill Before Receipt  check     box in the vendor settings on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors (AP303000) form; in addition,     you can select this check box for a particular vendor location on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303010|AP303010]) Vendor Locations (AP303010) form. The state of this check box will be copied to each     purchase order created to this vendor, and can be reviewed on the  Other      Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form. For a     detailed description on how to process a purchase order with the associated bill being prepared     before the receipt, see  Purchases with Billing Before Receipt: General Information. Posting Accounts for Non-Stock Lines For the  Non-Stock  lines on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form, in     the  Account  column, the system inserts the Expense account defined by the       Use COGS / Expense Account From  setting of the posting class specified     on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) Posting Classes (IN206000) form. If the  Subaccounts  feature is     enabled in your system, the system also inserts the subaccount, which is composed as defined by     the  Combine COGS / Expense Sub From  setting of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) Posting Classes (IN206000) form, in the  Sub.  column of the        ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form.  Accounts and subaccounts are used for processing  Non-Stock  lines as follows: When a purchase order is created, the item amount is recorded to the Expense account (with      the Expense subaccount). When a purchase receipt linked to the purchase order is released, the line amount is moved      from the Expense account (with the Expense subaccount) to the PO Accrual account (with the PO      Accrual subaccount). When a bill is created for the receipt, the amount is moved back from the PO Accrual account      (with the PO Accrual subaccount) to the Expense account (with the Expense subaccount). The Expense and PO Accrual accounts to be used for receipt-related transactions are defined by     the posting class of the item on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) Posting Classes (IN206000) form; the     default accounts assigned to the item on the  GL Accounts  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items form will be used if the posting class's  Use COGS /      Expense Account From  and  Use PO Accrual Account From      settings have the  Inventory Item  option selected. The Expense subaccount and PO Accrual     subaccount are also defined by the settings of posting class of the item; the default     subaccounts assigned to the item on the  GL Accounts  tab will be used as     the segment value sources for the resulting subaccounts based on the  Combine COGS /      Expense Sub From  and  Combine PO Accrual Sub From  rules. For     more information, see  Posting Classes: General Information. Rules for Closing and Completing Non-Stock Lines The way the lines of the  Non-Stock  type are completed and closed depends on the     completion rule specified for the applicable non-stock item in the  Complete PO      Line  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form. The system     determines if a line of the  Non-Stock  type should be closed and completed by using the     following rules:  If  By Quantity  is selected in the  Complete PO Line  box for the      item (the default option for non-stock items of the  Non-Stock Item  type), the purchase      order line is considered completed in either of the following cases: If the sum of the received quantity for the released purchase receipts prepared for the        line is equal to or greater than the quantity of the purchase order line *         ( Complete On % /100) On release of the purchase receipt prepared for the line if the user has selected the          Completed  check box manually With the  By Quantity  completion rule selected for the item, the line is       considered closed on release of the purchase receipt or AP bill if the sum of the received       quantity for all released purchase receipts prepared for this line is equal to the line       quantity in all released AP bills prepared for this line, and the quantity in the AP bill       lines is equal to or greater than purchase order line quantity * ( Complete On        % /100). The line is also considered closed on release of the purchase receipt or       AP bill if the sum of the received quantity for all released purchase receipts prepared for       this line is equal to the line quantity in all released AP bills prepared for this line, and       the user has selected the  Completed  check box manually in the purchase       receipt line.  If  By Amount  is selected in the  Complete PO Line  box for the      item (the default option for non-stock items of the  Labor, Service, Charge , and        Expense  types), the purchase order line is considered completed in either of the      following cases: Automatically if the system has closed the line (that is, if the          Closed  check box is selected) On release of the purchase receipt prepared for the line if the user has selected the          Completed  check box manually With the  By Quantity  completion rule selected for the item, the line is       considered closed on release of the purchase receipt or AP bill if the sum of received       quantity for all released purchase receipts prepared for this line is equal to the  quantity       in all released AP bills prepared for this line, and if the amount in the AP bill lines is       equal to or greater than the amount of the purchase order line. If a user processes the lines of a purchase order partially, multiple related purchase     receipts and AP bills can be prepared for a single purchase order. The system determines which     purchase order lines should be added to the prepared purchase receipt or AP bill depending on     the status of the  Completed  and  Closed  check boxes     in each line, as follows: Completed purchase order lines are not added to the purchase receipt. Closed lines are added to neither purchase receipts nor AP bills. If all purchase order lines have the  Completed  check box selected, and     at least one line still has the  Closed  check box cleared, the purchase     order is assigned the  Completed  status. If all purchase order lines have the       Completed  and  Closed  check boxes selected, the     purchase order is assigned the  Closed  status. ]]></column>

For each non-stock item, you define whether a purchase receipt is required by selecting or clearing the '''Require Receipt''' check box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. In a purchase order line on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, when you select a non-stock item that does not require receipt, the system inserts ''Service'' as the line type; also, the system inserts the ''Service'' line type in purchase order lines with no item specified. Although the ''Service'' lines are not tracked in inventory and do not require receipt, if you want to list them in purchase receipts for informational purposes, you can configure the system so that these lines are added to purchase receipts.{br}

This topic describes how the system processes ''Service'' lines added to a purchase order, and explains how the lines with these items are completed.{br}{TOC}[anchor|#servlines]
==General Workflow and Related Documents==
 The following diagram illustrates how the ''Service'' lines in purchase orders can be processed depending on the system settings.[anchor|#_5cbad372-ea71-49f0-a976-51e36baa1a61][anchor|#_72644f85-0573-4629-96c9-891ba85ab88d][image:UserGuide/Images/PO_Service_Lines.png|popup|450px]
The remainder of this topic describes in detail the processing steps shown in the diagram and issues related to how this processing unfolds. The processing of the service order consists of the following steps:[anchor|#_8d7c5a90-a14c-4ed8-abd9-78251d245624]
#''Entering a purchase order''
#:You enter a purchase order of the ''Normal'' type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, and you add a ''Service'' line or multiple lines to the order. The reference number for a new purchase order is generated in accordance with the numbering sequence specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form. If the order is created with the ''On Hold'' status, you should clear the '''Hold''' check box for the order to process it further.
#''Conditionally processing ''Service'' lines''
#:The way the system processes ''Service'' lines depends on the state of the '''Process Service Lines from Normal Purchase Orders via Purchase Receipt''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form. 
#:If the check box is cleared (the default setting), processing ''Service'' lines doesn&rsquo;t involve creating a purchase receipt; an AP bill (or multiple bills) has to be created directly from the purchase order (see Step 4). When a user creates a purchase receipt for a purchase order with lines of different types, some of which require receipt and some of which do not require receipt, the system does not copy ''Service'' lines to a purchase receipt that is prepared from this purchase order. Also, in this case, ''Service'' lines cannot be added to the purchase receipt manually.
#''Preparing a purchase receipt (optional)''
#: If the '''Process Service Lines from Normal Purchase Orders via Purchase Receipt''' check box is selected, a purchase receipt is required for the lines of the ''Service'' type. A user creates a purchase receipt from a purchase order by clicking '''Actions &gt; Enter PO Receipt''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form. The prepared purchase receipt is available for reviewing on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form. If the purchase receipt is created with the ''On Hold'' status, you should clear the '''Hold''' check box for the receipt to process it further.
#:As an alternative to creating the purchase receipt while viewing the purchase order, a user can create a new purchase receipt manually and add ''Service'' lines to it by clicking '''Add PO''' or '''Add PO Line''' on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] form and using the dialog box that opens.
#''Preparing an AP bill''
#:You prepare the AP bill by clicking '''Actions &gt; Enter AP Bill''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form. The system brings up the generated AP bill on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form. 

==Processing of the Accounts Payable Bill for the Purchase Order==
The general workflow of processing purchase orders with lines of any type is to process a purchase receipt (if it is needed) before creating an AP bill (see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\OrderMgmt_Standard_Inventory_Purchase_GeneralInfo|Standard Inventory Purchases: General Information] for details). However, if you receive bills from a particular vendor before the ordered items are received to inventory, you can configure this vendor so that for the purchase orders of this vendor, you can create and process an AP bill before the purchase receipt is released. {br}

To do this, you need to select the '''Allow AP Bill Before Receipt''' check box in the vendor settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form; in addition, you can select this check box for a particular vendor location on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_10|Vendor Locations] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303010|AP303010]) form. The state of this check box is copied to each purchase order created for this vendor, and can be reviewed on the '''Other Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. For a detailed description on how to process a purchase order with the associated bill being prepared before the receipt, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\OrderMgmt_Purchase_Bill_Before_Receipt_GeneralInfo|Purchases with Billing Before Receipt: General Information].
==Posting Accounts for Service Lines==
When you add a ''Service'' line to a purchase order on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, in the '''Account''' column, the system inserts the expense account defined by the '''Use COGS / Expense Account''' setting of the posting class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) form. If the'' Subaccounts'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, in the '''Sub.''' column of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form, the system inserts the subaccount composed as defined by the '''Combine COGS / Expense Sub From''' setting of the posting class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) form. 
==Rules for Closing and Completing Service Lines==
The way the lines of the ''Service'' type (including the ''Service'' lines with the '''Inventory ID''' column empty) are completed and closed depends on whether the service lines are processed through receipts, and on the completion rule specified for each non-stock item in the '''Complete PO Line''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. ((({S:Warn}If you change the '''Complete PO Line''' setting for a non-stock item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form, the system does not change this setting for already existing purchase orders; the newly specified setting applies to new purchase orders only. Existing purchase orders will be billed with the settings that were specified when the order was entered.
)))
The system determines if a line of the ''Service'' type should be closed and completed by using the following rules: [anchor|#_88f1e6e2-f406-4a14-8465-5748e51cfe98]
*If the ''Service'' line is processed through a receipt and ''By Amount'' is selected in the '''Complete PO Line''' box for an item, the line is completed automatically when the line is closed or on release of the purchase receipt if the user has selected the '''Completed''' check box manually. The line is closed in either of the following cases: 
**When a purchase receipt for the line is released if a user has selected the '''Complete PO Line''' check box manually in the purchase receipt line on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form.
**When an AP bill for the line is released if the billed quantity for all bills that have been released for this line is equal to or greater than the amount of the purchase order line.
*If the ''Service'' line is processed through a receipt and ''By Quantity'' is selected in the '''Complete PO Line''' box for an item, the line is closed when an AP bill for the line is released if the sum of the line quantities in all released bills for this line is equal to or greater than the quantity of the purchase order line &#42; ('''Complete On %'''/100). The line is completed in the following cases:
**Automatically if the system has closed the line (that is, if the '''Closed''' check box is selected)
**On release of the purchase receipt prepared for the line if the user has selected the '''Completed''' check box manually
**If the sum of the received quantity for the released purchase receipts prepared for the line is equal to or greater than the quantity of the purchase order line &#42; ('''Complete On %'''/100)
*If the ''Service'' line is processed without a receipt and ''By Amount'' is selected in the '''Complete PO Line''' box for the line item, the line is closed on release of the AP bill if the billed amount for all released bills for this line is equal to or greater than the amount of the purchase order line. The line is completed automatically when it is closed.
*If the ''Service'' line is processed without a receipt and ''By Quantity'' is selected in the '''Complete PO Line''' box for the line item, the line is closed on release of the AP bill if the sum of the quantities in released bills for this line is equal to or greater than the quantity of the purchase order line &#42; ('''Complete On %'''/100). The line is completed automatically when it is closed.

If a user processes the lines of a purchase order partially, multiple related purchase receipts and AP bills can be prepared for a single purchase order. The system determines which purchase order lines should be added to the prepared purchase receipt or AP bill depending on the status of the '''Completed''' and '''Closed''' check boxes in each line, as follows:[anchor|#_7aed7b2c-e176-4580-9d67-86bb979340fb]
*Completed purchase order lines are not added to the purchase receipt.
*Closed lines are added to neither purchase receipts nor AP bills.

If all purchase order lines have the '''Completed''' check box selected, and at least one line still has the '''Closed''' check box cleared, the purchase order is assigned the ''Completed'' status. If all purchase order lines have the '''Completed''' and '''Closed''' check boxes selected, the purchase order is assigned the ''Closed'' status.

Preparing an AP bill You prepare the AP bill by clicking  Actions > Enter AP Bill  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form. The system       brings up the generated AP bill on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form.       Processing of the Accounts Payable Bill for the Purchase Order The general workflow of processing purchase orders with lines of any type is to process a         purchase receipt (if it is needed) before creating an AP bill (see  Standard Inventory Purchases: General Information for details). However, if you         receive bills from a particular vendor before the ordered items are received to inventory,         you can configure this vendor so that for the purchase orders of this vendor, you can create         and process an AP bill before the purchase receipt is released.  To do this, you need to select the  Allow AP Bill Before Receipt  check         box in the vendor settings on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors (AP303000) form; in         addition, you can select this check box for a particular vendor location on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303010|AP303010]) Vendor Locations (AP303010) form. The state of this check box is copied to each         purchase order created for this vendor, and can be reviewed on the  Other           Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form. For a         detailed description on how to process a purchase order with the associated bill being         prepared before the receipt, see  Purchases with Billing Before Receipt: General Information. Posting Accounts for Service Lines When you add a  Service  line to a purchase order on the  Document      Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form, in the       Account  column, the system inserts the expense account defined by the       Use COGS / Expense Account  setting of the posting class on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) Posting Classes (IN206000) form. If the  Subaccounts  feature is enabled on the        ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, in the  Sub.  column of     the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form, the system inserts the subaccount composed as defined     by the  Combine COGS / Expense Sub From  setting of the posting class on     the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) Posting Classes (IN206000) form.  Rules for Closing and Completing Service Lines The way the lines of the  Service  type (including the  Service  lines with the            Inventory ID  column empty) are completed and closed depends on         whether the service lines are processed through receipts, and on the completion rule         specified for each non-stock item in the  Complete PO Line  box on the             ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form.  If you change the  Complete PO Line  setting for a non-stock item         on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items form, the system does not change this setting for         already existing purchase orders; the newly specified setting applies to new purchase orders         only. Existing purchase orders will be billed with the settings that were specified when the         order was entered. The system determines if a line of the  Service  type should be closed and completed         by using the following rules:  If the  Service  line is processed through a receipt and  By Amount  is           selected in the  Complete PO Line  box for an item, the line is           completed automatically when the line is closed or on release of the purchase receipt if           the user has selected the  Completed  check box manually. The line is           closed in either of the following cases:  When a purchase receipt for the line is released if a user has selected the                  Complete PO Line  check box manually in the purchase receipt               line on the  Document Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form. When an AP bill for the line is released if the billed quantity for all bills that               have been released for this line is equal to or greater than the amount of the               purchase order line. If the  Service  line is processed through a receipt and  By Quantity  is           selected in the  Complete PO Line  box for an item, the line is           closed when an AP bill for the line is released if the sum of the line quantities in all           released bills for this line is equal to or greater than the quantity of the purchase           order line * ( Complete On % /100). The line is completed in the           following cases: Automatically if the system has closed the line (that is, if the                  Closed  check box is selected) On release of the purchase receipt prepared for the line if the user has selected               the  Completed  check box manually If the sum of the received quantity for the released purchase receipts prepared for               the line is equal to or greater than the quantity of the purchase order line *                 ( Complete On % /100) If the  Service  line is processed without a receipt and  By Amount  is           selected in the  Complete PO Line  box for the line item, the line is           closed on release of the AP bill if the billed amount for all released bills for this line           is equal to or greater than the amount of the purchase order line. The line is completed           automatically when it is closed. If the  Service  line is processed without a receipt and  By Quantity  is           selected in the  Complete PO Line  box for the line item, the line is           closed on release of the AP bill if the sum of the quantities in released bills for this           line is equal to or greater than the quantity of the purchase order line *             ( Complete On % /100). The line is completed automatically when it           is closed. If a user processes the lines of a purchase order partially, multiple related purchase         receipts and AP bills can be prepared for a single purchase order. The system determines         which purchase order lines should be added to the prepared purchase receipt or AP bill         depending on the status of the  Completed  and            Closed  check boxes in each line, as follows: Completed purchase order lines are not added to the purchase receipt. Closed lines are added to neither purchase receipts nor AP bills. If all purchase order lines have the  Completed  check box selected,         and at least one line still has the  Closed  check box cleared, the         purchase order is assigned the  Completed  status. If all purchase order lines have the            Completed  and  Closed  check boxes selected,         the purchase order is assigned the  Closed  status. ]]></column>

You may need to reorder document lines in purchase orders and purchase receipts—for example, if you need the lines of the printed document to be in a specific order other than in the document sent by vendor. Also, you may need to add a new line to a purchase order or purchase receipt at the beginning of a list or in the middle of it. The following sections describe how you can reorder lines in various Purchase Orders documents.{br}{TOC}
==Reordering Lines in Purchase Orders==
The order number of each document line is shown in the '''Line Order''' column on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form for purchase orders, and of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form for purchase receipts. (On both forms, these columns are hidden by default so you should use the '''Column Configuration''' dialog box to make the columns available before you reorder lines.) {br}

Once you reorder the lines, the system automatically regenerates the order numbers for each document line. You can reorder lines in a purchase order that is on hold; in a purchase receipt, you can reorder the lines until this receipt has been released. You can select the lines to be reordered in any combinations, such as the following:[anchor|#ul_r23_c1l_gz]
*A single document line (for example, line 3 or 8). To select a single line, click it. 
*Multiple non-contiguous lines (for example, lines 1, 3, and 7). To select these lines, hold Ctrl while clicking the row selector next to the needed lines.
*A contiguous group of document lines (for example, line 5 through line 9). To select a group of lines, select the first line in the group, and hold Shift while clicking the last line in the group. (Alternatively, you can click the first line and then press Shift+Down Arrow until all the needed lines are selected.)
*A group of some contiguous lines and some non-contiguous lines (for example, line 5 through line 7, and line 10). To select a non-contiguous group of lines, hold Ctrl while clicking the row selector next to the needed lines.

All selected lines are grouped and thus are moved contiguously, even if you have selected multiple non-contiguous document lines. After you have selected the needed lines, move them to the new place in the table in one of the following ways:[anchor|#ul_s23_c1l_gz]
*Drag the selected line or lines to the place where you want to move them. A thin red line between the table lines shows where these lines will be inserted. Once you drag the selected lines, the system moves these lines and regenerates the '''Line Order''' numbers for all the lines in the table.
*When you need to move purchase order or purchase receipt lines between pages, cut the selected document lines and paste them to the new place in the table. To cut the lines, press Ctrl+X, or right-click the table and then click '''Cut Row'''. Then click the line the cut lines should be inserted above, and press Ctrl+V; alternatively, you can right-click the table, and then click '''Insert Cut Row'''. 

Once you reorder the lines, the system automatically regenerates the line number for each document line. For purchase receipts, these numbers are used for numbering lines in the printable reports, such as the printable purchase receipt shown on the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\PO_64_60_00|Purchase Receipt] ([~/?ScreenId=PO646000|PO646000]) report. You can cancel the line reordering by clicking '''Cancel''' on the form toolbar before you save these changes.((({S:Warn}You cannot rearrange lines in the table if custom sorting by any column is applied to the table.
)))
==Inserting Lines into Purchase Orders and Purchase Receipts==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, you can insert a single line anywhere in the document. To do this, click the line above which the new line should be inserted and then press Shift+Insert, or right-click the needed line and then click '''Insert Row'''. The system adds a new blank line. When you finish entering the line information and save your changes, the system automatically regenerates the line numbers for all lines in the table.]]></column>

You may want to change the vendor in the existing purchase order—for example, if you want to compare the order total for different vendors, or if the wrong vendor was selected in the purchase order. To change the vendor, you need to change the vendor ID specified for the purchase order. {br}

You change the vendor ID in the '''Vendor''' box of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form for a purchase order that has the ''On Hold'' status, check the settings of the purchase order that have changed, and save your changes. The following sections describe the settings that are and are not preserved, as well as the restrictions on changing the vendor in a document.
==Settings that Are Preserved When the Vendor Is Changed==
When you change the vendor ID of the purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, the system preserves the following settings in the Summary area: [anchor|#ul_pfq_czd_xx]
*'''Type'''
* '''Order Nbr.'''
* '''Description'''
* '''Currency'''

The system also preserves the following information in the appropriate columns of the order lines on the '''Document Details''' tab: [anchor|#_554a79ab-5731-4d57-9b0e-fd94d8f09cfe]
*'''Branch'''

*'''Location''': The system inserts the default location of the selected vendor (or it inserts ''MAIN'', if it is the only location of this vendor). This box appears only if the ''Business Account Locations'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
*'''Owner''': The system inserts the identifier of the employee corresponding to the user who changes the vendor.
*'''Vendor Ref. Nbr.''': This box is cleared so that a new vendor reference number can be entered, if applicable.
*Currency Rate: This rate, which can be found in the box right of the '''Currency''' box that shows the identifier, is recalculated based on the new date specified for the order.

The system also updates certain document-level settings on the following tabs of the form:[anchor|#ul_ogt_w14_t3b]
*'''Shipping Instructions '''tab: In the '''Ship Via '''section, the '''FOB Point''' and '''Ship Via''' settings of the new vendor are inserted.
*'''Vendor Info''' tab: The settings of the newly selected vendor are inserted by default in the '''Vendor Contact '''and '''Vendor Address''' sections, but you can override the inserted settings. Also, in the '''Info''' section, the system inserts the vendor&rsquo;s settings in the following boxes: 
**'''Terms''': This box holds the credit terms of the vendor.
**''' Vendor Tax Zone''': The system recalculates the taxes in the order based on the new tax settings).
**'''Pay-To Vendor ''': This box appears on the tab if the ''Vendor Relations'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form.
*'''Other Information''' tab: The system specifies the default states of the '''Don&rsquo;t Print''' and '''Don&rsquo;t Email''' check boxes based on the '''Print Orders''' and '''Send Orders by Email''' settings (respectively) of the new vendor, which have been specified on the '''Purchase Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] form. Also, the '''Retainage Percent''' box is filled with the percentage specified for the vendor; this box appear on the tab if the '''Apply Retainage''' check box is selected on this tab and the ''Retainage Support'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form.
{br}

On the '''Document Details''' tab, the system also updates information in the appropriate columns of the purchase order lines as follows:[anchor|#_b5628cf3-f51b-4bf7-89ae-50c0cc750ca4]
*The following columns related to prices and costs use the vendor-specific costs: '''Unit Cost''' and '''Ext. Cost'''
* '''Alternate ID''': The system updates the column with the alternate ID of the item with the new vendor or clears the box if no alternate ID is specified for a new vendor.
*'''Min. Receipt (%)''', '''Max. Receipt (%)''', '''Complete On (%)''', and '''Receipt Action''': The default settings of the vendor are inserted for each line, but they can be overridden.
*The following columns related to discounts are updated: '''Discount Percent''' and '''Discount Amount'''.

Also, the  Retainage Percent  box is filled             with the percentage specified for the vendor; this box appear on the tab if the                Apply Retainage  check box is selected on this tab and the                Retainage Support  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features             form. On the  Document Details  tab, the system also updates information in         the appropriate columns of the purchase order lines as follows: The following columns related to prices and costs use the vendor-specific costs:              Unit Cost  and  Ext. Cost Alternate ID : The system updates the column with the alternate ID           of the item with the new vendor or clears the box if no alternate ID is specified for a           new vendor. Min. Receipt (%) ,  Max. Receipt (%) ,              Complete On (%) , and  Receipt Action : The           default settings of the vendor are inserted for each line, but they can be           overridden. The following columns related to discounts are updated:  Discount             Percent  and  Discount Amount . The expense and accrual accounts and subaccounts: The system inserts the appropriate           values in the following columns:  Account ,              Sub. ,  Accrual Account , and              Accrual Sub. The following columns related to dates are updated:  Requested  and              Promised . The system does not automatically save the document after you change the vendor ID, so you         can easily cancel these changes by clicking  Cancel  on the form         toolbar. Restrictions on Changing the Vendor  You cannot save the purchase order after changing the vendor in any of the following         cases: At least one AP bill, prepayment, or purchase receipt has been linked to the purchase           order. The purchase order has a line or multiple lines that have been created based on a           blanket purchase order. ]]></column>

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[In Acumatica ERP, you can require a user to perform additional steps during the processing of purchase orders and related documents. The following sections of this topic explain how you can adjust the workflow for processing the purchase orders and the related documents as needed in your organization.{br}{TOC}
==Holding Purchase Receipts and Landed Cost Documents on Entry==
The following documents are created with the ''On Hold'' status if the respective check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form:[anchor|#_8f8c8df5-ee2e-4b96-ad65-6679a1f6acdb]
*Purchase receipts: '''Hold Receipts on Entry'''
*Landed cost documents: '''Hold Landed Costs on Entry'''

If one of these check boxes is cleared, the newly created documents of the associated type are created with the ''Balanced'' status.
==Affecting the Processing of Generated Documents==
The following documents are released automatically upon generation if the respective check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form: [anchor|#_87bc04d6-dcce-45fa-887d-0e83b731943d]
*Inventory receipts: '''Release IN Documents Automatically'''
*Landed cost adjustments: '''Release LC IN Adjustments Automatically'''
*Accounts payable documents: '''Release AP Documents Automatically'''

If one of these check boxes is cleared, the documents of the associated type are generated and saved with the ''Balanced'' status.
==Making the Entry of Documents Error-Proof==
In the '''Validate Total on Entry''' section on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form, you can prevent the particular type of document from being processed until a user types the total order amount in the '''Control Total''' box (for orders and landed costs), or the total receipt quantity in the '''Control Qty.''' box, on the corresponding document entry form. The control total or quantity that the user enters must be equal to the order total calculated by the system. You can select the corresponding check boxes in this section to enable total validation for receipts, normal and standard purchase orders, blanket orders, drop-ship purchase orders, and landed cost documents.
==Making the Entry of an External Reference Number Foolproof==
You select the '''Require Vendor Reference''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_10_10_00|Accounts Payable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AP101000|AP101000]) form to prevent any actions from being performed on a purchase receipt or a landed cost document (that is still editable) until a user types the external reference number of the vendor's original document in the '''Vendor Ref.''' box, which is displayed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form (for purchase receipts) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_30_00|Landed Costs] ([~/?ScreenId=PO303000|PO303000]) form (for landed cost documents).
==Affecting the Purchase Receipt Creation==
You can use the '''Default Receipt Quantity''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form to define which quantities the system should specify in purchase receipts created from purchase orders. You can configure the system to create purchase receipt lines with items' quantities from a purchase order (if the ''Open Quantity'' is selected), or to create lines with a quantity of zero by default, so that the user enters the received quantity manually.
==Determining Whether Bills Are Created==
To set up the workflow of the processing of purchase receipts, landed cost documents, and bills, you can use the '''Create Bill On Receipt Release''' and '''Create Bill on LC Release''' check boxes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form. These check boxes provides the default value for the '''Create Bill''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form and on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_30_00|Landed Costs] ([~/?ScreenId=PO303000|PO303000]) form, respectively. {br}

For the convenience of users, you should select these check boxes if bills should be generated automatically for most receipts and landed cost documents. You should clear these check boxes if users should enter bills manually for most receipts or landed cost documents or if users enter or import the bills and later link them to receipts and landed cost documents. A user can override this setting if needed for a particular purchase receipt or landed cost document.
==Affecting the Processing of Bills==
The '''Allow AP Bill Before Receipt''' check box, which can be selected or cleared for a particular vendor on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form or for a particular vendor location on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_10|Vendor Locations] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303010|AP303010]) form, defines the workflow for processing purchase orders and related documents. The state of the check box is copied to purchase orders prepared for the vendor, and affects the processing as follows:[anchor|#_0ed78713-c220-43bb-b7c2-a5e4691105e6]
*If the check box is selected, you can create a purchase receipt and an AP bill for the purchase order in any order.
*If the check box is cleared, you can prepare an AP bill for the lines with stock items and non-stock items requiring receipt only after the purchase receipt has been prepared and processed.

==Affecting the Processing of Service Lines==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form, you can specify whether the system should process lines of the ''Service'' type in normal and drop-ship purchase orders, respectively, through purchase receipts by selecting or clearing the following check boxes:[anchor|#_12e8ba02-717e-4009-9ba8-4d56d61730a6]
*'''Process Service Lines from Normal Purchase Orders via Purchase Receipt''': If this check box is selected, non-stock lines of the ''Service'' type in purchase orders of the ''Normal'' type are processed through purchase receipts. If the check box is cleared, the non-stock lines of the ''Service'' type are not copied to purchase receipts and are billed directly from purchase orders. 
*'''Process Service Lines from Drop-Ship Purchase Orders via Purchase Receipt''': If this check box is selected, non-stock lines of the ''Service'' type in purchase orders of the ''Drop-Ship'' type are processed through purchase receipts. If the check box is cleared, the non-stock lines of the ''Service'' type are not copied to purchase receipts and are billed directly from drop-ship orders.

A use tax is a type of a tax that is applied when a merchant purchases a product or service on which sales tax was not initially paid, and then converts this product or service for its own use. For example, if your company purchases tax-free goods from a vendor that is not registered in the state of your purchase, it must report the purchases and pay the use tax directly to the tax agency of your state. {br}

The rate and the amount of the use taxes that apply to a purchase document can depend on many factors, including the types of items purchased, the vendor relations you have configured, the remittance address of the vendor, and the address of the warehouse.{br}{TOC}
==Use Tax Calculation with Avalara AvaTax==
If your system is integrated with the AvaTax service of Avalara or another third-party tax calculation software, the applicable taxes are calculated by this service or software and recorded to the purchase order or AP bill when you save the document. {br}

Once a user creates a document that is subject to taxes and removes it from hold (if applicable), the system checks whether the vendor location specified in the document is in the tax zone configured for the tax calculation software. If so, the system sends a request to the tax calculation software to determine the applicable taxes, based on the vendor location address, entity code, available exemption certificates, and tax rules (if any). The tax amounts computed by the tax calculation software are sent to Acumatica ERP and can be reviewed on the '''Tax Details''' tab of the document entry form, [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]). ((({S:Warn}For purchase orders, the taxes are shown for informational purposes only. Only taxes on AP bills are actually reported to the applicable tax agency. 
)))
The way the tax calculation software calculates use taxes depends on the settings of the origin ('''From''') and destination ('''To''') addresses specified in an Acumatica ERP document. The following sections describes how the system selects the '''From''' and '''To''' addresses in documents and individual document lines, depending on the document type and vendor settings.
==Sales Tax Calculation in Acumatica ERP==
 Acumatica ERP supports automatic calculation of sales taxes in purchase orders with the sales tax amount included in the document total. You can also select a sales tax with the ''Input'' group manually on the '''Tax Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form.{br}

For details on creating a sales tax of the ''Input'' type, see [HelpRoot_Financials\SalesTaxes_Implem_Activity_AP|Sales Taxes: To Configure a Sales Tax for Use in AP].
==Addresses in Purchase Orders==
In the document header of a purchase order, the system specifies the remittance address of the vendor selected in the purchase order as the '''From''' address, and the '''Ship-To''' address of the purchase order as the '''To''' address.{br}

In the individual purchase order lines, the system specifies the '''From''' and '''To''' addresses by using the following rules:[anchor|#_7db36be2-006c-4f45-8c59-53007f94020d]
*For lines of ''Normal'', ''Blanket'', and ''Standard'' purchase orders, the system specifies the vendor remittance address as the '''From''' address, and the address of the warehouse in the line as the '''To''' address. (If the ''Multiple Warehouses'' feature is not used in the system, the '''Ship-To''' address of the purchase order is used as the '''To''' address.) 
*For lines of ''Drop-Ship'' purchase orders, the system specifies the vendor remittance address as the '''From''' address, and the '''Ship-To''' address of the purchase order as the '''To''' address.

==Addresses in Accounts Payable Bills==
If the '''Vendor Relations''' feature is disabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the system specifies the vendor location address of the bill as the '''From''' address, and the main address of the bill&rsquo;s branch as the '''To''' address.{br}

If the '''Vendor Relations''' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form and vendor relations are set up, the system specifies the supplied-by vendor's location address of the bill as the '''From''' address, and the main address of the bill&rsquo;s branch as the '''To''' address.{br}

In the individual lines of the bills, the system specifies the '''From''' and '''To''' addresses by using the following rules:[anchor|#_155bf262-865c-4292-b788-db6ba9cb74b7]
*If a bill line is related to a line of a ''Normal'' purchase order, the system specifies the vendor address of the related purchase order line as the '''From''' address, and the address of the warehouse in the related purchase receipt line (or in the related purchase order line if the receipt has not been prepared yet) as the '''To''' address. (If the ''Multiple Warehouses'' feature is not used in the system, the '''Ship-To''' address of the purchase order is used as the '''To''' address.)
*If a bill line is related to a line of a ''Drop-Ship'' purchase order, the system specifies the vendor address of the related purchase order line as the '''From''' address, and the '''Ship-To''' address of the purchase order as the '''To''' address.
*If a bill line is related to a line of a direct purchase receipt (that is, one that is not linked to a purchase order), the system uses the vendor location address of the related purchase receipt as the '''From''' address, and the address of the warehouse in the related purchase receipt as the '''To''' address. (If the ''Multiple Warehouses'' feature is not used in the system, the main address of the bill&rsquo;s branch is used as the '''To''' address.)
*If a bill line is not related to any line of a purchase order or purchase receipt, the system uses the vendor location address of the bill as the '''From''' address, and the main address of the bill&rsquo;s branch as the '''To''' address.

In the individual purchase order lines, the system specifies the            From  and  To  addresses by using the following         rules: For lines of  Normal ,  Blanket , and  Standard  purchase orders, the           system specifies the vendor remittance address as the  From  address,           and the address of the warehouse in the line as the  To  address. (If           the  Multiple Warehouses  feature is not used in the system, the              Ship-To  address of the purchase order is used as the              To  address.)  For lines of  Drop-Ship  purchase orders, the system specifies the vendor           remittance address as the  From  address, and the              Ship-To  address of the purchase order as the              To  address. Addresses in Accounts Payable Bills If the  Vendor Relations  feature is disabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, the system specifies the vendor location         address of the bill as the  From  address, and the main address of the         bill's branch as the  To  address. If the  Vendor Relations  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features form and vendor relations are set up, the system specifies the         supplied-by vendor's location address of the bill as the  From          address, and the main address of the bill's branch as the  To          address. In the individual lines of the bills, the system specifies the  From          and  To  addresses by using the following rules: If a bill line is related to a line of a  Normal  purchase order, the system           specifies the vendor address of the related purchase order line as the              From  address, and the address of the warehouse in the related           purchase receipt line (or in the related purchase order line if the receipt has not been           prepared yet) as the  To  address. (If the  Multiple Warehouses            feature is not used in the system, the  Ship-To  address of the           purchase order is used as the  To  address.) If a bill line is related to a line of a  Drop-Ship  purchase order, the system           specifies the vendor address of the related purchase order line as the              From  address, and the  Ship-To  address of           the purchase order as the  To  address. If a bill line is related to a line of a direct purchase receipt (that is, one that is           not linked to a purchase order), the system uses the vendor location address of the           related purchase receipt as the  From  address, and the address of           the warehouse in the related purchase receipt as the  To  address.           (If the  Multiple Warehouses  feature is not used in the system, the main address of           the bill's branch is used as the  To  address.) If a bill line is not related to any line of a purchase order or purchase receipt, the           system uses the vendor location address of the bill as the  From            address, and the main address of the bill's branch as the  To            address.

The Purchase Orders module supports value added taxes (VATs) on purchased items if the ''VAT Reporting'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. {br}

In most European countries, where VATs are often used, prices for consumers are tax-inclusive—that is, specified with the tax amount included. In Acumatica ERP, you can configure the VAT-like taxes or sales taxes as calculated separately on item prices or as extracted from prices. The base and sale prices, too, can be specified as including or excluding the appropriate tax amount. {br}

Inclusive and non-inclusive taxes are configured on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\TX_20_50_00|Taxes] ([~/?ScreenId=TX205000|TX205000]) form. For inclusive taxes, the '''Extract from Item Amount''' option is selected. {br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, the document details include applicable taxes shown for informational purposes on the '''Tax Details''' tab; the list of applicable taxes includes the taxes present in both the vendor tax zone and the ordered item&rsquo;s tax category. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, tax amounts are calculated because although value-added taxes for inventory items are paid to vendors, they are claimable from the tax agency. ((({S:Warn} Correcting taxes in a purchase order does not affect the taxes in documents (purchase receipts and Accounts Payable bills) created from this purchase order. The taxes for each document are calculated when the document is created based on the tax settings of this document.
)))
==Example of Inclusive Tax Processing==
Consider an example in which a company purchases 100 motherboards at $22 each with a 10% VAT included. The total amount is $2200, and the VAT amount calculated for the document is $200. {br}

The following transactions will be generated for the Inventory receipt. 
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="40%" !  Account
!width="20%" ! Credit
!width="40%" ! Debit
|-

|  0 
|  2200 – 200 = 2000
|- 
|  PO Accruals
|  2000 
|  0
|}
 The following transactions will be generated for the Accounts Payable bill. 
{| class="checklist" | width="100%"

|- 
|  Accounts Payable
|  2200 (full receipt amount)
|  0
|- 
|  VAT Claimable Account
|  0 
|  200

If any difference arises, due to rounding, between the original order amount and the sum of the tax amount and the amount to be recorded to the accrual account, it will be added to the Purchase Price Variance account.

In Acumatica ERP, you can create and maintain vendor catalogs—that is, the lists of the inventory items you purchase from each vendor, along with the last prices of items and purchasing information about the items, which are generally used for automated replenishment. By maintaining vendor catalogs, you can more efficiently select vendors that sell specific types of items. You can also reduce errors on purchase orders by using vendor-specific alternate IDs of items. {br}{TOC}
==Creating Vendor Catalogs==
To create vendor catalogs, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_20_10_00|Vendor Inventory] ([~/?ScreenId=PO201000|PO201000]) form. On this form, you can select a vendor and vendor location and create a list of items your company can purchase from this vendor location. {br}

For each item, you can specify the following information, some of which may be specific to the vendor location: [anchor|#ul_rnd_bws_1q]
*The vendor inventory ID, which is the identifier used by the vendor for the item. This alternate ID can be assigned to the item (or to the item–subitem pair if your organization uses subitems for more detailed identification of products).
*The unit of measure (UOM) used by the vendor as the sales unit for the item at this location (defined as the item&rsquo;s ''purchase unit'' in your organization).
*The economic order quantity, which represents the quantity of this item that minimizes the costs of ordering from this vendor location.
*The vendor lead time, and the additional lead time (if any) for the inventory item purchased from the vendor. The system uses the additional lead time to schedule the purchases from the vendor and calculate the promised date. The system automatically calculates the promised date by adding the lead time and additional lead time (if any was specified for the item) to the requested date.
*The purchasing information, which is used in automated replenishment: 
**The minimum frequency of orders.
**The lot size defined for the item if it is tracked by lot numbers. 
**The minimum and maximum quantity that form the range in which the order quantity must fall
((({S:Warn}You cannot enter the prices in the '''Last Vendor Price''' column. The column is populated and updated automatically by the prices that were last used for the items. For details on setting up automatic price updating, see the following section. 
)))
Instead of entering all the items for each vendor and location, you can populate the vendor catalogs by creating a list of possible vendors for each stock item by using the '''Vendor Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form and for each non-stock item by using the same-name tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. Then, when you open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_20_10_00|Vendor Inventory] ([~/?ScreenId=PO201000|PO201000]) form and select a vendor, you can view the stock and non-stock items that the vendor sells and modify this list if needed. 
==Catalog Updating from Vendor Documents==
You can update the vendor catalogs manually at any time by replacing any changed data—such as alternate IDs, economic order quantities (EOQs), lot sizes, and minimum and maximum quantities—with the newer and more correct data. However, the last used prices in the catalogs cannot be entered manually; the system updates these prices automatically from prices quoted on vendor documents. {br}

You can set up automatic updating of the last used vendor prices in the vendor catalog based on the entry or release of specific vendor documents. To do this, on the '''Price/Discount Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_10_10_00|Accounts Payable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AP101000|AP101000]) form, in the '''Vendor Price Update''' box, select one of the following options:[anchor|#ul_nxm_bhl_rp]
*''On PO Entry''
* ''On AP Bill Release''
* ''None''

 When the event specified by the '''Vendor Price Update''' option (purchase order entry, or release of an AP bill that is linked to a purchase receipt or order) occurs, the item&rsquo;s unit price from the document replaces the last price of the item with the same UOM in the vendor catalog. If the UOM of the last price is the same as in the document, but the currency differs from the document&rsquo;s currency, the item&rsquo;s unit price in the document currency replaces the last price. If the UOM in the document line differs from the UOM of the last price, the system adds a new line to the vendor catalog.((({S:Warn}The system does not keep the history of price changes in the vendor catalog. 
)))
If you do not want to maintain information about the last used prices in the vendor catalogs, select ''None'' as the '''Vendor Price Update''' option—the last used prices will not be updated. Note that in this case the last vendor price may be updated on release of a bill that is not linked to any PO document.
==Using the Prices from Vendor Catalogs==
If you regularly receive vendors&rsquo; price lists for all or most of their items, you can maintain vendor prices with much more flexibility by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_20_00|Vendor Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AP202000|AP202000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_20_10|Vendor Price Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=AP202010|AP202010]) forms. You can import the price lists, and calculate the updated prices by applying specific percentages. {br}

 Maintaining vendor prices through vendor catalogs can also be useful for items for which the prices do not change often or information about prices is not available in advance. Once the system populates the '''Last Vendor Price''' column for items in the vendor catalogs, the system uses these last used prices as the default prices for the corresponding items on new purchase orders as follows: When you create a new purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form or receipt on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, if there are no prices listed for the item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_20_00|Vendor Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AP202000|AP202000]) form, for each item, the system inserts the last price from the vendor catalog as the vendor's default price ('''Unit Cost''' on either form). ((({S:Warn}If you are browsing the vendor catalog on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_20_10_00|Vendor Inventory] form in order to select a vendor for a specific item, you can view this vendor's current item prices by clicking the '''Vendor Prices''' button on the table toolbar and navigating to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_20_00|Vendor Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AP202000|AP202000]) form.
)))
You can override the default catalog prices on a purchase order or purchase receipt if the actual purchase prices for inventory items are different from those listed in the vendor catalog. In this case, the new prices that you enter will automatically appear in the vendor catalog as the last used prices; the particular event triggering this update depends on the option selected in the '''Vendor Price Update''' box. The new prices will then appear on a new purchase order when a user creates it. {br}

However, if the ''Volume Pricing'' feature is enabled in your system, and you purchase different volumes with different prices from your vendors, consider whether you need to maintain price updating in the catalog, taking into account that you will not know what volume the price listed in the catalog corresponds to.

If the ''Vendor Relations'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the vendor relations functionality can be configured. The following sections describe how the vendor relations you configure may affect the AP bills and debit adjustments created based on a purchase order or purchase receipt. 
==Vendor Relations Overview==
In some companies that consist of multiple branches, the branches can collectively make on order to a vendor on behalf of the company (that is, its head office) by sending purchase orders to that vendor. The supplier provides goods and issues a bill to the head office of the company. The head office pays it, and, in turn, issues bills to its branches. As a result, a branch receives goods from one vendor (specified in the purchase order), but pays for those goods to another vendor (specified in the bill). In Acumatica ERP, you can set up vendor relations so that the system accurately handles those vendor relations in documents. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form, for each vendor that supplies goods and services but does not receive payment (a ''supplied-by'' vendor), you specify its vendor for which an AP bill or debit adjustment should be created if this vendor is specified in a purchase order or receipt (the pay-to vendor). For details, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AP__con_Vendor_Relations_Overview|Vendor Relations Overview].
==Vendor Relations in Purchase Orders and Purchase Receipts==
When you create a purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, in the '''Vendor''' box of the Summary area, you can select a vendor with either vendor relations set up (a supplied-by vendor) or a vendor with no vendor relations set up. The system does one of the following for the purchase order: [anchor|#ul_zxd_2tp_f1b]
*If the selected vendor is a supplied-by vendor, the system inserts in the '''Pay-to Vendor''' box of the '''Vendor Info''' tab the pay-to vendor that is specified for the selected supplied-by vendor on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] form.
*If vendor relations are not configured for the selected vendor, the system inserts this same vendor in the '''Pay-to Vendor''' box of the '''Vendor Info''' tab.
((({S:Warn}For purchase receipts on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, the system selects the '''Pay-to Vendor''' in the same way. The only difference is that this box is located on the '''Financial Details''' tab, in the '''Billing Settings''' section.
))){br}

For a purchase order or a purchase receipt, you can override the vendor in the '''Pay-to Vendor''' box, if needed.{br}

With the vendor relations functionality set up, when you invoke '''Actions &gt; Enter AP Bill''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] form, the system creates an AP bill (or, for example, a debit adjustment for a purchase receipt of the ''Return'' type) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form that has all the details copied from the initial document except the vendor in the '''Vendor''' box. In this box, the system inserts the vendor specified in the '''Pay-to Vendor''' box of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] form. As a result, the bill will be paid to a different vendor than the vendor for which the purchase order was created.
==Discount Calculation==
In an Accounts Payable document (bill or debit adjustment) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form that is based on the purchase order, the system uses the discounts of the supplied-by vendor to calculate document discounts.
==Tax Calculation==
For a purchase order or purchase receipt on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form with vendor relations set up, the system calculates the tax and taxable amounts of the purchase order or purchase receipt by using the tax zones of the supplied-by vendors (that is, of the vendor specified in the '''Vendor''' box of the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] form). With vendor relations set up, the system calculates the tax and taxable amounts of the Accounts Payable documents similarly. {br}

If integration with Avalara AvaTax is configured and used for calculating taxes for purchase documents, the vendor relations you configure may affect the way the system selects the '''From''' and '''To''' addresses in these purchase documents.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Vendor Relations in Purchase Documents If the  Vendor Relations  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, the vendor relations functionality         can be configured. The following sections describe how the vendor relations you configure         may affect the AP bills and debit adjustments created based on a purchase order or purchase         receipt.  Vendor Relations Overview In some companies that consist of multiple branches, the branches can collectively make on         order to a vendor on behalf of the company (that is, its head office) by sending purchase         orders to that vendor. The supplier provides goods and issues a bill to the head office of         the company. The head office pays it, and, in turn, issues bills to its branches. As a         result, a branch receives goods from one vendor (specified in the purchase order), but pays         for those goods to another vendor (specified in the bill). In  Acumatica ERP, you can set up vendor relations so that the system accurately handles those vendor         relations in documents. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors (AP303000) form, for each         vendor that supplies goods and services but does not receive payment (a  supplied-by          vendor), you specify its vendor for which an AP bill or debit adjustment should be created         if this vendor is specified in a purchase order or receipt (the pay-to vendor). For details,         see  Vendor Relations Overview. Vendor Relations in Purchase Orders and Purchase Receipts When you create a purchase order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form,         in the  Vendor  box of the Summary area, you can select a vendor with         either vendor relations set up (a supplied-by vendor) or a vendor with no vendor relations         set up. The system does one of the following for the purchase order:  If the selected vendor is a supplied-by vendor, the system inserts in the                Pay-to Vendor  box of the  Vendor Info  tab             the pay-to vendor that is specified for the selected supplied-by vendor on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors form. If vendor relations are not configured for the selected vendor, the system inserts             this same vendor in the  Pay-to Vendor  box of the                Vendor Info  tab. For purchase receipts on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form,           the system selects the  Pay-to Vendor  in the same way. The only           difference is that this box is located on the  Financial Details            tab, in the  Billing Settings  section. For a purchase order or a purchase receipt, you can override the vendor in the            Pay-to Vendor  box, if needed. With the vendor relations functionality set up, when you invoke  Actions > Enter AP Bill  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders or   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts form, the system creates an AP bill (or, for example, a debit         adjustment for a purchase receipt of the  Return  type) on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form that has all the details copied from the initial         document except the vendor in the  Vendor  box. In this box, the system         inserts the vendor specified in the  Pay-to Vendor  box of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders or   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts form. As a result, the bill         will be paid to a different vendor than the vendor for which the purchase order was         created. Discount Calculation In an Accounts Payable document (bill or debit adjustment) on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form that is based on the purchase order, the         system uses the discounts of the supplied-by vendor to calculate document discounts. Tax Calculation For a purchase order or purchase receipt on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000)         or   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form with vendor relations set up, the system         calculates the tax and taxable amounts of the purchase order or purchase receipt by using         the tax zones of the supplied-by vendors (that is, of the vendor specified in the            Vendor  box of the Summary area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders or   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts form).

You can create a quote (an order of the ''QT'' type) to record a planned sale. The quantities of goods and the document amounts on open quotes do not cause the allocation of stock items in inventory and do not update the information in the Accounts Receivable module. To be able to prepare an invoice to the customer for the quote and issue the included items from inventory, you need to create a sales order of the needed type based on that quote and process the sales order. As soon as any order (even for a partial quantity of items) has been prepared from the quote, the quote becomes completed.{br}{TOC}
==Entering a Quote==
You create a sales order of the ''QT'' type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form to represent a customer's interest in possibly purchasing goods in a specified quantity on a specified date. {br}

For a quote, you specify the following information:[anchor|#ul_fdk_lkp_np]
*The customer and its location
*The planned order date and requested date
*The shipping rule for the order and for each order line
*The shipping terms
*The included stock and non-stock items with their quantities, units of measure, unit prices, and tax category
*The expiration date of the quote
{br}

New orders of the ''QT'' type are saved with the ''Open'' status by default because the '''Hold Documents on Entry''' check box is cleared for this order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form; you can change this default setting. The first time you save the new quote, the system generates a reference number for it according to the numbering sequence assigned to this order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] form.
==Creating a Sales Order from a Quote==
From the open quote on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]), you can create an order of any of the following types: ''SO'' (sales order), ''IN'' (invoice order), or ''CS'' (cash sale order). To create an order from a quote, you click the '''Actions &gt; Copy Order''' action on the form toolbar. When you create an order based on a quote, the details of the quote (including the document lines and the specified accounts and subaccounts) are copied to the created order. You can select whether to recalculate discounts on sales orders copied from quotes. After you have copied a quote to a sales order, the quote remains open until you cancel it.{br}

Quotes can also be used as templates for repeating orders for a particular customer. In this case, you can create orders based on quotes by using the standard copy-paste functionality on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. When you create an order in this way, the quote is not completed and is still available when you need to prepare other sales orders.
==Canceling a Quote==
To reflect in the system that the customer is no longer considering a particular proposed sale (quote) or that your company is no longer offering the included item or items at the specified price or prices, you need to cancel the quote. For each newly created quote, you can specify an expiration date in the '''Cancel By''' box on the '''Shipping Settings''' tab. By default, the system calculates the '''Cancel By''' date as follows: the number of days specified in the '''Days to Keep''' box for the ''QT'' order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] form ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) is added to the '''Date''' specified in the quote.{br}

The system does not cancel the expired quotes automatically. A user should cancel expired quotes manually or by using the ''Cancel Order'' action on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] form ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]). ]]></column>

Click  Save  on the form toolbar to save the                     created quote. Notes About the Procedure The notes in this section describe the nuances of the UI elements available on             the form, such as when an element is required and when it is not, and when the system             fills in settings by default. This section can include other notes. Note the following about this procedure: If  QT  is not available for selection in the  Order                         Type  box, enable the  QT  order type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form. To limit the range of items in the  Inventory                 Lookup  dialog box, you can do any of the following: Type a string in the  Inventory  box to find the item by                     this string in its inventory ID, description, or alternate ID type. Click the  Sold Since  option button if the item has been                     sold recently. When you do, the  Sold Since  box appears                     with a date that is three months earlier than the current business date; select                     another date if needed. The list of items is populated with the items that have                     been sold in this date range. Select the  Show Available Items Only  check box to review                     only items whose available quantities are greater than 0. Clear this check box                     to see all items. If subitems are used in your system, to narrow the resulting list to a                     particular subitem of the item, select the needed subitem in the                          Subitem  box. To narrow the list to items located in a particular warehouse, select the                     warehouse in the  Warehouse  box.  ]]></column>

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
In a typical distribution organization, a customer order may be taken over the phone or received by email. In Acumatica ERP, you can process a sale of stock items by creating and processing a corresponding sales order. A sales order represents a customer request to buy particular goods in a specified quantity on a specified date.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Create a sales order with stock items
*Create the shipment for a sales order
*Confirm the shipment
*Create the invoice for a sales order
*Process the SO invoice and the related inventory and accounts payable documents

==Applicable Scenarios==
You process a sales order with a stock item if you need to record the sale goods with shipping the items to customer, updating item quantities in inventory, and preparing an invoice to the customer for the sold goods. 
==Sale of Stock Items with Automatic or Manual Allocation==
The standard sales process typically includes entering a sales order, processing a shipment of the items with items being issued from inventory, and preparing the related invoice to customer. In Acumatica ERP, to process a sale that requires the items to be shipped before an invoice can be prepared, you can use a sales order of the ''SO'' or ''SA'' type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. Consider the following points as you decide which of the order types to use: [anchor|#_5dcb7cad-f11e-46de-b089-be4408a9b768]
*For a new order of the ''SO'' type, the items are not reserved in inventory automatically. You can manually allocate (reserve) the requested quantity for a specific stock item or multiple items if this is required by your company policies or was requested by the customer. Also, you may want to reserve a line item if the item is available but the quantity required for the order line is distributed between different warehouses and any transfers are required. 
*When you save a new order of the ''SA'' type, the system automatically reserves the requested quantities of stock items for this order (or the available part, if only part of requested quantity is available for any item). If the ordered quantity cannot be fully allocated at the specified location or warehouse, you can manually allocate the unavailable quantity in other warehouses or locations. If you prepare a shipment for an SA order that has an unallocated quantity, the order will be shipped partially even if the ordered quantities are available for shipping at another warehouse or warehouse location but were not allocated for this particular order. For information on processing back orders, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_ReplanBackOrders|Back Ordering and Replanning Back Orders].

On the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form, you can view the allocation for each sales order line and change it, if needed, by clicking a line and clicking '''Allocations''' on the table toolbar. The quantities of the items that have been allocated for the order (automatically or manually) cannot be shipped for another order. {br}

The way the order will be fulfilled depends on the item availability and on the shipping rules specified for the order and for the sales order lines on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. These shipping rules determine whether the goods in the sales order should be shipped only in full, partial shipments for the available quantities are allowed with the remainder canceled, or partial shipments are allowed with the remainder on back order. For detailed information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Shipping_Rules|Shipping Rule Combinations]. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form, you can review the details of a shipment document prepared for an order; then you can confirm the shipment of items.{br}

After you have prepared and confirmed the shipment or shipments related to the sales order, you need to bill the customer for the shipped items by preparing an SO invoice, which is a financial document in the system that contains links to the applicable shipments and sales orders. You can review the prepared SO invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form; then you can release it. When the SO invoice is released, the system automatically generates a corresponding inventory issue for the shipped items with the date and posting period of the invoice. Also, when the SO invoice is released, the system creates and releases a corresponding AR invoice, which you can view on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form. {br}

An AR invoice is a financial document that is similar to the SO invoice but does not contain the links to the applicable shipments and sales orders. The system assigns the same reference number to the SO invoice and the related AR invoice and prints this number in the customer statement; thus, these invoices appear to be a single document from the customer&rsquo;s perspective. Both of these documents contain the link to the batch of the general ledger transactions that was generated when the AR invoice was released. For more information on processing accounts receivable invoices, see [HelpRoot_Financials\Finance_ARInvoices_Mapref|Processing AR Invoices].
==Workflow of a Sale of Stock Items==
For a sales order of the ''SO'' or ''SA'' type that includes stock items, the typical processing involves the actions and generated documents shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#fig_p5z_bpd_h5][anchor|#image_z5v_1hn_dt][image:UserGuide/Images/Inventory_Sale_With_Shipping.png|popup|450px]]]></column>

==Story==
Suppose that on January 30, 2020, the GoodFood One Restaurant wholesale customer has ordered a large amount of orange and apple jams in 96-ounce jars from the main office of SweetLife, where you are employed, for the café&rsquo;s baking needs. The ordered jams are stored in the warehouse of SweetLife’s main office. You, as a sales manager, need to enter and process the appropriate documents.
==Configuration Overview==For the purposes of this lesson, the ''Inventory'' feature, which provides the ability to create purchase orders that include stock items, has been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form, the ''SO'' order type has been configured and activated.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form, the ''GOODFOOD (GoodFood One Restaurant)'' customer has been configured.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, the ''APJAM96'' and ''ORJAM96'' stock items have been configured. In the ''WHOLESALE'' warehouse, which has been configured on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form, sufficient quantities of the ''APJAM96'' and ''ORJAM96'' items are on hand.
==Process Overview==
To perform a sale of stock items with manual allocation, you create a sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, select the customer to which the items are being sold, add items to the order, and reserve the items in inventory. Then you create a shipment document on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form. On this form, you confirm the settings that the system has inserted automatically based on the sales order, and then confirm the shipment. After shipment confirmation, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form to prepare a corresponding invoice to the customer and release it. 
==System Preparation==

#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded. To sign in as a sales manager, use the ''norman'' login and the ''123'' password.
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select ''1/30/2020'' on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system on this business date.

==Step 1: Entering a Sales Order==
To create a sales order, do the following:[anchor|#_0d71bbd6-64b1-4729-853d-8569ec0c9d5c]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, create a sales order, and specify the following settings:
#*'''Order Type''': ''SO''
#* '''Customer''': ''GOODFOOD''
#* '''Date''': ''1/30/2020''
#* '''Requested On''': ''1/30/2020''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Jams, orange and apple</tt>
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, add rows with the following settings:
#*'''Inventory ID''': ''APJAM96'', '''Warehouse''': ''WHOLESALE'', '''Quantity''': <tt>20</tt>, '''Unit Price''': <tt>45.15</tt>
#*'''Inventory ID''': ''ORJAM96'', '''Warehouse''': ''WHOLESALE'', '''Quantity''': <tt>20</tt>, '''Unit Price''': <tt>35.99</tt>
#Click '''Save''' on the form toolbar to save the sales order, which is assigned the ''Open'' status.

==Step 2: Allocating Inventory Items==
To manually allocate the inventory items for the sales order you have created, while you are still viewing the sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, do the following for each of the sales order lines:[anchor|#_0425071c-c6b3-4173-97b5-f885e4354908]
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, click the line, and review the Allocated quantity in the table footer (which is currently equal to 0 because the system does not automatically allocate stock for ''SO'' orders). 
#On the table toolbar, click '''Allocations'''.
#In the '''Allocations''' dialog box, which opens, make sure ''WHOLESALE'' is selected in the '''Alloc. Warehouse''' column of the only row.
#Select the '''Allocated''' check box for the allocation line.
#Click '''OK''' to save the created allocation and close the dialog box.
#In the table footer, review the Allocated quantity, and notice that it is now equal to the quantity specified in the line, which means that the items have been allocated in inventory.
#Click '''Save''' on the form toolbar.

Now you need to create a shipment document for the sales order.
==Step 3: Creating a Shipment==
To create a shipment, do the following: [anchor|#_c13c0201-052e-41d4-91c1-d3fabf10b020]
#While you are still viewing the sales order you have created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, on the form toolbar, click '''Actions &gt; Create Shipment'''. 
#In the '''Specify Shipment Parameters''' dialog box, which opens, make sure the ''1/30/2020'' date and the ''WHOLESALE'' warehouse are selected, and click '''OK'''. The system creates a shipment and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form.

==Step 4: Confirming the Shipment==
To confirm the shipment, do the following:[anchor|#_8617e284-ae55-4d34-86b0-f192b3eceb6c]
#While you are still viewing the shipment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form, review the lines on the '''Document Details''' tab. Make sure that both order lines have been included in the shipment and that the shipped quantity in both lines is equal to the ordered quantity.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions &gt; Confirm Shipment'''.

The shipment is assigned the ''Confirmed'' status, and now you can prepare the invoice to bill the customer and increase the customer&rsquo;s debt in the system.
==Step 5: Processing the Invoice==
To prepare and release the invoice, do the following:[anchor|#_d4312437-0d7a-4d10-bceb-54b7620c7700]
#While you are still viewing the shipment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form, on the form toolbar, click '''Actions &gt; Prepare Invoice'''. The system prepares the invoice and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form.
#On this form, review the details of the prepared invoice. The invoice has two lines, as the initial sales order does. In the '''Shipment Nbr.''' and '''Order Nbr.''' columns, notice that the system has inserted the reference number links to the related shipment and sales order.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions &gt; Release''' to release the invoice.
#Return to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, and open the sales order that you have processed.
#On the '''Shipments''' tab, in the only row, click the link in the '''Inventory Ref. Nbr.''' column to view the inventory issue that was generated when you released the invoice.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form, which opens, review the details of the inventory issue, as shown in the following screenshot. Make sure the issue has the ''Released'' status, which means that the issue has been released and the items&rsquo; quantities in inventory have been decreased appropriately.[anchor|#_6eb21c0c-b072-406c-8cea-c402403c455c][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_OrderMgmt_Sale_of_Stock_Items.png|popup|Inventory issue generated on release of the invoice|450px]

The sales order processing is now complete.]]></column>
			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Sales of Stock Items: Process Activity The following activity will walk you through the process of preparing and processing                 (to completion) a sales order with manual allocation of stock items.  The following activity is             based on the  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system             settings have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the             activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100              dataset to its initial state. Story Suppose that on January 30,  2020, the GoodFood One Restaurant wholesale customer has                 ordered a large amount of orange and apple jams in 96-ounce jars from the main                 office of SweetLife, where you are employed, for the café's baking needs. The                 ordered jams are stored in the warehouse of SweetLife’s main office. You, as a sales                 manager, need to enter and process the appropriate documents. Configuration Overview For the purposes of this lesson, the                  Inventory  feature, which provides the ability to create purchase orders that             include stock items, has been enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000)                 form. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form, the  SO  order                 type has been configured and activated. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers                 (AR303000) form, the  GOODFOOD (GoodFood One Restaurant)  customer has been                 configured. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form, the                      APJAM96  and  ORJAM96  stock items have been configured. In the                      WHOLESALE  warehouse, which has been configured on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses (IN204000) form, sufficient quantities of the                      APJAM96  and  ORJAM96  items are on hand. Process Overview To perform a sale of stock items with manual allocation, you create a sales order on                 the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, select the customer to which                 the items are being sold, add items to the order, and reserve the items in                 inventory. Then you create a shipment document on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) form. On this form, you confirm the settings that the system has                 inserted automatically based on the sales order, and then confirm the shipment.                 After shipment confirmation, you use the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000)                 form to prepare a corresponding invoice to the customer and release it.  System Preparation Do the following: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the  U100  dataset preloaded. To                     sign in as a sales manager, use the  norman  login and the  123                      password. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to                      1/30/2020. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date                     menu button, and select  1/30/2020 on the calendar. For simplicity, in                     this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system on this                     business date. Step 1: Entering a Sales Order To create a sales order, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, create a sales order,                     and specify the following settings: Order Type :  SO Customer :  GOODFOOD Date :  1/30/2020Requested On :  1/30/2020Description :  Jams, orange and                                 apple On the  Document Details  tab, add rows with the following                         settings: Inventory ID :  APJAM96 ,                                  Warehouse :  WHOLESALE ,                                  Quantity :  20 ,                                  Unit Price :  45.15 Inventory ID :  ORJAM96 ,                                  Warehouse :  WHOLESALE ,                                  Quantity :  20 ,                                  Unit Price :  35.99 Click  Save  on the form toolbar to save the sales order,                     which is assigned the  Open  status. Step 2: Allocating Inventory Items To manually allocate the inventory items for the sales order you have created, while                 you are still viewing the sales order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders                 (SO301000) form, do the following for each of the sales order lines: On the  Document Details  tab, click the line, and review                     the Allocated quantity in the table footer (which is currently equal to 0                     because the system does not automatically allocate stock for  SO  orders).  On the table toolbar, click  Allocations . In the  Allocations  dialog box, which opens, make sure                          WHOLESALE  is selected in the  Alloc. Warehouse                      column of the only row. Select the  Allocated  check box for the allocation                     line. Click  OK  to save the created allocation and close the                     dialog box. In the table footer, review the Allocated quantity, and notice that it is now                     equal to the quantity specified in the line, which means that the items have                     been allocated in inventory. Click  Save  on the form toolbar. Now you need to create a shipment document for the sales order. Step 3: Creating a Shipment To create a shipment, do the following:  While you are still viewing the sales order you have created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, on the form toolbar, click  Actions > Create Shipment .  In the  Specify Shipment Parameters  dialog box, which                     opens, make sure the  1/30/2020 date and the  WHOLESALE  warehouse                     are selected, and click  OK . The system creates a shipment                     and opens it on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) form. Step 4: Confirming the Shipment To confirm the shipment, do the following: While you are still viewing the shipment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments                     (SO302000) form, review the lines on the  Document Details                      tab. Make sure that both order lines have been included in the shipment and that                     the shipped quantity in both lines is equal to the ordered quantity. On the form toolbar, click  Actions > Confirm Shipment . The shipment is assigned the  Confirmed  status, and now you can prepare the                 invoice to bill the customer and increase the customer's debt in the system. Step 5: Processing the Invoice To prepare and release the invoice, do the following: While you are still viewing the shipment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments                     (SO302000) form, on the form toolbar, click  Actions > Prepare Invoice . The system prepares the invoice and opens it on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form. On this form, review the details of the prepared invoice. The invoice has two                     lines, as the initial sales order does. In the  Shipment                         Nbr.  and  Order Nbr.  columns, notice that                     the system has inserted the reference number links to the related shipment and                     sales order. On the form toolbar, click  Actions > Release  to release the invoice. Return to the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, and open the                     sales order that you have processed.

==To Reserve an Inventory Item in an Order==[anchor|#ol_isj_3lz_lz]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form.
#In the '''Order Type''' box, select the order type of the order for which you want to allocate items. 
#In the '''Order Nbr.''' box, select the reference number of the needed order.
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, for each item whose quantities should be reserved in the source warehouse, perform the following steps:
##Click the order line with the needed item, and click '''Allocations''' on the table toolbar.
##In the '''Allocations''' dialog box, which opens, select the '''Allocated''' check box for the allocation line. If the full quantity is not available in the source warehouse, the system replaces the quantity in the line with the available quantity and adds one more line for the remaining quantity.
##For the additional line (if added), select the check box in the '''Allocated''' column. In the '''Alloc. Warehouse''' column, select the source warehouse from the list of warehouses. If the item quantity available in this warehouse ('''Qty. On Hand''') is less than the remaining quantity, the system adds one more allocation line with the remaining quantity; if it does, either adjust the requested quantity or continue reserving item quantities in other warehouses.
##Click '''OK''' to save the created allocations and close the dialog box.

*To limit the range of items in the '''Inventory Lookup''' dialog box, you can do any of the following:
**Type a string in the '''Inventory''' box to find the item by this string in its inventory ID, description, or alternate ID type.
**Click the '''Sold Since''' option button if the item has been sold recently. When you do, the '''Sold Since''' box appears with a date that is three months earlier than the current business date; select another date if needed. The list of items is populated with the items that have been sold in this date range.
**Select the '''Show Available Items Only''' check box to review only items whose available quantities are greater than 0. Clear this check box to see all items.
**If subitems are used in your system, to narrow the resulting list to a particular subitem of the item, select the needed subitem in the '''Subitem''' box.
**To narrow the list to items located in a particular warehouse, select the warehouse in the '''Warehouse''' box. 
*If the reserved quantity is split between multiple warehouses, the appropriate allocations will be visible on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_90_00|Create Transfer Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO509000|SO509000]) form, and you can generate transfer orders for the allocations you select or for all listed allocations.

If needed, specify lot or serial numbers for specific ordered items for this sales                 order. Clear the  Hold  check box.  Click  Save  on the form toolbar. Notes About the Procedure The notes in this section describe the nuances of the UI elements available on             the form, such as when an element is required and when it is not, and when the system             fills in settings by default. This section can include other notes. Note the following about this procedure: If  SA  is not available for selection in the  Order                         Type  box, select the  Active  check box for                     the  SA  order type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000)                     form. The functionality of stock allocation (reservation) is available only if any of                     the following features are enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features                     (CS100000) form:  Multiple Warehouses ,  Sales Order to Purchase Order                         Link , and  Lot and Serial Tracking .  To facilitate order processing and tracking, you can attach scanned images or                     electronic versions of original customer orders to sales orders. For                     instructions, see  To Attach a File to a Record. To limit the range of items in the  Inventory                 Lookup  dialog box, you can do any of the following: Type a string in the  Inventory  box to find the item by                     this string in its inventory ID, description, or alternate ID type. Click the  Sold Since  option button if the item has been                     sold recently. When you do, the  Sold Since  box appears                     with a date that is three months earlier than the current business date; select                     another date if needed. The list of items is populated with the items that have                     been sold in this date range. Select the  Show Available Items Only  check box to review                     only items whose available quantities are greater than 0. Clear this check box                     to see all items. If subitems are used in your system, to narrow the resulting list to a                     particular subitem of the item, select the needed subitem in the                          Subitem  box. To narrow the list to items located in a particular warehouse, select the                     warehouse in the  Warehouse  box.  If the reserved quantity is split between multiple warehouses, the                         appropriate allocations will be visible on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO509000|SO509000]) Create Transfer Orders (SO509000) form, and you can generate transfer orders for the allocations                         you select or for all listed allocations. ]]></column>

Notes About the Procedure The notes in this section describe the nuances of the UI elements available on             the form, such as when an element is required and when it is not, and when the system             fills in settings by default. This section can include other notes. Note the following about the creation of shipments for multiple orders: After you have created shipments, you need to confirm each shipment and create                     transfer receipts for transfer orders, if any have been processed.  To narrow the range of documents shown in the table, do any of the                 following: In the  Start Date  and  End Date                      boxes, specify the date range for the dates of the type you selected. To further narrow the list of documents, select a particular customer in the                          Customer  box. In the  Carrier  box, select the carrier to be used for                     shipping. In the  Ship Via  box, select a particular ship via                     code. In the  Warehouse  box, select the source warehouse. Specify and apply a filter to select documents by specific criteria. You can                     create a reusable filter for the form that will give you the ability to display                     particular documents each time you bring up this form.

After items have been shipped to a customer, you create and release an SO invoice, which increases the customer&rsquo;s debt. Once the SO invoice has been released, the settings of the invoice, including the invoice amounts, cannot be changed directly in the SO invoice. {br}

In Acumatica ERP, there are two ways to correct an SO invoice that has been released (which in this context is the ''original invoice''): either create correction invoice, or cancel the original SO invoice and then create a new invoice with the correct settings.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#_ba4590f5-f125-448b-abde-e9a56d167416]
*Create a correction document for an SO invoice
*Cancel an SO invoice by creating a cancellation credit memo and applying this credit memo to it
*Review the correction and cancellation documents
*Review the GL transactions generated on release of correction or cancellation documents

==Applicable Scenarios==
You correct SO invoices in any of the following cases:[anchor|#_592ae776-a49b-429e-a0de-eca5d4568afd]
*You need to decrease the outstanding amount of an SO invoice because the invoice overcharged the customer, the customer reported receiving damaged goods, or the applicable taxes were calculated incorrectly. 
*You need to increase the amount of an SO invoice due to additional expenses being incurred during the delivery of the goods or services listed in the original invoice, or if the applicable taxes have been calculated incorrectly. 
*You need to cancel an SO invoice because the customer decided to negate the sale.
*You need to cancel an SO invoice and create a new one if some significant data in the invoice needs to be changed (for example, if you need to add more lines to this invoice).

==Correction of an SO Invoice==
You can correct an SO invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form if it has the ''Open'' status. If a payment or credit memo has been applied to the SO invoice, you must first reverse the application and then correct the invoice.{br}

To correct the SO invoice, while viewing it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] form, you click '''Actions''' > '''Correct Invoice''' on the form toolbar. The system creates a correction invoice and displays it on the same form, with all the settings from the original invoice copied to the correction invoice. In the correction invoice that has been created, you can correct any settings as needed, but you cannot add new lines or remove existing lines. After you have made all needed corrections, you release the correction invoice.{br}

On release of the correction invoice, the system automatically generates and releases a credit memo in the amount of the original invoice, applies it to the original invoice, and assigns the ''Canceled'' status to the original invoice. Also, the correction invoice is assigned the ''Open'' status; in the related sales order and shipment, the system replaces the links to the original invoice with the links to the correction invoice.
==Workflow of Invoice Correction==
The following diagram illustrates the workflow related to the correction of an SO invoice.[anchor|#_68e991c7-9800-46c1-b881-12a3879772b0][anchor|#_9d049bba-bdd7-43bb-b893-cd6d16a5836d][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_OrderMgmt_SO_Invoice_Correction.png|popup|450px]
==Known Process Limitations==
The following limitations apply to the processes of correcting and canceling SO invoices that have been created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form:[anchor|#_61cb187b-310a-44d3-a50d-4018159eaf71]
*It is not possible to cancel or correct SO invoices whose credit terms (specified in the '''Terms''' box of the Summary area of the form) are multiple-installment.
*It is not possible to cancel or correct SO invoices related to direct sales—that is, the invoices in which the stock items listed on the '''Document Details''' tab have been added directly without links to related shipments and sales orders (in the '''Shipment Nbr.''' and '''Order Nbr.''' columns, respectively).
*It is not possible to cancel or correct SO invoices that have been prepared for sales orders of the ''IN'' type.

This topic explains how you can cancel an SO invoice that has been prepared for a sales order and released.
==Cancellation of an SO Invoice==
You can cancel an SO invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form if it has the ''Open'' status. If a payment or credit memo has been applied the SO invoice, you must first reverse the application and then cancel the invoice.{br}

To cancel the invoice, while viewing it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] form, you click '''Actions''' > '''Cancel Invoice''' on the form toolbar. The system creates an SO credit memo—the cancellation credit memo—in the full amount of the invoice being canceled, with all the settings from the original invoice copied, and displays it on the same form. In the credit memo that has been created you can change the date, posting period, and description, all of which are copied from the SO invoice being canceled. {br}

The cancellation credit memo can be applied only to the original invoice for which it has been prepared. When you release the cancellation credit memo, the system applies it to the original invoice automatically, assigns the ''Canceled'' status to the original invoice, and assigns the ''Closed'' status to the cancellation credit memo. {br}

When the original invoice is canceled, the system removes the links between it and the related sales orders and shipments, and assigns the related shipment the ''Confirmed'' status. You can now create a new SO invoice for this shipment, if needed. The inventory issue transaction related to the canceled invoice is not affected by the invoice cancellation; it is still linked to the shipment.

)))
==Story==
Suppose that on January 21, 2019, GoodFood One Restaurant ordered 92 pounds of oranges from the main office of SweetLife. The ordered fruits were shipped from the Wholesale warehouse to the customer&rsquo;s location, and the SO invoice were prepared and paid. Further suppose that the customer later informed you that the price of oranges in the invoice was specified incorrectly (the price in the invoice sent to customer is $2.15, and it should have been $1.99). Acting as a sales manager, you need to correct the error introduced in sales documents, and prepare a correct invoice for the customer.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this lesson, the ''Inventory'' feature, which provides the ability to create sales and purchase orders that include stock items, have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form: {br}

Also, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form, the ''SO'' order type has been configured and activated.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, the ''ORANGES'' stock item has been defined.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form, the ''GOODFOOD (GoodFood One Restaurant)'' customer has been defined. Additionally, the sales documents that you need to correct have been processed in the system: A sales order for ''GOODFOOD '' has been created, a shipment for the sales order has been prepared and confirmed, and an SO invoice has been prepared, released, and paid in full.
==Process Overview==
To be able to correct the SO invoice that was processed and paid, you will first reverse the payment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_20_00|Payments and Applications] ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) form. Then on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form, you will create a correction invoice with the correct unit price and release this invoice, which will cause the system to cancel the invoice with the incorrect data and apply a credit memo to it. You will then apply the payment to the correction invoice.
==System Preparation==
Do the following:[anchor|#_73ebb003-1b19-4747-9eea-982486c72ff9][anchor|#_87261bd8-0ea9-4df0-a769-dbc270af0e37]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded. To sign in as a sales and purchasing manager, use the ''wiley'' login and the ''123'' password.
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''1/30/2019''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select ''1/30/2019'' on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system on this business date.

==Step 1: Reversing the Payment==
To reverse the payment that has been applied to the SO invoice that you are going to correct, do the following:[anchor|#_fa742785-635f-4638-890f-918dff014a89]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, open the sales order for the ''GOODFOOD'' customer in the amount of $210.66, dated ''1/21/2019''.
#In the '''Invoice Nbr.''' column on the '''Shipments''' tab, click the link to open the SO invoice prepared for the sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form. 
#:In the Summary area of the form, notice that the SO invoice is assigned the ''Closed'' status because it was paid in full. You need to reverse the payment to be able to correct the invoice.
#On the '''Applications''' tab, click the link in the '''Reference Nbr.''' column of the only row to open the payment that was applied to invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_20_00|Payments and Applications] ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) form.
#On the table toolbar of the '''Application History''' tab, click '''Reverse Application'''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the reversal of the payment application. 
#:On the '''Application History''' tab, a reversing line for the full payment amount appears. The payment application is now reversed; the payment is assigned the ''Open'' status.

==Step 2: Creating the Correction Invoice==
Now that you have reversed the payment, you can create the correction SO invoice as follows:[anchor|#_157bbfb8-a804-4c3c-b8df-06b8f140a5bc]
#While you are still viewing the payment you have reversed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_20_00|Payments and Applications] ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) form, on the '''Application History''' tab, click the link in the '''Reference Nbr.''' column of either row to open the SO invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form. Notice that invoice is now assigned the ''Open'' status.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Correct Invoice'''. The system creates a correction invoice and opens it on the same form. 
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save''' to save the prepared invoice. The system displays a warning on the '''Financial Details''' tab indicating that the current document is the correction document.
#In the only line on the '''Document Details''' tab, change the '''Unit Price''' to ''1.99''.
#On the form toolbar, click'''Release from Hold''' and then click '''Release'''. Notice that the invoice is assigned the ''Open'' status.
#On the '''Financial Details''' tab, click the '''Original Document''' link to open the original invoice (that is, the invoice that was corrected) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] form. 
#On the '''Applications''' tab, review the line with the ''Credit Memo'' document type, as shown in the following screenshot. The credit memo was automatically generated when you released the correction invoice and was applied to the original document; this is why the original invoice is now assigned the ''Canceled'' status, as you can also see in the screenshot.[anchor|#_99f97f2d-5e3e-4fee-a2bd-2fa68f0733b3][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_OrderMgmt_SO_Invoice_Correction.png|popup|The original invoice, which is now canceled|450px]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, again open the sales order for the ''GOODFOOD'' customer in the amount of $210.66, dated ''1/21/2019''. On the '''Shipments''' tab, notice that the reference number of the correction invoice (and a link to this invoice) is now shown in the '''Invoice Nbr.''' column.

==Step 3: Applying a Payment to Correction Document==
To apply the payment to the correction SO invoice that you have created, do the following:[anchor|#_6da246db-768d-4667-b69f-ddd91da4395d]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_20_00|Payments and Applications] ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) form, open the payment to ''GOODFOOD'' in the amount of $210.66.
#On the '''Documents to Apply''' tab, add a new line with the ''Invoice'' type, and in the '''Reference Nbr.''' box, select the reference number of the correction invoice that you have created earlier in this activity.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Release'''. Due to the changed price of the oranges, the payment still has an available balance of $11.33 that can be applied to any other customer invoice (which is shown in the '''Available Balance''' box in the Summary area).
#On the '''Application History''' tab, click the reference number of the invoice to which you applied the payment (that is, the correction invoice), to open it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form. The invoice that was paid is now assigned the ''Closed'' status.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[SO Invoice Correction: To Correct an SO Invoice The following activity will walk you through the process of correcting an SO invoice                 that was created for a sales order. The following activity is             based on the  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system             settings have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the             activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100              dataset to its initial state. Story Suppose that on January 21, 2019, GoodFood One Restaurant ordered 92 pounds of                 oranges from the main office of SweetLife. The ordered fruits were shipped from the                 Wholesale warehouse to the customer's location, and the SO invoice were prepared and                 paid. Further suppose that the customer later informed you that the price of oranges                 in the invoice was specified incorrectly (the price in the invoice sent to customer                 is $2.15, and it should have been $1.99). Acting as a sales manager, you need to                 correct the error introduced in sales documents, and prepare a correct invoice for                 the customer. Configuration Overview For the purposes of this lesson, the  Inventory  feature, which provides the                 ability to create sales and purchase orders that include stock items, have been                 enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS101000) form:  Also, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form, the  SO  order                 type has been configured and activated. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form, the  ORANGES  stock item                 has been defined. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000) form, the  GOODFOOD (GoodFood One                     Restaurant)  customer has been defined. Additionally, the sales documents                 that you need to correct have been processed in the system: A sales order for                      GOODFOOD   has been created, a shipment for the sales order has been                 prepared and confirmed, and an SO invoice has been prepared, released, and paid in                 full. Process Overview To be able to correct the SO invoice that was processed and paid, you will first                 reverse the payment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) Payments and Applications (AR302000) form. Then on                 the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form, you will create a correction                 invoice with the correct unit price and release this invoice, which will cause the                 system to cancel the invoice with the incorrect data and apply a credit memo to it.                 You will then apply the payment to the correction invoice. System Preparation Do the following: Launch the  Acumatica ERP             website, and sign in to a company with the  U100  dataset preloaded. To sign in as             a sales and purchasing manager, use the  wiley  login and the  123              password. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to                          1/30/2019 . If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date                     menu button, and select  1/30/2019  on the calendar. For simplicity, in                     this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system on this                     business date. Step 1: Reversing the Payment To reverse the payment that has been applied to the SO invoice that you are going to                 correct, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, open the sales order for                     the  GOODFOOD  customer in the amount of $210.66, dated                      1/21/2019 . In the  Invoice Nbr.  column on the                          Shipments  tab, click the link to open the SO invoice                     prepared for the sales order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000)                     form.  In the Summary area of the form, notice that the SO invoice is assigned                         the  Closed  status because it was paid in full. You need to reverse                         the payment to be able to correct the invoice. On the  Applications  tab, click the link in the                          Reference Nbr.  column of the only row to open the                     payment that was applied to invoice on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) Payments and Applications                     (AR302000) form. On the table toolbar of the  Application History  tab,                     click  Reverse Application . On the form toolbar, click  Release  to release the                     reversal of the payment application.  On the  Application                             History  tab, a reversing line for the full payment amount                         appears. The payment application is now reversed; the payment is assigned                         the  Open  status. Step 2: Creating the Correction Invoice Now that you have reversed the payment, you can create the correction SO invoice as                 follows: While you are still viewing the payment you have reversed on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) Payments and Applications (AR302000) form, on the  Application                         History  tab, click the link in the  Reference                         Nbr.  column of either row to open the SO invoice on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form. Notice that invoice is now                     assigned the  Open  status. On the form toolbar, click  Actions Correct Invoice . The system creates a correction invoice and opens it on the same                     form.  On the form toolbar, click  Save  to save the prepared                     invoice. The system displays a warning on the  Financial                         Details  tab indicating that the current document is the                     correction document. In the only line on the  Document Details  tab, change the                          Unit Price  to  1.99 . O n                     the form toolbar, click Release from Hold  and then click  Release .                     Notice that the invoice is assigned the  Open  status. On the  Financial Details  tab, click the                          Original Document  link to open the original invoice                     (that is, the invoice that was corrected) on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices                     form.  On the  Applications  tab, review the line with the                          Credit Memo  document type, as shown in the following screenshot. The                     credit memo was automatically generated when you released the correction invoice                     and was applied to the original document; this is why the original invoice is                     now assigned the  Canceled  status, as you can also see in the                          screenshot . The original invoice, which is now canceled On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, again open the sales                     order for the  GOODFOOD  customer in the amount of $210.66, dated                          1/21/2019 . On the  Shipments  tab, notice that                     the reference number of the correction invoice (and a link to this invoice) is                     now shown in the  Invoice Nbr.  column. Step 3: Applying a Payment to Correction Document To apply the payment to the correction SO invoice that you have created, do the                 following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) Payments and Applications (AR302000) form, open the payment to                          GOODFOOD  in the amount of $210.66. On the  Documents to Apply  tab, add a new line with the                          Invoice  type, and in the  Reference Nbr.  box,                     select the reference number of the correction invoice that you have created                     earlier in this activity. On the form toolbar, click  Release . Due to the changed                     price of the oranges, the payment still has an available balance of $11.33 that                     can be applied to any other customer invoice (which is shown in the                          Available Balance  box in the Summary area). On the  Application History  tab, click the reference                     number of the invoice to which you applied the payment (that is, the correction                     invoice), to open it on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form. The                     invoice that was paid is now assigned the  Closed  status. You have finished the process of correcting the SO invoice. ]]></column>

==Story==
Suppose that on January 28, 2020, FourStar Coffee & Sweets Shop ordered 15 pounds of apples from the main office of SweetLife. The ordered fruits were shipped from the Wholesale warehouse to the customer&rsquo;s location, and the SO invoice was prepared. Further suppose that you later noticed that the sales taxes had not been calculated for the SO invoice because the ''EXEMPT'' tax category had been specified in the sales order line by mistake. Acting as a sales manager, you need to cancel the incorrect invoice and create a new one with the correct information.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this lesson, the ''Inventory'' feature, which provides the ability to create sales and purchase orders that include stock items, have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

Also, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form, the ''SO'' order type has been configured and activated.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, the ''APPLES'' stock item has been defined.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form, the ''COFFEESHOP (FourStar Coffee & Sweets Shop)'' customer has been defined. Additionally, the sales documents that you need to correct have been processed in the system: a sales order to ''COFFEESHOP'' has been created, a shipment for the sales order has been prepared and confirmed, and an SO invoice has been prepared and released.
==Process Overview==
To correct the mistake of taxes not being charged on the SO invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form, you will cancel the invoice. Then you will change the tax category in the sales order line on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, and prepare a new SO invoice for the sales order with the correct information.
==System Preparation==
Do the following:[anchor|#_73ebb003-1b19-4747-9eea-982486c72ff9][anchor|#_a239db67-84ae-4707-a766-9d698eadf94b]

#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Cancel Invoice'''.
#The system creates a cancellation credit memo with the same settings as the invoice you were viewing, and opens it on the same form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Release from Hold''' and then click '''Release'''. The credit memo is assigned the ''Closed'' status, because it has been applied in full to the invoice.
#On the '''Financial Details''' tab, click the link in the '''Original Document''' box to open the invoice that was canceled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] form. Notice that the invoice is now assigned the ''Canceled'' status.

Additionally, the sales                 documents that you need to correct have been processed in the system: a sales order                 to  COFFEESHOP  has been created, a shipment for the sales order has been                 prepared and confirmed, and an SO invoice has been prepared and released. Process Overview To correct the mistake of taxes not being charged on the SO invoice on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form, you will cancel the invoice. Then you                 will change the tax category in the sales order line on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, and prepare a new SO invoice for the                 sales order with the correct information. System Preparation Do the following: Launch the  Acumatica ERP             website, and sign in to a company with the  U100  dataset preloaded. To sign in as             a sales and purchasing manager, use the  wiley  login and the  123              password. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to  1/30/2020. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and                     select  1/30/2020 on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and                     process all documents in the system on this business date. Step 1: Canceling the SO Invoice To cancel the SO invoice with the incorrect tax category, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, open the sales order for                     the  COFFEESHOP  customer in the amount of $37.50, dated  1/28/ 2020. On the  Shipments  tab, click the  Invoice                         Nbr.  link to open the SO invoice on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form. Review the  Tax Details  tab. Notice that the                          NYNOTAX  tax code with the 0% tax rate has been applied to the SO                     invoice, so the tax amount is $0.00, which is incorrect.  On the form toolbar, click  Actions Cancel Invoice . The system creates a cancellation credit memo with the same settings as the                     invoice you were viewing, and opens it on the same form. On                     the form toolbar, click  Release from Hold  and then click                          Release . The credit memo is                     assigned the  Closed  status, because it has been applied in full to the                     invoice. On the  Financial Details  tab, click the link in the                          Original Document  box to open the invoice that was                     canceled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices form. Notice that the invoice is                     now assigned the  Canceled  status. Step 2: Creating the New SO invoice To create the SO invoice with the correct tax information, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, again open the sales                     order for  COFFEESHOP (FourStar Coffee & Sweets Shop)  dated                                  1/28/ 2020.  On the form toolbar, click  Actions Prepare Invoice . The system creates the new SO invoice for the sales order and                     opens it on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form. In the only line on the  Document Details  tab, change the                     tax category to  TAXABLE . Review the  Tax Details  tab, and make sure that the                          NYSTATETAX  has been applied to the invoice and the calculated tax                     amount is $3.33, as shown in the screenshot below. The correct tax amounts in the corrected SO invoice On the form toolbar, click  Actions Release  to release the invoice. On the  Document Details  tab, click the link in the                          Order Nbr.  column in the only line to open the                     related sales order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders form. On the  Shipments  tab, notice that the reference number of                     the newly created invoice is now shown in the  Invoice                         Nbr.  column. You have canceled the SO invoice with incorrect data and prepared a new one. ]]></column>

The shipping rules specified for a particular sales order define whether the goods for the sales order should be shipped only in full or partial shipments for the available quantities are allowed. This topic explains how you can set up the shipping rules to be used in sales orders by default.
==Shipping Settings of a Customer==
You can specify the shipping rule for each customer class in the '''Default Delivery Settings''' section on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_10_00|Customer Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR201000|AR201000]) form. Then when you create a new customer and select this class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form, the shipping rule specified in the customer class will be copied to the '''Shipping Rule''' box on the '''Delivery Settings''' tab. If needed, for the selected customer, you can override the default shipping rule copied from the customer class.{br}

When you create a new sales order on the on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form and select the customer, the system inserts the default shipping rule of the selected customer as the document-level shipping rule for this sales order in the '''Shipping Rule''' box on the '''Shipping Settings''' tab. Then when you add lines to the sales order, the system specifies the document-level shipping rule to each added line by default. ((({S:Warn}You can override the document-level shipping rule so that all new lines in this sales order will be added with this new rule (which differs from the customer&rsquo;s default shipping rule). Also, you can change the shipping rule manually in any sales order line.
)))
==Shipping Settings of Customer Locations==
If the ''Business Account Locations'' feature is enabled in your system on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the system copies the default shipping rule values from the customer to the customer locations. If needed, you can specify different default shipping rules for different customer locations on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_20|Customer Locations] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303020|AR303020]) form.
==Shipping Settings for Transfer Orders==
Because transfer orders are created to account for transfers of items between warehouses, and warehouses are assigned to particular branches, default shipping rules can be specified for branches on the '''Delivery Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_20_00|Branches] ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) form.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Shipping Rule Settings The shipping rules specified for a particular sales order define whether the goods for the     sales order should be shipped only in full or partial shipments for the available quantities are     allowed. This topic explains how you can set up the shipping rules to be used in sales orders by     default. Shipping Settings of a Customer You can specify the shipping rule for each customer class in the  Default Delivery      Settings  section on the  General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR201000|AR201000]) Customer Classes (AR201000) form. Then when you create a new customer and select this     class on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000) form, the shipping rule specified in the     customer class will be copied to the  Shipping Rule  box on the       Delivery Settings  tab. If needed, for the selected customer, you can     override the default shipping rule copied from the customer class. When you create a new sales order on the on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000)     form and select the customer, the system inserts the default shipping rule of the selected     customer as the document-level shipping rule for this sales order in the  Shipping      Rule  box on the  Shipping Settings  tab. Then when you add     lines to the sales order, the system specifies the document-level shipping rule to each added     line by default.  You can override the document-level shipping rule so that all new lines      in this sales order will be added with this new rule (which differs from the customer's default      shipping rule). Also, you can change the shipping rule manually in any sales order     line. Shipping Settings of Customer Locations If the  Business Account Locations  feature is enabled in your system on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, the system copies the default shipping rule values     from the customer to the customer locations. If needed, you can specify different default     shipping rules for different customer locations on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303020|AR303020]) Customer Locations     (AR303020) form. Shipping Settings for Transfer Orders Because transfer orders are created to account for transfers of items between warehouses, and     warehouses are assigned to particular branches, default shipping rules can be specified for     branches on the  Delivery Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) Branches (CS102000) form. ]]></column>

This topic briefly explains how the system creates shipments for sales orders depending on the shipping rules specified in these orders, and how you can consolidate shipments for multiple sales orders.{br}{TOC}
==Shipment Creation by Shipping Rules==
Each shipment is generated from one particular warehouse. The system creates an individual shipment from each warehouse that is specified in sales order lines, as if these were multiple orders being shipped from different warehouses. If you are creating shipments by processing orders on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) form, the system creates the shipments one by one from each warehouse that is referred to in each processed order. The document-level shipping rule of the sales order, which is specified on the '''Shipping Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders]form ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]), is applied to each warehouse as follows:[anchor|#ol_kl2_cyv_k5]
*If the document-level shipping rule is ''Ship Complete'', a shipment is created from the warehouse selected in the line only if all other order lines with the same warehouse can be shipped from that warehouse according to the shipping rule of each line. ''Ship Complete'' lines can be shipped in full, and other lines can be shipped at least partially.
*If the document-level shipping rule is ''Cancel Remainder'' or ''Back-Order Allowed'', a shipment is created from the selected warehouse if at least one order line can be shipped from that warehouse according to the shipping rule of the line.

When a shipment is created for a sales order, the system adds the lines with a nonzero open quantity to the shipment according to the following logic:[anchor|#ol_txp_czv_k5]
#The system adds to the shipment only the lines that have a '''Ship On''' date no later than the specified shipment date and have to be shipped from the warehouse specified for the shipment.
#The system adds the lines to the shipment according to the shipping rule of the line as follows:
#*A ''Ship Complete'' line is added to the shipment only if the open quantity can be shipped in full from the quantity available for shipping.
#*A ''Back Order Allowed'' or ''Cancel Remainder'' line is added to the shipment with the quantity that is available for shipping at the moment of shipment creation even if the quantity is less than the open quantity of the line.

For more detailed information on shipping rules, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Shipping_Rules|Shipping Rule Combinations].
==Consolidated Shipments==
You can consolidate shipments, creating one shipment (and corresponding shipment document) for multiple sales orders of the same customer, unless the '''Ship Separately''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form is selected for the order type being used. As long as the check box is cleared, you can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) form to create one shipment for multiple sales orders associated with the same customer. Sales orders with the predefined order type ''SO'' don&rsquo;t require goods to be shipped separately for separate sales orders. ((({S:Warn}The orders of the type for which the '''Ship Separately''' check box is selected can still be consolidated into a single shipment if you manually add them using the '''Add Order''' button on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form.
)))
One more setting that affects the creation of consolidated shipments is the '''Use Customer&rsquo;s Account''' setting specified in a shipment document on the '''Shipment Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form. The system copies the state of this check box from the related sales order. Thus, if you mass-process multiple sales orders that have different states of the '''Use Customer&rsquo;s Account''' check box on the '''Shipping Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, the system will group the sales orders by the state of this check box and create two consolidated shipments: The first shipment will include the sales orders in which the check box is selected, and the second shipment will include the sales orders in which this check box is cleared.

Shipments, which are a key part of the order fulfillment process, can be incoming or outgoing. This topic discusses the outgoing shipments (based on the ''Issue'' operation) that are generated when a user processes a sale of items and ships the items to a customer; further we will refer to them as ''shipments''. The processing of incoming shipments (which are based on the ''Receipt'' operation, and thus are called ''receipts'') involve customer returns based on return orders and is described in the topics of the [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\OrderMgmt_Return_for_Replacement_GeneralInfo|Returns for Replacement: General Information] section. {br}

For a shipment prepared for a sales order, the typical processing involves the actions and generated documents shown in the following diagram. [anchor|#fig_pbz_bpd_h5][anchor|#image_zbv_1hn_dt][image:UserGuide/Images/Shipment_process.png|popup|Shipment process|300px]
The following sections describe in detail the processing steps shown in the diagram.{br}{TOC}
==1. Prepare the Shipment==
You can directly create a shipment document for a particular sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form by selecting '''Actions''' > '''Create Shipment''' on the form toolbar; this brings up the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form with the new shipment document that includes the lines with items to be shipped. Alternatively, by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] form as a starting point, you can create a new shipment document and add one order or multiple orders of the same customer. {br}

To create multiple shipments for multiple sales orders of multiple customers, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) form. The system automatically assigns reference numbers to the created shipment documents, in accordance with the numbering sequence assigned to shipments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form. {br}

If you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form to create shipments for a sales order that includes items to be shipped from multiple warehouses, you can create only one shipment at a time. Because an order with the ''Shipping'' status is read-only, there can be only one open shipment for the order from a particular warehouse. Once you confirm the open shipment, you can create a shipment to be sent from another warehouse. However, by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] form, you can create multiple shipments for these orders at once.
==2. Print the Pick List==
You can print a pick list for a particular shipment by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form. For multiple shipments with the ''On Hold'' or ''Open'' status, you can print pick lists by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_30_00|Process Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO503000|SO503000]) form. For more details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Shipment_Processing|Shipment Processing Steps].
==3. Confirm the Shipment==
After all the required goods are picked and packed, you can confirm the shipment by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Confirm Shipment''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form. You can confirm multiple shipments by executing the ''Confirm Shipment'' action for the selected shipments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_30_00|Process Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO503000|SO503000]) form. Shipment confirmation updates the available quantities and changes the status of the associated sales order. During shipment confirmation, the system checks that for all items for which lot or serial numbers are tracked, the appropriate numbers were specified.
==4. Print Shipment Confirmation==
If authorization is required before the shipment is confirmed, you can print a shipment confirmation document to be signed by the authorized person by clicking '''Reports &gt; Print Shipment Confirmation''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form. For multiple shipments, you can print shipment confirmations by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_30_00|Process Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO503000|SO503000]) form.{br}

To complete the sale, you must generate Sales Orders invoices and inventory issues and release these documents. The general workflow for most organizations is to first generate Sales Orders invoices and then release them; on release of these invoices, inventory issues are generated automatically. Another shipment processing workflow, in which an organization updates inventory and processes inventory issues before generating and processing customer invoices, is described in [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Shipment_Process_Variations|Shipment Process Variations]. 
==5. Correct the Shipment==
If you need to correct a shipment that has already been confirmed, click '''Actions''' > '''Correct Shipment''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form to reopen the shipment and make the required corrections. The associated order's status is changed to ''Shipping'' once you reopen the shipment. {br}

If an order that has a confirmed shipment has been canceled, you can reopen the order by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Re-Open Order''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. You can then delete or correct the shipment by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] form.{br}

If a shipment includes a sales order line that is also included in any subsequent shipments, you have to correct the subsequent shipments prior to correcting the preceding one. After you have completed all needed corrections, you can confirm the shipment or shipments that you have reopened.

Due to shipment policies, your organization may process customer invoices later than it does inventory issues. In this case, you can first create issues, then generate invoices, and finally release invoices and issues. {br}

The processing of a sales order with issues created before invoices includes the steps and generated documents shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#_683df3df-3a3b-481f-b818-b16a5aa8c616][image:UserGuide/Images/Inventory_Sale_with_Issuing_Before_Invoicing.png|popup|450px]
The following sections describe in detail the processing steps shown in the diagram.{br}{TOC}
==1. Enter the Sales Order==
You create a new sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. If the order is created with the ''On Hold'' status, you should  click '''Release from Hold'''on the form toolbar to process the order further.
==2. Prepare and Confirm the Shipment==
For a particular order, you can create a shipment by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Create Shipment''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. Then you need to confirm the shipment. For more details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Shipment_Processing|Shipment Processing Steps].
==3. Update Inventory==
To manually create the inventory issue for a shipment, you can click '''Actions''' > '''Create Shipment''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form, or you can create inventory issues for multiple selected shipments by executing the ''Update IN'' action on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_30_00|Process Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO503000|SO503000]) form. 
==4. Release the Inventory Issue==

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Shipment Process Variations Due to shipment policies, your organization may process customer invoices later than it         does inventory issues. In this case, you can first create issues, then generate invoices,         and finally release invoices and issues.  The processing of a sales order with issues created before invoices includes the steps and         generated documents shown in the following diagram. The following sections describe in detail the processing steps shown in the diagram. 1. Enter the Sales Order You create a new sales order          on         the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form. If the order is created with the  On           Hold  status, you should                   click  Release from Hold on the form toolbar          to         process          the         order          further. 2. Prepare and Confirm the Shipment For a particular order, you can create a shipment by clicking  Actions Create Shipment  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders         (SO301000) form. Then you need to confirm the shipment. For more details, see  Shipment Processing Steps. 3. Update Inventory To manually create the inventory issue for a shipment, you can click  Actions Create Shipment  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) form,         or you can create inventory issues for multiple selected shipments by executing the            Update IN  action on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO503000|SO503000]) Process Shipments (SO503000) form.  4. Release the Inventory Issue To release the inventory issue (and thus, to update the item availability information in         inventory), you click  Actions > Release  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) Issues (IN302000) form.         When the inventory issue is released, the batch of General Ledger transactions is generated.  5. Process the Sales Orders Invoice You can prepare a Sales Orders (SO) invoice for a particular order by clicking  Actions Prepare Invoice  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) form,         or you can create invoices for multiple selected shipments by executing the  Prepare           Invoice  action on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO503000|SO503000]) Process Shipments (SO503000) form.  To release the SO invoice, you click  Actions > Release  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form         after reviewing its details. When the SO invoice is released, the batch of General Ledger         transactions is generated.  To adjust the dates in the invoices generated for confirmed shipments, you can use the            Use Shipment Date for Invoice Date  check box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences (SO101000) form as follows: Select this check box to set the shipment date as the invoice date. Clear the check box to use the current business date as the default date for the           invoice. ]]></column>

The shipping rules specified for a particular sales order define how the goods in the sales order should be shipped—whether they should be shipped only in full or partial shipments for the available quantities are allowed. The shipment rules for a sales order are applied when you create a shipment for a single order—by using the '''Create Shipment''' action on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form—or mass-create shipments for multiple orders, by running the '''Create Shipments''' process from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) form.{br}{TOC}
==Shipping Rule Options==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, you can specify the document-level shipping rule for the sales order document as a whole (in the '''Shipping Rule''' box on the '''Shipping Settings''' tab) and for each sales order line (in the '''Shipping Rule''' column on the '''Document Details''' tab). {br}

You can specify any of the following shipping rule options for order lines and for orders:[anchor|#ul_lmx_p53_zs]
*''Ship Complete''
* ''Cancel Remainder''
* ''Back Order Allowed''

The shipping rules applied to order lines are explained in the following table.[anchor|#table_v1d_3q3_zs]
===Line-Level Shipping Rules===
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="25%" ! Shipping Rule Option
!width="75%" ! Result 
|- 
| '''Ship Complete'''
| 
If a negative quantity is not allowed for the item specified in the line, the item can be included in a shipment only if the full ordered quantity is available for shipping. If the quantity of the item that is available for shipping is less than the ordered quantity, then the item in this line is not included in the shipment. The ordered quantity is shown as the '''Open Quantity''', and the line remains ''Open''. {br}

If shipping of the negative stock is allowed for the order type—that is, if '''Ship in Full If Negative Stock Is Allowed''' is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form—the items for which a negative quantity is allowed are included in a shipment in the full ordered quantity, regardless of whether this quantity is available for shipping. (This rule does not apply to lot- or serial-tracked stock items.){br}

After this shipment has been confirmed, the line has the ''Completed'' status on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form. For details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Shipments|Processing Partial Shipments]. 
|- 
| '''Cancel Remainder'''
| 
With this shipping rule, shipping for the line is performed only once.{br}

If a negative quantity is not allowed for the item specified in the line, the item can be included in a shipment if any nonzero quantity that is less than or equal to the ordered quantity is available for shipping.{br}

If shipping of the negative stock is allowed for the order type, the items for which a negative quantity is allowed are included in a shipment in the full ordered quantity, regardless of whether it is available for shipping. (This rule does not apply to lot- or serial-tracked stock items.){br}

After this shipment has been confirmed, the line is marked as ''Completed'', and the '''Open Quantity''' value is set to zero.((({S:Warn}If you reopen a sales order line for which at least one shipment has been performed, the system changes the shipping rule to ''Back-Order Allowed'' for this line on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form.
)))
|- 
| '''Back Order Allowed'''
| 
If a negative quantity is not allowed for the item specified in the line, the item can be included in a shipment if any nonzero quantity that is less than or equal to the ordered quantity is available for shipping. The remaining quantity (if applicable) is shown as the '''Open Quantity''' on the line. The ordered quantity can be shipped in multiple shipments. The line gets the ''Completed'' status once the full ordered quantity has been shipped.{br}

If shipping of the negative stock is allowed for the order type, the items for which a negative quantity is allowed are included in a shipment in the full ordered quantity, regardless of whether the full quantity is available for shipping. (This rule does not apply to lot- or serial-tracked stock items.) After this shipment has been confirmed, the line has the ''Completed'' status.{br}

If shipping of the negative stock is not allowed for an order type, but you don&rsquo;t want to rely completely on availability data for the classes of items for which negative quantity is allowed, select the '''Add Zero Lines for Items Not in Stock''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] form. Then in the orders of this type, for order lines with the '''Back Order Allowed''' shipping rule, a zero-quantity line is added to the shipment if the item is not in stock; you can manually enter the actually available quantity of the item.

See the table below for details about how the shipping rule of a sales order affects the mass-processing of the sales orders, which you perform by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) form. ((({S:Warn}If you initiate shipment creation for an individual sales order (by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form) and the system detects a shortage of the items, the system displays the message informing you that the order cannot be shipped in full so that you can make an appropriate decision on the fulfillment of this order and change the quantities, create a partial shipment, or change the order status to ''Back Order'' manually.

If shipping cannot be performed for each line of the order, no shipment is created, and the order is assigned the ''Back Order'' status.{br}

The shipment is created (and the order is assigned the ''Shipping'' status) if shipping can be performed for each line—that is, if the lines meet the following criteria:[anchor|#ul_np3_vrj_zs]
*For each ''Ship Complete'' line: The ordered quantity is available for shipping and can be shipped in full.
*For each ''Cancel Remainder'' line: Any nonzero quantity that is equal to or less than the ordered quantity is available for shipping.
*For each ''Back Order Allowed'' line: Any nonzero quantity that is equal to or less than the ordered quantity is available for shipping.

You cannot specify different '''Requested On''' dates for different lines in the order. {br}

When the shipment has been confirmed, the order is assigned the ''Completed'' status if all the lines have the ''Completed'' status. If any line is not completed, the order is assigned the ''Back Order'' status.
|- 
| '''Cancel Remainder'''
| 
If shipping cannot be performed for any of order lines, no shipment is created, and the order is assigned the ''Back Order'' status.{br}

If full or partial shipping can be performed for at least one line (according to the line&rsquo;s shipping rule), the shipment is created.{br}

You cannot specify different '''Requested On''' dates for different lines in the order. {br}

 When the shipment has been confirmed, the order is assigned the ''Completed'' status if at least one line has the ''Completed'' status and the lines not included in shipment have the ''Cancel Remainder'' rule. The order is assigned the ''Back Order'' status if at least one line is not completed (that is, if it has a nonzero open quantity).
|- 
| ''' Back Order Allowed'''
| 
If shipping cannot be performed for any of the order lines, no shipment is created, and the order is assigned the ''Back Order'' status.{br}

You can specify different '''Requested On''' dates for different lines in the order, and different lines will be shipped on different dates. ((({S:Warn}If you change the '''Requested On''' date for the order, the system prompts you to choose whether you want to keep the dates specified for each line or to update the respective dates with the new '''Requested On''' date. 
))){br}

If full or partial shipping can be performed for at least one line according to the line&rsquo;s shipping rule, the shipment is created. After the shipment has been confirmed, the order is assigned the ''Back Order'' status if other lines are not completed.

==Examples of the Application of Shipping Rules==
The table below presents the examples that illustrate how the shipping rules specified for the sales order and its lines affect the fulfillment of the order. Assume this order has the following lines: [anchor|#ul_ccy_db1_bt]
*Line 1: ''Product 1'' with an ordered quantity of 150
*Line 2: ''Product 2'' with an ordered quantity of 100

Each row of the table shows a combination of shipping rules, with the first column indicating the rule specified for the sales order as a whole and the second column indicating the rules specified for the lines of the sales orders. The third column shows the quantity of each product that is available for shipping in the example in the row. The fourth column then shows, for the particular shipping rules and available quantities, the result of and conditions. The table includes enough combinations to give you an idea how these settings work together without covering an overwhelming amount of detail.[anchor|#table_g2y_db1_bt]

==Shipment Thresholds==
You can use undershipment and overshipment thresholds, in addition to shipping rules, to determine whether a shipment results in changing the status of the sales order line to ''Completed''. {br}

On the '''Document Details''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, for each line of a sales order, you can specify whether undershipment and overshipment are allowed as follows:[anchor|#ul_czf_zpb_2t]
*To allow overshipment, you enter in the '''Overship. Threshold (%)''' column a value greater than 100 (meaning 100%). For an order line with the ''Ship Complete'' shipping rule for 100 yards of fabric, you might opt to have the whole lap shipped (a lap of fabric has 100 meters, and each meter is 1.093 yards). To do this, you can specify the overshipment threshold at 110%, which allows up to 10% more fabric than the ordered amount to be shipped. 
*To allow undershipment, you enter in the '''Undership. Threshold (%)''' a value that is less than 100. Suppose that when you create a shipment, for an order line with the ''Back Order Allowed'' shipping rule, the system detects a small shortage of goods—for example, only 99 units are available for shipping and 100 have been ordered. If the line&rsquo;s undershipment threshold was specified at 99% or lower, the 99 units for the line will be included in the shipment, the line will be marked as ''Completed'', and no open quantity will be left on the line for a back order.
((({S:Warn}If 100 is specified in both these columns, it means that undershipment or overshipment are not allowed.

You can specify any of the following shipping rule options for order lines and for         orders: Ship Complete Cancel Remainder Back Order Allowed The shipping rules applied to order lines are explained in the following table. Line-Level Shipping Rules Shipping Rule Option Result  Ship Complete If a negative quantity is not allowed for the item specified in the line, the                   item can be included in a shipment only if the full ordered quantity is available                   for shipping. If the quantity of the item that is available for shipping is less                   than the ordered quantity, then the item in this line is not included in the                   shipment. The ordered quantity is shown as the  Open                     Quantity , and the line remains  Open .  If shipping of the negative stock is allowed for the order type—that is, if                      Ship in Full If Negative Stock Is Allowed  is selected on                   the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form—the items for which a negative                   quantity is allowed are included in a shipment in the full ordered quantity,                   regardless of whether this quantity is available for shipping. (This rule does not                   apply to lot- or serial-tracked stock items.) After this shipment has been confirmed, the line has the  Completed  status                   on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders form. For details, see  Processing Partial Shipments.  Cancel Remainder With this shipping rule, shipping for the line is performed only once. If a negative quantity is not allowed for the item specified in the line, the                   item can be included in a shipment if any nonzero quantity that is less than or                   equal to the ordered quantity is available for shipping. If shipping of the negative stock is allowed for the order type, the items for                   which a negative quantity is allowed are included in a shipment in the full                   ordered quantity, regardless of whether it is available for shipping. (This rule                   does not apply to lot- or serial-tracked stock items.) After this shipment has been confirmed, the line is marked as  Completed ,                   and the  Open Quantity  value is set to zero. If you reopen a sales order line for which at least one shipment has been                   performed, the system changes the shipping rule to  Back-Order Allowed  for                   this line on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders form. Back Order Allowed If a negative quantity is not allowed for the item specified in the line, the                   item can be included in a shipment if any nonzero quantity that is less than or                   equal to the ordered quantity is available for shipping. The remaining quantity                   (if applicable) is shown as the  Open Quantity  on the line.                   The ordered quantity can be shipped in multiple shipments. The line gets the                      Completed  status once the full ordered quantity has been shipped. If shipping of the negative stock is allowed for the order type, the items for                   which a negative quantity is allowed are included in a shipment in the full                   ordered quantity, regardless of whether the full quantity is available for                   shipping. (This rule does not apply to lot- or serial-tracked stock items.) After                   this shipment has been confirmed, the line has the  Completed  status. If shipping of the negative stock is not allowed for an order type, but you don't                   want to rely completely on availability data for the classes of items for which                   negative quantity is allowed, select the  Add Zero Lines for Items Not                     in Stock  check box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences form. Then                   in the orders of this type, for order lines with the  Back Order                     Allowed  shipping rule, a zero-quantity line is added to the shipment                   if the item is not in stock; you can manually enter the actually available                   quantity of the item.  See the table below for details about how the shipping rule of a sales order affects the         mass-processing of the sales orders, which you perform by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) Process Orders (SO501000) form.  If you initiate shipment creation for an individual sales order (by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders form) and the system detects a shortage of the items, the system         displays the message informing you that the order cannot be shipped in full so that you can         make an appropriate decision on the fulfillment of this order and change the quantities,         create a partial shipment, or change the order status to  Back Order  manually. Document-Level Shipping Rules  Document-Level Rule Result  Ship Complete If shipping cannot be performed for each line of the order, no shipment is                   created, and the order is assigned the  Back Order  status. The shipment is created (and the order is assigned the  Shipping  status) if                   shipping can be performed for each line—that is, if the lines meet the                   following criteria: For each  Ship Complete  line: The ordered quantity is available for                     shipping and can be shipped in full. For each  Cancel Remainder  line: Any nonzero quantity that is equal to                     or less than the ordered quantity is available for shipping. For each  Back Order Allowed  line: Any nonzero quantity that is equal to                     or less than the ordered quantity is available for shipping. You cannot specify different  Requested On  dates for                   different lines in the order.  When the shipment has been confirmed, the order is assigned the  Completed                    status if all the lines have the  Completed  status. If any line is not                   completed, the order is assigned the  Back Order  status. Cancel Remainder If shipping cannot be performed for any of order lines, no shipment is created,                   and the order is assigned the  Back Order  status. If full or partial shipping can be performed for at least one line (according to                   the line's shipping rule), the shipment is created. You cannot specify different  Requested On  dates for                   different lines in the order.   When the shipment has been confirmed, the order is assigned the  Completed                    status if at least one line has the  Completed  status and the lines not                   included in shipment have the  Cancel Remainder  rule. The order is assigned                   the  Back Order  status if at least one line is not completed (that is, if it                   has a nonzero open quantity).  Back Order Allowed If shipping cannot be performed for any of the order lines, no shipment is                   created, and the order is assigned the  Back Order  status. You can specify different  Requested On  dates for different                   lines in the order, and different lines will be shipped on different dates.                      If you change the  Requested On  date for the order,                     the system prompts you to choose whether you want to keep the dates specified                     for each line or to update the respective dates with the new                        Requested On  date.  If full or partial shipping can be performed for at least one line according to                   the line's shipping rule, the shipment is created. After the shipment has been                   confirmed, the order is assigned the  Back Order  status if other lines are                   not completed. Examples of the Application of Shipping Rules The table below presents the examples that illustrate how the shipping rules specified for         the sales order and its lines affect the fulfillment of the order. Assume this order has the         following lines:  Line 1:  Product 1  with an ordered quantity of 150 Line 2:  Product 2  with an ordered quantity of 100 Each row of the table shows a combination of shipping rules, with the first column         indicating the rule specified for the sales order as a whole and the second column         indicating the rules specified for the lines of the sales orders. The third column shows the         quantity of each product that is available for shipping in the example in the row. The         fourth column then shows, for the particular shipping rules and available quantities, the         result of and conditions. The table includes enough combinations to give you an idea how         these settings work together without covering an overwhelming amount of detail.

On                 shipment confirmation, the sales order is assigned the  Back Order                  status. Shipment Thresholds You can use undershipment and overshipment thresholds, in addition to shipping rules, to         determine whether a shipment results in changing the status of the sales order line to            Completed .  On the  Document Details  tab on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders         (SO301000) form, for each line of a sales order, you can specify whether undershipment and         overshipment are allowed as follows: To allow overshipment, you enter in the  Overship. Threshold (%)            column a value greater than 100 (meaning 100%). For an order line with the  Ship             Complete  shipping rule for 100 yards of fabric, you might opt to have the whole lap           shipped (a lap of fabric has 100 meters, and each meter is 1.093 yards). To do this, you           can specify the overshipment threshold at 110%, which allows up to 10% more fabric than           the ordered amount to be shipped.  To allow undershipment, you enter in the  Undership. Threshold (%)            a value that is less than 100. Suppose that when you create a shipment, for an order line           with the  Back Order Allowed  shipping rule, the system detects a small shortage of           goods—for example, only 99 units are available for shipping and 100 have been           ordered. If the line's undershipment threshold was specified at 99% or lower, the 99 units           for the line will be included in the shipment, the line will be marked as            Completed , and no open quantity will be left on the line for a back order. If 100 is specified in both these columns, it means that undershipment or overshipment         are not allowed.

When you create a shipment for a sales order (by using either [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] form), the system checks the availability of the items included in the sales order and uses the shipping rules to determine whether the shipment can be created. This topic describes how the partial shipments are created and processed, and how to add zero lines for the items that currently are not available for shipment.{br}{TOC}
==Shipping of Stock Items in Parts==
You can create partial shipments for the sales orders if the '''Shipping Rule''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form has the ''Back Order Allowed'' option selected and ''Back Order Allowed'' shipping rule is selected for at least one order line. These settings let you ship the available quantity of goods in one shipment and the remainder in one shipment or multiple shipments as the goods are received. {br}

If the ''Cancel Remainder'' shipping rule is specified in a line, shipping for the line is performed only once. After the partial shipment of available items has been prepared and confirmed, the line is completed, and the open quantity of the line is set to zero. The lines with the ''Ship Complete'' shipping rule cannot be shipped partially. For more information on shipping rules, overshipment, and undershipment, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Shipping_Rules|Shipping Rule Combinations]. {br}

When you create a shipment by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form, if the system detects that no shipment can be created according to the shipment rules (due to a shortage of items), the system displays a warning; you then decide how to process the order further. If you mass-create shipments for multiple sales orders from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] form, and the system detects that no shipment can be created for a particular order according to the shipment rules, the system changes the status of the order to ''Back Order''. For information, on how to replan back-orders, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_ReplanBackOrders|Back Ordering and Replanning Back Orders].
==Partial Shipping of Free Items==
If a sales order is fulfilled with multiple partial shipments, the '''Free Item Shipping''' setting, located on the '''Price/Discount Calculation''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form, defines how free items should be shipped: proportionally to the amounts of goods in the partial shipments (''Proportional''), or sent with the last shipment (''On Last Shipment'').{br}

 If free items are sent with the last shipment and only part of the needed quantity of free items is available, only the available quantity is shipped, and no back order is initiated for the missing free items. {br}

If the quantity of the free items should be distributed between the partial shipments, the total quantity of free items on all partial shipments for the order may be less than the quantity initially calculated for the applicable group discount, because the system rounds the free item quantity down on each partial shipment. In such a case, you can add the missing quantity of the free item manually to any of the partial shipments.
==Shipments With Zero Lines==
Your organization may prefer to send customer invoices that list all the items from their sales orders so that they can see which items were ordered but at the time were unavailable. To allow the system to add these zero lines to shipments, select the '''Add Zero Lines for Items Not in Stock''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] form. {br}

Selecting this option also can be helpful if you don&rsquo;t want to rely completely on availability data, because in some cases, although the system shows an item as not in stock, the quantities required for a shipment may be available for some reason. You should select this check box if you have item classes for items of which negative quantities are allowed and if shipments are created manually on a per-order basis—then users can edit the shipments and specify the quantities that are currently not reflected on the books correctly and may be available on shipment confirmation (for instance, if shown as quantities on purchase receipts). For example, if you prepare a shipment for a sales order with a line that have the ''Back Order Allowed'' shipping rule, and the available quantity of the item is zero, the shipment will include a zero-line for this item, if the '''Add Zero Lines for Items Not in Stock''' is selected. You can then correct the quantity tho specify the quantity that is actually available for this order line.{br}

If the '''Add Zero Lines for Items Not in Stock''' check box is selected, you should also decide whether to allow the creation of shipments with all zero-quantity lines. To allow the creation of such shipments, you should select the '''Create Zero Shipments''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] form. However, we do not recommend using this option if in your organization, shipments are generally created automatically by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] form.

This topic explains when the system back-orders a sales order and how to replan a back order to process it further.{br}{TOC}
==Completing Sales Orders Lines on Shipping==
Lines with stock and non-stock items that require shipping are completed based on the item quantity in the shipments prepared for the sales order. When you confirm a shipment of the full open quantity of an order line, the '''Completed''' check box becomes selected in the order line. Non-stock lines that do not require shipping are completed by the prepared invoice. After all lines have been completed, the order is assigned the ''Completed'' status.{br}

When you confirm a partial shipment, if an open ''Ship Complete'' line or an incomplete ''Back Order Allowed'' line remains in the order, the remaining open quantity of the line becomes classified to the ''SO Back Ordered'' allocation type, and the sales order is assigned the ''Back Order'' status. The open quantities of ''Cancel Remainder'' lines are set to zero and the '''Completed''' check box is selected for the lines.{br}

Sales order lines that require shipping but cannot be shipped at the moment are assigned the ''SO Back Ordered'' allocation type if shipment creation has failed for them. For an individual sales order with the ''Back Order'' status, you can create a shipment directly from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form without replanning the order once the quantities of the items become above zero. To be able to mass-prepare shipments for back orders by using the ''Create Shipment'' action on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) form, you need to replan the back orders. 
==Automatic Replanning of Back Orders==
Replanning of a back order is a process that moves the ordered items with the ''SO Back Ordered'' allocation type to the ''SO Booked'' allocation type and changes the status of the back order to ''Open'' so that it can be shipped. You can make the system auto-replan back orders by selecting the '''Replan Back-Orders''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form. If this check box is selected, the system automatically replans back orders on release of every inventory transaction that increases the inventory on hand (inventory receipt, inventory transfer, or positive inventory adjustment). The system performs the replanning process for the items that are involved in the released inventory transactions.
==Manual Replanning of Back Orders==
If automatic replanning is switched off— that is, if the '''Replan Back-Orders''' check box is cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form— you can run the manual replanning process for the needed inventory items from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_50_00|Validate Inventory] ([~/?ScreenId=IN505000|IN505000]) form with the '''Replan Back Orders''' check box selected. Also, you can configure a schedule to run the process on that form at an appropriate interval, such as once a day.
==Back Order Replanning Process==
When automatic replanning is in process, for each inventory item being processed, the system selects the ''SO Booked'' and ''SO Back Ordered'' lines of open sales orders. The selected lines are sorted by '''Ship On''' date (starting from the earliest one), allocation type (''SO Booked'' lines are organized before ''SO Back Ordered'' lines), and line quantity, starting from the greatest quantity. ''SO Booked'' lines are included in the process to make sure that the units that are booked for orders created earlier are not counted for the fulfillment of back orders created later. The system distributes the quantity available for shipping among the selected lines in their sort order as follows:[anchor|#_5ff8d784-70d9-46bc-bf65-ed19d41017e3]
#The quantities of ''SO Booked'' lines are subtracted from the quantity available for shipping that can be distributed to the next lines.
#If there is some quantity available for shipping that can be distributed to an ''SO Back Ordered'' line, the system changes the allocation type of the line to ''SO Booked''. For lines with the ''Ship Complete'' shipping rule, the system changes the allocation type to ''SO Booked'' only if the line quantity can be booked in full.
#If the quantity available for shipping is not enough to distribute among all the selected lines, the remaining lines maintain the original ''SO Back Ordered'' status. Each processed line is replanned in full or not replanned at all (and never split) if the quantity that can be booked for the line is less than the line quantity.
((({S:Warn}The system does not reallocate items when it replans back orders. For each replanned back order of an order type that requires allocation—that is, if the '''Require Stock Allocation''' check box is selected for the order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form—you have to manually allocate items before further processing the order.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Back Ordering and Replanning Back Orders This topic explains when the system back-orders a sales order and how to replan a back         order to process it further. Completing Sales Orders Lines on Shipping Lines with stock and non-stock items that require shipping are completed based on the item         quantity in the shipments prepared for the sales order. When you confirm a shipment of the         full open quantity of an order line, the  Completed  check box becomes         selected in the order line. Non-stock lines that do not require shipping are completed by         the prepared invoice. After all lines have been completed, the order is assigned the            Completed  status. When you confirm a partial shipment, if an open  Ship Complete  line or an incomplete            Back Order Allowed  line remains in the order, the remaining open quantity of the         line becomes classified to the  SO Back Ordered  allocation type, and the sales order         is assigned the  Back Order  status. The open quantities of  Cancel Remainder          lines are set to zero and the  Completed  check box is selected for the         lines. Sales order lines that require shipping but cannot be shipped at the moment are assigned         the  SO Back Ordered  allocation type if shipment creation has failed for them. For an         individual sales order with the  Back Order  status, you can create a shipment directly         from the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form without replanning the order once         the quantities of the items become above zero. To be able to mass-prepare shipments for back         orders by using the  Create Shipment  action on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) Process Orders         (SO501000) form, you need to replan the back orders.  Automatic Replanning of Back Orders Replanning of a back order is a process that moves the ordered items with the  SO Back           Ordered  allocation type to the  SO Booked  allocation type and changes the status         of the back order to  Open  so that it can be shipped. You can make the system         auto-replan back orders by selecting the  Replan Back-Orders  check box         on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000) form. If this check box is selected, the         system automatically replans back orders on release of every inventory transaction that         increases the inventory on hand (inventory receipt, inventory transfer, or positive         inventory adjustment). The system performs the replanning process for the items that are         involved in the released inventory transactions. Manual Replanning of Back Orders If automatic replanning is switched off— that is, if the  Replan           Back-Orders  check box is cleared on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences         (IN101000) form— you can run the manual replanning process for the needed inventory         items from the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN505000|IN505000]) Validate Inventory (IN505000) form with the  Replan           Back Orders  check box selected. Also, you can configure a schedule to run the         process on that form at an appropriate interval, such as once a day. Back Order Replanning Process When automatic replanning is in process, for each inventory item being processed, the         system selects the  SO Booked  and  SO Back Ordered  lines of open sales orders.         The selected lines are sorted by  Ship On  date (starting from the         earliest one), allocation type ( SO Booked  lines are organized before  SO Back           Ordered  lines), and line quantity, starting from the greatest quantity.  SO           Booked  lines are included in the process to make sure that the units that are booked         for orders created earlier are not counted for the fulfillment of back orders created later.         The system distributes the quantity available for shipping among the selected lines in their         sort order as follows: The quantities of  SO Booked  lines are subtracted from the quantity available for           shipping that can be distributed to the next lines. If there is some quantity available for shipping that can be distributed to an  SO             Back Ordered  line, the system changes the allocation type of the line to  SO             Booked . For lines with the  Ship Complete  shipping rule, the system changes           the allocation type to  SO Booked  only if the line quantity can be booked in           full. If the quantity available for shipping is not enough to distribute among all the           selected lines, the remaining lines maintain the original  SO Back Ordered  status.           Each processed line is replanned in full or not replanned at all (and never split) if the           quantity that can be booked for the line is less than the line quantity. The system does not reallocate items when it replans back orders. For each replanned         back order of an order type that requires allocation—that is, if the            Require Stock Allocation  check box is selected for the order type         on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form—you have to manually allocate         items before further processing the order. ]]></column>

When you are entering a sales order, you may notice that some of the ordered items are not available in the warehouse from which you are going to ship the order, but the quantity needed to fulfill the order is available in another warehouse. For fulfilling this sales order, you need to allocate items in the other warehouse, and then transfer these items to the warehouse from which the order will be shipped. In Acumatica ERP, you can process the transfer of allocated goods from one warehouse to another by creating and processing a transfer order based on the applicable sales order.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Create a sales order with items allocated in different warehouses.
*Prepare a transfer order for a sales order.
*Process a transfer order to completion to transfer the included items.
*Process a sales order after the items have been transferred to the destination warehouse.

==Applicable Scenarios==
You process a sales order with goods from multiple warehouses in the following cases:[anchor|#_8dbf0bee-fabe-4da5-bf61-5810cbf9a2b9]
*You have only a part of the ordered items in the warehouse specified in the sales order, but the rest of the items are currently available at another warehouse (or multiple warehouses), so the sales order can be completed with the items from different warehouses.
*You company uses one warehouse as a distribution center, so that all items are received to this warehouse and then are distributed to smaller warehouses on demand.

==Sale of Stock Items from Multiple Warehouses==
When you process a sale of inventory items, you can reserve one line or multiple lines of an open sales order of the ''SO'' type in a warehouse other than the warehouse selected in the line. To be able to process a sales order with stock items that you have allocated (that is, reserved) in a remote warehouse (that is, a warehouse other than the one specified in the order), you first need to transfer the reserved items from the remote source warehouse (where you reserved the items) to the destination warehouse (for which the sales order is processed). For this purpose, you need to prepare and process a transfer order (that is, an order of the ''TR'' predefined order type).{br}

The standard sales process typically starts with the entry of a sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. To obtain the sufficient quantity of items for the sales order, you manually reserve the quantity for each specific item in the source warehouse. For the items allocated in a warehouse other than the warehouse specified in the sales order, the system automatically generates transfer requests of the ''SO Allocated'' plan type based on which you generate transfer orders related to sales orders. To be able to complete the sales order, you need to perform a transfer of the items allocated in a source warehouse to the destination warehouse by creating and processing a transfer order (or multiple orders). {br}

To create a transfer order for a sales order, while viewing the sales order with allocated items on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, you click '''Actions''' > '''Create Transfer Order''' on the form toolbar; then you create one transfer order or multiple transfer orders on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_90_00|Create Transfer Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO509000|SO509000]) form, which opens. This form shows transfer requests for the sales orders that have the ''Open'' status.{br}

A transfer order is fulfilled by one shipment or by multiple shipments from the source warehouse (in which the item is allocated) to the destination warehouse. You create a shipment for a transfer order from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Create Shipment''' on the form toolbar; on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form, which is opened, you then confirm the shipment by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Confirm Shipment''' on the form toolbar.{br}

To update the item quantities in the source warehouse and complete the shipment, while you are still viewing the shipment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] form, you click '''Actions''' > '''Update IN''' on the form toolbar; the system generates the two-step inventory transfer transaction, which issues items from the source warehouse. On release of this inventory transfer, the system generates a batch of general ledger transactions.{br}

To complete the processing of the two-step inventory transfer, you prepare a transfer receipt to record the receiving of items to the destination warehouse. You manually create the transfer receipt (a receipt of the ''Transfer Receipt'' type) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form and add to the receipt the lines from one transfer order or multiple transfer orders. A transfer receipt may include only some of the lines from a transfer order; also, you can change the quantity in a particular line if the items specified in this line were received partially.{br}

On release of the transfer receipt, the inventory receipt transaction is generated in the system to reflect the receipt of the items to the destination warehouse. On release of the inventory receipt, a batch of GL transactions is generated. Thus, the quantity of the item that has been transferred from the source warehouse to the destination warehouse becomes available for sale.{br}

After all transferred stock items have been received to the destination warehouse, you complete the sales order as you would if you had just entered it: You process a shipment of all items from the destination warehouse, and you process the related SO invoice. For information about the general steps of sales order processing, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\OrderMgmt_Sale_of_Stock_Items_Mapref|Processing Sales of Stock Items].
==Workflow of a Sale from Multiple Warehouses==
For a sales order for which the items have been allocated in multiple warehouses, the processing involves the actions and generated documents shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#fig_xqs_s4n_jdb][anchor|#image_sqs_xrk_3db][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_OrderMgmt_Sale_from_Multiple_Warehouses.png|popup|400px]]]></column>

To complete the processing of the two-step inventory transfer, you prepare a transfer receipt     to record the receiving of items to the destination warehouse. You manually create the transfer     receipt (a receipt of the  Transfer Receipt  type) on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts     (PO302000) form and add to the receipt the lines from one transfer order or multiple transfer     orders. A transfer receipt may include only some of the lines from a transfer order; also, you     can change the quantity in a particular line if the items specified in this line were received     partially. On release of the transfer receipt, the inventory receipt transaction is generated in the     system to reflect the receipt of the items to the destination warehouse. On release of the     inventory receipt, a batch of GL transactions is generated. Thus, the quantity of the item that     has been transferred from the source warehouse to the destination warehouse becomes available     for sale. After all transferred stock items have been received to the destination warehouse, you     complete the sales order as you would if you had just entered it: You process a shipment of all     items from the destination warehouse, and you process the related SO invoice. For information     about the general steps of sales order processing, see  Processing Sales of Stock Items. Workflow of a Sale from Multiple Warehouses For a sales order for which the items have been allocated in multiple warehouses, the     processing involves the actions and generated documents shown in the following diagram. ]]></column>

==Story==
Suppose that the FourStar Coffee & Sweets Shop customer ordered cherry jam in 32-ounce jars and lemon jam in 96-ounce jars at SweetLife’s retail store. When entering this sales order, a sales manager has noticed that the 32-ounce jars of cherry jam are currently out of stock in the retail warehouse, and has decided to allocate the unavailable quantity of jam in the SweetLife’s wholesale warehouse.{br}

To complete the customer’s request, acting as the sales manager of the SweetLife store, you need to enter the sales order and allocate the needed items, process a transfer of cherry jam from the wholesale warehouse to the SweetLife store&rsquo;s warehouse, and then process the sales order to completion.[anchor|#section_qnv_sty_clb]
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, the following features have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form: [anchor|#_de016f84-6b54-499c-a7ad-dc116afe37b2]
*''Inventory'', which provides the ability to create purchase orders that include stock items
*''Multiple Warehouses'', which provides the ability to process transfers of items between warehouses

The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in the system:[anchor|#ul_wxw_fv1_clb]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form, the ''WHOLESALE'' and ''RETAIL'' warehouses have been configured.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form, the ''COFFEESHOP'' customer has been configured.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, the ''CHERJAM32'' and ''LEMJAM96'' stock items have been configured.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form, the ''TR'' order type has been configured.

==Process Overview==
In this activity, to perform a sale of stock items from multiple warehouses, you will create a sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, select the customer to which the items are being sold, and add items to the order. Then you will allocate the unavailable items in the warehouse in which these items are currently on hand.{br}

To transfer items from the source warehouse to the destination warehouse, you will create a transfer order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_90_00|Create Transfer Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO509000|SO509000]) form. Then you will process a transfer order to completion: You will process the related shipment between warehouses (which causes the items to be issued from the source warehouse) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form, and you will process the related transfer receipt (which records the receipt of the items to the destination warehouse) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form. After you process the transfer receipt, all the items required for the sales order become available in the destination warehouse, so you can process the initial sales order to completion. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form, you will create a shipment document for the sales order and confirm the shipment. You then will use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form to prepare the corresponding invoice for the customer and release it.
==System Preparation==
Do the following:[anchor|#_f037b311-f439-42af-a9a7-584719dc0985][anchor|#_efbac641-3070-4ea3-95c8-03e0cfa6046e]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded. To sign in as a sales and purchasing manager, use the ''wiley'' login and the ''123'' password.[anchor|#_a2256ad9-8330-4fc0-9cf3-1312ab897ea5]
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to today&rsquo;s date. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.[anchor|#_59100414-5a14-4ed3-bd08-906d77c191e0]
#On the company and branch selection menu, on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, select the ''SweetLife Store'' branch.

==Step 1: Creating the Sales Order==
To create the sales order, do the following:[anchor|#_639c6644-42f8-4dc8-8802-bb668aa56d78]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, create a sales order, and specify the following settings:
#*'''Order Type''': ''SO''
#* '''Customer''': ''COFFEESHOP''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Sale of cherry jam and lemon jam</tt>
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, add rows with the settings shown in the following table.
#:{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="20%" ! Branch
!width="20%" ! Inventory ID
!width="20%" ! Warehouse
!width="20%" ! Quantity

#:Notice that the system displays a warning in the '''Quantity''' column of the ''CHERJAM32'' line indicating that the specified quantity is not available in the selected warehouse.
#Click '''Save''' on the form toolbar to save the sales order, which is assigned the ''Open'' status.

==Step 2: Allocating the Items in Another Warehouse==
To allocate the items that are not available in the ''RETAIL'' warehouse, while you are still viewing the sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, do the following:[anchor|#_beb4c9ae-a528-46f6-8136-ae5797226a78]
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, click the ''CHERJAM32'' line, and on the table toolbar, click '''Allocations'''.
#In the '''Allocations''' dialog box, which opens, do the following:
##In the only line, select the '''Allocated''' check box.
##In the '''Alloc. Warehouse''' box, select ''WHOLESALE''.
##Click '''OK'''
#:Notice that the warehouse in the line on the '''Document Details''' tab hasn&rsquo;t changed, but in the table footer, the '''Allocated''' quantity is now equal to 10.[anchor|#_6e524baa-8a60-4149-912a-861515590b5f]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

==Step 3: Creating the Transfer Order==
To create the transfer order for the allocated items from the sales order, do the following:[anchor|#_124ad575-f457-470f-82b6-53f8f785e7b6]
#While you are still viewing the sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, click '''Actions''' > '''Create Transfer Order''' on the form toolbar.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_90_00|Create Transfer Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO509000|SO509000]) form, which opens, select the unlabeled check box in the line with ''SO Allocated'' specified as the '''Plan Type''' and ''CHERJAM32'' specified as the '''Inventory ID'''. This line is the transfer request related to the line of the sales order that you have allocated in another warehouse. In the line, make sure that ''WHOLESALE'' is specified as the '''From Warehouse''' and ''RETAIL'' is specified as the '''To Warehouse'''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Process''' to process the transfer request you have selected. The system creates a transfer order of the ''TR'' order type and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form.
#In the '''Description''' box in the Summary area, type <tt>Transferred goods for sales order from COFFEESHOP</tt>.[anchor|#_5fa343b6-2fd1-4d59-8c73-1d0d8757e51b]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

==Step 4: Processing the Transfer Order==
To process the transfer order to completion, do the following:[anchor|#_1db3a71a-0b05-4c40-97a5-915d33facf1d]
#While you are still viewing the transfer order you have created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, on the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Create Shipment'''. 
#In the '''Specify Shipment Parameters''' dialog box, which opens, make sure the today&rsquo;s date and the ''WHOLESALE'' warehouse are selected, and click '''OK'''. The system creates a shipment with the ''Transfer'' type and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form. 
#Review the Summary area of the shipment, and make sure that '''Warehouse ID''' is ''WHOLESALE'' and '''To Warehouse''' is ''RETAIL''. Also, review the only line included in the shipment, and make sure its details are correct.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Confirm Shipment'''. The shipment is assigned the ''Confirmed'' status.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Update IN''' to generate the inventory transfer transaction that issues the items from the source warehouse. The shipment is assigned the ''Completed'' status.
#On the '''Orders''' tab, click the link in the '''Inventory Ref. Nbr.''' column in the only row.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_40_00|Transfers] ([~/?ScreenId=IN304000|IN304000]) form that opens, make sure that the generated inventory transfer has been released.

==Step 5: Processing the Transfer Receipt==
To process the transfer receipt, do the following:[anchor|#ol_k2h_jwy_clb]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form.[anchor|#_51546a7d-eadc-474a-ac5d-17436777054d]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record'''.
#In the Summary area, specify the following:
#*'''Type''': ''Transfer Receipt''
#* '''Warehouse''': ''RETAIL''
#On the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab, click '''Add Transfer'''. The '''Add Transfer Order''' dialog box opens. The dialog box shows the list of completed transfer orders with completed shipments whose items have not been received to the destination warehouse yet.
#In the dialog box, select the unlabeled check box for the transfer order you have processed earlier, and click '''Add & Close''' to close the dialog box and return to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] form.
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, review the details of the added line with the ''CHERJAM32'' item.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the transfer receipt.
#On the '''Other Information''' tab, click the '''IN Ref. Nbr.''' link to open the related inventory receipt transaction on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) form.
#Make sure the inventory receipt has the ''Released'' status, which means that the items have been received to the ''RETAIL'' warehouse and are now available for shipping.

Now you can finish processing the sales order, because all of the ordered items are on hand in the SweetLife&rsquo;s Store warehouse.
==Step 6: Processing the Shipment==
To create and process the shipment that is associated with the sales order, do the following:[anchor|#_c13c0201-052e-41d4-91c1-d3fabf10b020]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, open the sales order of the ''SO'' type that you have created in Step 1, and on the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Create Shipment'''.
#In the '''Specify Shipment Parameters''' dialog box, which opens, make sure the today&rsquo;s date and the ''RETAIL'' warehouse are selected, and click '''OK'''. The system creates a shipment and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form. 
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, make sure that both order lines have been included in the shipment and that the shipped quantity in both lines is equal to the ordered quantity.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Confirm Shipment'''.

The shipment is assigned the ''Confirmed'' status, and now you can prepare the invoice to bill the customer and increase the customer&rsquo;s debt in the system.
==Step 7: Processing the AR Invoice for the Customer==
To complete the processing of a sale, you need to generate an invoice to the customer. Do the following:[anchor|#_3b26f332-6214-4df2-bd5c-cae71a7c03c0]
#While you are still viewing the shipment you have created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form, on the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Prepare Invoice'''.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form, which opens, review the details of the invoice to make sure that both items have been included in the invoice.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Release''' to release the invoice.
#Return to the sales order of the ''SO'' type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form, and notice that the order is now assigned the ''Completed'' status, as shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_8e3a556c-2483-45ab-b4fa-992ca5d02ae5][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_OrderMgmt_Sale_from_Multiple_Warehouses.png|popup|Sale from multiple warehouses completed|450px]

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Sales from Multiple Warehouses: Process Activity The following activity will walk you through the processing of a sales order with                 items allocated in multiple warehouses. The following activity is             based on the  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system             settings have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the             activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100              dataset to its initial state. Story Suppose that the FourStar Coffee & Sweets Shop customer ordered cherry jam in                 32-ounce jars and lemon jam in 96-ounce jars at SweetLife’s retail store. When                 entering this sales order, a sales manager has noticed that the 32-ounce jars of                 cherry jam are currently out of stock in the retail warehouse, and has decided to                 allocate the unavailable quantity of jam in the SweetLife’s wholesale warehouse. To complete the customer’s request, acting as the sales manager of the SweetLife                 store, you need to enter the sales order and allocate the needed items, process a                 transfer of cherry jam from the wholesale warehouse to the SweetLife store's                 warehouse, and then process the sales order to completion. Configuration Overview For the purposes of this activity, the following features have been enabled on the                       ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS101000) form:  Inventory , which provides the ability to create purchase orders that                     include stock items Multiple Warehouses , which provides the ability to process transfers of                     items between warehouses The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in                 the system: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses (IN204000) form, the  WHOLESALE  and                          RETAIL  warehouses have been configured. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000) form, the  COFFEESHOP                      customer has been configured. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form, the  CHERJAM32  and                          LEMJAM96  stock items have been configured. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form, the  TR  order type                     has been configured. Process Overview In this activity, to perform a sale of stock items from multiple warehouses, you will                 create a sales order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, select                 the customer to which the items are being sold, and add items to the order. Then you                 will allocate the unavailable items in the warehouse in which these items are                 currently on hand. To transfer items from the source warehouse to the destination warehouse, you will                 create a transfer order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO509000|SO509000]) Create Transfer Orders (SO509000) form. Then                 you will process a transfer order to completion: You will process the related                 shipment between warehouses (which causes the items to be issued from the source                 warehouse) on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) form, and you will                 process the related transfer receipt (which records the receipt of the items to the                 destination warehouse) on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form. After                 you process the transfer receipt, all the items required for the sales order become                 available in the destination warehouse, so you can process the initial sales order                 to completion. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) form, you will                 create a shipment document for the sales order and confirm the shipment. You then                 will use the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form to prepare the                 corresponding invoice for the customer and release it. System Preparation Do the following: Launch the  Acumatica ERP             website, and sign in to a company with the  U100  dataset preloaded. To sign in as             a sales and purchasing manager, use the  wiley  login and the  123              password. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to today's date.

The following sections explain how to create multiple transfer orders and related documents, and how the system generates, changes, or works with documents as a result of the mass processing. {br}{TOC}
==Mass-Creating Transfer Orders==
Transfer orders can be mass-generated for multiple sales orders at a time. To mass-create transfer orders, you open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_90_00|Create Transfer Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO509000|SO509000]) form, on which you can create transfer orders based on the transfer requests that have been created for sales orders.{br}

On this form, after you specify any needed criteria to limit the requests listed, you select the unlabeled check boxes in the rows of the transfer requests to be processed (which are the lines with the ''SO Allocated'' plan type) and click '''Process''' on the form toolbar to generate the applicable transfer orders. The system creates a consolidated transfer order for each group of transfer requests with the same source warehouse–destination warehouse pair.
==Mass-Creating Shipments==
Shipments can be mass-generated for transfer orders. To generate shipments for multiple transfer orders at a time, you open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) form and select the ''Create Shipment'' action, as well as any selection criteria for filtering the orders. Then you select the unlabeled check boxes in the rows of the orders to be processed, and click '''Process''' on the form toolbar. The system prepares a consolidated shipment document for each group of the selected transfer orders with the same source warehouse–destination warehouse pair; the lines in the prepared shipments are grouped by stock items in these lines.
==Mass-Confirming Shipments==
Shipments can be confirmed in bulk. To confirm multiple shipments at a time, you open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_30_00|Process Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO503000|SO503000]) form and select the ''Confirm Shipment'' action, as well as any selection criteria for filtering the shipments. Then you select the unlabeled check boxes in the rows of the shipments to be processed, and click '''Process''' on the form toolbar. The system confirms the selected shipment documents. 
==Mass-Printing Pick Lists==
For multiple shipments with the ''On Hold'' and ''Open'' statuses, you can mass-print pick lists by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_30_00|Process Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO503000|SO503000]) form. On this form, you select the ''Print Pick List'' action (and any other needed selection criteria for filtering the shipments), select the unlabeled check boxes in the rows of the shipments for which you need to print pick lists, and click '''Process''' on the form toolbar.]]></column>

When the SO invoice is released, the batch of General Ledger transactions is generated. Also, when the SO invoice is released, the system automatically generates a corresponding inventory issue with the date and posting period of the invoice. The related Accounts Receivable invoice with the same reference number becomes available for reviewing on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form. For more information on processing Accounts Receivable invoices, see [HelpRoot_Financials\Finance_ARInvoices_Mapref|Processing AR Invoices].
==4. Release the Inventory Issue==
The generated inventory issue is released automatically if the '''Automatically Release IN Documents''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form. If this check box is cleared, you have to release the inventory issue manually by clicking '''Release''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form. On release of the inventory issue, the batch of General Ledger transactions is generated.

For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Quick_Process_Workflow|Quick Processing of Sales Orders].
)))[anchor|#fig_dc5_dmr_gdb][anchor|#image_ec5_dmr_gdb][image:UserGuide/Images/Inventory_Sale_By_Cash.png|popup|300px]
The following sections describe in detail the processing steps shown in the diagram.{br}{TOC}
==1. Enter the Sales Order==
A new sales order of the ''CS'' type is created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. You can save the order of the ''CS'' type only after you specify the payment information, including the payment method, cash account, and payment reference number (and the card information if the payment is performed with a credit card). {br}

The reference number for a new order is generated according to the numbering sequence assigned to this order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. If the order is created with the ''On Hold'' status, you should click '''Release from Hold''' on the form toolbar to process the order further.
==2. Prepare the Sales Orders Invoice==
You can prepare the Sales Orders (SO) invoice by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Prepare Invoice''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, or you can create invoices by specifying the ''Prepare Invoice'' action on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) form and processing multiple selected orders. For the cash sale order, an SO invoice of the ''Cash Sale'' type is prepared. {br}

Any prepared SO invoice can be reviewed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form. You can print an SO invoice by clicking '''Reports &gt; Print Invoice''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] form. 
==3. Release the Sales Orders Invoice==
To release the Sales Orders invoice, you click '''Actions &gt; Release''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] form. When the SO invoice of the ''Cash Sale'' type is released, a batch of General Ledger transactions is generated. Also, when the SO invoice is released, the system automatically generates a corresponding inventory issue with the date and posting period of the SO invoice. The related Accounts Receivable cash sale with the same reference number becomes available for reviewing on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_40_00|Cash Sales] ([~/?ScreenId=AR304000|AR304000]) form. For more information on processing Accounts Receivable cash sales, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__how_Entering_a_Cash_Sale|To Enter a Cash Sale].
==4. Release the Inventory Issue==
The generated inventory issue is released automatically if the '''Automatically Release IN Documents''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form. If this check box is cleared, you have to release the inventory issue manually by clicking '''Release''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form. On release of the inventory issue, a batch of General Ledger transactions is generated.
==Important Notes==
Note the following about the processing of cash sales orders:[anchor|#_7ae8fe89-5d47-4673-aa43-53ab950f4ce8]
*If you process a cash sales order with only non-stock items, no inventory issue is generated when the SO invoice of the ''Cash Sale'' type is released. 
*For non-stock items and services, you can enter a process a cash sale directly on the[HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_40_00|Cash Sales] ([~/?ScreenId=AR304000|AR304000]) form without creating and processing a cash sale order.
*For items that have lot or serial numbers tracked in Acumatica ERP, you can specify these numbers, thus indicating that these particular items have been delivered to the customer.

In Acumatica ERP, the payment and prepayment functionality is used to record the amount of funds that has already been paid for each sales order.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Create a sales order
*Create a prepayment or payment for the sales order
*Create a shipment for the sales order
*Confirm the shipment
*Create an invoice for a sales order
*Process the invoice

==Applicable Scenarios==
You create sales orders with payments and prepayments in the following cases:[anchor|#_2b17960a-2a22-46de-83f8-ce16229a8397]
*When you sell goods that you produce or purchase only after you have received the payment, per company policy
*When you have a contract with a customer that requires a certain prepayment percent before the goods can be shipped

==Sales Orders with Payments and Prepayments==
The standard processing of a sales order with a payment or prepayment typically includes entering a sales order, entering a payment or prepayment, processing a shipment of the items, and preparing the related invoice for the customer.{br}

 In Acumatica ERP, to begin processing a sale that requires the items to be shipped before billing occurs, you enter a sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form and add to the order the items the customer has requested.{br}

When the customer pays the amount that is required before the sales order can be processed further, you create a prepayment document and apply it to the sales order.{br}

Then you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form to prepare and confirm the shipment or shipments related to the sales order. When the shipment confirmation is complete, you need to bill the customer for the shipped items by preparing an SO invoice, which is a financial document in the system that contains links to the applicable shipments and sales orders. You can review the prepared SO invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form. If any payment is still required for the sales order, after the money is received, you create a payment and apply it to the SO invoice; then you can release the invoice. When the SO invoice is released, you can also view it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form.{br}

An AR invoice view is similar to the SO invoice view, but it does not contain the links to the applicable shipments and sales orders. Both of these document views contain the link to the batch of general ledger transactions that was generated when the AR invoice was released. For more information on processing accounts receivable invoices, see [HelpRoot_Financials\Finance_ARInvoices_Mapref|Processing AR Invoices].
==Workflow of Processing a Sales Order with a Payment or Prepayment==
For a sales orders with a payment or prepayment, the typical processing involves the actions and generated documents shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#_6d3fa360-736d-426b-93b0-67ee4ab18063][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_OrderMgmt_Sales_With_Prepayments.png|popup|450px]]]></column>

Contact your system administrator to obtain access to any needed reports or forms.
))){br}{TOC}
==Finding Shipments Related to a Sales Order==
If you need to find a shipment that is linked to a particular sales order and view it, you can do this by opening the sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form and viewing the '''Shipments''' tab, which lists all the shipments that have been prepared for the order. To view the details of a listed shipment, you click its reference number in the '''Document Nbr.''' column; the system opens the shipment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form.
==Tracking the Status of Order Fulfillment==
To track how a sales order is being fulfilled, you can check its status in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form. On the '''Totals''' tab of this form, you can also check the quantities and amounts that are not yet shipped and not yet billed, as well as the amount that is not yet paid. 
==Printing Pick Lists==
To prepare a printable pick list for a shipment document that is being processed, you use the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\SO_64_40_00|Pick List] ([~/?ScreenId=SO644000|SO644000]) report. While you are viewing a shipment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form, you can go to this report for the selected shipment by clicking '''Actions &gt; Print Pick List''' on the form toolbar. The system opens the printable pick list on the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\SO_64_40_00|Pick List] report; then you can view the pick list and print it by clicking '''Print''' on the report toolbar. 
==Printing Invoices==
To prepare a printable form of the SO invoice that is being processed, you use the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\SO_64_30_00|Invoice / Memo] ([~/?ScreenId=SO643000|SO643000]) report.

Contact your system administrator to obtain             access to any needed reports or forms. Finding Shipments Related to a Sales Order If you need to find a shipment that is linked to a particular sales order and view                 it, you can do this by opening the sales order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form and viewing the  Shipments  tab, which lists                 all the shipments that have been prepared for the order. To view the details of a                 listed shipment, you click its reference number in the  Document                     Nbr.  column; the system opens the shipment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) form. Tracking the Status of Order Fulfillment To track how a sales order is being fulfilled, you can check its status in the                 Summary area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders form. On the                      Totals  tab of this form, you can also check the                 quantities and amounts that are not yet shipped and not yet billed, as well as the                 amount that is not yet paid.  Printing Pick Lists To prepare a printable pick list for a shipment document that is being processed, you                 use the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO644000|SO644000]) Pick List (SO644000) report. While you are viewing a                 shipment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) form, you can go to this                 report for the selected shipment by clicking  Actions > Print Pick List  on the form toolbar. The system opens the printable pick list on the                       ([~/?ScreenId=SO644000|SO644000]) Pick List report; then you can view the pick list and                 print it by clicking  Print  on the report toolbar.  Printing Invoices To prepare a printable form of the SO invoice that is being processed, you use the                       ([~/?ScreenId=SO643000|SO643000]) Invoice / Memo (SO643000) report.

 Acumatica ERP provides support for the most common types of return processes, which gives you the flexibility to manage various types of customer returns according to the return policies of your company. {br}

Returns for credit with receipt of items are one type of returns. These returns are processed in the system as return orders of the ''RC'' order type. With this type, a customer returns an item, which you need to receive to inventory. You then process a credit memo to adjust the customer&rsquo;s balance in the system.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Create a return order that is linked to the sales order in which the returned items were purchased
*Create an incoming shipment (receipt) of the returned item or items, and confirm the shipment
*Create an SO credit memo for the original sales order 
*Process the SO credit memo and the related inventory and AP documents

==Applicable Scenario==
You create a return order for credit (that is, an order with the ''RC'' predefined order type) to perform a customer return for credit with the returned item or items received to inventory and the AP documents issued to adjust the customer balance in the system. 
==Processing of Returned Items for Credit==
The standard process of return for credit typically includes the entry of a return order, the addition of items to be returned, the processing of the receipt of the returned items to inventory, and the preparation of the related AR document to customer. {br}

In general, the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) is the starting point for the creation of a customer return. You create a new return order and add the item or items that are being returned by the customer. You can add a line and select the item to be returned without linking it to a sales document, or add a line with a reference to the original SO invoice for which the return is performed. To add an item with a link to the original SO invoice, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form, you click '''Add Invoice''' on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab and select the line of the needed invoice in the '''Add Invoice Details''' dialog box (which opens). If an item to be returned has a specific lot or serial number, you should select this particular item from the list of invoice lines.{br}

The receipt of the items returned to inventory is processed in the system as an incoming shipment document with the ''Receipt'' operation type. After you have prepared and confirmed the document reflecting the receipt of items to inventory, you need to update the customer&rsquo;s balance in the amount of the returned items by preparing and releasing an SO credit memo (which is an SO invoice document of the ''Credit Memo'' type). The SO credit memo is a financial document in the system that contains links to the applicable shipments and sales orders. You can review the prepared SO credit memo on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form; then you can release it. When the SO credit memo is released, the system automatically generates a corresponding inventory receipt for the returned items and creates and releases a corresponding AR credit memo, which you can view on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form. An AR credit memo is a financial document that is similar to the SO credit memo but doesn't contain the links to the applicable shipments and sales orders. Also, unlike the SO document, the AR credit memo can be applied to the customer balance.{br}

To finish the return process, you need to process the AR credit memo to completion. You can apply the credit memo to the original invoice, or process a customer refund if the original invoice was already paid. For details on credit memo application, see [HelpRoot_Financials\Finance_CorrectingARInvoices_GeneralInfo|AR Invoice Correction: General Information]. For details on the processing of a customer refund, see [HelpRoot_Financials\Finance_ProcessingCustomerRefunds_Activity1|Customer Refunds: To Create a Customer Refund].
==Workflow of a Return for Credit with Receipt==
The processing of a return order for credit involves the actions and generated documents shown in the following diagram. [anchor|#fig_ll4_m1b_kdb][anchor|#image_ml4_m1b_kdb][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_Return_for_Credit_With_Receipt.png|popup|450px]]]></column>

))){br}{TOC}
==Story==
Suppose that on January 30, 2020, the FourStar Coffee & Sweets Shop customer requests authorization for the return of the oranges ordered on January 29, 2020, because the customer was not satisfied with the quality of the shipped fruits. The sales manager authorizes the return with shipping of the returned items to SweetLife’s main warehouse. Acting as the sales manager, you will process this return.
==Configuration Overview==For the purposes of this lesson, the ''Inventory'' feature, which provides the ability to create purchase orders that include stock items, has been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form, the ''RC'' order type has been configured and activated.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form, the ''COFFEESHOP (FourStar Coffee & Sweets Shop)'' customer has been configured. Additionally, the sales documents for which you will process a return, as well as the items included in these documents, have been configured in the system.
==Process Overview==
To process a return for credit with shipping, you create a return order of the ''RC'' type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, and add to it the line or lines of the SO invoice that had been prepared for the sales order for which you need to process a return. Then you receive the returned items to inventory on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form by creating a shipment with the ''Receipt'' operation and confirming it. After the items have been received to inventory, you create an SO credit memo to decrease the customer&rsquo;s debt in the system by the amount of the returned items. After reviewing the details of the prepared credit memo on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form, you release it.
==System Preparation==
Before you begin preparing and processing the customer return, do the following:[anchor|#_f811a610-8f11-49fe-9fd6-edb04d0e9b26]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded. To sign in as a sales manager, use the ''norman'' login and the ''123'' password.
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select ''1/30/2020'' from the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.

==Step 1: Creating a Return Order ==
You create a return order as follows:[anchor|#_588f6f42-dabc-4c1e-9be2-dbd794d75edf]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, create an order and specify the following settings:
#*'''Order Type''': ''RC''
#* '''Customer''': ''COFFEESHOP''
#* '''Date''': ''1/30/2020''
#* '''Requested On''': ''1/30/2020''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Return unconditional order</tt>
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save''' to save the order.

==Step 2: Adding the Item to Be Returned==
Now you need to do the following to add to the return order the line of the SO invoice that had been prepared for the sales order for which you need to process a return:[anchor|#_300cd7e8-2e64-4ffd-a502-45917f972f17]
#While you are still viewing the return order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab, click '''Add Invoice'''. 
#In the '''Add Invoice Details''' dialog box, which opens, select ''Invoice'' in the '''Type''' box. In the '''Reference Nbr.''' box, select the reference number of the invoice to ''COFFEESHOP'' dated ''1/29/2020''. The invoice lines appear in the table of the dialog box.
#In the table, select the unlabeled check box in the ''ORANGES'' line, and click '''Add & Close''', which closes the dialog box and adds the line to the '''Document Details''' tab.
#Review the details of the added line, and make sure that the related invoice reference number is specified in the '''Invoice Nbr.''' column.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''; notice that the return order has the ''Open'' status.

==Step 3: Receiving the Returned Items==
You process the receipt of items to inventory as follows:[anchor|#_6b164728-1351-4079-a71d-0520e29bef87]
#While you are still viewing the return order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, on the form toolbar, click '''Actions &gt; Create Receipt''' to create a receipt of the returned items.
#In the '''Specify Shipment Parameters''' dialog box, which opens, make sure that ''1/30/2020'' is selected as the '''Shipment Date''' and ''WHOLESALE'' is selected as the '''Warehouse ID'''.
#Click '''OK'''. The system closes the dialog box and opens the prepared shipment with the ''Receipt'' operation on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form.
#Click '''Actions &gt; Confirm Shipment''' to confirm the shipment.

==Step 4: Processing a Credit Memo==
Now that you have processed the return of the items to inventory, you need to prepare a credit memo to the customer to adjust the customer&rsquo;s balance by doing the following: [anchor|#_16dfad6a-5465-442c-bae0-28e53f4c7c5b]
#While you are still viewing the shipment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form, on the form toolbar, click '''Actions &gt; Prepare Invoice'''. The system creates a credit memo to the customer and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form.
#In the Summary area, make sure that the '''Date''' is set to ''1/30/2020''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions &gt; Release''' to release the credit memo, which is assigned the ''Open'' status, as shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_12fef44e-bd2f-40db-8d84-cd0aebf4dccb][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_OrderMgmt_Return_for_Credit_with_Receipt.png|popup|Credit memo prepared for the return order|450px]

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Returns for Credit with Receipt: Process Activity The following activity will walk you through the process of preparing and processing                 (to completion) a customer return for a particular sales order with the returned                 item or items being received to inventory and a credit memo to the customer being                 created.  The following activity is             based on the  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system             settings have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the             activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100              dataset to its initial state. Story Suppose that on January 30,  2020, the FourStar Coffee & Sweets Shop customer                 requests authorization for the return of the oranges ordered on January 29,  2020,                 because the customer was not satisfied with the quality of the shipped fruits. The                 sales manager authorizes the return with shipping of the returned items to                 SweetLife’s main warehouse. Acting as the sales manager, you will process this                 return. Configuration Overview For the purposes of this lesson, the                  Inventory  feature, which provides the ability to create purchase orders that             include stock items, has been enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000)                 form. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form, the  RC  order                 type has been configured and activated. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers                 (AR303000) form, the  COFFEESHOP (FourStar Coffee & Sweets Shop)  customer                 has been configured. Additionally, the sales documents for which you will process a                 return, as well as the items included in these documents, have been configured in                 the system. Process Overview To process a return for credit with shipping, you create a return order of the                      RC  type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, and add to it the line or lines of                 the SO invoice that had been prepared for the sales order for which you need to                 process a return. Then you receive the returned items to inventory on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) form by creating a shipment with the                      Receipt  operation and confirming it. After the items have been received                 to inventory, you create an SO credit memo to decrease the customer's debt in the                 system by the amount of the returned items. After reviewing the details of the                 prepared credit memo on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form, you                 release it. System Preparation Before you begin preparing and processing the customer return, do the following: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the  U100  dataset preloaded. To                     sign in as a sales manager, use the  norman  login and the  123                      password. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to                      1/30/2020. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date                     menu button, and select  1/30/2020 from the calendar. For simplicity, in                     this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during                     this business date. Step 1: Creating a Return Order  You create a return order as follows: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, create an                     order and specify the following settings: Order Type :  RC Customer :  COFFEESHOP Date :  1/30/2020Requested On :  1/30/2020Description :  Return unconditional                                 order On the form toolbar, click  Save  to save the order. Step 2: Adding the Item to Be Returned Now you need to do the following to add to the return order the line of the SO                 invoice that had been prepared for the sales order for which you need to process a                 return: While you are still viewing the return order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, on the table toolbar of the                          Document Details  tab, click  Add                         Invoice .  In the  Add Invoice Details  dialog box, which opens,                     select  Invoice  in the  Type  box. In the                          Reference Nbr.  box, select the reference number of                     the invoice to  COFFEESHOP  dated  1/29/ 2020. The invoice lines appear in the table of the dialog box. In the table, select the unlabeled check box in the  ORANGES  line, and                     click  Add & Close , which closes the dialog box and                     adds the line to the  Document Details  tab. Review the details of the added line, and make sure that the related invoice                     reference number is specified in the  Invoice Nbr.                      column. On the form toolbar, click  Save ; notice that the return                     order has the  Open  status. Step 3: Receiving the Returned Items You process the receipt of items to inventory as follows: While you are still viewing the return order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, on the form toolbar,                     click  Actions > Create Receipt  to create a receipt of the                     returned items. In the  Specify Shipment Parameters  dialog box, which                     opens, make sure that  1/30/2020 is selected as the  Shipment                         Date  and  WHOLESALE  is selected as the                          Warehouse ID . Click  OK . The system closes the dialog box and opens the                     prepared shipment with the  Receipt  operation on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) form. Click  Actions > Confirm Shipment  to confirm the shipment. Step 4: Processing a Credit Memo Now that you have processed the return of the items to inventory, you need to prepare                 a credit memo to the customer to adjust the customer's balance by doing the                 following:  While you are still viewing the shipment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) form, on the form toolbar,                     click  Actions > Prepare Invoice . The system creates a credit memo to the customer and opens it on                     the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form. In the Summary area, make sure that the  Date  is set to                              1/30/2020. On the form toolbar, click  Actions > Release  to release the credit memo, which is assigned the  Open                      status, as shown in the                      following                         screenshot .

 Acumatica ERP provides support for the most common types of return processes, which gives you the flexibility to manage various types of customer returns according to the return policies of your company. {br}

Returns for replacement are one type of returns. These returns are processed in the system as return orders of the ''RR'' order type. With this type, a customer returns an item and requests that the item be replaced with the same or another item at exactly the same price, so that you don&rsquo;t need to process an invoice or a credit memo. (Return orders of the ''RR'' type may involve the exact replacement of a single item or multiple items.){br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Create a return order that is linked to the sales order that was used to record the purchase of the returned item or items
*Create an incoming shipment (receipt) of the returned item or items, and confirm the shipment
*Create a shipment of the replacement item or items to the customer
*Update inventory forms to reflect the replacement of the returned item or items

==Applicable Scenario==
You create a return for replacement (that is, an order with the ''RR'' predefined order type) to perform a customer return in which the customer receives an exact replacement of a particular item or specific items (that is, the replacement of the same items at the same price). The customer returns the rejected goods, the goods are returned to inventory, and the customer receives a replacement for the rejected goods. Since the items are replaced at exactly the same price, no AR documents need to be processed.
==Processing of Returned Items for Replacement ==
The standard process of return for replacement typically includes the entry of a return order, the addition of the items to be returned and the items to be shipped for replacement, the processing of the receipt of the returned items to inventory, the processing of a shipment of replacement items to the customer, and the updating of the inventory. {br}

In general, the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) is the starting point for the creation of a customer return. You create a new return order and add the item or items being returned by the customer. You can add an item to be returned without linking it to a sales document, or add a line with a reference to the original SO invoice for which the return is performed. To add the item to be returned with a link to the original SO invoice, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form, you click '''Add Invoice''' on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab and select the line of the needed invoice in the '''Add Invoice Details''' dialog box (which opens). {br}

A line corresponding to an item being returned (whether or not it is linked to an SO invoice) should have the ''Receipt'' operation specified in the '''Operation''' column. Because this is an order of the ''RR'' type, each return line should have a corresponding replacement line: a line with the ''Issue'' operation type for a replacement item. If the item in a line with the ''Receipt'' operation is not tracked by serial or lot numbers, you can select the '''Auto-Create Issue''' check box for the line so that the system will automatically add the corresponding replacement line when you confirm the receipt of the returned items to inventory. {br}

If an item to be returned has a specific lot or serial number, you should select this particular item (with its lot or serial number) from the list of invoice lines. For the items to be returned that are lot- or serial- tracked, you must clear the '''Auto-Create Issue''' check box for the return line. Instead, you add the replacement line manually.{br}

After you have specified the details in the return order, you need to create and confirm two documents: a receipt of returned items (also referred to as an ''incoming shipment'') and a shipment of replacement items to customer. To create a receipt, on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form, you click '''Actions''' > '''Create Receipt'''. To create a shipment, on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form, you click '''Actions''' > '''Create Shipment'''. The incoming and outgoing shipments can be reviewed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form. After you review each of the shipments, you have to confirm it by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Confirm Shipment''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] form.{br}

You can update the inventory for each shipment separately by opening the shipment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] form and clicking '''Actions''' > '''Update IN''' on the form toolbar; this causes the system to generate the appropriate inventory transaction and to update the item availability data. On release of the inventory documents, batches of GL transactions are generated. {br}

SO invoices and AR invoices are not generated for an ''RR'' order because the returned item is replaced with another item at the same price.
==Workflow of a Return for Replacement==
The processing of a return order for replacement involves the actions and generated documents shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#_e16a8fa5-9988-4476-9d74-b81e91c36a16][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_Return_for_Exact_Replacement.png|popup|450px]]]></column>

To add the item to be returned with a link to the original SO invoice, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders form, you click  Add Invoice  on the table     toolbar of the  Document Details  tab and select the line of the needed     invoice in the  Add Invoice Details  dialog box (which opens).  A line corresponding to an item being returned (whether or not it is linked to an SO invoice)     should have the  Receipt  operation specified in the  Operation      column. Because this is an order of the  RR  type, each return line should have a     corresponding replacement line: a line with the  Issue  operation type for a replacement     item. If the item in a line with the  Receipt  operation is not tracked by serial or lot     numbers, you can select the  Auto-Create Issue  check box for the line so     that the system will automatically add the corresponding replacement line when you confirm the     receipt of the returned items to inventory.  If an item to be returned has a specific lot or serial number, you should select this     particular item (with its lot or serial number) from the list of invoice lines. For the items to     be returned that are lot- or serial- tracked, you must clear the  Auto-Create      Issue  check box for the return line. Instead, you add the replacement line     manually. After you have specified the details in the return order, you need to create and confirm two     documents: a receipt of returned items (also referred to as an  incoming shipment )     and a shipment of replacement items to customer. To create a receipt, on the form toolbar of the        ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders form, you click  Actions Create Receipt . To create a shipment, on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders     form, you click  Actions Create Shipment . The incoming and outgoing shipments can be reviewed on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) form. After you review each of the shipments, you have to     confirm it by clicking  Actions Confirm Shipment  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments form. You can update the inventory for each shipment separately by opening the shipment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments form and clicking  Actions Update IN  on the form toolbar; this causes the system to generate the appropriate inventory     transaction and to update the item availability data. On release of the inventory documents,     batches of GL transactions are generated.  SO invoices and AR invoices are not generated for an  RR  order because the returned item     is replaced with another item at the same price. Workflow of a Return for Replacement The processing of a return order for replacement involves the actions and generated documents     shown in the following diagram. ]]></column>

))){br}{TOC}
==Story==
Suppose that on January 30, 2020, the GoodFood One Restaurant customer asks for the replacement of five small jars of orange jam (ordered on January 25, 2020) with the same number of the same jam jars because the lids appeared to be dented. The returned jars must be temporarily placed to inventory so that the quality assurance would assess them to track the source of the damage. The sales manager of the SweetLife company authorizes the return. Acting as this sales manager, you need to process the return of items to inventory with shipping the exact replacement of the returned items to customer. 
==Configuration Overview==For the purposes of this lesson, the ''Inventory'' feature, which provides the ability to create purchase orders that include stock items, has been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form, the ''RR'' order type has been configured and activated.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form, the ''GOODFOOD (GoodFood One Restaurant)'' customer has been configured. Additionally, the sales documents for which you will process a return, as well as the items included in these documents, have been configured in the system.
==Process Overview==
To process a customer return with an exact replacement, you create a return order of the ''RR'' type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, and add to it the line or lines of the SO invoice that had been prepared for the sales order for which you need to process a return. You receive the returned items to inventory by creating a shipment with the ''Receipt'' operation. Then you process another shipment to record the delivery of the replacement items to the customer. Because the returned and replacement items have the same price, you do not need to process any accounts receivable documents. {br}

Finally, you update the inventory by using the '''Update IN''' action on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form; this action generates inventory documents that record the receiving and issuing of the items in this return order.
==System Preparation==
Before you begin preparing and processing the customer return, do the following:[anchor|#_f811a610-8f11-49fe-9fd6-edb04d0e9b26]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as a sales manager by using the ''norman'' login and the ''123'' password.
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to''1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select ''1/30/2020'' from the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.

==Step 1: Creating a Return Order==
You create a return order as follows:[anchor|#_588f6f42-dabc-4c1e-9be2-dbd794d75edf]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, create a return order, and specify the following settings:
#*'''Order Type''': ''RR''
#* '''Customer''': ''GOODFOOD''
#* '''Date''': ''1/30/2020''
#* '''Requested On''': ''1/30/2020''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Authorized replacement</tt>
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

==Step 2: Adding the Items to Be Returned==
Now you will add to the return order the line of the SO invoice that had been prepared for the sales order for which you need to process a return. Perform the following instructions:[anchor|#_300cd7e8-2e64-4ffd-a502-45917f972f17]
#While you are still viewing the return order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, on the table toolbar, click '''Add Invoice'''. 
#In the '''Add Invoice Details''' dialog box, which opens, select ''Invoice'' in the '''Type''' box. In the '''Reference Nbr.''' box, select the reference number of the invoice to ''GOODFOOD'' in the amount of ''201.74'' dated ''1/25/2020''. The invoice lines appear in the table of the dialog box.
#In the table, select the unlabeled check box in the ''ORJAM08'' line, and click '''Add & Close''', which closes the dialog box and adds the line to the '''Document Details''' tab.
#Review the details of the added line, and make sure that the related invoice reference number is specified in the '''Invoice Nbr.''' column.
#In the line, change '''Quantity''' to <tt>5</tt>, which is the number of jars to be replaced.
#Also, in the line, make sure that the '''Auto Create Issue''' check box is selected. With this check box selected, the line with the item for replacement will be created and added automatically to the return order on receipt confirmation.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''; notice that the return order has the ''Open'' status.

==Step 3: Receiving the Returned Items==
You process the receipt of items to inventory as follows:[anchor|#_6b164728-1351-4079-a71d-0520e29bef87]
#While you are still viewing the return order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, on the form toolbar, click '''Actions &gt; Create Receipt''' to create a receipt of returned items.
#In the '''Specify Shipment Parameters''' dialog box, which opens, specify ''1/30/2020'' as the '''Shipment Date''', and make sure that ''WHOLESALE'' is specified in the '''Warehouse ID''' box.
#Click '''OK'''. The system closes the dialog box and opens the prepared shipment with the ''Receipt'' operation on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions &gt; Confirm Shipment''' to confirm the receipt of the returned items.

==Step 4: Shipping the Replacement Items==
Now that the items have been received to inventory, you need to process the shipping of the replacement items to the customer. Proceed as follows:[anchor|#_af41ea6e-9b77-4b18-b401-3fd1243610f6]
#Open the ''RR'' order that you have prepared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form and review it. On the '''Document Details''' tab, notice that the line with the replacement item (with the same inventory item, quantity, and unit price as the item that had been returned) has been added automatically when you confirmed the receipt of the returned items. The line has the ''Issue'' operation.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions &gt; Create Shipment''' to create a shipment of the replacement item to the customer.
#In the '''Specify Shipment Parameters''' dialog box, which opens, make sure that ''1/30/2020'' is selected in the '''Shipment Date''' box and ''WHOLESALE'' is specified in the '''Warehouse ID''' box.
#Click '''OK'''. The system opens the prepared shipment with the ''Issue'' operation on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form.
#Click '''Actions &gt; Confirm Shipment''' to confirm the shipment.

The replacement item has the same price and quantity, so no invoice to the customer is required. To record the movement of items and complete the process, you need to update the inventory. 
==Step 5: Updating Inventory==
To update the inventory, do the following:[anchor|#_a46d397a-e053-4aa8-927b-99b31be49328]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_30_00|Process Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO503000|SO503000]) form, in the '''Action''' box, select ''Update IN - Confirmed Not Billable'', and in the '''End Date''' box, specify ''1/30/2020''.
#In the table, select the unlabeled check boxes next to the lines with two confirmed shipments to ''GOODFOOD'' customer that you have prepared earlier in this activity.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Process'''. For the selected shipment lines, the system generates two inventory issues: an issue with the ''Return'' operation for the receipt, and an issue with the ''Issue'' operation for the shipment of the replacement item.
#Open the ''RR'' order that you have prepared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form and review the order. The order now has the ''Completed'' status, as you can see in the following screenshot. On the '''Shipments''' tab, make sure that the reference numbers of both the receipt and the shipment are shown in the '''Inventory Ref. Nbr.''' column (also shown in the following screenshot), which indicates that the corresponding inventory documents have been generated.[anchor|#_809086f7-c78e-4b7d-b425-9d384f7e868a][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_OrderMgmt_Return_for_Replacement.png|popup|Return order processed to completion|450px]
#Click the link in the '''Inventory Ref Nbr.''' column in the first line. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form, which is opened for the line, make sure the issue has the ''Released'' status. Repeat this instruction for the link in the second line.

The customer return with replacement is now complete.]]></column>

The following activity is             based on the  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system             settings have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the             activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100              dataset to its initial state. Story Suppose that on January 30,  2020, the GoodFood One Restaurant customer asks for the                 replacement of five small jars of orange jam (ordered on January 25,  2020) with the                 same number of the same jam jars because the lids appeared to be                 dented.

Configuration Overview For the purposes of this lesson, the                  Inventory  feature, which provides the ability to create purchase orders that             include stock items, has been enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000)                 form. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form, the  RR  order                 type has been configured and activated. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers                 (AR303000) form, the  GOODFOOD (GoodFood One Restaurant)  customer has been                 configured. Additionally, the sales documents for which you will process a return,                 as well as the items included in these documents, have been configured in the                 system. Process Overview To process a customer return with an exact replacement, you create a return order of                 the  RR  type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000)                 form, and add to it the line or lines of the SO invoice that had been prepared for                 the sales order for which you need to process a return. You receive the returned                 items to inventory by creating a shipment with the  Receipt  operation. Then                 you process another shipment to record the delivery of the replacement items to the                 customer. Because the returned and replacement items have the same price, you do not                 need to process any accounts receivable documents.  Finally, you update the inventory by using the  Update IN                  action on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) form; this                 action generates inventory documents that record the receiving and issuing of the                 items in this return order. System Preparation Before you begin preparing and processing the customer return, do the following: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as a sales manager by using the  norman  login and                     the  123  password. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to 1/30/2020. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date                     menu button, and select  1/30/2020 from the calendar. For simplicity, in                     this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during                     this business date. Step 1: Creating a Return Order You create a return order as follows: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, create a                     return order, and specify the following settings: Order Type :  RR Customer :  GOODFOOD Date :  1/30/2020Requested On :  1/30/2020Description :  Authorized                                 replacement On the form toolbar, click  Save . Step 2: Adding the Items to Be Returned Now you will add to the return order the line of the SO invoice that had been                 prepared for the sales order for which you need to process a return. Perform the                 following instructions: While you are still viewing the return order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, on the table toolbar, click                          Add Invoice .  In the  Add Invoice Details  dialog box, which opens,                     select  Invoice  in the  Type  box. In the                          Reference Nbr.  box, select the reference number of                     the invoice to  GOODFOOD  in the amount of  201.74  dated  1/25/ 2020. The invoice lines appear in the table of the dialog box. In the table, select the unlabeled check box in the  ORJAM08  line, and                     click  Add & Close , which closes the dialog box and                     adds the line to the  Document Details  tab. Review the details of the added line, and make sure that the related invoice                     reference number is specified in the  Invoice Nbr.                      column. In the line, change  Quantity  to  5 ,                     which is the number of jars to be replaced. Also, in the line, make sure that the  Auto Create Issue                      check box is selected. With this check box selected, the line with the item for                     replacement will be created and added automatically to the return                     order  on                     receipt confirmation . On the form toolbar, click  Save ; notice that the return                     order has the  Open  status. Step 3: Receiving the Returned Items You process the receipt of items to inventory as follows: While you are still viewing the return order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, on the form toolbar,                     click  Actions > Create Receipt  to create a receipt of                     returned items. In the  Specify Shipment Parameters  dialog box, which                     opens, specify  1/30/2020 as the  Shipment Date , and                     make sure that  WHOLESALE  is specified in the  Warehouse                         ID  box. Click  OK . The system closes the dialog box and opens the                     prepared shipment with the  Receipt  operation on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) form. On the form toolbar, click  Actions > Confirm Shipment  to confirm the receipt of the returned items. Step 4: Shipping the Replacement Items Now that the items have been received to inventory, you need to process the shipping                 of the replacement items to the customer. Proceed as follows: Open the  RR  order that you have prepared on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form and review it. On the                          Document Details  tab, notice that the line with the                     replacement item (with the same inventory item, quantity, and unit price as the                     item that had been returned) has been added automatically when you confirmed the                     receipt of the returned items. The line has the  Issue  operation. On the form toolbar, click  Actions > Create Shipment  to create a shipment of the replacement item to the                     customer. In the  Specify Shipment Parameters  dialog box, which                     opens, make sure that  1/30/2020 is selected in the  Shipment                         Date  box and  WHOLESALE  is specified in the                          Warehouse ID  box. Click  OK . The system opens the prepared shipment with the                          Issue  operation on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments                     (SO302000) form. Click  Actions > Confirm Shipment  to confirm the shipment. The replacement item has the same price and quantity, so no invoice to the customer                 is required. To record the movement of items and complete the process, you need to                 update the inventory.  Step 5: Updating Inventory To update the inventory, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO503000|SO503000]) Process Shipments (SO503000) form, in the                          Action  box, select  Update IN - Confirmed Not                         Billable , and in the  End Date  box, specify                      1/30/2020. In the table, select the unlabeled check boxes next to the lines with                      two                      confirmed shipments to  GOODFOOD                      customer  that                     you have prepared earlier in this activity . On the form toolbar, click  Process . For the selected                     shipment lines, the system generates two inventory issues: an issue with the                          Return  operation for the receipt, and an issue with the  Issue                      operation for the shipment of the replacement item. Open the  RR  order that you have prepared on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form and review the order. The order                     now has the  Completed  status, as you can see in the following screenshot.                     On the  Shipments  tab, make sure that the reference                     numbers of both the receipt and the shipment are shown in the                          Inventory Ref. Nbr.  column (also shown in the                     following screenshot), which indicates that the corresponding inventory                     documents have been                         generated. Return order processed to completion Click the link in the  Inventory Ref Nbr.  column in the                     first line. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) Issues (IN302000) form,                     which is opened for the line, make sure the issue has the  Released                      status. Repeat this instruction for the link in the second line. The customer return with replacement is now complete. ]]></column>

 Acumatica ERP gives you the flexibility to manage various types of customer returns. Depending on your company&rsquo;s return policies, you may need to perform a return for credit when shipping of returned items to inventory is not needed. This topic describes the processing steps you need to perform, and the transactions generated during these steps.{br}

To process an unauthorized return without receipt and shipment, you can use a credit memo order (''CM''). The processing of a return for credit involves the actions and generated documents shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#fig_xqs_s4n_jdb][anchor|#image_sqs_xrk_3db][image:UserGuide/Images/Return_for_Credit_Without_Receipt.png|popup|400px]
The following sections describe in detail the processing steps shown in the diagram.{br}{TOC}
==1. Enter the Credit Memo Order==
You create a new credit memo order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. A reference number for the new return order is generated according to the numbering sequence assigned to this order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. If the order is created with the ''On Hold'' status, you should click '''Release from Hold''' on the form toolbar to process the order further.
==2. Link the Original Invoice Line to the Order==
Each line in the order of the ''CM'' order type can include a reference to the original invoice for which the return is performed. To add an item to be returned and include a link to original invoice, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, you can click '''Add Invoice''' on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab and select the line of the needed invoice in the '''Add Invoice Details''' dialog box (which opens). ((({S:Warn}You can also add a stock item to be returned without linking it to an invoice. To do this, click '''Add Stock Item''' on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab, and select the item in the '''Inventory Lookup''' dialog box (which opens).
)))
==3. Prepare the Sales Orders Invoice==
You can prepare the Sales Orders (SO) invoice by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Prepare Invoice''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, or you can create any number of invoices by running the ''Prepare Invoice'' action for multiple selected orders on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) form. {br}

The prepared document or documents of the ''Credit Memo'' type can be reviewed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form. You can print an SO invoice by clicking '''Reports &gt; Print Invoice''' on the form toolbar of this form. 
==4. Release the Sales Orders Invoice==
For the credit memo order, the released Sales Orders invoice acts as a shipment does: On release of the invoice, the system updates the '''Qty. on Shipments''' value in the order lines based on the quantity specified in the credit memo lines, and inserts the reference number of the Sales Orders credit memo on the '''Shipments''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form.{br}

When the SO invoice is released, a batch of General Ledger transactions is generated, and the system automatically generates an inventory issue with the ''Credit Memo'' transaction type that adds the returned item to inventory. Also, a corresponding Accounts Receivable credit memo is generated and becomes available for review on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form.
==5. Release the Inventory Issue==
The generated inventory issue is released automatically if the '''Automatically Release IN Documents''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form. If this check box is cleared, you have to release the inventory issue manually by clicking '''Release''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form. On release of the inventory issue, a batch of General Ledger Transactions is generated.((({S:Warn}To finish the return process, you need to process Accounts Receivable credit memo to completion. You can apply the credit memo to the original invoice, or process the customer refund if the original invoice was already paid. For details on credit memo application, see [HelpRoot_Financials\Finance_CorrectingARInvoices_Process_Activity|AR Invoice Correction: To Create a Credit Memo]. For details on the processing of a customer refund, see[HelpRoot_Financials\Finance_ProcessingCustomerRefunds_Activity1|Customer Refunds: To Create a Customer Refund].

This topic describes the processing steps you         need to perform, and the transactions generated during these steps. To process an unauthorized return without receipt and shipment, you can use a credit memo         order ( CM ). The processing of a return for credit involves the actions and generated         documents shown in the following diagram. The following sections describe in detail the processing steps shown in the diagram. 1. Enter the Credit Memo Order You create a new credit memo order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form.         A reference number for the new return order is generated according to the numbering sequence         assigned to this order type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form. If the         order is created with the  On Hold  status, you should          click            Release from Hold  on the form toolbar to process the order         further. 2. Link the Original Invoice Line to the Order Each line in the order of the  CM  order type can include a reference to the original         invoice for which the return is performed. To add an item to be returned and include a link         to original invoice, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, you can click            Add Invoice  on the table toolbar of the  Document           Details  tab and select the line of the needed invoice in the  Add           Invoice Details  dialog box (which opens).  You can also add a stock item to be returned without linking it to an invoice. To do         this, click  Add Stock Item  on the table toolbar of the            Document Details  tab, and select the item in the            Inventory Lookup  dialog box (which opens). 3. Prepare the Sales Orders Invoice You can prepare the Sales Orders (SO) invoice by clicking  Actions Prepare Invoice  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form,         or you can create any number of invoices by running the  Prepare Invoice  action for         multiple selected orders on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) Process Orders (SO501000) form.  The prepared document or documents of the  Credit Memo  type can be reviewed on the             ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form. You can print an SO invoice by clicking  Reports > Print Invoice  on the form toolbar of this form.  4. Release the Sales Orders Invoice For the credit memo order, the released Sales Orders invoice acts as a shipment does: On         release of the invoice, the system updates the  Qty. on Shipments          value in the order lines based on the quantity specified in the credit memo lines, and         inserts the reference number of the Sales Orders credit memo on the            Shipments  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000)         form. When the SO invoice is released, a batch of General Ledger transactions is generated, and         the system automatically generates an inventory issue with the  Credit Memo          transaction type that adds the returned item to inventory. Also, a corresponding Accounts         Receivable credit memo is generated and becomes available for review on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form. 5. Release the Inventory Issue The generated inventory issue is released automatically if the  Automatically           Release IN Documents  check box is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences (SO101000) form. If this check box is cleared, you have to         release the inventory issue manually by clicking  Release  on the form         toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) Issues (IN302000) form. On release of the inventory         issue, a batch of General Ledger Transactions is generated. To finish the return process, you need to process Accounts Receivable credit memo to         completion. You can apply the credit memo to the original invoice, or process the customer         refund if the original invoice was already paid.

 Acumatica ERP gives you the flexibility to manage various types of customer returns. Depending on your company&rsquo;s return policies, you may need to perform a return of an inventory item for cash. This topic describes the processing steps you need to perform, and the transactions generated during these steps.{br}

To process a return for cash, you can use a return order for cash (that is, an order with the ''CR'' predefined order type). The processing of a return for cash involves the actions and generated documents shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#fig_xqs_s4n_jdb][anchor|#image_sqs_xrk_3db][image:UserGuide/Images/Return_for_Cash.png|popup|400px]
The following sections describe in detail the processing steps shown in the diagram.{br}{TOC}
==1. Enter the Return Order for Cash ==
You create a new return order for cash on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. A reference number for the new return order for cash is generated according to the numbering sequence assigned to this order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. If the order is created with the ''On Hold'' status, you should click '''Release from Hold''' on the form toolbar to process the order further..
==2. Link the Original Invoice Line to the Order==
Each line in the order of the ''CR'' order type can include a reference to the original invoice for which the return is performed. To add an item to be returned with a link to the original invoice, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, you can click '''Add Invoice''' on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab and select the line of the needed invoice in the '''Add Invoice Details''' dialog box (which opens). If an item to be returned has a specific lot or serial number, you should select this particular item from the list of invoice lines.((({S:Warn}You can also add a stock item to be returned without linking it to an invoice. To do this, click '''Add Stock Item''' on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab, and select an item in the '''Inventory Lookup''' dialog box (which opens).
)))
In each line added on the '''Document Details''' tab for an order of the ''CR'' type, you must specify a reason code. Also, the payment information on the '''Payment Settings''' tab is required for the cash return.
==3. Prepare the Sales Orders Invoice==
You can prepare the Sales Orders (SO) invoice by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Prepare Invoice''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, or you can create multiple invoices by running the ''Prepare Invoice'' action for multiple selected orders on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) form. {br}

The prepared document or documents of the ''Cash Return'' type can be reviewed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form. You can print an SO invoice by clicking '''Reports &gt; Print Invoice''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form. 
==4. Release the Sales Orders Invoice==
When the Sales Orders invoice of the ''Cash Return'' type is released, the system automatically generates an inventory issue with the ''Credit Memo'' transaction type that adds the returned item to inventory; you can review the generated issue on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form. Also, the related Accounts Receivable cash return with the same reference number becomes available for reviewing on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_40_00|Cash Sales] ([~/?ScreenId=AR304000|AR304000]) form. The document updates the appropriate sales and cash accounts. 
==5. Release the Inventory Issue==
The generated inventory issue is released automatically if the '''Automatically Release IN Documents''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] form. If this check box is cleared, you have to release the inventory issue manually by clicking '''Release''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form. On release of the inventory issue, a batch of General Ledger Transactions is generated.]]></column>

 Acumatica ERP gives you the flexibility to manage various types of customer returns. Depending on your company&rsquo;s return policies, you may need to perform a merchandise authorization return of an inventory item for possible credit and replacement. For this purpose, you an use a merchandise authorization return order, and you can send the customer a printed or electronic copy of it along with the goods to be returned. Once the goods are received by your organization, they are returned to inventory, and the customer receives other goods instead. For this type of return order, different items than those returned may be included for replacement, freight and shipping and handling charges may be included, and the items could be returned at higher or lower prices. {br}

To process a merchandise authorization return, you can use a return order of the ''RM'' predefined order type. The processing of a ''RM'' order (further in this topic referred to as a ''return order'') involves the actions and generated documents shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#_3326672c-df88-4115-9a58-004ddcbb5bbf][anchor|#_0b20fe5c-67fd-4336-8568-a858d1353048][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_OrderMgmt_Return_at_Another_Price.png|popup|450px]
The following sections describe in detail the processing steps shown in the diagram.{br}{TOC}
==1. Enter the Merchandise Return Order==
You create a new return order of the ''RM'' order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. A reference number for the new return order is generated according to the numbering sequence assigned to this order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. If the order is created with the ''On Hold'' status, you should click '''Release from Hold''' on the form toolbar to process the order further..
==2. Link the Original Invoice Line to the Order==
Each return line in an order of the ''RM'' order type could include a reference to the original invoice for which the return is performed. To add an item to be returned and include a link to the original invoice, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, you can click '''Add Invoice''' on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab and select the line of the needed invoice in the '''Add Invoice Details''' dialog box (which opens). ((({S:Warn}You can also add a stock item to be returned without linking it to an invoice. To do this, click '''Add Stock Item''' on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab, and select the item in the '''Inventory Lookup''' dialog box (which opens). 
)))
An added return line (whether or not it is linked to an invoice) has the ''Receipt'' operation specified in the '''Operation''' column. After you have added the ''Receipt'' lines, make sure that the '''Auto-Create Issue''' check box is cleared in these lines (because you need to add replacement items and specify their details manually).
==3. Add a Line with the Item for Replacement==
Each line with the ''Receipt'' transaction type in an ''RM'' order should have a corresponding line with the ''Issue'' operation type for a replacement item. You need to add an ''Issue''-type line for the replacement lines manually. Alternatively, if the returned item is not tracked by serial or lot numbers, and the item price wasn&rsquo;t changed between the original sale and return, you can select the '''Auto-Create Issue''' check box for the line; on shipment confirmation, the system will add the corresponding ''Issue''-type lines automatically and copy the line details from the ''Receipt''-type lines. 
==4a–4b. Process the Return and the Replacement==
To complete the order, you need to process the receipt of the returned item and the shipment of the replacement item. You can process the return and replacement in any order on its own, or you can process multiple returns and replacements simultaneously on mass-processing forms. You perform the following general steps for processing: [anchor|#_228a8628-2ef3-4115-aaae-ce8fbd6b3cec]
#Prepare the receipt (for return) and the shipment (for replacement) by doing the following:
#*You prepare the receipt (that is, the incoming shipment with the ''Receipt'' operation type) by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Create Receipt''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form.
#*You prepare the outgoing shipment with the ''Issue'' operation type by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Create Shipment''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form. 
#:The prepared shipment can be reviewed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form.
#:Alternatively, you can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) form to create both incoming and outgoing shipments for one order or multiple orders. To do this, you select the ''Create Shipment'' action, select the needed orders, and click '''Process''' on the form toolbar.
#Confirm the receipt and the shipment.
#:You can confirm a particular receipt or shipment by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Confirm Shipment''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] form; to confirm multiple shipments, you can select the ''Confirm Shipment'' action, select the needed shipments, and click '''Process''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_30_00|Process Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO503000|SO503000]) form.
#Prepare the SO invoices. 
#:You prepare the Sales Orders invoice for a particular receipt or shipment by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Prepare Invoice''' on the form toolbar on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] form, or you can create invoices by processing the ''Prepare Invoice'' action for multiple selected shipments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_30_00|Process Shipments] form. 
#:The prepared document or documents can be reviewed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form. For the return, the system generates an SO invoice of the ''Credit Memo'' type; for the shipment, the system generates an SO invoice of the ''Invoice'' type. 
#:You can print an SO invoice by clicking '''Reports &gt; Print Invoice''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] form. 
#Release the SO invoices.
#:When the SO invoices are released, the system automatically generates two inventory issues: one with the ''Return'' transaction type for the return, and one with the ''Issue'' transaction type for replacement. Also, the related Accounts Receivable credit memo and invoice with the same reference numbers become available for reviewing on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form. 
#:Once you release the SO invoices, the original ''RM'' order is assigned the ''Completed'' status. 
#Release the generated inventory issues.
#:The generated inventory issues are released automatically if the '''Automatically Release IN Documents''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form. If this check box is cleared, you have to release each inventory issue manually by clicking '''Release''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form. On release of each inventory issue, a batch of the General Ledger transactions is generated.

Link the Original Invoice Line to the Order Each return line in an order of the  RM  order type could include a reference to the         original invoice for which the return is performed. To add an item to be returned and         include a link to the original invoice, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000)         form, you can click  Add Invoice  on the table toolbar of the            Document Details  tab and select the line of the needed invoice in         the  Add Invoice Details  dialog box (which opens).

You need to         add an  Issue -type line for the replacement lines manually. Alternatively, if the         returned item is not tracked by serial or lot numbers, and the item price wasn't changed         between the original sale and return, you can select the  Auto-Create           Issue  check box for the line; on shipment confirmation, the system will add         the corresponding  Issue -type lines automatically and copy the line details from the            Receipt -type lines.  4a–4b.

You prepare the outgoing shipment with the  Issue  operation type by clicking  Actions Create Shipment  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders form.  The prepared shipment can be reviewed on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments             (SO302000) form. Alternatively, you can use the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) Process Orders             (SO501000) form to create both incoming and outgoing shipments for one order or multiple             orders. To do this, you select the  Create Shipment  action, select the needed             orders, and click  Process  on the form toolbar. Confirm the receipt and the shipment. You can confirm a particular receipt or shipment             by clicking  Actions Confirm Shipment  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments form; to             confirm multiple shipments, you can select the  Confirm Shipment  action, select             the needed shipments, and click  Process  on the form toolbar of             the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO503000|SO503000]) Process Shipments (SO503000) form. Prepare the SO invoices.  You prepare the Sales Orders invoice for a particular             receipt or shipment by clicking  Actions Prepare Invoice  on the form toolbar on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments form, or you             can create invoices by processing the  Prepare Invoice  action for multiple             selected shipments on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO503000|SO503000]) Process Shipments form.  The prepared             document or documents can be reviewed on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000)             form. For the return, the system generates an SO invoice of the  Credit Memo  type;             for the shipment, the system generates an SO invoice of the  Invoice  type.              You can print an SO invoice by clicking  Reports > Print Invoice  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices form.            Release the SO invoices. When the SO invoices are released, the system automatically             generates two inventory issues: one with the  Return  transaction type for the             return, and one with the  Issue  transaction type for replacement. Also, the             related Accounts Receivable credit memo and invoice with the same reference numbers             become available for reviewing on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form.

Non-stock items in Acumatica ERP, which are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form during implementation, are used to represent products that cannot be stocked in warehouses (such as services or charges) or physical entities whose quantities you do not need to track.The following sections describe the sales process of non-stock items that are shipped to the customer.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Prepare a sales order for a sale of non-stock items with shipping
*Prepare the shipment for the sales order
*Prepare the invoice that corresponds to the sales order

==Applicable Scenarios==
You process a sales order with non-stock lines, and then create a shipment if a customer buys some goods that are defined as non-stock items in the system, and the goods must be delivered to the customer&rsquo;s place.
==Sales of Non-Stock Items with Shipping==
The standard sales process with order management software typically includes entering a sales order, processing a shipment of the items, and preparing the related sales invoice for the customer. In Acumatica ERP, to begin processing a sale that requires the items to be shipped before billing occurs, you enter a sales order of the ''SO'' type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form and add to the order the non-stock items the customer has requested.{br}

Then you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form to prepare and confirm the shipment or shipments related to the sales order. When the shipment is confirmed, you need to bill the customer for the shipped items by preparing an SO invoice, which is a financial document in the system that contains links to the applicable shipments and sales orders. You can review the prepared SO invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form; then you can release it. When the SO invoice is released, the system releases a corresponding AR invoice, which you can view on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form.{br}

An AR invoice is a financial document that is similar to the SO invoice but does not contain the links to the applicable shipments and sales orders. The system assigns the same reference number to the SO invoice and the related AR invoice. Both of these documents contain the link to the batch of the general ledger transactions, which was generated when the AR invoice was released. For more information on processing accounts receivable invoices, see [HelpRoot_Financials\Finance_ARInvoices_Mapref|Processing AR Invoices].
==Workflow of Sales of Non-Stock Items with Shipping==
If a sales order includes only non-stock items with shipment, the processing of the sales order involves the steps and generated documents shown in the following diagram.{br}

)))
==Story==
Suppose that the GoodFood One Restaurant customer has asked SweetLife to conduct a two-day training course on home canning for the café&rsquo;s employees.{br}

The materials to be used for the upcoming training on home canning (which are included in the price of the training) need to be delivered to the customer&rsquo;s location before the course is conducted. You, as a sales manager, need to reflect these details in the system by entering and processing the appropriate documents.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, the following prerequisites actions have been performed in the system:[anchor|#_f9fd0602-d3ab-4e9a-8b9d-7a35031a6e17]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Inventory'' feature has been enabled.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form, the ''SO'' order type has been configured and activated.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form, the ''GOODFOOD (GoodFood One Restaurant)'' customer has been configured.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, the ''OFLCOURSE (Home canning courses at customer&rsquo;s place)'' non-stock item has been configured, and the '''Require Shipment''' check box has been selected for this item on the '''General Settings''' tab.

==Process Overview==
In this activity, you will create a sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, and then add a non-stock item to it. After that, you will create a related shipment document on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form. On this form, you will check the settings that the system has specified automatically, and then confirm the shipment. After shipment confirmation, you will use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form to prepare an SO invoice to the customer and release it. 
==System Preparation==
Do the following:[anchor|#_f811a610-8f11-49fe-9fd6-edb04d0e9b26]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the U100 dataset preloaded. To sign in as a sales and purchasing manager, use the ''norman'' login and the ''123'' password.[anchor|#_9c88480f-18b6-44b7-86a1-e46987630c99]
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to today&rsquo;s date. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.

==Step 1: Entering a Sales Order==
To create a sales order, do the following:[anchor|#_1eb03beb-2a5e-4ce9-be0e-72fcaf2e8f78]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, click '''Add New Record''' on the form toolbar, and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Order Type''': ''SO''
#* '''Customer''': ''GOODFOOD''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Home canning training</tt>
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the row:
#*'''Inventory ID''': ''OFLCOURSE''
#* '''Warehouse''': ''WHOLESALE''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>2</tt>
#*'''Unit Price''': <tt>45</tt>
#Save the order, and notice that it is assigned the ''Open'' status.

Now you need to create a shipment for the materials that need to be shipped in advance of the training.
==Step 2: Creating a Shipment=={br}

To create the shipment related to the sales order, do the following: [anchor|#_c13c0201-052e-41d4-91c1-d3fabf10b020]
#While you are still viewing the sales order you have created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, on the form toolbar, click '''Actions &gt; Create Shipment'''.
#In the '''Specify Shipment Parameters''' dialog box, which is opened, make sure that the today&rsquo;s business date and the WHOLESALE warehouse are selected, and click '''OK'''.

The system creates closes the dialog box, creates a shipment and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form.
==Step 3: Confirming the Shipment==
To confirm the shipment, do the following:[anchor|#_8617e284-ae55-4d34-86b0-f192b3eceb6c]
#While you are still viewing the shipment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form, review the lines on the '''Document Details''' tab, and make sure that the order line with the non-stock item has been included in the shipment.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions &gt; Confirm Shipment'''.

Notice that the shipment is assigned the ''Confirmed'' status. Now you can prepare the invoice to bill the customer and increase the customer&rsquo;s debt in the system.
==Step 4: Processing the Invoice==
To prepare and release an SO invoice related to the sales order (and shipment), do the following:[anchor|#_d4312437-0d7a-4d10-bceb-54b7620c7700]
#While you are still viewing the shipment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form, on the form toolbar, click '''Actions &gt; Prepare Invoice'''. The system prepares the invoice and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form.
#On this form, review the details of the prepared invoice. The invoice has one line on the '''Document Details''' tab, as the initial sales order does. In the '''Shipment Nbr.''' and '''Order Nbr.''' columns of this tab, the system has inserted the reference numbers of the related shipment and sales order (which you created in Steps 1 and 2 of this activity); these numbers are also links that you can click to view the shipment and sales order on the appropriate forms.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions &gt; Release''' to release the SO invoice. The invoice is assigned the Open status.
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, in the only row, click the link in the '''Order Nbr.''' column to view the associated sales order.
#On the form, which opens, review the details of the sales order, as shown in the following screenshot. Notice that the sales order has the ''Completed'' status, which the system assigned on release of the SO invoice and which means that the processing of the sale is completed.

==Finding Shipments Related to a Sales Order==
If you need to find a shipment that is linked to a particular sales order and review it, you can do this by opening the sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form and reviewing the '''Shipments''' tab, which lists all the shipments that have been prepared for the order. To review the details of a listed shipment, you click its reference number in the '''Document Nbr.''' column; the system opens the shipment for review on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form.
==Tracking the Status of Order Fulfillment==
To track how a sales order is being fulfilled, you can check its status in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form. On the '''Totals''' tab of this form, you can also check the quantities and amounts that are not yet shipped and not yet billed, and the amount that is not yet paid. 
==Printing Pick Lists==
To prepare a printable pick list for a shipment document that is being processed, you use the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\SO_64_40_00|Pick List] ([~/?ScreenId=SO644000|SO644000]) report. While you are viewing a shipment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form, you can navigate to this report for the selected shipment by clicking '''Actions &gt; Print Pick List''' on the form toolbar. The system opens the printable pick list on the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\SO_64_40_00|Pick List] report; then you can review the pick list and print it by clicking '''Print''' on the report toolbar. 
==Printing Invoices==
To prepare a printable form of the SO invoice that is being processed, you use the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\SO_64_30_00|Invoice / Memo] ([~/?ScreenId=SO643000|SO643000]) report. While you are viewing an SO invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form, you can navigate to this report by clicking '''Reports &gt; Print Invoice''' on the form toolbar.

Non-stock items in Acumatica ERP, which are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form during implementation, are used to represent the products that cannot be stocked in warehouses (such as services or charges) or physical entities whose quantities you do not need to track.{br}

The following sections describe the sales process of non-stock items that represent services.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Create a sales order for a sale of services
*Prepare the invoice that corresponds to the sales order

==Applicable Scenarios==You process a sales order with a service line or multiple service lines if you need to track this sale (and then bill the customer for the provided services), which does not involve a shipment being processed in the system. 
==Sales of Services==
Although you could record the billing for a sale of services directly in the system by using an AR invoice, by entering sales orders for all sales, you implement a single entry point for the processing and tracking of sales, including the sales of services. For a sale of services, you start with entering a sales order of the ''SO'' or ''IN'' type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form and add to the order the non-stock item or items representing the needed services.{br}

After you have entered the sales order, you need to bill the customer for the sold services by preparing an SO invoice, which is a financial document in the system that contains links to the applicable sales orders. You can review the prepared SO invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form; then you can release it. When the SO invoice is released, the system releases the corresponding AR invoice, which you can view on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form.{br}

An AR invoice is a financial document that is similar to the SO invoice but does not contain the links to the other applicable documents. The system assigns the same reference number to the SO invoice and the related AR invoice. Both of these documents contain the link to the batch of the general ledger transactions, which was generated when the AR invoice was released. For more information on processing accounts receivable invoices, see [HelpRoot_Financials\Finance_ARInvoices_Mapref|Processing AR Invoices].
==Workflow of Sales of Services==
If a sales order includes only services that do not involve shipping, the typical processing of the sales order involves the steps and generated documents shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#fig_rdm_bwr_gdb][anchor|#image_sdm_bwr_gdb][image:UserGuide/Images/Sale_of_Services.png|popup|450px]]]></column>

==Story==
Suppose that the GoodFood One Restaurant manager has ordered a three-day training course on home canning for the restaurant&rsquo;s employees. The course is conducted online and no shipping needs to occur. You, as a sales manager, need to reflect these details in the system by entering and processing the appropriate documents.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, the following prerequisites actions have been performed in the system:[anchor|#_4f4d3fb4-f8b5-45c1-a039-6828f9487961]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form, the ''SO'' order type have been configured and activated.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form, the ''GOODFOOD (GoodFood One Restaurant)'' customer has been configured.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, the ''ONLCOURSE (Home canning courses online (website session)'' non-stock item has been configured.

==Process Overview==
In this activity, you will create a sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, and then add a service line to it. After that, you will use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form to prepare a related invoice to the customer and release it. 
==System Preparation==
Do the following:[anchor|#_f811a610-8f11-49fe-9fd6-edb04d0e9b26]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the U100 dataset preloaded. To sign in as a sales and purchasing manager, use the ''norman'' login and the ''123'' password.[anchor|#_d3b4e196-ad80-4c03-adf4-c96a7766e998]
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to today&rsquo;s date. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.

==Step 1: Entering a Sales Order==
To create a sales order, do the following:[anchor|#_1eb03beb-2a5e-4ce9-be0e-72fcaf2e8f78]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form,click '''Add New Record''' on the form toolbar, and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Order Type''': ''SO''
#* '''Customer''': ''GOODFOOD''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Home canning training</tt>
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the row:
#*'''Inventory ID''': ''ONLCOURSE''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>3</tt>
#*'''Unit Price''': <tt>14.5</tt>
#Save the order, and notice that it is assigned the ''Open'' status.

==Step 2: Processing the SO Invoice==
To prepare and release the SO invoice that is related to the sales order, do the following:[anchor|#_d4312437-0d7a-4d10-bceb-54b7620c7700]
#While you are still viewing the sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, on the form toolbar, click '''Actions &gt; Prepare Invoice'''. The system prepares the SO invoice and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form.
#On this form, review the details of the prepared invoice. The invoice has one line on the '''Document Details''' tab, as the initial sales order does. In the '''Order Nbr.''' column of this tab, the system has inserted the reference number of the related sales order; this number is also a link you can click to view the document on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form. Notice that the '''Shipment Nbr.''' column of the '''Document Details''' tab has no number.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions &gt; Release''' to release the invoice. The invoice is assigned the Open status. Also, an AR invoice with the same reference number, which you can view on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form, becomes available.
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, in the only row, click the link in the '''Order Nbr.''' column to view the associated sales order.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, which opens, review the details of the sales order, as shown in the following screenshot. Notice that the sales order has the ''Completed'' status, which the system assigned on release of the SO invoice and which means that the processing of the sale is completed.

In Acumatica ERP, you can create sales orders whose goods are intended for drop shipping. Drop shipping means that a customer orders the goods from your company, pays your company for the order, and receives the goods (which your company has ordered) directly from one of your vendors. With the ''Drop Shipments'' feature enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can mark particular goods for drop-shipping and create drop-ship orders for these goods. {br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_pqx_cyf_hy]
*Configure the processing of drop shipments in Acumatica ERP
*Mark items for drop shipment in a sales order
*Create a drop-ship purchase order for a sales order and process the drop shipment to completion
*Mass-process drop shipments
*Process the sales order and related purchase documents, inventory documents, and accounts payable documents
*Find the information about documents related to drop shipment

==Applicable Scenarios==
You use drop shipment to fulfill a sales order with items that your company does not have in stock. The standard process for fulfilling such a sales order is to create a sales order and mark the items for drop shipping, and then create a purchase order to purchase these items from the vendor, which ships the items directly to the customer. You then process a purchase receipt and an SO invoice when the customer has received the items.
==Drop-Shipment Process==
To process a sale with drop shipment, you create a sales order of the ''SO'' order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, and add the stock items ordered by the customer. You mark items for drop shipping by selecting the check box in the '''Mark for PO''' column and selecting ''Drop-Ship'' in the '''PO Source''' column, which means that the items will be ordered from the vendor and shipped directly to the customer. The system does not allocate stock items in inventory based on the quantities of goods and the document amounts on sales orders for drop shipping. {br}

When you mark items for drop shipping, the system creates purchase requests of the ''Drop-Ship'' plan type. You create drop-ship purchase orders by processing ''Drop-Ship'' purchase requests on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_50_00|Create Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) form. Each drop-ship purchase order generated from purchase requests contains links to the related sales order. The items from this purchase order are not shipped to the company's warehouse; rather, they are shipped directly to the customer. After you have received confirmation that the customer has received the goods from the vendor, you prepare and release the purchase receipt for the drop-ship purchase order. When you release the purchase receipt (which functions as a shipment document for drop-ship lines of sales orders), the status of the drop-ship purchase order is changed to ''Closed''; the sales order is assigned the ''Completed'' status, and then you prepare an SO invoice to the customer.{br}

On release of a purchase receipt prepared for drop-ship purchase order, the system does not create an inventory receipt, because the items are not received to inventory and are instead delivered directly to the customer. The quantities of stock items on completed drop-ship orders are not included in the quantities available at any warehouse of your company.
==Workflow of a Sale with Drop-Shipment==
For a sales order that includes stock items intended for drop shipping, the typical processing involves the actions and generated documents shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#fig_ygr_p4d_h5][anchor|#image_dc1_xyx_2t][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_Sale_for_Dropship.png|popup|350px]
==Known Limitations==
Return of drop-shipped stock items is supported only if these stock items have been received from a customer to the company&rsquo;s warehouse. In the purchase return document, the lines with drop-shipped stock items must be issued from the company&rsquo;s warehouse. Before you process a return, make sure that the drop-shipment processing has been completed (that is, the purchase receipt prepared for a drop-ship purchase order has been billed, and the invoice has been prepared and released for the related sales order).]]></column>

==Other Settings That Affect the Workflow==
You can affect the processing workflow by specifying additional settings:[anchor|#_b92d5786-a45e-41ba-9425-317e2ac3b37d]
*To cause sales orders of a particular order type to be created with the ''On Hold'' status (so the user can verify them before processing them further), select the '''Hold Documents on Entry''' check box for the order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] form. For more information on other order type settings affecting the workflow of sales orders, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\config_Sales_Order_Types_GeneralInfo|Sales Order Types: General Information].
*To cause the system to automatically create an accounts payable bill on release of a purchase receipt by default, select the '''Create Bill on Receipt Release''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form. In this case, when a user creates a purchase receipt on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, the system automatically selects the '''Create Bill''' check box. (The user can clear this check box for a particular bill.) For information on processing bills, see [HelpRoot_Financials\Finance_ProcessingAPBills_GeneralInfo|AP Bills: General Info].
*To cause the system to automatically post general ledger batches generated during the processing of sales and purchase documents, select the '''Automatically Post on Release''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_10_20_00|General Ledger Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=GL102000|GL102000]) form. For information on processing general ledger batches, see [HelpRoot_Financials\Finance_Processing_Batch_GeneralInfo|GL Transactions: General Information].

)))
==Story==
Suppose that the FourStar Coffee & Sweets Shop (''COFFEESHOP'') customer ordered a variety of green, black, and fruit teas at SweetLife’s retail store. Although the tea varieties are presented in SweetLife’s website catalog, the company does not keep tea in the wholesale or retail warehouse. When a customer orders tea, SweetLife drop-ships it from the Tea & Spices (''TEACOMPANY'') vendor directly to the customer who ordered the tea. To complete the customer’s request, acting as the sales manager of the SweetLife store, you need to process a drop shipment. 
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, the following features have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form: [anchor|#_cd1bdea4-c69d-457c-88c1-bc3675beccc2]
*''Inventory'', which provides the ability to create purchase orders that include stock items
*''Drop Shipments'', which provides the ability to create and process drop-shipped orders

The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in the system:[anchor|#ul_itw_4h4_blb]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form, the ''TEACOMPANY'' vendor has been configured.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, the ''GREENTEA6'', ''BLACKTEA6'', and ''FRUITTEA12'' stock items have been configured. For each of these items, the ''TEACOMPANY'' vendor has been added to the '''Vendor Details''' tab.

==Process Overview==
In this activity, to process a sale with drop-shipment, you will create a sales order of the ''SO'' order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form; on the '''Document Details''' tab, you will add the inventory items ordered by the customer. Because the items are not in stock, you will mark each of them for drop shipping by selecting the check box in the '''Mark for PO''' column and selecting ''Drop-Ship'' in the '''PO Source''' column, which means that the items will be ordered from the vendor and shipped directly to the customer. You will create drop-ship purchase orders by processing ''Drop-Ship'' purchase requests on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_50_00|Create Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) form. Each drop-ship purchase order generated from purchase requests, which can be viewed and processed further on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, contains links to the related sales order. {br}

After you have received confirmation that the customer has received the goods from the vendor, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, you will prepare and release the purchase receipt for the drop-ship purchase order. After drop shipping has completed, you will prepare an invoice for the customer by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form.
==System Preparation==
Do the following:[anchor|#_942b520d-56ae-45df-83d1-822a75e51ad6][anchor|#_f6ddb0d8-f3f3-461e-87ae-9f90ad2e421b]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded. To sign in as a sales and purchasing manager, use the ''wiley'' login and the ''123'' password.[anchor|#_4b1e522f-ea67-4bbc-aa9d-8997fe037f7a]
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to today&rsquo;s date. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.[anchor|#_83337b63-e68f-49b2-a3a8-783dc2e57b19]
#On the company and branch selection menu, on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, select the ''SweetLife Store'' branch.

==Step 1: Creating a Sales Order==
To create a sales order, do the following:[anchor|#_103ca273-754d-4fc1-a571-5852aec26584]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, create a sales order, and specify the following settings:
#*'''Order Type''': ''SO''
#* '''Customer''': ''COFFEESHOP''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Website order #00784 (tea)</tt>
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, add rows with the settings shown in the following table.
#:{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="20%" ! Branch
!width="20%" ! Inventory ID

#:Notice that the system displays warnings in the '''Quantity''' column in each line on the '''Documents Details''' tab indicating that the specified quantity is not available in the selected warehouse.
#Click '''Save''' on the form toolbar to save the sales order, which is assigned the ''Open'' status.

==Step 2: Marking the Items for Drop-Shipment==
To mark items for drop-shipment, while you are still viewing the sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, do the following:[anchor|#_533eb8c1-0c89-4e50-b9d8-0bc70973b1e4]
#For each of the lines on the '''Document Details''' tab, select the '''Mark for PO''' check box and select ''Drop-Ship'' in the '''PO Source''' column.[anchor|#_b2456486-3136-4ce5-bcdd-5185d39829c5]

==Step 3: Creating a Drop-Ship Purchase Order==
To create a drop-ship purchase order from purchase requests, do the following:[anchor|#_005b012f-b17e-489e-8434-1a9f02ef4b04]
#On the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form while you are still viewing the sales order, click '''Actions''' > '''Create Purchase Order'''.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_50_00|Create Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) form, which opens, select the unlabeled check boxes in the three lines with ''Drop Ship'' specified as the '''Plan Type''' (which are the lines that are related to the sales order that you have prepared earlier). 
#In all of the lines, specify ''TEACOMPANY'' in the '''Vendor''' column.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Process''' to process the purchase requests you have selected. 
#:The system creates a drop-ship purchase order to the ''TEACOMPANY'' vendor and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form.
#On the '''Document Details''' tab of this form, click the ''GREENTEA06'' line, and on the table toolbar, click '''View SO Demand'''. The '''Demand''' dialog box, which opens, shows the sales order to which this purchase order line is linked.

#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

==Step 4: Processing the Drop-Ship Purchase Order==
To process the drop-ship purchase order to completion, do the following:[anchor|#_6e64d418-4508-4fab-af45-6672b1801798]
#While you are still viewing the purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, click '''Actions''' > '''Enter PO Receipt''' on the form toolbar. 
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, which the system opens with the created receipt, review the details of the prepared purchase receipt, and make sure that all purchase order lines have been added with the appropriate quantities. 
#In the Summary area, select the '''Create Bill''' check box to make the system generate the bill automatically on release of the purchase receipt.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the purchase receipt.
#:The system releases the purchase receipt and assigns it the ''Released'' status.
#On the '''Billing History''' tab, review the only line in the table, which shows the generated bill, and make sure the bill has a status of ''Open''.
#On the '''Other Information''' tab, notice that '''IN Ref. Nbr.''' is empty. This is the case because the items are shipped directly from the vendor to the customer, so no inventory documents need to be generated.

==Step 5: Processing the AR Invoice for the Customer==
To complete the processing of a sale with drop shipment, you need to generate an invoice to the customer. Do the following:[anchor|#_5f17c0d1-cccc-41f1-b318-5d0bde0859cb]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, open the sales order for the ''COFFEESHOP'' customer that you have created earlier in this activity.

#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Release''' to release the invoice.
#Return to the sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form, and on the '''Shipments''' tab, review the only line, which has the shipment for the order. Notice that the purchase receipt that you have processed acts as a shipment for this sales order, and the reference number link to this purchase receipt is shown in the '''Document Nbr.''' column in the only line in the table (see the following screenshot).[anchor|#_28300c53-a8d4-4d19-9f81-ff0a5fe287a4][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_OrderMgmt_Sale_with_Drop_Shipment.png|popup|Sales order with drop shipment processed to completion|450px]

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Sales with Drop Shipment: Process Activity The following activity will walk you through the process of preparing and processing                 to completion a sales order with items marked for drop shipping. The following activity is             based on the  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system             settings have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the             activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100              dataset to its initial state. Story Suppose that the FourStar Coffee & Sweets Shop ( COFFEESHOP ) customer                 ordered a variety of green, black, and fruit teas at SweetLife’s retail store.                 Although the tea varieties are presented in SweetLife’s website catalog, the company                 does not keep tea in the wholesale or retail warehouse. When a customer orders tea,                 SweetLife drop-ships it from the Tea & Spices ( TEACOMPANY ) vendor                 directly to the customer who ordered the tea. To complete the customer’s request,                 acting as the sales manager of the SweetLife store, you need to process a drop                 shipment.  Configuration Overview For the purposes of this activity, the following features have been enabled on the                       ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS101000) form:  Inventory , which provides the ability to create purchase orders that                     include stock items Drop Shipments , which provides the ability to create and process                     drop-shipped orders The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in                 the system: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors (AP303000) form, the  TEACOMPANY                      vendor has been configured. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form, the  GREENTEA6 ,                          BLACKTEA6 , and  FRUITTEA12  stock items have been configured.                     For each of these items, the  TEACOMPANY  vendor has been added to the                          Vendor Details  tab. Process Overview In this activity, to process a sale with drop-shipment, you will create a sales order                 of the  SO  order type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form;                 on the  Document Details  tab, you will add the inventory items                 ordered by the customer. Because the items are not in stock, you will mark each of                 them for drop shipping by selecting the check box in the  Mark for                     PO  column and selecting  Drop-Ship  in the  PO                     Source  column, which means that the items will be ordered from the                 vendor and shipped directly to the customer. You will create drop-ship purchase                 orders by processing  Drop-Ship  purchase requests on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) Create Purchase Orders (PO505000) form. Each drop-ship purchase order                 generated from purchase requests, which can be viewed and processed further on the                       ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form, contains links to the related                 sales order.  After you have received confirmation that the customer has received the goods from                 the vendor, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form, you will prepare                 and release the purchase receipt for the drop-ship purchase order. After drop                 shipping has completed, you will prepare an invoice for the customer by using the                       ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form. System Preparation Do the following: Launch the  Acumatica ERP             website, and sign in to a company with the  U100  dataset preloaded. To sign in as             a sales and purchasing manager, use the  wiley  login and the  123              password. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to today's date. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date. On the company and branch selection menu, on the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP screen, select the  SweetLife Store  branch. Step 1: Creating a Sales Order To create a sales order, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, create a sales order,                     and specify the following settings: Order Type :  SO Customer :  COFFEESHOP Description :  Website order #00784                                 (tea) On the  Document Details  tab, add rows with the settings                     shown in the following table. Branch Inventory ID Warehouse Quantity Unit Price RETAIL GREENTEA06 RETAIL 2 22.99 RETAIL BLACKTEA06 RETAIL 1 23.99 RETAIL FRUITTEA12 RETAIL 2 32.99 Notice that the system displays warnings in the                              Quantity  column in each line on the                              Documents Details  tab indicating that the                         specified quantity is not available in the selected warehouse. Click  Save  on the form toolbar to save the sales order,                     which is assigned the  Open  status. Step 2: Marking the Items for Drop-Shipment To mark items for drop-shipment, while you are still viewing the sales order on the                       ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, do the                 following: For each of the lines on the  Document Details  tab, select                     the  Mark for PO  check box and select  Drop-Ship  in                     the  PO Source  column. On the form toolbar, click  Save . Step 3: Creating a Drop-Ship Purchase Order To create a drop-ship purchase order from purchase requests, do the following: On the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form while                     you are still viewing the sales order, click  Actions Create Purchase Order . On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) Create Purchase Orders (PO505000) form, which opens, select the                     unlabeled check boxes in the three lines with  Drop Ship  specified as the                          Plan Type  (which are the lines that are related to                     the sales order that you have prepared earlier).  In all of the lines, specify  TEACOMPANY  in the                          Vendor  column. On the form toolbar, click  Process  to process the                     purchase requests you have selected.  The system creates a drop-ship purchase                         order to the  TEACOMPANY  vendor and opens it on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form. On the  Document Details  tab of this form, click the                          GREENTEA06  line, and on the table toolbar, click  View SO                         Demand . The  Demand  dialog box, which                     opens, shows the sales order to which this purchase order line is linked. Click  Close  to close the dialog box. In the  Description  box in the Summary area, type                          Purchase for website order #00784 . On the                     form toolbar, click  Release from Hold .                      . On the form toolbar, click  Save . Step 4: Processing the Drop-Ship Purchase Order To process the drop-ship purchase order to completion, do the following: While you are still viewing the purchase order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form, click  Actions Enter PO Receipt  on the form toolbar.  On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form, which the system opens                     with the created receipt, review the details of the prepared purchase receipt,                     and make sure that all purchase order lines have been added with the appropriate                     quantities.  In the Summary area, select the  Create Bill  check box to                     make the system generate the bill automatically on release of the purchase                     receipt. On the form toolbar, click  Release  to release the                     purchase receipt. The system releases the purchase receipt and assigns it the                              Released  status. On the  Billing History  tab, review the only line in the                     table, which shows the generated bill, and make sure the bill has a status of                          Open . On the  Other Information  tab, notice that  IN                         Ref. Nbr.  is empty. This is the case because the items are                     shipped directly from the vendor to the customer, so no inventory documents need                     to be generated. Step 5: Processing the AR Invoice for the Customer To complete the processing of a sale with drop shipment, you need to generate an                 invoice to the customer. Do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, open the                     sales order for the  COFFEESHOP  customer that you have created earlier in                     this activity. On the form toolbar, click  Actions Prepare Invoice . On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form, which                     opens, review the details of the invoice to make sure that all items have been                     included in the invoice. On the form toolbar, click  Actions Release  to release the invoice. Return to the sales order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders form, and on                     the  Shipments  tab, review the only line, which has the                     shipment for the order. Notice that the purchase receipt that you have processed                     acts as a shipment for this sales order, and the reference number link to this                     purchase receipt is shown in the  Document Nbr.  column in                     the only line in the table (see the following screenshot).

==Mass-Creating Drop-Ship Purchase Orders==
Drop-ship purchase orders can be mass-generated for multiple sales orders at a time. To mass-process sales orders marked for drop-shipping, you open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_50_00|Create Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) form, on which you can create drop-ship purchase orders based on the drop-ship purchase requests that have been created for this sales order. On this form, you select the unlabeled check boxes in the rows of the lines to be processed (which could include lines from the sales order you were working with or any other order) and click '''Process''' on the form toolbar to generate the purchase order or orders of the ''Drop-Ship'' type. A sales order can have two or more linked drop-ship orders, but each generated drop-ship order has only one linked sales order. The system creates a consolidated drop-ship order for each group of purchase requests for which both the sales order and the vendor are the same. 
==Mass-Creating SO Invoices==
You can create multiple invoices on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) form by selecting the ''Prepare Invoice'' action, selecting the unlabeled check box in the sales order lines to be processed (which could include lines from the sales order you were working with, or lines of any other order), and click '''Process''' on the form toolbar to generate the SO invoice or invoices.]]></column>

Contact your system administrator to obtain access to any needed reports or forms.
))){br}{TOC}
==Finding Orders Pending Drop-Shipment==
You can find purchase requests of the ''Drop Ship'' type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_50_00|Create Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) form. On the form, you can filter purchase requests by any of the following criteria: warehouse, vendor, order type, order number, inventory identifier, item class, customer, product manager, and workgroup. For the selected list of purchase requests, you can generate purchase orders of the ''Drop Ship'' type for all the lines in the list, or you can select particular lines (by selecting the unlabeled check boxes in the lines) and generate these purchase orders.
==Reviewing the Demand for Purchase Orders==
You can find the sales order that is linked to a particular line of a drop-ship purchase order by clicking the purchase order line on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, and then clicking '''View SO Demand''' on the table toolbar. The '''Demand''' dialog box, which opens, lists all the sales orders that are linked to the selected line of the purchase order.
==Reviewing the Purchase Order Linked to a Sales Order Line==
You can find the purchase order that is linked to a particular line of a sales order by clicking the sales order line on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, and then clicking '''PO Link''' on the table toolbar. The '''Purchasing Details''' dialog box, which opens, lists all the purchase orders that are linked to the selected line of the sales order.
==Reviewing Item Plans Related to Drop-Ship Orders==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_20_00|Inventory Allocation Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) form, you can select an item in the '''Inventory ID''' box, and on the '''Item Plans''' tab, review the quantity of the item that is currently listed in drop-ship orders. The ''SO to Drop-Ship'' plan type indicates that a sales order has items marked for drop-shipping. The ''Drop-Ship for SO Prepared'' plan type indicates that a purchase order was prepared for the sales-order with items marked for drop-shipment. 
==Printing Reports and Documents==
To prepare a printable form of the purchase order that is being processed, you use the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\PO_64_10_00|Purchase Order] ([~/?ScreenId=PO641000|PO641000]) report.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Sales with Drop Shipment: Related Report and Inquiry Forms In the following sections, you can find details about the reports, inquiry forms, and                 dialog boxes you may want to review to gather information about sales for                 drop-shipment that have been processed or are being processed in the system.  If you do not see a particular report or form that             is described, you may have signed in to the system with a user account that does not             have access rights to the report or form. Contact your system administrator to obtain             access to any needed reports or forms. Finding Orders Pending Drop-Shipment You can find purchase requests of the  Drop Ship  type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) Create Purchase Orders (PO505000) form. On the form, you can filter purchase                 requests by any of the following criteria: warehouse, vendor, order type, order                 number, inventory identifier, item class, customer, product manager, and workgroup.                 For the selected list of purchase requests, you can generate purchase orders of the                      Drop Ship  type for all the lines in the list, or you can select                 particular lines (by selecting the unlabeled check boxes in the lines) and generate                 these purchase orders. Reviewing the Demand for Purchase Orders You can find the sales order that is linked to a particular line of a drop-ship                 purchase order by clicking the purchase order line on the  Document                     Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form,                 and then clicking  View SO Demand  on the table toolbar. The                      Demand  dialog box, which opens, lists all the sales                 orders that are linked to the selected line of the purchase order. Reviewing the Purchase Order Linked to a Sales Order Line You can find the purchase order that is linked to a particular line of a sales order                 by clicking the sales order line on the  Document Details  tab                 of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, and then clicking                      PO Link  on the table toolbar. The  Purchasing                     Details  dialog box, which opens, lists all the purchase orders that                 are linked to the selected line of the sales order. Reviewing Item Plans Related to Drop-Ship Orders On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) Inventory Allocation Details (IN402000) form, you can select an item in the                      Inventory ID  box, and on the  Item                     Plans  tab, review the quantity of the item that is currently listed                 in drop-ship orders. The  SO to Drop-Ship  plan type indicates that a sales                 order has items marked for drop-shipping. The  Drop-Ship for SO Prepared  plan                 type indicates that a purchase order was prepared for the sales-order with items                 marked for drop-shipment.  Printing Reports and Documents To prepare a printable form of the purchase order that is being processed, you use                 the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO641000|PO641000]) Purchase Order (PO641000) report. While you are viewing a                 purchase order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form, you can print                 the purchase order by clicking  Reports Print Purchase Order  on the form toolbar. The system opens the printable version of the                 document on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO641000|PO641000]) Purchase Order report; then you can review the                 order and print it by clicking  Print  on the report                 toolbar. ]]></column>

In Acumatica ERP, you can create sales orders whose goods are intended for drop shipping. Drop shipping means that a customer orders the goods from your company, pays your company for the order, and receives the goods (which your company has ordered) directly from one of your vendors. In the system, you define these goods as non-stock items because your company does not keep them in stock.{br}

If the ''Drop Shipments'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can mark particular non-stock items for drop shipping and create drop-ship orders for these items. [anchor|#section_j1t_try_klb]
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_pqx_cyf_hy]
*Process a sales order for non-stock items to be drop-shipped
*Mark items for drop shipment in a sales order
*Create a drop-ship purchase order for the sales order and process the drop shipment to completion
[anchor|#section_k1t_try_klb]
==Applicable Scenarios==
You use a drop shipment to fulfill a sale of non-stock items that your company does not keep in its warehouses. Instead, your company processes the needed documents to have your vendor ship the items directly to the customer[anchor|#section_l1t_try_klb]
==Drop-Shipping Process==
To process a sale with drop shipment, you create a sales order of the ''SO'' order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, and add the non-stock items ordered by the customer. On the '''Document Details''' tab of the form, you mark the non-stock items for drop shipping by selecting the check box in the '''Mark for PO''' column and selecting ''Drop-Ship'' in the '''PO Source''' column, which means that the items will be ordered from the vendor and shipped directly to the customer.{br}

When you mark items for drop shipping and save the sales order with the ''Open'' status, the system creates purchase requests of the ''Drop-Ship'' plan type. You then create a drop-ship purchase order by processing ''Drop-Ship'' purchase requests on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_50_00|Create Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) form. This drop-ship purchase order contains links to the related sales order.{br}

The items from this purchase order are not shipped to the company&rsquo;s warehouse; rather, they are shipped directly to the customer. After you have received confirmation that the customer has received the items from the vendor, you prepare and release the purchase receipt for the drop-ship purchase order. When you release the purchase receipt (which is listed as a shipment document for the sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form), the status of the drop-ship purchase order and sales order is changed to ''Completed''. You can then you prepare an SO invoice for the customer.[anchor|#section_m1t_try_klb]
==Workflow of a Sale with Drop Shipment==
For a sales order with non-stock items intended for drop shipment, the typical processing involves the actions and generated documents shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#fig_ygr_p4d_h5][anchor|#image_dc1_xyx_2t][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_Sale_Non-Stock_for_Dropship.png|popup|350px]]]></column>

In the       system, you define these goods as non-stock items because your company does not keep them in       stock. If the  Drop Shipments  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000)       form, you can mark particular non-stock items for drop shipping and create drop-ship orders       for these items.  Learning Objectives In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following: Process a sales order for non-stock items to be drop-shipped Mark items for drop shipment in a sales order Create a drop-ship purchase order for the sales order and process the drop shipment to           completion Applicable Scenarios You use a drop shipment to fulfill a sale of non-stock items that your company does not keep         in its warehouses. Instead, your company processes the needed documents to have your vendor         ship the items directly to the customer Drop-Shipping Process To process a sale with drop shipment, you create a sales order of the  SO  order type on         the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, and add the non-stock items ordered by         the customer. On the  Document Details  tab of the form, you mark the         non-stock items for drop shipping by selecting the check box in the  Mark for           PO  column and selecting  Drop-Ship  in the  PO           Source  column, which means that the items will be ordered from the vendor and         shipped directly to the customer. When you mark items for drop shipping and save the sales order with the  Open  status,         the system creates purchase requests of the  Drop-Ship  plan type. You then create a         drop-ship purchase order by processing  Drop-Ship  purchase requests on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) Create Purchase Orders (PO505000) form. This drop-ship purchase order contains links to         the related sales order. The items from this purchase order are not shipped to the company's warehouse; rather, they         are shipped directly to the customer. After you have received confirmation that the customer         has received the items from the vendor, you prepare and release the purchase receipt for the         drop-ship purchase order. When you release the purchase receipt (which is listed as a         shipment document for the sales order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000)         form), the status of the drop-ship purchase order  and sales order is changed to            Completed . You can then you prepare an SO invoice for the customer. Workflow of a Sale with Drop Shipment For a sales order with non-stock items intended for drop shipment, the typical processing         involves the actions and generated documents shown in the following diagram. ]]></column>

==Story==
Suppose that the FourStar Coffee & Sweets Shop (''COFFEESHOP'') customer has ordered two rare teas at SweetLife’s retail store. Although these teas are presented in SweetLife’s website catalog, the company does not keep them in the wholesale or retail warehouse; they are defined in Acumatica ERP as non-stock items. When a customer orders these teas, SweetLife drop-ships them from the Tea & Spices (''TEACOMPANY'') vendor, which regularly stocks these teas, directly to the customer who ordered the teas. To fulfill the customer’s request, acting as the sales manager of the SweetLife store, you need to process a drop shipment. [anchor|#section_plw_wry_klb]
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, the ''Drop Shipments'' feature, which provides the ability to create and process sales orders with drop shipment, has been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in the system:[anchor|#ul_itw_4h4_blb]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form, the ''TEACOMPANY'' vendor has been configured.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, the ''EMPTEA'' and ''KINGTEA'' non-stock items have been configured. For each of these items, the ''TEACOMPANY'' vendor has been added to the '''Vendor Details''' tab. Also, the '''Require Receipt''' and '''Require Shipment''' check boxes have been selected for these items on the '''General Settings''' tab. These settings are required to process drop-ship sales.
[anchor|#section_qlw_wry_klb]
==Process Overview==
In this activity, to process a sale with drop shipment, you will create a sales order of the ''SO'' order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form; on the '''Document Details''' tab, you will add the items ordered by the customer. Because the items are not kept in stock, you will mark each of them for drop shipping by selecting the check box in the '''Mark for PO''' column and selecting ''Drop-Ship'' in the '''PO Source''' column, which means that the items will be ordered from the vendor and shipped directly to the customer.{br}

You will then create a drop-ship purchase order by processing purchase requests of the ''Drop-Ship'' plan type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_50_00|Create Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) form. The drop-ship purchase order generated from purchase requests, which can be viewed and processed further on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, contains links to the related sales order. {br}

After you have received confirmation that the customer has received the items from the vendor, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, you will prepare and release the purchase receipt for the drop-ship purchase order. You will then prepare an invoice for the customer by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form.[anchor|#section_rlw_wry_klb]

[anchor|#section_ulw_wry_klb]
==Step 3: Creating a Drop-Ship Purchase Order==
To create a drop-ship purchase order from purchase requests, do the following:[anchor|#_005b012f-b17e-489e-8434-1a9f02ef4b04]
#On the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form while you are still viewing the sales order, click '''Actions''' > '''Create Purchase Order'''.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_50_00|Create Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) form, which opens, select the unlabeled check boxes in the two rows with ''Drop Ship'' specified as the '''Plan Type''' (which are the lines that are related to the sales order that you have prepared). 
#In both of the rows, make sure that ''TEACOMPANY'' is specified in the '''Vendor Name''' column.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Process''' to process the purchase requests you have selected. 
#:The system creates a drop-ship purchase order for the ''TEACOMPANY'' vendor and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form.
#On the '''Document Details''' tab of this form, click the ''EMPTEA'' line, and on the table toolbar, click '''View SO Demand'''. The '''Demand''' dialog box, which opens, shows the sales order to which this purchase order line is linked.

#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, which the system opens with the created receipt, review the details of the prepared purchase receipt, and make sure that both purchase order lines have been added with the appropriate quantities. 
#In the Summary area, select the '''Create Bill''' check box to make the system generate the bill automatically on release of the purchase receipt.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the purchase receipt.
#:The system releases the purchase receipt and assigns it the ''Released'' status.
#On the '''Billing History''' tab, review the only line in the table, which shows the generated bill, and make sure the bill has a status of ''Open''.
[anchor|#section_wlw_wry_klb]
==Step 5: Processing the AR Invoice for the Customer==
To complete the processing of a sale with drop shipment, you need to generate an invoice to the customer. Do the following:[anchor|#_5f17c0d1-cccc-41f1-b318-5d0bde0859cb]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, open the sales order for the ''COFFEESHOP'' customer that you have created earlier in this activity.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Prepare Invoice'''.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form, which opens, review the details of the invoice to make sure that both items have been included in the invoice.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Release''' to release the invoice.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Drop Shipment of Non-Stock Items: Process Activity The following activity will walk you through the process of preparing a sales order                 with non-stock items marked for drop shipping and processing this sales order to                 completion. The following activity is             based on the  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system             settings have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the             activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100              dataset to its initial state. Story Suppose that the FourStar Coffee & Sweets Shop ( COFFEESHOP ) customer has                 ordered two rare teas at SweetLife’s retail store. Although these teas are presented                 in SweetLife’s website catalog, the company does not keep them in the wholesale or                 retail warehouse; they are defined in  Acumatica ERP as non-stock items. When a customer orders these teas, SweetLife drop-ships them                 from the Tea & Spices ( TEACOMPANY ) vendor, which regularly stocks these                 teas, directly to the customer who ordered the teas. To fulfill the customer’s                 request, acting as the sales manager of the SweetLife store, you need to process a                 drop shipment.  Configuration Overview For the purposes of this activity, the  Drop Shipments  feature, which                 provides the ability to create and process sales orders with drop shipment, has been                 enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS101000) form. The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined                     in the system: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors (AP303000) form, the                              TEACOMPANY  vendor has been configured. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form, the  EMPTEA                      and  KINGTEA  non-stock items have been configured. For each of these                     items, the  TEACOMPANY  vendor has been added to the  Vendor                         Details  tab. Also, the  Require Receipt                      and  Require Shipment  check boxes have been selected for                     these items on the  General Settings  tab. These settings                     are required to process drop-ship sales. Process Overview In this activity, to process a sale with drop shipment, you will create a sales                 order of the  SO  order type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000)                 form; on the  Document Details  tab, you will add the items                 ordered by the customer. Because the items are not kept in stock, you will mark each                 of them for drop shipping by selecting the check box in the  Mark for                     PO  column and selecting  Drop-Ship  in the  PO                     Source  column, which means that the items will be ordered from the                 vendor and shipped directly to the customer. You will then create a                  drop-ship                  purchase order by processing purchase requests of the  Drop-Ship  plan type on                 the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) Create Purchase Orders (PO505000) form. The drop-ship purchase order                 generated from purchase requests, which can be viewed and processed further on the                       ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form, contains links to the related                 sales order.  After you have received confirmation that the customer has received the items                 from the vendor, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form, you will                 prepare and release the purchase receipt for the drop-ship purchase order. You will                 then prepare an invoice for the customer by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form. System Preparation Do the following: Launch the  Acumatica ERP             website, and sign in to a company with the  U100  dataset preloaded. To sign in as             a sales and purchasing manager, use the  wiley  login and the  123              password. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to today's date. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date. On the company and branch selection menu, on the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP screen, select the  SweetLife Store  branch. Step 1: Creating a Sales Order To create a sales order, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, create a sales order,                     and specify the following settings: Order Type :  SO Customer :  COFFEESHOP Description :  Website order #00785                                 (tea) On the  Document Details  tab, add rows with the settings                     shown in the following table. Branch Inventory ID Warehouse Quantity Unit Price RETAIL EMPTEA RETAIL 10 47.99 RETAIL KINGTEA RETAIL 10 54.99 Click  Save  on the form toolbar to save the sales order,                     which is assigned the  Open  status. Step 2: Marking the Items for Drop Shipment To mark items for drop shipment, while you are still viewing the sales order on                 the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, do the following: For each of the lines on the  Document Details  tab,                         select the  Mark for PO  check box and select                              Drop-Ship  in the  PO Source  column. On the form toolbar, click  Save . Step 3: Creating a Drop-Ship Purchase Order To create a drop-ship purchase order from purchase requests, do the                     following: On the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form while                     you are still viewing the sales order, click  Actions Create Purchase Order . On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) Create Purchase Orders (PO505000) form, which opens, select the                     unlabeled check boxes in the two rows with  Drop Ship  specified as the                          Plan Type  (which are the lines that are related to                     the sales order that you have prepared).  In both of the rows, make sure that  TEACOMPANY  is specified in the                          Vendor Name  column. On the form toolbar, click  Process  to process the                     purchase requests you have selected.  The system creates a drop-ship purchase                         order for the  TEACOMPANY  vendor and opens it on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form. On the  Document Details  tab of this form, click the                          EMPTEA  line, and on the table toolbar, click  View SO                         Demand . The  Demand  dialog box, which                     opens, shows the sales order to which this purchase order line is linked. Click  Close  to close the dialog box. In the  Description  box of the Summary area, type                          Purchase for website order #00785 . On the form toolbar, click  Release from Hold . On the form toolbar, click  Save . Step 4: Processing the Drop-Ship Purchase Order Suppose that you have been notified that the customer has received the ordered teas.                 To process the drop-ship purchase order to completion, do the following: While you are still viewing the purchase order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form, click  Actions Enter PO Receipt  on the form toolbar.  On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form, which the system opens                     with the created receipt, review the details of the prepared purchase receipt,                     and make sure that both purchase order lines have been added with the                     appropriate quantities.  In the Summary area, select the  Create Bill  check box to                     make the system generate the bill automatically on release of the purchase                     receipt. On the form toolbar, click  Release  to release the                     purchase receipt. The system releases the purchase receipt and assigns it the                              Released  status. On the  Billing History  tab, review the only line in the                     table, which shows the generated bill, and make sure the bill has a status of                          Open . Step 5: Processing the AR Invoice for the Customer To complete the processing of a sale with drop shipment, you need to generate an                     invoice to the customer. Do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, open the sales order                         for the  COFFEESHOP  customer that you have created earlier in this                         activity. On the form toolbar, click  Actions Prepare Invoice . On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form, which opens, review                     the details of the invoice to make sure that both items have been included in                     the invoice. On the form toolbar, click  Actions Release  to release the invoice. Return to the sales order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders form, and                     notice the  Completed  status (shown in the following screenshot), which                     reflects that you have processed it to completion. Then on the                          Shipments  tab, review the only row (also shown in the                     following screenshot), which indicates the shipment for the order. Notice that                     the purchase receipt that you have processed is listed as a shipment for this                     sales order and that the reference number of this purchase receipt is shown in                     the  Document Nbr.  column of the row (see the following                         screenshot).

To mass-process sales orders marked for drop shipment, you open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_50_00|Create Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) form, on which you can create drop-ship purchase orders based on the drop-ship purchase requests that have been created for sales orders.{br}

On this form, you select the unlabeled check boxes in the rows of the purchase requests of the ''Drop-Ship'' plan type to be processed and click '''Process''' on the form toolbar to generate the purchase order or orders of this type. A sales order can have two or more linked drop-ship purchase orders, but each generated drop-ship purchase order can have only one linked sales order. The system creates a consolidated drop-ship purchase order for each group of purchase requests for which both the sales order and the vendor are the same. [anchor|#section_qyg_yry_klb]
==Mass-Creating SO Invoices==
You can create multiple invoices on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) form by selecting the ''Prepare Invoice'' action, selecting the unlabeled check box in the rows of the sales orders to be processed, and click '''Process''' on the form toolbar to generate the SO invoice or invoices.]]></column>

Mass-Creating Drop-Ship Purchase Orders Drop-ship purchase orders can be mass-generated for purchase requests related to multiple         sales orders at a time. To mass-process sales orders marked for drop shipment, you open the             ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) Create Purchase Orders (PO505000) form, on which you can create drop-ship         purchase orders based on the drop-ship purchase requests that have been created for sales         orders.

Many businesses perform sales on credit: A customer order is paid after the order has been shipped and an invoice for the shipped goods and services has been sent to the customer. In some cases, businesses may require prepayments or payments to be made for particular orders, or your organization can charge a customer card for specific orders. If you rely on payment auto-application, payments are applied to unrelated invoices starting from the earliest documents, and it is difficult to perform reconciliation of balances later.{br}

With Acumatica ERP, you can create payments and prepayments directly on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, thus reserving these payments or prepayments for the particular order in full or partially. Also, you can link an order to existing prepayments or payments by their reference numbers. There may be many variations of processing a sales order with reserved payment, such as multiple shipments and multiple invoices for the order, multiple payments reserved for one order, or multiple orders paid by one prepayment. If the order is being shipped in multiple shipments, you can track how the payment's partial amounts was applied to multiple invoices.{br}{TOC}
==Linking Orders and Payments==
When you enter a new sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, you can create a payment or prepayment directly from the '''Payments''' tab by clicking '''Create Payment''' or '''Create Prepayment''' on the table toolbar. The system brings up the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_20_00|Payments and Applications] ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) form in a pop-up window. After you enter and save the payment or prepayment, it is linked to the sales order and can be reviewed on the '''Payments''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders]form. {br}

When you enter a new customer prepayment or payment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_20_00|Payments and Applications] form, you can link it directly to a particular order or multiple by adding the order or orders on the '''Orders to Apply''' tab. Payments with balances that have been partially applied to invoices (whether or not the invoices are related to the order) can also be reserved for sales orders. {br}

For customers who pay by using credit cards, you can create a payment, link it to particular sales order or orders, and charge the credit card by using the same form, [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_20_00|Payments and Applications]. 
==Applying Parent and Child Payments==
If the ''Parent-Child Customer Relationship'' feature has been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can configure parent-child relationships between customer accounts. If the '''Consolidate Balance''' check box is selected for a child account on the '''Billing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form, you can apply parent payments and prepayments to the open sales orders of this child account. When the invoice is prepared for the sales order, the payment application amount is transferred to the invoice. If you enter an invoice for a child customer directly on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form, you can also apply payments and prepayments of the parent customer to this invoice. {br}

For more information on the configuration of parent-child relationships, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__MNG_ParentChild|Managing Parent-Child Relationships].
==Processing Orders with Reserved Payments==
An order with a payment linked is processed in the same way as any other order is. Once an order with linked payments or prepayments is shipped, the payment or prepayment amount applied to an order is transferred to the Sales Orders invoice or invoices generated for the order. On release of the SO invoices, the system applies the payment amounts reserved for the order to the invoices. If the amount of payments is equal to the order total, the invoices are closed. If the total amount of payments or prepayments applied to the order is less than the order total, the system leaves one of the invoices open with the unpaid balance (which is the difference between the order total and the payments&rsquo; total). {br}

You can view the history of application on the '''Application History''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_20_00|Payments and Applications] ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) form. As orders linked to this payment are shipped and completed, you will see on the '''Application History''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_20_00|Payments and Applications] form the list of applied invoices (generated for those orders) as it is populated.{br}

When a full-amount payment has been reserved for an order, once the order has been shipped and an invoice has been generated and released, the payment amount is applied to the invoice; the invoice is assigned the ''Closed'' status on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form, while the order is assigned the ''Completed'' status on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. If an order with a full-amount payment is shipped partially and then is completed or canceled, the amount applied to the order is reset to zero, while the payment with an unapplied balance is assigned the ''Open'' status and its applied amount is transferred to the invoice. 
==Limitations on Payment Application==
The application of payments to sales orders has the following limitations:[anchor|#_9e2822e1-9e57-4355-ad92-76a923ec3658]
*Payments and prepayments can be applied to only sales orders with single-installment credit terms specified in the '''Terms''' box on the '''Financial Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. If you change single-installment credit terms to multiple-installment terms for an existing sales order with payments or prepayments applied, these applications will be unlinked from the sales order. For more information on configuring credit terms, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__con_Credit_Terms|Setup of Credit Terms].
*If approval of sales orders is required in your organization, you can specify payments for only orders that have undergone the required approvals and have the ''Open'' status. For details about approval processes, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Approvals|Sales Order Approval].

==Canceling Payment Reservation==
If no invoice has been generated for the order, you can cancel payment application by removing the reserved payment from the list on the '''Payments''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form.

If your company sells certain items that are purchased only when sales orders for these items exist, a sales order may result in multiple purchase orders for different vendors, and a purchase order may include items from multiple sales orders. These factors could make it difficult to track the fulfillment of sales orders. In Acumatica ERP, you can link sales orders to existing purchase orders and receipts, so that the system will allocate the items listed on purchase receipts to specific sales orders. {br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_pqx_cyf_hy]
*Configure the processing of purchases for sale in Acumatica ERP
*In a sales order, mark items to be purchased for the sale 
*Create a purchase order linked to a sales order
*Mass-create purchase orders
*Process the sales order and related purchase documents, inventory documents, and accounts payable documents
*Find information about documents related to a purchase for sale

==Applicable Scenarios==
You process purchases for sale in the following cases:[anchor|#_9cb48b39-cf84-4b8f-9697-e1e7904755d2]
*You need to process a sales order that includes items that your company does not have in stock; such items are purchased only for specific sales orders.
*You have multiple warehouses and perform purchasing only to particular larger warehouses (distribution centers). (During the processing of a purchase for sale, the system will generate the required transfers between warehouses, so you can easily track where the particular sales order is in the fulfillment process.)
*You need to promptly fulfill a sales order line for which the quantity of the item is insufficient. After you have shipped the available quantity of the item (if any units are available), you need to order the quantity that was unavailable at the time of shipping.

==Creation of Sales Orders with Items Requested for Purchase==
If the quantity of an item added to a sales order is fully or partially out of stock, you can purchase the remaining quantity. You specify that the remaining quantity should be purchased for the order by selecting the '''Mark for PO''' check box for the line on the '''Document Details''' tab. The quantity initially allocated for the order remains allocated, while the quantity that must be purchased remains unallocated. {br}

Once you take the sales order off hold, the purchase request created for this order appears on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_50_00|Create Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) form. By default, for each line, the system specifies the vendor, which is set as default for a stock item specified in this line. You can change the vendor, if needed. From the purchase requests, you generate purchase orders that will be linked to the original sales order. Once you prepare and release the purchase receipt for the purchase order, the items become available for shipping, so you can allocate the initially unallocated quantities manually by using the '''Allocations''' dialog box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form and complete the processing of the sales order.
==Workflow of a Purchase for Sale==
For a sales order that includes stock items intended for purchasing, the typical processing involves the actions and generated documents shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#_8acb494e-d490-40d9-b88d-7ed9a32285f0][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_OrderMgmt_Purchase_for_Sale.png|popup|450px]
==Process Limitations==
The following limitations apply to the processing of purchases for sale:[anchor|#_b1dbcf34-c4fb-493a-93a8-b22b4d991fbe]
*Sales order lines marked for purchase are not processed during the quick processing of a sales order. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Quick_Process_Workflow|Quick Processing of Sales Orders].
*In a sales order of the ''RR'' or ''RM'' type, lines with the ''Return'' operation type cannot be marked for purchasing for sale, because these are the items to be received to inventory.
*Releasing inventory receipts during the processing of a purchase for sale does not automatically update plan types for sales orders with allocations, even if the '''Replan Back Orders''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form. On release of these inventory receipts, the unallocated quantities are still shown as ''Back Ordered'' until you manually allocate them. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_ReplanBackOrders|Back Ordering and Replanning Back Orders].

The following sections describe how you can establish connections between sales orders and the purchase documents that relate to these sales orders.
==Linking Sales Orders to Purchase Orders==
You can link a line of a sales order with the '''Mark for PO''' check box selected to an existing purchase order, for instance, if you have created a new sales order that lists the same items as an open purchase order does. To link a sales order line to a purchase order line, on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, you need to click the sales order line and then click '''PO Link''' on the table toolbar. In the '''Purchasing Details''' dialog box, which opens, select the unlabeled check box in the needed line of the needed purchase order, and click '''Save'''. If the purchase order line has a quantity that exactly matches the total quantity on the sales orders that are already linked, you should first increase the quantity on the purchase order line, and then link the sales order to this purchase order.
==Linking Purchase Receipts to Sales Orders==
Items marked for purchase in a sales order may be received to warehouses other than the warehouse specified on the sales order. If the users properly specify the links between the purchase receipts and purchase orders, Acumatica ERP enables the tracking of sales order fulfillment, reserves the received items for sales orders, and automates the transfers of the items to the needed warehouses. {br}

To make it possible to track items in receipts to the original sales orders, when you create these receipts, you need to link each receipt to the corresponding purchase order in one of the following ways:[anchor|#ul_hgm_m4p_wp]
*Open the purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, and create a receipt for it by selecting '''Actions''' > '''Enter PO Receipt''' on the form toolbar.
*Create a receipt on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, and link all the related purchase orders or purchase order lines to this new receipt by clicking '''Add PO''' or '''Add PO Line''' on the table toolbar.

After a purchase receipt has been properly linked to all the related purchase orders, you will be able to track the stage of fulfillment for each line of the original sales order. On release of the purchase receipt, the quantities of items required for the sales orders are deducted from the item quantities available for shipping. If items are received to a warehouse other than the warehouse specified on the sales order, the system will generate a transfer request, which you can use to create a transfer order by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form for a single transfer order, or by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_90_00|Create Transfer Orders] form for multiple transfer orders. ]]></column>

In this activity, you will learn how to process a purchase of items that are not in stock for a particular sales order, and how to process the sales order to completion after receipt of the items that were purchased for sale. {br}{TOC}
==Story==
Suppose that the GoodFood One Restaurant customer has ordered tropical fruits (3 pounds of dragon fruits and 2 pounds of tangerines) on SweetLife&rsquo;s website. SweetLife&rsquo;s warehouses do not have the appropriate conditions for keeping delicate tropical fruits; also, these fruits are ordered rarely and in small quantities. To provide fresh and high-quality fruits to the customers, the sales manager purchases these tropical fruits on demand from the All Fruits Mall company, and once the fruits are delivered to the retail warehouse of the SweetLife store, they are immediately shipped to the customer that ordered them. Acting as the sales manager, you will process the sales order and the related purchase order in the system.
==Configuration Overview==

For each item, the ''ALLFRUITS'' vendor has been added on the '''Vendor Details''' tab, and the last vendor price has been specified.

==Process Overview==
In this activity, to process a sales order that includes items that must be purchased for sale, you will first create a sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form and add all of the stock items that were ordered by the customer. Because the items are not in stock, you will mark them for purchasing in the sales order; to ship these lines, you have to receive the purchased items at the warehouse specified in the sales order lines.{br}

When you mark items for purchasing, the system creates purchase requests of the ''SO to Purchase'' type. You will create purchase orders by mass-processing purchase requests of this type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_50_00|Create Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) form. Each purchase order generated from a purchase request or from multiple requests is linked to the related sales order. When you receive the items of each linked purchase order to inventory, the items are allocated directly to the related sales orders.{br}

After all purchased items have been received to inventory, you will process the sales order to completion. That is, you will ship the items to the customer and prepare the invoice for the customer.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Purchases for Sale: Process Activity In this activity, you will learn how to process a purchase of items that are not in                 stock for a particular sales order, and how to process the sales order to completion                 after receipt of the items that were purchased for sale.  Story Suppose that the GoodFood One Restaurant customer has ordered tropical fruits (3                 pounds of dragon fruits and 2 pounds of tangerines) on SweetLife's website.                 SweetLife's warehouses do not have the appropriate conditions for keeping delicate                 tropical fruits; also, these fruits are ordered rarely and in small quantities. To                 provide fresh and high-quality fruits to the customers, the sales manager purchases                 these tropical fruits on demand from the All Fruits Mall company, and once the                 fruits are delivered to the retail warehouse of the SweetLife store, they are                 immediately shipped to the customer that ordered them. Acting as the sales manager,                 you will process the sales order and the related purchase order in the system. Configuration Overview For the purposes of this activity, the following features have been enabled on the                       ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS101000) form:  Inventory , which provides the ability to create purchase orders that                     include stock items Sales Order to Purchase Order Link , which provides the ability to link                     sales orders to existing purchase orders and receipts, and to create new                     purchase orders for existing sales orders The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in                 the system: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000) form, the  GOODFOOD                         (GoodFood One Restaurant)  customer has been configured.

This topic explains how to process multiple documents related to purchases for sale, and how the system generates, changes, or works with documents as a result of the mass processing. {br}{TOC}
==Mass-Creating Purchase Orders==
Purchase orders related to sales orders can be mass-generated for multiple sales orders at a time. To mass-process sales order lines that have been marked for purchase, you open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_50_00|Create Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) form, on which you can create purchase orders based on the purchase requests (which are the lines with the ''SO to Purchase'' plan type) that have been created for these sales order lines. On this form, you select the unlabeled check boxes in the rows of the lines to be processed and click '''Process''' on the form toolbar to generate the purchase order or orders of the ''Normal'' type.{br}

When multiple purchase orders are generated from purchase requests, the system creates consolidated purchase orders grouped by order type, vendor, vendor location, and warehouse; if project accounting functionality is in use, the purchase orders are also grouped by project. In each prepared purchase order, purchase order lines are grouped by item, subitem, and date on which they are requested; if project accounting functionality is in use, the purchase order lines are also grouped by project, project task, and cost code.
==Mass-Creating SO Invoices==
You can create multiple invoices on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) form by selecting the ''Prepare Invoice'' action, selecting the unlabeled check box in the sales order lines to be processed, and click '''Process''' on the form toolbar to generate the SO invoice or invoices.]]></column>

==Finding Orders Pending Purchase==
You can find purchase requests of the ''SO to Purchase'' type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_50_00|Create Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) form. On the form, you can filter purchase requests by any of the following criteria: warehouse, vendor, order type, order number, inventory identifier, item class, customer, product manager, and workgroup. For the selected list of purchase requests, you can generate purchase orders for all the lines in the list, or you can select particular lines (by selecting the unlabeled check boxes in the lines) and generate these purchase orders.
==Reviewing Allocations for a Sales Order==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, you can track the stage of fulfillment for each line of a sales order by clicking the line and then '''Allocations''' on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab. In the '''Allocations''' dialog box, which opens, you can view an allocation that the system automatically performs to reserve the line item quantity required for the sales order on the purchase receipt. {br}

If a purchase order line that corresponds to a sales order is completed or canceled, the system adds a new allocation line, which can be viewed in the '''Allocations''' dialog box. This line has the '''Mark for PO''' check box cleared and indicates that the shipment should be prepared for the item quantity in this line. When the shipment is confirmed for this line, the line is removed from the '''Allocations''' dialog box.
==Reviewing the Demand for Purchase Orders==
You can find the sales order that is linked to a particular line of a purchase order by clicking the purchase order line on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, and then clicking '''View SO Demand''' on the table toolbar. The '''Demand''' dialog box, which opens, lists all the sales orders that are linked to the selected line of the purchase order.
==Reviewing the Links Between Sales Order Lines and Purchase Order Lines==
You can link a sales order line to an existing purchase order line, or find the purchase order that is linked to a particular line of a sales order by clicking the sales order line on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, and then clicking '''PO Link''' on the table toolbar. The '''Purchasing Details''' dialog box, which opens, lists all the purchase orders that are linked to the selected line of the sales order. To link a sales order line to a purchase order line, you select the '''Selected''' check box next to need line in the table, and click '''Save'''.
==Reviewing the Item Plans Related to Purchases for Sale==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_20_00|Inventory Allocation Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) form, you can select an item in the '''Inventory ID''' box, and on the '''Item Plans''' tab, review the quantity of the item that is currently listed in purchase orders. The ''SO to Purchase'' plan type indicates that a sales order has items marked for purchasing. The ''Purchase for SO Prepared'' plan type indicates that a purchase order was prepared for the sales-order with items marked for purchasing.
==Printing a Purchase Order==
To prepare a printable version of the purchase order that is being processed, you use the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\PO_64_10_00|Purchase Order] ([~/?ScreenId=PO641000|PO641000]) report. While you are viewing a purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, you can print the purchase order by clicking '''Reports''' > '''Print Purchase Order''' on the form toolbar. The system opens the printable version of the document on the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\PO_64_10_00|Purchase Order] report; then you can review the order and print it by clicking '''Print''' on the report toolbar.]]></column>

In Acumatica ERP, you can process standard inventory purchases: purchases in which the bills are generated after the ordered goods and services have been received into inventory from the vendors. {br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
You will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Create a purchase order with stock items
*Prepare a purchase receipt for an existing purchase order
*Release a purchase receipt
*Enter the accounts payable bill for the receipt
*Process the purchase order and the related inventory documents and accounts payable documents

==Applicable Scenarios==
You process a purchase order if you need to record a purchase of stock items with item quantities updated in inventory and to prepare a bill for the purchased goods to the vendor of the goods. The standard purchase process typically includes entering a purchase order, processing the purchase receipt when the purchased items are received to inventory, and preparing a bill to the vendor.
==Standard Purchase Process==
In general, the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form is the starting point for creating a purchase order. In Acumatica ERP, for processing standard purchases of inventory items, purchase orders of the ''Normal'' type are used. {br}

In a new purchase order created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form, you should first select the vendor. Then on the '''Document Details''' tab, you list the stock items to be purchased from the vendor. You can add stock items by clicking the '''Add Item''' button on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab and selecting from only the vendor&rsquo;s items or from the entire list of stock items. Once the purchased items have been received to inventory, you need to create a purchase receipt (or multiple partial receipts). When a purchase receipt is released, the system automatically generates a corresponding inventory receipt, with the date and posting period of the purchase receipt, to update the inventory on hand with the quantity and cost of the received goods. On release of the inventory receipt, a batch of GL transactions is generated to update account balances in the general ledger. If all the lines in the purchase order have been received in full, the system assigns the purchase order the ''Completed'' status. Then you need to create a bill to increase the vendor&rsquo;s balance in the system with amount to be paid for received goods. If all the lines in the purchase order have been billed in full, the system assigns the purchase order the ''Closed'' status.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Standard Inventory Purchases: General Information In  Acumatica ERP, you can process standard inventory purchases: purchases in which the bills are generated         after the ordered goods and services have been received into inventory from the vendors.        Learning Objectives You will learn how to do the following: Create a purchase order with stock items Prepare a purchase receipt for an existing purchase order Release a purchase receipt Enter the accounts payable bill for the receipt Process the purchase order and the related inventory documents and accounts payable           documents Applicable Scenarios You process a purchase order if you need to record a purchase of stock items with item         quantities updated in inventory and to prepare a bill for the purchased goods to the vendor         of the goods. The standard purchase process typically includes entering a purchase order,         processing the purchase receipt when the purchased items are received to inventory, and         preparing a bill to the vendor. Standard Purchase Process In general, the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form is the         starting point for creating a purchase order. In  Acumatica ERP, for processing standard purchases of inventory items, purchase orders of the            Normal  type are used.  In a new purchase order created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form,         you should first select the vendor. Then on the  Document Details  tab,         you list the stock items to be purchased from the vendor. You can add stock items by         clicking the  Add Item  button on the table toolbar of the            Document Details  tab and selecting from only the vendor's items or         from the entire list of stock items. Once the purchased items have been received to         inventory, you need to create a purchase receipt (or multiple partial receipts). When a         purchase receipt is released, the system automatically generates a corresponding inventory         receipt, with the date and posting period of the purchase receipt, to update the inventory         on hand with the quantity and cost of the received goods. On release of the inventory         receipt, a batch of GL transactions is generated to update account balances in the general         ledger. If all the lines in the purchase order have been received in full, the system         assigns the purchase order the  Completed  status. Then you need to create a bill to         increase the vendor's balance in the system with amount to be paid for received goods. If         all the lines in the purchase order have been billed in full, the system assigns the         purchase order the  Closed  status. For more information on the rules that affect line         closing and completion, see  Stock Item Lines in Purchase Orders. Workflow of a Standard Inventory Purchase The following diagram represents the general workflow of the processing of a purchase order         in  Acumatica ERP, in which a purchase receipt is processed before the bill is generated.  ]]></column>

==Story==
Suppose that on January 30, 2020, the purchasing manager purchases fruits (100 pounds of apples, 200 pounds of oranges, and 50 pounds of lemons) from the Glory Fruit Case vendor. The purchased fruits are to be delivered to the main office&rsquo;s warehouse. As the purchasing manager, you need to enter and process a purchase order, process a purchase receipt, and create a bill that should be paid to the vendor for the received fruits.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this lesson, the ''Inventory'' feature, which provides the ability to create purchase orders that include stock items, has been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form, the ''GLORYFRUIT (Glory Fruit Case)'' vendor has been configured.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, the ''APPLES'', ''LEMONS'', and ''ORANGES'' stock items have been configured.
==Process Overview==
In the standard purchasing process, you create a purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form and add the purchased items to it. When the items have been received, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, you create a purchase receipt for the ordered items. On release of the purchase receipt, the system automatically generates an inventory receipt to reflect the receipt of the items in inventory. Then on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form, you create an accounts payable bill to the vendor.
==System Preparation==
Do the following:[anchor|#_f811a610-8f11-49fe-9fd6-edb04d0e9b26]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded. To sign in as a sales and purchasing manager, use the ''wiley'' login and the ''123'' password.
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select ''1/30/2020'' from the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system on this business date.
#On the company and branch selection menu, on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure the ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center'' branch is selected.

==Step 1: Creating a Purchase Order==
To create a purchase order, do the following:[anchor|#_639c6644-42f8-4dc8-8802-bb668aa56d78]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, create a purchase order with the following settings:
#*'''Type''': ''Normal''
#* '''Vendor''': ''GLORYFRUIT''
#* '''Date''': ''1/30/2020''
#* '''Promised On''': ''1/30/2020''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Purchase of fruits</tt>
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, add rows with the following settings:
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE'', '''Inventory ID''': ''APPLES'', '''Warehouse''': ''WHOLESALE'', '''Order Qty.''': <tt>100</tt>, '''Unit Cost''': <tt>2.29</tt>
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE'', '''Inventory ID''': ''LEMONS'', '''Warehouse''': ''WHOLESALE'', '''Order Qty.''': <tt>50</tt>, '''Unit Cost''': <tt>2.59</tt>
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE'', '''Inventory ID''': ''ORANGES'', '''Warehouse''': ''WHOLESALE'', '''Order Qty.''': <tt>200</tt>, '''Unit Cost''': <tt>1.85</tt>
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box so you can continue processing the purchase order.
#Click '''Save''' on the form toolbar to save the purchase order, which has the ''Open'' status.

==Step 2: Processing the Purchase Receipt==
Create the purchase receipt for the purchase order as follows:[anchor|#_5a48f678-622e-4c30-883c-135d7f9a0374]
#On the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form while you are still viewing the purchase order, click '''Actions &gt; Enter PO Receipt'''. The system prepares the purchase receipt for the selected purchase order and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form.
#Click '''Save''' on the form toolbar, and review the details of the prepared purchase receipt. Make sure the '''Create Bill''' check box is cleared in the Summary area. (In the next step, you will prepare the bill manually.)
#On the form toolbar, click '''Release'''.
#On the '''Other Information''' tab, click the '''IN Ref. Nbr.''' link, and review the details of the generated inventory receipt, which the system opens on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) form. Make sure the inventory receipt has the ''Released'' status.
#Run the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_61_55_00|Inventory Valuation] ([~/?ScreenId=IN615500|IN615500]) report with the following parameters (leave the default settings for the other parameters), and review the report:
#*'''Warehouse''': ''WHOLESALE''
#* '''Report Format''': ''Summary''
#:Make sure the report reflects that the purchased items have been received to the warehouse and are available.

==Step 3: Processing the AP Bill==
Do the following to process the AP bill:[anchor|#_9fbacbcf-22ac-415c-ad2c-69f40d4e84f1]
#Return to the purchase receipt that you have processed earlier in this activity on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, and on the form toolbar, click '''Actions &gt; Enter AP Bill'''. The system generates an accounts payable bill to the vendor of the goods and shows the created document on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form.
#In the '''Description''' box, enter <tt>Purchase of apples, lemons, and oranges</tt>.
#Clear the '''Hold''' check box in the Summary area, and click '''Release''' on the form toolbar to release the bill.
#Return to the purchase order to ''GLORYFRUIT'' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, and review its details. Notice that the order now has a status of ''Closed'', as shown in the screenshot below. On the '''PO History''' tab, notice that the information about purchase receipt and accounts payable bill that were prepared for the order is displayed. According to this information, the purchased items have been received to inventory and billed in full, so the purchasing process is completed.[anchor|#_596892b3-d198-4810-9b2a-1ea07af243f1][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_OrderMgmt_Standard_Inventory_Purchase.png|popup|Purchase order processed to completion|450px]

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Standard Inventory Purchases: Process Activity The following activity will walk you through the process of preparing and processing                 to completion a purchase order with items received to inventory before the vendor is                 billed. The following activity is             based on the  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system             settings have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the             activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100              dataset to its initial state. Story Suppose that on January 30,  2020, the purchasing manager purchases fruits (100 pounds of apples, 200 pounds of                 oranges, and 50 pounds of lemons) from the Glory Fruit Case vendor.

For simplicity, in                     this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system on this                     business date. On the company and branch selection menu, on the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP screen, make sure the  SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center                      branch is selected. Step 1: Creating a Purchase Order To create a purchase order, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form, create a purchase order                     with the following settings: Type :  Normal Vendor :  GLORYFRUIT Date :  1/30/2020Promised On :  1/30/2020Description :  Purchase of                                 fruits On the  Document Details  tab, add rows with the following                         settings: Branch :  HEADOFFICE ,  Inventory                                 ID :  APPLES ,  Warehouse :                                  WHOLESALE ,  Order Qty. :                                  100 ,  Unit Cost :                                  2.29 Branch :  HEADOFFICE ,  Inventory                                 ID :  LEMONS ,  Warehouse :                                  WHOLESALE ,  Order Qty. :                                  50 ,  Unit Cost :                                  2.59 Branch :  HEADOFFICE ,  Inventory                                 ID :  ORANGES ,  Warehouse :                                  WHOLESALE ,  Order Qty. :                                  200 ,  Unit Cost :                                  1.85 In the Summary area, clear the  Hold  check box so you can                     continue processing the purchase order. Click  Save  on the form toolbar to save the purchase                     order, which has the  Open  status. Step 2: Processing the Purchase Receipt Create the purchase receipt for the purchase order as follows: On the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form while                     you are still viewing the purchase order, click  Actions > Enter PO Receipt . The system prepares the purchase receipt for the selected                     purchase order and opens it on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000)                     form. Click  Save  on the form toolbar, and review the details of                     the prepared purchase receipt. Make sure the  Create Bill                      check box is cleared in the Summary area. (In the next step, you will prepare                     the bill manually.) On the form toolbar, click  Release . On the  Other Information  tab, click the  IN                         Ref. Nbr.  link, and review the details of the generated                     inventory receipt, which the system opens on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) Receipts (IN301000) form. Make sure the                     inventory receipt has the  Released  status. Run the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN615500|IN615500]) Inventory Valuation (IN615500) report with the                     following parameters (leave the default settings for the other parameters), and                     review the report: Warehouse :  WHOLESALE Report Format :  Summary Make                         sure the report reflects that the purchased items have been received to the                         warehouse and are available. Step 3: Processing the AP Bill Do the following to process the AP bill: Return to the purchase receipt that you have processed earlier in this activity                     on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form, and on the form toolbar,                     click  Actions > Enter AP Bill . The system generates an accounts payable bill to the vendor of                     the goods and shows the created document on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments                     (AP301000) form. In the  Description  box, enter  Purchase of                         apples, lemons, and oranges . Clear the  Hold  check box in the Summary area, and click                          Release  on the form toolbar to release the bill. Return to the purchase order to  GLORYFRUIT  on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form, and review its details. Notice                     that the order now has a status of  Closed , as shown in the screenshot                     below. On the  PO History  tab, notice that the information                     about purchase receipt and accounts payable bill that were prepared for the                     order is displayed. According to this information, the purchased items have been                     received to inventory and billed in full, so the purchasing process is                         completed. Purchase order processed to completion ]]></column>

The following sections describe how you can establish connection between purchase documents and related finance documents.
==Linking Accounts Payable Bills to Purchase Documents==
When you process a purchase of stock items by using the purchase order or purchase receipt as a starting point, the AP bills generated based on these documents are automatically linked to the related purchase documents. However, in some organizations, AP bills could be imported from a third-party application, or bills received from the vendors could be entered manually on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form, thus they would contain no reference to the purchase documents. To correctly track the order fulfillment and the relationships between documents in the system, lines with stock items in independently created bills must be linked to purchase orders or purchase receipts.{br}

Stock and non-stock items may be listed in a bill. When you add a stock item to a bill, the system displays a message that warns you that the line must be linked to a purchase receipt before the bill can be released. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] form, you must link each line of a bill with a stock item to a line of a released purchase receipt. If the bill includes non-stock items, you also may link the lines with non-stock items to the lines of released purchase receipts or open purchase orders, depending on the type of non-stock items. 
==Linking Purchase Receipts and Purchase Orders==
When you receive purchases from a single vendor and create a new purchase receipt on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, you can add an entire purchase order, multiple purchase orders, or particular purchase order lines to this receipt. The lines that can be added to a purchase receipt depend on the line types of these lines and on particular system settings. Purchase receipts can be linked to only normal or drop-ship purchase orders; see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_Types_of_Purchase_Orders|Blanket and Standard Purchase Orders] for details about these and other purchase order types. ]]></column>

The following sections explain how to mass-process purchase orders and related documents, and how the system generates, changes, or works with documents as a result of the mass processing. {br}{TOC}
==Mass-Releasing Purchase Receipts==
You can release multiple purchase receipts at the same time by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_10_00|Release Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO501000|PO501000]) form. On this form, you select the unlabeled check boxes in the rows to be processed, and click '''Process''' on the form toolbar to release the selected documents.
==Printing and Emailing Multiple Purchase Orders==
If needed, you can print or email multiple purchase orders at the same time by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_30_00|Print/Email Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO503000|PO503000]) form. To do this for multiple purchase orders simultaneously, you select the ''Print Purchase Order'' or ''Email Purchase Order'' action, select the unlabeled check boxes for the rows to be processed, and click '''Process''' on the form toolbar to process the selected documents.
==Consolidating Purchase Orders or Lines into a Single Purchase Receipt==
Instead of preparing an individual purchase receipt for each purchase order, you can add multiple purchase orders of one vendor to a single purchase receipt; you can also add individual lines of one purchase order or multiple purchase orders. To do this, you create a new purchase receipt of the ''Receipt'' type manually on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form; you then click '''Add PO''' on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab and add the lines of multiple purchase orders with the same vendor to the purchase receipt.

==Reviewing Purchase Order Information==
If you need to review all information related to a purchase order—including the order total, open quantities, unbilled quantities and amounts, and related purchase receipts and accounts payable bills with their dates, amounts, and current statuses—you first open the particular purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. Then on the form toolbar, you click '''Reports''' > '''View Purchase Order Receipt and Billing History''' to open the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\PO_64_30_00|Purchase Order Receipt and Billing History] ([~/?ScreenId=PO643000|PO643000]) report for this purchase order.
==Finding the Purchase Receipts Related to a Purchase Order==
If you need to find a purchase receipt linked to a particular purchase order, you can open the purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form and review the '''PO History''' tab. The left table on this tab lists all the purchase receipts that have been prepared for the order, and the table footer shows the summary information for all listed documents. To review the details of a listed purchase receipt, you click its reference number in the '''Receipt Nbr.''' column; the system opens the purchase receipt for review on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form.
==Finding the Bills Related to a Purchase Order==

The system                         opens the  Link Line  dialog box. In the dialog box, select the  Purchase Order  option                     button. The dialog box displays the purchase order lines with the same inventory                     ID that can be linked to the current line. Select the unlabeled check box for the purchase order line to be linked to the                     bill.  Click  Save  to link the lines and close the dialog box.  On the form toolbar, click  Save . Notes About the Procedure The notes in this section describe the nuances of the UI elements available on             the form, such as when an element is required and when it is not, and when the system             fills in settings by default. This section can include other notes. Note the following about linking AP bill lines to purchase order lines: To be able to link the lines of a bill to the lines of a corresponding purchase                     order, make sure that for the bill, the  Tax Settings  option is selected                     in the  Tax Calculation Mode  box on the                          Financial Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form. You can link bill lines to the lines of only purchase orders for which billing                     before receipt is allowed (that is, purchase orders for which the                          Allows AP Bill Before Receipt  check box is selected                     for the purchase order on the  Other Information  tab of                     the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form). Information about the related documents appears for each linked line of the bill                     on the  Document Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments form (in the  PO Type ,                          PO Number ,  PO Receipt Nbr. ,                     and  PO Receipt Line  columns). While the bill is                     unreleased, you can cancel the established links and link the bill lines to                     other documents if needed. ]]></column>

In Acumatica ERP, you can process purchases in which the bills are received and need to be paid before the vendor ships the ordered goods.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Configure a vendor so that its bills should be processed before the goods are shipped (and thus received)
*Create a purchase order with stock items
*Prepare the accounts payable bill for the purchase order
*Prepare and release purchase receipt and the related inventory documents

==Applicable Scenarios==
In your organization, if bills are received from some vendors and entered into the system before the purchased goods arrive or if bills are imported from a third-party system, you can establish a workflow in which an accounts payable bill can be processed before the ordered items have been received. In this case, the purchasing process typically includes entering a purchase order, preparing a bill for the vendor, and then, when the purchased items are received to inventory, processing the purchase receipt.
==Purchasing Process with Billing Before Receipt==
In general, the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form is the starting point for creating a purchase order. In Acumatica ERP, for the processing of purchases of inventory items with billing before receipt, purchase orders of the ''Normal'' type are used.{br}

You can create an AP bill before the corresponding purchase receipt for a purchase order if for the vendor specified in the order, the '''Allow AP Bill Before Receipt''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form or if for the vendor location selected in the order, the same check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_10|Vendor Locations] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303010|AP303010]) form, if applicable. The state of this check box is copied from the vendor or vendor location settings to the purchase orders prepared for this vendor or vendor location and cannot be changed in a purchase order.((({S:Warn}If a purchase order has the '''Allow AP Bill Before Receipt''' check box selected, you can also use the standard inventory purchase workflow in which the purchase receipt is processed and then the AP bill is prepared; the check box merely determines whether it is permissible to create the AP bill before the corresponding purchase receipt is created. For a description of the workflow with the receipt processed before the related bill, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\OrderMgmt_Standard_Inventory_Purchase_GeneralInfo|Standard Inventory Purchases: General Information].
)))
In a new purchase order created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form, you first select the vendor. Then on the '''Document Details''' tab, you list the stock items to be purchased from the vendor. You can add stock items by clicking the '''Add Item''' button on the table toolbar of this tab and selecting from only the vendor&rsquo;s items or from the entire list of stock items.{br}

Then you need to create a bill to increase the vendor&rsquo;s balance in the system by the amount to be paid for the received goods. You can release the prepared bill at any time, before or after the processing of the receipt of the ordered items. Once the purchased items have been received to inventory, you create a purchase receipt (or multiple partial receipts). When a purchase receipt is released, the system automatically generates a corresponding inventory receipt, with the same date and posting period that the purchase receipt has, to update the inventory on hand with the quantity and cost of the received goods. On release of the inventory receipt, a batch of GL transactions is generated to update the account balances in the general ledger. If all the lines in the purchase order have been received and billed in full, the system assigns the purchase order the ''Completed'' status. For more information on the rules that affect line closing and completion, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_Purchase_of_Stock|Stock Item Lines in Purchase Orders], [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_Purchase_of_NStock_w_Receipt|Non-Stock Lines in Purchase Orders], and [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_Purchase_of_Services|Service Lines in Purchase Orders].
==Workflow of a Purchase with Billing Before Receipt==

Learning Objectives In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following: Configure a vendor so that its bills should be processed before the goods are shipped (and           thus received) Create a purchase order with stock items Prepare the accounts payable bill for the purchase order Prepare and release purchase receipt and the related inventory documents Applicable Scenarios In your organization, if bills are received from some vendors and entered into the system         before the purchased goods arrive or if bills are imported from a third-party system, you         can establish a workflow in which an accounts payable bill can be processed before the         ordered items have been received. In this case, the purchasing process typically includes         entering a purchase order, preparing a bill for the vendor, and then, when the purchased         items are received to inventory, processing the purchase receipt. Purchasing Process with Billing Before Receipt In general, the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form is the         starting point for creating a purchase order. In  Acumatica ERP, for the processing of purchases of inventory items with billing before receipt, purchase         orders of the  Normal  type are used. You can create an AP bill before the corresponding purchase receipt for a purchase order if         for the vendor specified in the order, the  Allow AP Bill Before           Receipt  check box is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors         (AP303000) form or if for the vendor location selected in the order, the same check box is         selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303010|AP303010]) Vendor Locations (AP303010) form, if applicable. The state of         this check box is copied from the vendor or vendor location settings to the purchase orders         prepared for this vendor or vendor location and cannot be changed in a purchase order. If a purchase order has the  Allow AP Bill Before Receipt  check         box selected, you can also use the standard inventory purchase workflow in which the         purchase receipt is processed and then the AP bill is prepared; the check box merely         determines whether it is permissible to create the AP bill before the corresponding purchase         receipt is created. For a description of the workflow with the receipt processed before the         related bill, see  Standard Inventory Purchases: General Information. In a new purchase order created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form,         you first select the vendor. Then on the  Document Details  tab, you         list the stock items to be purchased from the vendor. You can add stock items by clicking         the  Add Item  button on the table toolbar of this tab and selecting         from only the vendor's items or from the entire list of stock items. Then you need to create a bill to increase the vendor's balance in the system by the amount         to be paid for the received goods. You can release the prepared bill at any time, before or         after the processing of the receipt of the ordered items. Once the purchased items have been         received to inventory, you create a purchase receipt (or multiple partial receipts). When a         purchase receipt is released, the system automatically generates a corresponding inventory         receipt, with the same date and posting period that the purchase receipt has, to update the         inventory on hand with the quantity and cost of the received goods. On release of the         inventory receipt, a batch of GL transactions is generated to update the account balances in         the general ledger. If all the lines in the purchase order have been received and billed in         full, the system assigns the purchase order the  Completed  status. For more         information on the rules that affect line closing and completion, see  Stock Item Lines in Purchase Orders,  Non-Stock Lines in Purchase Orders, and  Service Lines in Purchase Orders. Workflow of a Purchase with Billing Before Receipt The following diagram represents the general workflow of the processing of a purchase order         in  Acumatica ERP, in which a bill is processed before the purchased items are received to inventory. ]]></column>

)))
==Story==
Suppose that you, acting as the purchasing manager, order a large quantity of labeled paper bags and jar labels for SweetLife’s needs. The Wingman Printing Company vendor, from which these goods were purchased, sent a bill to SweetLife, which received the original paper bill before the goods were delivered to the warehouse of the company&rsquo;s main office. You need to enter the purchase order, enter the accounts payable bill for the purchase order, and later, when the goods arrive to the wholesale warehouse, create and process a purchase receipt related to the purchase order.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, the ''Inventory'' feature, which provides the ability to create purchase orders that include stock items, have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in the system:[anchor|#ul_ccr_1wk_dlb]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form, the ''PRINTICO (Wingman Printing Company)'' vendor has been configured. The '''Allow AP Bill Before Receipt''' check box has been selected for the vendor on the '''Purchase Settings''' tab.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, the ''PAPERBAG'' and ''LABELS'' stock items have been configured.

==Process Overview==
In this activity, to process a purchase order with billing before the items are received, you will first create the purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form and add the purchased items to it. You will then create an accounts payable bill for the vendor on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form and release the bill. When the ordered items are received, you will create a purchase receipt for them on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form. On release of the purchase receipt, the system generates a corresponding inventory receipt to reflect the receipt of the items to inventory, which you will review on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) form.
==System Preparation==
Do the following:[anchor|#_f811a610-8f11-49fe-9fd6-edb04d0e9b26][anchor|#_b2a3e79c-3012-44a0-8661-57ea1a198a39]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded. To sign in as a sales and purchasing manager, use the ''wiley'' login and the ''123'' password.[anchor|#_d0b57566-35fc-4d0e-a4ca-90baea40ea1b]
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to today&rsquo;s date. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.[anchor|#_6acdbccf-3ae7-43d4-8a22-4073f16dbec4]
#On the company and branch selection menu, on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure the ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center'' branch is selected.

==Step 1: Creating the Purchase Order==
To create a purchase order that includes labeled paper bags and jar labels for the Wingman Printing Company, do the following:[anchor|#_639c6644-42f8-4dc8-8802-bb668aa56d78]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, create a purchase order with the following settings:
#*'''Type''': ''Normal''
#* '''Vendor''': ''PRINTICO''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Order of labels and paper bags</tt>
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, add rows with the settings listed in the following table.
#:{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="20%" ! Branch
!width="20%" ! Inventory ID
!width="20%" ! Warehouse
!width="20%" ! Order Qty.
!width="20%" ! Unit Cost
|- 
| ''HEADOFFICE''
|  ''LABELS''
|  ''WHOLESALE''
| <tt>40</tt>
| <tt>7.49</tt>
|- 
| ''HEADOFFICE''
|  ''PAPERBAG''
|  ''WHOLESALE''
| <tt>25</tt>
| <tt>16.70</tt>
|}
#Review the '''Other Information''' tab, and notice that the '''Allow AP Bill Before Receipt''' check box is selected. This setting, which was specified for the ''PRINTICO'' vendor, means that you can create the accounts payable bill for the purchase order even though the purchase receipt has not yet been entered for the purchase order.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Release from Hold''' to prepare the purchase order for further processing.
#Click '''Save''' on the form toolbar to save the purchase order.

==Step 2: Processing the Accounts Payable Bill==
To create an accounts payable bill for the purchase order, do the following:[anchor|#_9fbacbcf-22ac-415c-ad2c-69f40d4e84f1]
#While you are still viewing the purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, click '''Actions''' > '''Enter AP Bill''' on the form toolbar. The system generates an accounts payable bill (to which it copies the vendor of goods, the details, and other relevant information) and opens the created document on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form.
#Review the details of the created bill. In a production environment, you would make sure that the details of the bill created in the system correspond to the details of the paper document that was received from the vendor.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Release from Hold''' and then click '''Release''' to release the bill.

==Step 3: Processing the Purchase Receipt==
Create the purchase receipt for the purchase order as follows:[anchor|#_5a48f678-622e-4c30-883c-135d7f9a0374]
#Return to the purchase order for ''PRINTICO'' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, which still has a status of ''Open'', and review the '''PO History''' tab. Notice that the details of the bill are shown in the right table.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Enter PO Receipt'''. The system prepares the purchase receipt for the selected purchase order, with all lines and other relevant settings copied, and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form.
#Make sure the purchase receipt has the ''Balanced'' status, save the purchase receipt, and review its details. Notice that on the '''Billing History''' tab, the bill that you have created is listed.
#In the Summary area, make sure the '''Create Bill''' check box is cleared (because you have already created a bill for the entire quantity).
#On the form toolbar, click '''Release'''.
#On the '''Other Information''' tab, click the '''IN Ref. Nbr.''' link, and review the details of the generated inventory receipt, which the system opens on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) form. Make sure the inventory receipt has the ''Released'' status.
#Return to the purchase receipt on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] form, and on the '''Purchase Orders''' tab, review the information about the related purchase order, and make sure it now has a status of ''Closed'', as shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_7c00dcaf-a786-41ca-accd-a83d29fb94c6][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_OrderMgmt_Purchase_Bill_Before_Receipt.png|popup|The closed purchase order |450px]

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Purchases with Billing Before Receipt: Process Activity In this activity, you will learn how to process a purchase of stock items if the                 accounts payable bill from the vendor is received before the goods have been                 delivered. The following activity is             based on the  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system             settings have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the             activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100              dataset to its initial state. Story Suppose that you, acting as the purchasing manager, order a large quantity of labeled                 paper bags and jar labels for SweetLife’s needs. The Wingman Printing Company                 vendor, from which these goods were purchased, sent a bill to SweetLife, which                 received the original paper bill before the goods were delivered to the warehouse of                 the company's main office.

Configuration Overview For the purposes of this activity, the  Inventory  feature, which provides the                 ability to create purchase orders that include stock items, have been enabled on the                       ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS101000) form. The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in                 the system: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors (AP303000) form, the  PRINTICO (Wingman                         Printing Company)  vendor has been configured. The  Allow AP                         Bill Before Receipt  check box has been selected for the vendor                     on the  Purchase Settings  tab. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form, the  PAPERBAG  and                          LABELS  stock items have been configured. Process Overview In this activity, to process a purchase order with billing before the items are                 received, you will first create the purchase order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form and add the purchased items to it.

When the ordered                 items are received, you will create a purchase receipt for them on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form. On release of the purchase receipt,                 the system generates a corresponding inventory receipt to reflect the receipt of the                 items to inventory, which you will review on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) Receipts (IN301000) form. System Preparation Do the following: Launch the  Acumatica ERP             website, and sign in to a company with the  U100  dataset preloaded. To sign in as             a sales and purchasing manager, use the  wiley  login and the  123              password. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to today's date. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date. On the company and branch selection menu, on the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP screen, make sure the  SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center  branch is selected. Step 1: Creating the Purchase Order To create a purchase order that includes labeled paper bags and jar labels for the                 Wingman Printing Company, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form, create a                     purchase order with the following settings: Type :  Normal Vendor :  PRINTICO Description :  Order of labels and paper                                 bags On the  Document Details  tab, add rows with the settings                     listed in the following table. Branch Inventory ID Warehouse Order Qty. Unit Cost HEADOFFICE LABELS WHOLESALE 40 7.49 HEADOFFICE PAPERBAG WHOLESALE 25 16.70 Review the  Other Information  tab, and notice that the                          Allow AP Bill Before Receipt  check box is selected.                     This setting, which was specified for the  PRINTICO  vendor, means that you                     can create the accounts payable bill for the purchase order even though the                     purchase receipt has not yet been entered for the purchase order. On the form toolbar, click  Release from Hold  to prepare                     the purchase order for further processing. Click  Save  on the form toolbar to save the purchase                     order. Step 2: Processing the Accounts Payable Bill To create an accounts payable bill for the purchase order, do the following: While you are still viewing the purchase order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form, click  Actions Enter AP Bill  on the form toolbar. The system generates an accounts payable                     bill (to which it copies the vendor of goods, the details, and other relevant                     information) and opens the created document on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form. Review the details of the created bill. In a production environment, you would                     make sure that the details of the bill created in the system correspond to the                     details of the paper document that was received from the vendor. On                     the form toolbar, click  Release from                     Hold                      and  then                      click  Release  to release the bill. Step 3: Processing the Purchase Receipt Create the purchase receipt for the purchase order as follows: Return to the purchase order for  PRINTICO  on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form, which still has a                     status of  Open , and review the  PO History  tab.                     Notice that the details of the bill are shown in the right table. On the form toolbar, click  Actions Enter PO Receipt . The system prepares the purchase receipt for the selected                     purchase order, with all lines and other relevant settings copied, and opens it                     on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form. Make sure the purchase receipt has the  Balanced  status, save the purchase                     receipt, and review its details. Notice that on the  Billing                         History  tab, the bill that you have created is listed. In the Summary area, make sure the  Create Bill  check box                     is cleared (because you have already created a bill for the entire                     quantity). On the form toolbar, click  Release . On the  Other Information  tab, click the  IN                         Ref. Nbr.  link, and review the details of the generated                     inventory receipt, which the system opens on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) Receipts (IN301000) form. Make sure the                     inventory receipt has the  Released  status. Return to the purchase receipt on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts form, and                     on the  Purchase Orders  tab, review the information about                     the related purchase order, and make sure it now has a status of  Closed ,                     as shown in the following screenshot. The closed purchase order  Self-Test Exercise Process a purchase order with the same settings and to the same vendor with standard                 processing (first create a purchase receipt, and then process an accounts payable                 bill). ]]></column>

Non-stock items in Acumatica ERP, which are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form during implementation, are used to represent products that cannot be stocked in warehouses (such as services or charges) or physical entities whose quantities you do not need to track. If a non-stock item is included in a purchase order, the item’s settings determine whether the item must be included in a corresponding purchase receipt. {br}

The following sections explain how to process a purchase of services that will not be included in corresponding purchase receipts, and which documents are prepared during the processing of the purchase.{br}{TOC}[anchor|#section_fbp_s1x_hlb]
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Enter a purchase order for a purchase of a service that does not need to be included in the applicable purchase receipt
*Prepare an AP bill that corresponds to the purchase order
[anchor|#section_gbp_s1x_hlb]
==Applicable Scenarios==
When you need to purchase services from a vendor, you usually process a purchase order without processing a corresponding receipt. In this case, the purchasing process includes entering a purchase order and preparing a bill to pay the vendor.[anchor|#section_hbp_s1x_hlb]
==Purchase of Services Without a Corresponding Receipt==
In Acumatica ERP, you create a purchase order by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. You use a purchase order of the ''Normal'' type for processing a standard purchase of services.{br}

When you create a new purchase order, you first select the vendor and the ''Normal'' type in the Summary area. Then on the '''Document Details''' tab, you add lines with items and services (including the services that do not need to be included in a purchase receipt) to be purchased from the vendor.{br}

Once the purchased services have been received (that is, provided), you, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form, need to create an AP bill to increase the vendor's balance in the system with amount to be paid for the received services. 
==Workflow of a Purchase of Services Without a Purchase Receipt==[anchor|#section_ibp_s1x_hlb]{br}

When you process a purchase of services without a purchase receipt, the typical processing of a purchase order involves the steps and generated documents shown in the following diagram.{br}

==Story==
Suppose that you, as a purchasing manager for SweetLife Fruit & Jams, urgently need to buy some jars for packing SweetLife’s produced jam, which is sold in the retail store. SweetLife buys these jars (which are tracked as stock items in the system) from Jar Co., which offers free delivery of the jars.[anchor|#section_ynd_2yf_bmb]{br}

You order the jars, but you will not be able to use Jar Co.&rsquo;s regular delivery service because its soonest free delivery is in three days. Because you are in urgent need of the jars, you agree to pay Jar Co. an extra service fee to arrange for delivery by a third party, which you have defined in the system as a service that does not need to be included in a purchase receipt. {br}

Thus, you need to process a purchase order for Jar Co. that includes both the jars (at their normal price) and the expedited delivery service. You also need to process the corresponding purchase receipt (which includes only the jars, because purchased stock items are always included in a purchase receipt) and AP bill (which includes the jars and the expedited delivery service).[anchor|#section_hmc_4qx_hlb]
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, the following prerequisite actions have been performed in the system:
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Inventory'' feature has been enabled.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form, the ''JARCO (Jar Co.)'' vendor has been defined.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, the ''URGDELIVERY (One-time delivery service)'' non-stock item has been defined, and the '''Require Receipt''' check box has been cleared for this item on the '''General Settings''' tab. This indicates that when this item is purchased, it does not need to be included in a purchase receipt.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, the ''JAR96 (Glass jar 96 oz., 24 pcs)'' stock item has been defined. Because stock items are by definition items whose movements are tracked in inventory, when they are purchased, they must be included in the purchase receipt corresponding to the purchase order.
*:((({S:Warn}For details about the process of purchasing stock items, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\OrderMgmt_Standard_Inventory_Purchase_Process_Activity|Standard Inventory Purchases: Process Activity].
)))
[anchor|#section_jmc_4qx_hlb]
==Process Overview==
In this activity, you will create a purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form and add the purchased expedited delivery service and jars to it. Although the service does not need to be included in a purchase receipt, because the jars are stock items, you will process a purchase receipt for them on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form. Then on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form, you will create an AP bill to pay the vendor. [anchor|#section_kmc_4qx_hlb]
==System Preparation==
Do the following:[anchor|#_f811a610-8f11-49fe-9fd6-edb04d0e9b26]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the U100 dataset preloaded. To sign in as a sales and purchasing manager, use the ''wiley'' login and the ''123'' password.[anchor|#_ede4530e-52e9-4e60-b399-e8f65c6660a5]
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to today&rsquo;s date. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.[anchor|#_a420a18b-a903-4544-9aac-6b2b7945e756]
#On the company and branch selection menu, on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, select the ''SweetLife Store'' branch.
[anchor|#section_lmc_4qx_hlb]
==Step 1: Creating a Purchase Order==
To create a purchase order that includes the jars and the expedited delivery service, do the following:[anchor|#_639c6644-42f8-4dc8-8802-bb668aa56d78]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, click '''Add New Record''' on the form toolbar, and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Type''': ''Normal''
#* '''Vendor''': ''JARCO''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Purchase of jars</tt>
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, for each of the rows whose settings are listed below, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the listed settings in the row.

|  ''5''
|  ''30''
|- 
|  ''RETAIL''
|  ''URGDELIVERY''
| 
|  ''1''

|}
#In the Summary area, make sure the '''Hold''' check box is cleared. 
#Save the order, and notice that the system inserts the ''Open'' status.
[anchor|#section_mmc_4qx_hlb]
==Step 2: Processing the Purchase Receipt for the Jars==
Although the ''URGDELIVERY'' non-stock item does not need to be included in a purchase receipt, the purchase order also consists of the ''JAR96'' stock item. When this item is purchased, it needs to be included in the corresponding purchase receipt, because the movements of all stock items are carefully tracked in inventory. Thus, you still need to create a purchase receipt.{br}

Create the purchase receipt for the purchase order as follows:[anchor|#_5a48f678-622e-4c30-883c-135d7f9a0374]
#While you are still viewing the purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, on the form toolbar, click '''Actions &gt; Enter PO Receipt'''. The system prepares the purchase receipt for the selected purchase order and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form.
#Review the purchase receipt.
#:Notice that the line with the ''URGDELIVERY'' service, which had been included in the purchase order, is absent in the purchase receipt. This is because the '''Require Receipt''' check box is cleared for the non-stock item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. [anchor|#_72f0ea4d-e5b2-421b-a3b3-af5eb57aa310]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.
#Review the details of the prepared purchase receipt. Notice that the '''Create Bill''' check box is cleared in the Summary area. (You will create the bill manually in the next step.)
#On the form toolbar, click '''Release'''.
[anchor|#section_kzy_nsr_hlb]
==Step 3: Processing the AP Bill==
Do the following to process the AP bill related to the purchase order:[anchor|#ol_gbz_nsr_hlb]
#Return to the purchase order that you have processed earlier in this activity on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, and on the form toolbar, click '''Actions &gt; Enter AP Bill'''. The system generates an AP bill for the vendor of the goods and shows the created document on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form.
#In the '''Description''' box, enter <tt>Purchase of jars with expedited delivery</tt>.
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box.
# On the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the bill.
#Return to the purchase order for ''PRINTICO'' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form, and review its settings. Notice that the order now has a status of ''Closed'', as shown in the following screenshot. 
#:On the '''PO History''' tab, notice that the left pane lists the purchase receipt that includes an item from this purchase order, and the right pane lists the AP bill that was prepared for the order. The inclusion of these documents on the tab indicates that the purchased jars have been received and the jars and the delivery have been billed in full, so the purchasing process is completed.

You also need to process                 the corresponding purchase receipt (which includes only the jars, because purchased                 stock items are always included in a purchase receipt) and AP bill (which includes                 the jars and the expedited delivery service). Configuration Overview For the purposes of this activity, the following prerequisite actions have been                 performed in the system: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, the  Inventory                      feature has been enabled. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors (AP303000) form, the  JARCO (Jar                         Co.)  vendor has been defined. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form, the  URGDELIVERY                         (One-time delivery service)  non-stock item has been defined, and the                          Require Receipt  check box has been cleared for this                     item on the  General Settings  tab. This indicates that                     when this item is purchased, it does not need to be included in a purchase                     receipt. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form, the  JAR96 (Glass jar                         96 oz., 24 pcs)  stock item has been defined. Because stock items are by                     definition items whose movements are tracked in inventory, when they are                     purchased, they must be included in the purchase receipt corresponding to the                     purchase order. For details about the process of purchasing stock items,                         see  Standard Inventory Purchases: Process Activity. Process Overview In this activity, you will create a purchase order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form and add the purchased expedited                 delivery service and jars to it. Although the service does not need to be included                 in a purchase receipt, because the jars are stock items, you will process a purchase                 receipt for them on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form. Then on the                       ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form, you will create an AP bill to                 pay the vendor.  System Preparation Do the following: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the U100 dataset preloaded. To sign in                     as a sales and purchasing manager, use the  wiley  login and the  123                      password. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to today's date. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date. On the company and branch selection menu, on the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP screen, select the  SweetLife Store  branch. Step 1: Creating a Purchase Order To create a purchase order that includes the jars and the expedited delivery service,                 do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form, click  Add New                         Record  on the form toolbar, and specify the following settings                     in the Summary area: Type :  Normal Vendor :  JARCO Description :  Purchase of                                 jars On the  Document Details  tab, for each of the rows whose                     settings are listed below, click  Add Row  on the table                     toolbar, and specify the listed settings in the row. Branch Inventory ID Warehouse Order Qty.  Unit Cost RETAIL JAR96 RETAIL 5 30 RETAIL URGDELIVERY 1 20 In the Summary area, make sure the  Hold  check box is                     cleared.  Save the order, and notice that the system inserts the  Open  status. Step 2: Processing the Purchase Receipt for the Jars Although the  URGDELIVERY  non-stock item does not need to be included in a                 purchase receipt, the purchase order also consists of the  JAR96  stock item.                 When this item is purchased, it needs to be included in the corresponding purchase                 receipt, because the movements of all stock items are carefully tracked in                 inventory. Thus, you still need to create a purchase receipt. Create the purchase receipt for the purchase order as follows: While you are still viewing the purchase order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form, on the form toolbar, click  Actions > Enter PO Receipt . The system prepares the purchase receipt for the selected                     purchase order and opens it on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000)                     form. Review the purchase receipt. Notice that the line with the  URGDELIVERY                          service, which had been included in the purchase order, is absent in the                         purchase receipt.                          This                         is because the  Require Receipt  check box is cleared                         for the non-stock item on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000)                         form.  On the form toolbar, click  Save . Review the details of the prepared purchase receipt. Notice that the                          Create Bill  check box is cleared in the Summary area.                     (You will create the bill manually in the next step.) On the form toolbar, click  Release . Step 3: Processing the AP Bill Do the following to process the AP bill related to the purchase order: Return to the purchase order that you have processed earlier in this activity on                     the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form, and on the form toolbar,                     click  Actions > Enter AP Bill . The system generates an AP bill for the vendor of the goods and                     shows the created document on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000)                     form. In the  Description  box, enter  Purchase of jars                         with expedited delivery . In the Summary area, clear the  Hold  check box.  On the form toolbar, click  Release  to release the                     bill. Return to the purchase order for  PRINTICO  on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form, and review its settings. Notice that the                     order now has a status of  Closed , as shown in the following screenshot.                          On the  PO History  tab, notice that the left pane                         lists the purchase receipt that includes an item from this purchase order,                         and the right pane lists the AP bill that was prepared for the order. The                         inclusion of these documents on the tab indicates that the purchased jars                         have been received and the jars and the delivery have been billed in full,                         so the purchasing process is completed. The corresponding purchase receipt and AP bill for the closed                                 purchase order ]]></column>

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
A point-of-sale (POS) system is an electronic system that is used to record the sales, payment, and return transactions of a retail store. The POS system can be operated by a cashier or can be a self-service terminal where customers perform all operations. Your organization can integrate Acumatica ERP with an external POS system for simplified processing of direct sales if the ''Advanced SO Invoices'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

With a ''direct sale'', a customer purchases and immediately procures goods and services in the retail store. These purchased items may or may not be linked to a sales order that the customer has placed previously. In the POS system, a direct sale is processed through the creation of an SO invoice on the [https://help-2019r2.acumatica.com/(W(2))/Wiki/ShowWiki|Invoices] (SO303000) form. The processing of the SO invoice records the sale and updates inventory without a sales order and a shipment being processed.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Create an SO invoice for a direct sale
*Add to the SO invoice a sale line not linked to a previously prepared sales order
*Add to the SO invoice a line with a link to a previously prepared sales order
*Process the direct sale to completion

==Applicable Scenarios==
You create and process an SO invoice in the following cases:[anchor|#_97ad2036-c425-49f4-9f67-8c2bd7a2a706]
*The customer comes to the retail store, purchases goods, and directly procures the items, so that you need to process a direct sale through the POS system. In this case, you create and process only the SO invoice; there is no need to process a related shipment or sales order. 
*The customer picks up all or a part of items included in a sales order that has been added to the system based on a phone or online sale. In this case, you need to process a direct sale through the POS system by linking the SO invoice you create to the related sales order. 

==Direct Sale Process==
To process a direct sale, you create an SO invoice of the ''Invoice'' type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form. To the SO invoice, you add a line for each item included in the sale, and specify the quantity of items to be sold. For serialized items, you should add a separate invoice line with this item and a quantity of 1 for each serial number.{br}

To release the SO invoice, you click '''Actions''' > '''Release''' on the form toolbar. This causes the system to automatically generate a batch of general ledger transactions, as well as an inventory issue for the stock items. For sales lines in the SO invoice, the system adds to the inventory issue lines with the ''Invoice'' transaction type. Also, when you release the SO invoice, the related AR invoice becomes available for review and further processing on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form. On release of the generated inventory issue, a batch of GL transactions is generated.
==Workflow of a Direct Sale==
For an SO invoice created for processing a direct sale, the typical processing involves the actions and generated documents shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#_289a7ce2-cd9a-455f-a1c3-28e09c923dfc][anchor|#_3af062fe-0d5a-4426-87cd-a0bfc35e12db][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_OrderMgmt_Direct_Sales.png|popup|400px]]]></column>
			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Direct Sales: General Information A point-of-sale (POS) system is an electronic system that is used to record the sales,         payment, and return transactions of a retail store. The POS system can be operated by a         cashier or can be a self-service terminal where customers perform all operations. Your         organization can integrate  Acumatica ERP with an external POS system for simplified processing of direct sales if the  Advanced           SO Invoices  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000)         form. With a  direct sale , a customer purchases and immediately procures goods and services         in the retail store. These purchased items may or may not be linked to a sales order that         the customer has placed previously. In the POS system, a direct sale is processed through         the creation of an SO invoice on the  Invoices Invoices (SO303000) form. The processing of the SO         invoice records the sale and updates inventory without a sales order and a shipment being         processed. Learning Objectives In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following: Create an SO invoice for a direct sale Add to the SO invoice a sale line not linked to a previously prepared sales order Add to the SO invoice a line with a link to a previously prepared sales order Process the direct sale to completion Applicable Scenarios You create and process an SO invoice in the following cases: The customer comes to the retail store, purchases goods, and directly procures the           items, so that you need to process a direct sale through the POS system. In this case, you           create and process only the SO invoice; there is no need to process a related shipment or           sales order.  The customer picks up all or a part of items included in a sales order that has been           added to the system based on a phone or online sale. In this case, you need to process a           direct sale through the POS system by linking the SO invoice you create to the related           sales order.  Direct Sale Process To process a direct sale, you create an SO invoice of the  Invoice  type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form. To the SO invoice, you add a line for each item         included in the sale, and specify the quantity of items to be sold. For serialized items,         you should add a separate invoice line with this item and a quantity of 1 for each serial         number. To release the SO invoice, you click  Actions Release   on the form toolbar. This causes the system to automatically generate a         batch of general ledger transactions, as well as an inventory issue for the stock items. For         sales lines in the SO invoice, the system adds to the inventory issue lines with the            Invoice  transaction type. Also, when you release the SO invoice, the related AR         invoice becomes available for review and further processing on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form. On release of the generated inventory issue, a         batch of GL transactions is generated. Workflow of a Direct Sale For an SO invoice created for processing a direct sale, the typical processing involves the     actions and generated documents shown in the following diagram. ]]></column>

The customer may want to pick up in the retail store all or a part of items included in a sales order that has been added to the system based on a phone or online sale. In this case, you need to process a direct sale through the POS system with a link to the related sales order to record in the system that some of the items from the order have been taken by the customer.{br}

To process a direct sale, you create an SO invoice on the [https://help-2019r2.acumatica.com/(W(2))/Wiki/ShowWiki|Invoices] ([https://help-2019r2.acumatica.com//?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form. If the customer is picking up items as recorded in a sales order that has already been added to the system, you can add a sales line in a direct sale document that you create on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] form with a link to this sales order. {br}{TOC}
==Linking a Direct Sale Line to a Sales Order==
To add a line (or multiple lines) linked to a sales order, you click the '''Add SO Line''' button on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] form. In the dialog box that opens, you select the line or lines of one or multiple open sales orders to be added to the SO invoice. The details of the added line or lines are filled in automatically by the system and are not available for editing. The reference number of the sales order to which a line is linked is shown in the '''Order Nbr.''' column of the line.{br}

If a line of the SO invoice is linked to an open line of a sales order, the released SO invoice functions as a shipment does for the linked sales order line: On release of the SO invoice, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, the system updates '''Shipped Qty.''' of the sales order line ('''Document Details''' tab) by the quantity specified in the invoice line. Also, on the '''Shipments''' tab of this form, the system inserts the reference number of the SO invoice in the '''Shipment Nbr.''' box.]]></column>

==Story==
Suppose that on January 29, 2020, an individual customer (that is, a customer purchasing items for personal use rather than for a company) ordered five small jars of apple jam and 15 pounds of oranges on the company’s website, and selected the option to pick up these items and pay for them in the SweetLife retail store. When the customer submitted the order on the website, a sales order was created in Acumatica ERP.{br}

Then on January 30, 2020, the customer comes to SweetLife store and picks up ordered apple jam (five small jars) from the store shelves; the customer also picks up one small jar of orange jam (which was not in the online sales order). For the remainder of the website order, the customer asks to have the items shipped to the customer&rsquo;s address. The sales manager of the SweetLife store needs to scan the goods that the customer has picked up, enter them by using the POS terminal, and collect payment from the customer. After the customer pays for the picked goods, the sales manager needs to give him a receipt. You will act as the sales manager in performing the needed actions in the system.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, the following features have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form: [anchor|#_cd1bdea4-c69d-457c-88c1-bc3675beccc2]
*''Inventory'', which provides the ability to create sales and purchase orders that include stock items
*''Advanced SO Invoices'', which provides support for direct sales and returns and integration with POS systems

In the SweetLife store, the integration between the store’s POS system and Acumatica ERP has been configured to work as follows: [anchor|#ul_mtf_ytl_ljb]
*When the sales manager processes a sale through the POS system, the POS system creates two documents in Acumatica ERP by using the API: an SO invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form with all the lines from the receipt given to the customer, and a released payment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_20_00|Payments and Applications] ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) form that is linked to the SO invoice.
*If any lines of a direct sale relate to an existing sales order, the POS operator selects the needed lines directly via the POS terminal when processing a sale. 
*:((({S:Warn}In this activity, to simulate the POS functionality that occurs in a production system, you will link lines of an existing sales order to lines of the SO invoice.
)))
*When the sales manager releases the SO invoice, Acumatica ERP creates an inventory issue that decreases the quantities of items in inventory by the quantity of the sold items.
{br}

The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in the system:[anchor|#ul_opx_yl5_dlb]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form, the ''RETSALE (Individual Retail Customer)'' customer has been defined. This is the customer account used to represent any individual customer making a retail purchase in the store.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, the ''APJAM08'', ''ORANGES'', and ''ORJAM08'' stock items have been defined. In the ''RETAIL'' warehouse, which has been configured on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form, sufficient quantities of the ''APJAM08'', ''ORJAM08'', and ''ORANGES'' items are on hand.

==Process Overview==
In this activity, to process a direct sale with a link to a sales order, you will create a payment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_20_00|Payments and Applications] ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) form that will later be applied to the SO invoice used to record the direct sale. Then you will create this SO invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form. You will add the appropriate lines to the SO invoice. Then you will apply the payment to the SO invoice and release the SO invoice.
==System Preparation==
Do the following:[anchor|#_f811a610-8f11-49fe-9fd6-edb04d0e9b26]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded. To sign in as a sales manager, use the ''becher'' login and the ''123'' password.[anchor|#_6c5eefb3-f27b-47fc-be51-79916424ccdc]
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select ''1/30/2020'' on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.

==Step 1: Preparing a Payment==
To prepare a payment document that represents the customer&rsquo;s payment for the direct sale, perform the following instructions:[anchor|#_d9139265-2763-4358-acbf-a94c591cc36b]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_20_00|Payments and Applications] ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) form, create a payment with the following settings:
#*'''Type''': ''Payment''
#* '''Customer''': ''RETSALE''
#* '''Payment Method''': ''CASH''
#* '''Cash Account''': ''10100ST''
#* '''Application Date''': ''1/30/2020''
#* '''Application Period''': ''01-2020''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Payment for retail sale</tt>
#*'''Payment Amount''': <tt>26.34</tt>
#*'''Hold''': Cleared
#On the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the payment.
((({S:Warn}You could instead enter the SO invoice prior to entering a payment.
)))
==Step 2: Entering an SO Invoice==
To enter an SO invoice to record the direct sale, do the following:[anchor|#_595b18fd-8273-4024-8500-13ce98b266e4]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form, create the SO invoice, and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Type''': ''Invoice''
#* '''Customer''': ''RETSALE''
#* '''Date''': ''1/30/2020''
#* '''Post Period''': ''01-2020''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Retail sale, website order #00687 partial</tt>
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, add a row for the jar of orange jam the customer picks up in the retail store, and specify the following settings:
#*'''Inventory ID''': ''ORJAM08''
#* '''Warehouse''': ''RETAIL''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>1</tt>
#*'''Unit Price''': <tt>3.44</tt>
#To add a line for the jars of apple jam in the already-entered sales order, on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab, click '''Add SO Line'''.
#In the '''Add SO Line''' dialog box, which opens, select the unlabeled check box in the line with ''APJAM08'' item, and click '''Add & Close'''. 
#:The system adds the line to the SO invoice with a link to the sales order on which the item was added. Notice that in the '''Order Type''' and '''Order Nbr.''' columns in this line, the system has inserted the type of the related sales order and the link to the order. In the other line that you have added, these columns are empty thus indicating that this line is not related to a sales order.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Release from Hold'''; the invoice now has the ''Balanced'' status.[anchor|#_55320e12-566c-4f1c-8da7-100b877a995d]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.
[anchor|#_1a4f2844-ef95-4cac-ab1b-e98f5fed907b]
==Step 3: Applying the Payment to Invoice==
To apply the payment to the invoice, do the following while you are still viewing the invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form:[anchor|#_a3b910fe-ec5e-4b46-8455-fc40eb9ecced]
#On the table toolbar of the '''Applications''' tab, click '''Load Documents'''. The system adds a line with the payment that you have created earlier in this activity.
#In the '''Amount Paid''' column, specify <tt>26.34</tt> (which is the payment amount to be applied to the invoice).[anchor|#_4d45b68d-4732-439e-aa85-af959dd29fb4]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

==Step 4: Releasing the SO Invoice==
To release the invoice, do the following:[anchor|#_0862cfb1-0cf1-40c4-ace9-4dcd2417192e]
#While you are still viewing the SO invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form, click '''Actions''' > '''Release''' on the form toolbar. Notice that the invoice now has a status of ''Closed''.
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, in either of the invoice lines, click the link in the '''Inventory Ref. Nbr.''' column. The system opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form with the inventory issue that was generated on release of the SO invoice.
#On this form, review the details of the inventory issue, and make sure that it includes both invoice lines, and it has a status of ''Released''.
#Return to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form with the SO invoice that you have processed, and on the '''Document Details''' tab, click the '''Order Nbr.''' link in the ''APJAM08'' line to open the related sales order.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, which is opened, review its details. On the '''Document Details''' tab, in the ''APJAM08'' line, notice that '''Qty. on Shipments''' is 5 and the '''Open Qty.''' is 0, which means that the line was shipped in full.
#Review the '''Shipments''' tab. The processed SO invoice acts as a shipment for the related SO line with ''APJAM08'' item (see the following screenshot): On release of the SO invoice, the inventory issue that records the issuing of the items from inventory has been generated and released. The sales order retains a status of ''Open''; the sales manager can process a shipment for the rest of the items to the customer&rsquo;s location.[anchor|#_3854aaf0-b0fc-48d9-be8b-851265eff91d][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_OrderMgmtBasic_Direct_Sales.png|popup|Partial shipment of the sales order via the SO invoice|450px]

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Direct Sales: Process Activity In this activity, you will learn how to process a direct sale through a point-of-sale                 (POS) terminal, and how to link an existing sales order to the direct sale. The following activity is             based on the  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system             settings have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the             activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100              dataset to its initial state. Story Suppose that on January 29,  2020, an individual                  customer                  (that is, a customer purchasing items for personal use rather than for a company)                 ordered five small jars of apple jam and 15 pounds of oranges on the company’s                 website, and selected the option to pick up these items and pay for them in the                 SweetLife retail store. When the customer submitted the order on the website, a                 sales order was created in  Acumatica ERP. Then on January 30,  2020, the customer comes to SweetLife store and picks up ordered apple jam (five small                 jars) from the store shelves; the customer also picks up one small jar of orange jam                 (which was not in the online sales order). For the remainder of the website order,                 the customer asks to have the items shipped to the customer's address. The sales                 manager of the SweetLife store needs to scan the goods that the customer has picked                 up, enter them by using the POS terminal, and collect payment from the customer.                 After the customer pays for the picked goods, the sales manager needs to give him a                 receipt. You will act as the sales manager in performing the needed actions in the                 system. Configuration Overview For the purposes of this activity, the following features have been enabled on the                       ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS101000) form:  Inventory , which provides the ability to create sales and purchase orders                     that include stock items Advanced SO Invoices , which provides support for direct sales and returns                     and integration with POS systems In the SweetLife store, the integration between the store’s POS system and  Acumatica ERP has been configured to work as follows:  When the sales manager processes a sale through the POS system, the POS                         system creates two documents in  Acumatica ERP by using the API: an SO invoice on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices                         (SO303000) form with all the lines from the receipt given to the customer,                         and a released payment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) Payments and Applications (AR302000)                         form that is linked to the SO invoice. If any lines of a direct sale relate to an existing sales order, the POS                         operator selects the needed lines directly via the POS terminal when                         processing a sale.  In this activity, to simulate the POS functionality                             that occurs in a production system, you will link lines of an existing                             sales order to lines of the SO invoice. When the sales manager releases the SO invoice,  Acumatica ERP creates an inventory issue that decreases the quantities of items in                         inventory by the quantity of the sold items. The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in                 the system: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000) form, the  RETSALE                         (Individual Retail Customer)  customer has been defined. This is the                     customer account used to represent any individual customer making a retail                     purchase in the store. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form, the  APJAM08 ,                          ORANGES , and  ORJAM08  stock items have been defined. In the                          RETAIL  warehouse, which has been configured on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses (IN204000) form, sufficient quantities of the                          APJAM08 ,  ORJAM08 , and  ORANGES  items are on hand. Process Overview In this activity, to process a direct sale with a link to a sales order, you will                 create a payment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) Payments and Applications (AR302000) form that will                 later be applied to the SO invoice used to record the direct sale. Then you will                 create this SO invoice on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form. You                 will add the appropriate lines to the SO invoice. Then you will apply the payment to                 the SO invoice and release the SO invoice. System Preparation Do the following: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the  U100  dataset preloaded. To                     sign in as a sales manager, use the  becher  login and the  123                      password. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP             screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to  1/30/2020. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and             select  1/30/2020 on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and             process all documents in the system during this business date. Step 1: Preparing a Payment To prepare a payment document that represents the customer's payment for the direct                 sale, perform the following instructions: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) Payments and Applications (AR302000) form, create a                     payment with the following settings: Type :  Payment Customer :  RETSALE Payment Method :  CASH Cash Account :  10100ST Application Date :  1/30/2020Application Period :  01- 2020Description :  Payment for retail                                 sale Payment Amount :  26.34 Hold : Cleared On the form toolbar, click  Release  to release the                     payment. You could instead enter the SO invoice prior to entering a payment. Step 2: Entering an SO Invoice To enter an SO invoice to record the direct sale, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form, create the SO invoice,                     and specify the following settings in the Summary area: Type :  Invoice Customer :  RETSALE Date :  1/30/2020Post Period :  01- 2020Description :  Retail sale, website                                 order #00687 partial On the  Document Details  tab, add a row for the jar of                     orange jam the customer picks up in the retail store, and specify the following                         settings: Inventory ID :  ORJAM08 Warehouse :  RETAIL Quantity :  1 Unit Price :  3.44 To add a line for the jars of apple jam in the already-entered sales order, on                     the table toolbar of the  Document Details  tab, click                          Add SO Line . In the  Add SO Line  dialog box, which opens, select the                     unlabeled check box in the line with  APJAM08  item, and click                          Add & Close .  The system adds the line to the                         SO invoice with a link to the sales order on which the item was added.                         Notice that in the  Order Type  and  Order                             Nbr.  columns in this line, the system has inserted the type                         of the related sales order and the link to the order. In the other line that                         you have added, these columns are empty thus indicating that this line is                         not related to a sales order. On the form toolbar, click  Release from Hold ; the invoice                     now has the  Balanced  status. On the form toolbar, click  Save . Step 3: Applying the Payment to Invoice To apply the payment to the invoice, do the following while you are still viewing the                 invoice on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form: On the table toolbar of the  Applications  tab, click                          Load Documents . The system adds a line with the                     payment that you have created earlier in this activity. In the  Amount Paid  column, specify                          26.34  (which is the payment amount to be applied to                     the invoice). On the form toolbar, click  Save . Step 4: Releasing the SO Invoice To release the invoice, do the following: While you are still viewing the SO invoice on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form, click  Actions Release  on the form toolbar. Notice that the invoice now has a status of                          Closed . On the  Document Details  tab, in either of the invoice                     lines, click the link in the  Inventory Ref. Nbr.  column.                     The system opens the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) Issues (IN302000) form with the                     inventory issue that was generated on release of the SO invoice. On this form, review the details of the inventory issue, and make sure that it                     includes both invoice lines, and it has a status of  Released . Return to the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form with the SO                     invoice that you have processed, and on the  Document                         Details  tab, click the  Order Nbr.  link in                     the  APJAM08  line to open the related sales order. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, which is opened, review                     its details. On the  Document Details  tab, in the                          APJAM08  line, notice that  Qty. on Shipments  is                     5 and the  Open Qty.  is 0, which means that the line was                     shipped in full. Review the  Shipments  tab. The processed SO invoice acts                     as a shipment for the related SO line with  APJAM08  item (see the                     following screenshot): On release of the SO invoice, the inventory issue that                     records the issuing of the items from inventory has been generated and released.                     The sales order retains a status of  Open ; the sales manager can process a                     shipment for the rest of the items to the customer's location. Partial shipment of the sales order via the SO invoice Self-Test Exercise Process to completion the sales order that you have partially completed in this                 lesson by creating and processing one more SO invoice. ]]></column>

A point-of-sale (POS) system is an electronic system that is used to record the sales, payment, and return transactions of a retail store. The POS system can be operated by a cashier or can be a self-service terminal where customers perform all operations. Your organization can integrate Acumatica ERP with an external POS system for simplified processing of direct returns if the ''Advanced SO Invoices'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

With a ''direct return'', a customer returns stock items directly to the retail store rather than shipping them. In the POS system, a direct return is processed through the creation of an SO credit memo—a sales-related document of the ''Credit Memo'' type created on the [https://help-2019r2.acumatica.com/(W(2))/Wiki/ShowWiki|Invoices] (SO303000) form. {br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#_850a7c03-5296-4078-80f5-d254f48ef705]
*Create an SO credit memo for a direct return
*Add to the SO credit memo a return line with a link to an original sales document
*Add to the SO credit memo a replacement line 
*Process the direct return to completion

==Applicable Scenarios==
You create and process a direct return in the following cases:[anchor|#_252df15b-523e-4658-a699-0048b4ba91dc]
*When the customer returns goods directly at the store. In this case, you process an SO credit memo in the system.
*When the customer returns goods directly at the store and requests the replacement of returned items. In this case, you process either an SO credit memo or an SO invoice, and the document includes both return lines and replacement (sales) lines.

==Direct Return Process==
You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form to enter an SO credit memo, and you add a line for each returned or replaced item. To add a line (or multiple lines) with a link to related SO invoice, you click '''Add Return Line''' on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab. In the dialog box that opens, you select the invoice line or lines to be added as return lines to the document you are creating. In the added line, you can correct the quantity to be returned if partial return of the item quantity is requested (for example, if four units of the item were purchased and the customer is returning only two). For serialized items, you should add a separate line with this item and a quantity of 1 for each serial number.{br}

To release the SO credit memo, you click '''Actions''' > '''Release''' on the form toolbar. This causes the system to automatically generate a batch of general ledger transaction, as well as an inventory issue for the stock items. For return lines, the system adds to the inventory issue lines with the ''Credit Memo'' transaction type. On release of the generated inventory issue, the items are received to inventory, and a batch of GL transactions is generated.{br}

 Also, when you release the SO credit memo, the related AR credit memo becomes available for review and further processing on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form. 
==Workflow of a Direct Return==
For an SO credit memo created for processing a direct return, the typical processing involves the actions and generated documents shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#_289a7ce2-cd9a-455f-a1c3-28e09c923dfc][anchor|#_3af062fe-0d5a-4426-87cd-a0bfc35e12db][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_OrderMgmt_Direct_Returns.png|popup|400px]]]></column>

To add a line (or multiple lines) with a         link to related SO invoice, you click  Add Return Line  on the table         toolbar of the  Document Details  tab. In the dialog box that opens,         you select the invoice line or lines to be added as return lines to the document you are         creating. In the added line, you can correct the quantity to be returned if partial return         of the item quantity is requested (for example, if four units of the item were purchased and         the customer is returning only two). For serialized items, you should add a separate line         with this item and a quantity of 1 for each serial number. To release the SO credit memo, you click  Actions Release  on the form toolbar. This causes the system to automatically generate a batch         of general ledger transaction, as well as an inventory issue for the stock items. For return         lines, the system adds to the inventory issue lines with the  Credit Memo  transaction         type. On release of the generated inventory issue, the items are received to inventory, and         a batch of GL transactions is generated.  Also, when you release the SO credit memo, the related AR credit memo becomes available         for review and further processing on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form.        Workflow of a Direct Return For an SO credit memo created for processing a direct return, the typical processing         involves the actions and generated documents shown in the following diagram. ]]></column>

If a customer returns stock items directly to the retail store and requests for the exact replacement of these items, you can process both return and replacement in a single document.{br}{TOC}
==Processing Direct Return with Replacement==
To process a direct return with replacement, you create an SO invoice or SO credit memo on the [https://help-2019r2.acumatica.com/(W(2))/Wiki/ShowWiki|Invoices] ([https://help-2019r2.acumatica.com//?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form, and add to the document the lines with items to be returned and the lines with items for replacement.{br}

In the created document, return and replacement lines will have different signs. In an SO credit memo, return lines have quantities with positive sign, and replacement lines have quantities with negative sign. In an SO invoice, return lines have quantities with negative sign, and replacement lines have quantities with positive sign. You must select the type of the document for processing a direct return for replacement so that the total balance of the document will be equal to zero or above zero.{br}

When the SO invoice or SO credit memo is released, the system generates an inventory issue transaction to update the item information in inventory. The inventory operation to be specified in the inventory issue is generated on the line level. For a replacement line, an inventory issue line with the ''Invoice'' type is generated to issue the replacement item from inventory. For a return line, an inventory issue line with the ''Credit Memo'' type is generated to return an item to inventory.{br}

Also, on release of the SO invoice or SO credit memo, the related AR invoice or AR credit memo, respectively, becomes available for review and further processing on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form.]]></column>

==Story==
Suppose that on January 30, 2020, an employee of the small retail customer FourStar Coffee & Sweets Shop has come to the SweetLife store and asked for an exact replacement of a large jar of apple jam that is leaking. This jar is one of ten jars that were bought two days ago, on January 28, 2020.{br}

Acting as the sales manager of the SweetLife company, you need to process the return of the jar and the sale of the new jar by using the POS terminal. The previous sale, dated January 28, 2020, was recorded through the SO invoice (created automatically through the integration of the POS system and Acumatica ERP), which was paid in full and now has the ''Closed'' status. You need to replace the inventory item with the same item at the same price, so that no payment needs to be processed.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, the following features have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form:[anchor|#_cd1bdea4-c69d-457c-88c1-bc3675beccc2]
*''Inventory'', which provides the ability to create sales and purchase orders that include stock items
*''Advanced SO Invoices'', which provides support for direct sales and returns and integration with POS systems

In the SweetLife store, the integration between the store’s POS system and Acumatica ERP has been configured to work as follows:[anchor|#ul_mtf_ytl_ljb]
*When the sales manager processes a return through the POS system, the POS system creates an SO credit memo with the item or items being returned on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form.
*If any lines of a direct return relate to an existing sales order, the POS operator selects the needed order directly via the terminal when processing a return. 
*:((({S:Warn}In this activity, to simulate the POS functionality that occurs in a production system, you will add a return line with a link to the original SO invoice.
)))
*To process a replacement, the sales manager adds to this SO credit memo a line with the same inventory item or items and a quantity with the opposite sign.
*When the sales manager releases the SO credit memo, Acumatica ERP creates an inventory issue that includes two lines with different operation types: one line adds the returned item or items to inventory, and another line issues the replacement item or items from inventory.

The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in the system:[anchor|#ul_rld_ypz_dlb]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form, the ''COFFEESHOP'' customer has been defined.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, the ''APJAM96'' stock item has been defined. In the ''RETAIL'' warehouse, which has been defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form, a sufficient quantity of the ''APJAM96'' item is on hand for the processing of the return in this activity.

Additionally, the SO invoice for which you will process a return has been entered into the system on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] form.
==Process Overview==
In this activity, to handle a direct return, you will create an SO credit memo on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form. You will add the appropriate lines to the SO credit memo, some of which are linked to the original sales order and some of which are for replacement items and have a negative quantity. Then you will release the invoice to process both the receipt of returned items to inventory and the issue of replacement items from inventory.
==System Preparation==
Do the following:[anchor|#_f811a610-8f11-49fe-9fd6-edb04d0e9b26]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded. To sign in as a sales manager, use the ''becher'' login and the ''123'' password.[anchor|#_46d17ec3-e8ab-47f0-8bdf-d07f1fa6c290]
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select ''1/30/2020'' on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.

==Step 1: Entering a Credit Memo==
To enter an SO credit memo, do the following:[anchor|#_96dfb08a-be06-4b83-a33c-252a788181c2]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form, create a credit memo, and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Type''': ''Credit Memo''
#* '''Customer''': ''COFFEESHOP''
#* '''Date''': ''1/30/2020''
#* '''Post Period''': ''01-2020''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Replacement of the leaked jar</tt>
#Save the credit memo; notice that it has the ''Balanced'' status.

==Step 2: Adding the Return Line==
To add a line with the item to be returned, perform the following instructions while you are still viewing the SO credit memo on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form:[anchor|#_a64f7d72-d1b1-46b4-99bd-e6f8bed225e9]
#On the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab, click '''Add Return Line'''. The '''Add Return Line''' dialog box opens.
#In the dialog box, select the unlabeled check box in the line dated ''1/28/2020'' with the ''APJAM96'' item, and click '''Add & Close'''. The system adds the return line to the credit memo and closes the dialog box.
#In the line added to the credit memo, change the '''Quantity''' to <tt>1</tt> (because only one of the jars is being returned). In the '''Orig. Inv. Nbr.''' column in the line, notice that the system has inserted the reference number of the original invoice for which the return is being performed.

==Step 3: Adding the Replacement Line==
While you are still viewing the SO credit memo on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form, add the line with the replacement item as follows:[anchor|#_8b3316eb-2601-4997-bfbe-9853579b6ac1]
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, add one more line (for the replacement item) with the following settings:
#*'''Inventory ID''': ''APJAM96''
#* '''Warehouse''': ''RETAIL''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>-1</tt>
#*:The quantity is negative because the item is to be issued from inventory.
#*'''Unit Price''': <tt>45.15</tt> (the same as in the line with the item being returned)[anchor|#_4b377204-5453-49b2-8f27-f03c3b370d26]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

==Step 4: Releasing the Credit Memo==
To release the credit memo, do the following:[anchor|#_fe8089fc-c7f8-40c5-a208-83ea9e08502d]
#While you are still viewing the credit memo on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form, on the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Release'''. 
#:Notice that the status of the credit memo is now ''Closed''. On release of the credit memo, the returned item has been received to inventory, and the replacement item has been issued from inventory. Because the price of the returned item was the same as the price of the replacement item, the credit memo total is ''0.00''; thus, no payment needs to be processed.
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, in either of the lines, click the link in the '''Inventory Ref. Nbr.''' column. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form, the system opens the inventory issue that was generated on release of the credit memo.
#On this form, review the details of the inventory issue, and make sure the inventory issue has the ''Released'' status, as shown in the following screenshot. Notice that the line with the returned item has the ''Credit Memo'' transaction type, while the line with the replacement item has the ''Invoice'' transaction type.[anchor|#_a2892803-1e70-4efe-b547-527b90d4b756][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_OrderMgmtBasic_Direct_Returns.png|popup|Inventory document generated for processing the direct return|450px]

==Self-Test Exercise==
For the same original invoice, process a direct return of one ''APJAM96'' item and one ''ORJAM96'' item, and a sale of two ''ORJAM08'' items through a single SO invoice.]]></column>

In this activity, to simulate the POS functionality that occurs in                         a production system, you will add a return line with a link to the original                         SO invoice. To process a replacement, the sales manager adds to this SO credit memo a line                     with the same inventory item or items and a quantity with the opposite                     sign. When the sales manager releases the SO credit memo,  Acumatica ERP creates an inventory issue that includes two lines with different operation                     types: one line adds the returned item or items to inventory, and another line                     issues the replacement item or items from inventory. The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in                 the system: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000) form, the  COFFEESHOP                      customer has been defined. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form, the  APJAM96  stock                     item has been defined. In the  RETAIL  warehouse, which has been defined on                     the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses (IN204000) form, a sufficient quantity of                     the  APJAM96  item is on hand for the processing of the return in this                     activity. Additionally, the SO invoice for which you will process a return has been entered                 into the system on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices form. Process Overview In this activity, to handle a direct return, you will create an SO credit memo on the                       ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form.

Then you                 will release the invoice to process both the receipt of returned items to inventory                 and the issue of replacement items from inventory. System Preparation Do the following: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the  U100  dataset preloaded. To                     sign in as a sales manager, use the  becher  login and the  123                      password. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP             screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to  1/30/2020. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and             select  1/30/2020 on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and             process all documents in the system during this business date. Step 1: Entering a Credit Memo To enter an SO credit memo, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form, create a credit memo,                     and specify the following settings in the Summary area: Type :  Credit Memo Customer :  COFFEESHOP Date :  1/30/2020Post Period :  01- 2020Description :  Replacement of the leaked                                 jar Save the credit memo; notice that it has the  Balanced  status. Step 2: Adding the Return Line To add a line with the item to be returned, perform the following instructions while                 you are still viewing the SO credit memo on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices                 (SO303000) form: On the table toolbar of the  Document Details  tab, click                          Add Return Line . The  Add Return                         Line  dialog box opens. In the dialog box, select the unlabeled check box in the line dated  1/28/ 2020 with the  APJAM96  item, and click  Add &                         Close . The system adds the return line to the credit memo and                     closes the dialog box. In the line added to the credit memo, change the  Quantity                      to  1  (because only one of the jars is being returned). In                     the  Orig. Inv. Nbr.  column in the line, notice that the                     system has inserted the reference number of the original invoice for which the                     return is being performed. Step 3: Adding the Replacement Line While you are still viewing the SO credit memo on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices                 (SO303000) form, add the line with the replacement item as follows: On the  Document Details  tab, add one more line (for the                     replacement item) with the following settings: Inventory ID :  APJAM96 Warehouse :  RETAIL Quantity :  -1 The                                 quantity is negative because the item is to be issued from                                 inventory. Unit Price :  45.15  (the                             same as in the line with the item being returned) On the form toolbar, click  Save . Step 4: Releasing the Credit Memo To release the credit memo, do the following: While you are still viewing the credit memo on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form, on the form toolbar, click  Actions Release .  Notice that the status of the credit memo is now                              Closed . On release of the credit memo, the returned item has been                         received to inventory, and the replacement item has been issued from                         inventory. Because the price of the returned item was the same as the price                         of the replacement item, the credit memo total is  0.00 ; thus, no                         payment needs to be processed. On the  Document Details  tab, in either of the lines,                     click the link in the  Inventory Ref. Nbr.  column. On the                           ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) Issues (IN302000) form, the system opens the                     inventory issue that was generated on release of the credit memo. On this form, review the details of the inventory issue, and make sure the                     inventory issue has the  Released  status, as shown in the following                     screenshot. Notice that the line with the returned item has the  Credit                         Memo  transaction type, while the line with the replacement item has the                          Invoice  transaction type. Inventory document generated for processing the direct return Self-Test Exercise For the same original invoice, process a direct return of one  APJAM96  item and                 one  ORJAM96  item, and a sale of two  ORJAM08  items through a single SO                 invoice. ]]></column>

Different vendors have different conditions for supplying goods and services. A vendor may request that your company pay a part of the order amount in advance before those goods or services are provided. To support this process in Acumatica ERP, you can process a prepayment for the purchase order; this prepayment is later automatically applied to the AP bill prepared for the vendor of goods or services.
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#_85db21a6-2e59-4167-9ce4-e1386db30e0e]
*Configure the default prepayment amount for a vendor
*Create a prepayment request for a purchase order
*Create a prepayment from a prepayment request
*Apply a prepayment to an accounts payable bill created for a purchase order
*Process a single prepayment for multiple purchase orders
*Process multiple prepayments for a purchase order

==Applicable Scenarios==
You create and process a prepayment in the following cases:[anchor|#_7165d0ed-fbf9-4bca-b563-a0155c7a9310]
*You are processing a new purchase order for the vendor that requires a partial payment in advance before the ordered items will be sent.
*You have corrected the details of an existing purchase order that was already prepaid, so that an extra prepayment amount needs to be processed.

==Process of Prepaying Purchase Orders==
To process a prepayment in the system, you have to first create and release the prepayment request, which denotes the vendor&rsquo;s request for prepayment in the system. A prepayment request is not a financial document; it is an internal document that can be approved (if required in your system) before the prepayment is actually paid to the vendor. {br}

In general, the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form is the starting point for creating a prepayment request for a particular purchase order. You can create prepayment requests for purchase orders of the ''Normal'' and ''Drop-Ship'' type.{br}

On the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, you click'''Actions''' > '''Create Prepayment Request'''. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form, which opens, you specify the quantity and extended cost in each of the prepayment request lines. The total amount of prepayments prepared for a purchase order cannot exceed the total amount of the purchase order. After you have specified the details, you release the prepayment request. A prepayment request generates no general ledger transactions and does not change the vendor balance. ((({S:Warn}If approval is required in your system, the prepayment request must be approved on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_50_20_00|Approve Bills for Payment] ([~/?ScreenId=AP502000|AP502000]) form before it can be paid.
)))
To create a prepayment document from a prepayment request, you need to pay the prepayment. A prepayment request is always paid in the full amount; you cannot pay it partially. To pay the prepayment, you prepare an accounts payable check on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_20_00|Checks and Payments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP302000|AP302000]) form, apply it to the prepayment request, and release the check along with the application; depending on the system settings, processing a check may require you to print it before releasing it. After you apply the AP check to prepayment request, the system changes the status of this check to ''Closed'' and changes the status of the original prepayment to ''Open''. Also, a document with the ''Prepayment'' type and the same reference number as that of the original prepayment request becomes available on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_20_00|Checks and Payments] form. Then you can apply this prepayment to bills and credit adjustments prepared for the vendor of the goods.{br}

Once the purchased items have been received to inventory, you create a purchase receipt on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form and an accounts payable bill on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form. (Depending on the vendor's settings, you may need to process the bill before the receipt or the receipt before the bill.) The prepared prepayment document is automatically applied to the accounts payable bill; on release of the AP bill, the prepayment is applied to the bill. On release of the prepayment application to the bill, a batch of general ledger transactions is posted. The open balance of the bill is decreased by the balance of the applied prepayment.
==Workflow of Prepaying Purchase Orders==
The following diagram illustrates the workflow of processing a purchase with prepayment.[anchor|#_addf446d-ad5b-40f0-aefd-a5bf36272de6][anchor|#_5197c748-e4b3-4481-a2c2-e008ff9a2ea5][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_OrderMgmt_Purchase_w_Prepayment.png|popup|330px]]]></column>

After                 you apply the AP check to prepayment request, the system changes the status of this                 check to  Closed  and changes the status of the original prepayment to                      Open .

*To reduce input errors when users enter orders, set up the validation of order totals by selecting the '''For Normal and Standard Orders''' check box in the '''Validate Total on Entry''' section of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form ('''General Settings''' tab). If this check box is selected, when a user creates a new purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, to take the order off hold, the user must enter the order total in the '''Control Total''' box after verifying the order details.
*To cause an accounts payable bill to be created automatically on release of a purchase receipt by default, select the '''Create Bill on Receipt Release''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] form. In this case, when a user creates a purchase receipt on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, the system automatically selects the '''Create Bill''' check box. (The user can clear this check box for a particular bill.)
*To cause the system to automatically release accounts payable bills that are generated on release of purchase receipts, select the '''Release AP Documents Automatically''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] form. For information on processing bills, see [HelpRoot_Financials\Finance_ProcessingAPBills_GeneralInfo|AP Bills: General Info].
*To cause purchase receipts to be created with the ''On Hold'' status (so that users can verify them before processing them further), select the '''Hold Receipts on Entry''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] form.
*To cause the system to automatically release inventory receipts generated on release of purchase receipts, select the '''Release IN Documents Automatically''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] form.
*To cause the system to automatically post general ledger batches generated during processing purchase documents, select the '''Automatically Post on Release''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_10_20_00|General Ledger Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=GL102000|GL102000]) form. For information on processing general ledger batches, see [HelpRoot_Financials\Finance_Processing_Batch_GeneralInfo|GL Transactions: General Information].

==Testing of Settings==
To make sure that all settings are configured correctly, you can process a prepayment for a purchase order, as described in [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\OrderMgmt_Purchase_Order_Prepayments_Process_Activity|Prepayments for Purchase Orders: To Process a Prepayment].]]></column>
			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Prepayments for Purchase Orders: Implementation Checklist The following sections provide details you can use to ensure that the system is                 configured properly for the processing of prepayments for purchases of stock items,                 and to understand (and change, if needed) the settings that affect the processing                 workflow. Implementation Checklist We recommend that before you initially process prepayments for purchase orders, you                 make sure the needed features have been enabled, settings have been specified, and                 entities have been created, as summarized in the following checklist. Form Criteria to Check  ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) Purchase Orders Preferences (PO101000) form Make sure that all necessary settings related to purchase order                                 management have been specified as described in  Order Management with Inventory Configuration: Implementation Activity.  ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors (AP303000) form Make sure that all needed vendors have been configured as                                 described in  Vendors: General Information. Vendor Settings Checklist Make sure that all needed vendors have been configured as described in  Vendors: General Information. For a vendor, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors (AP303000) form, you can specify the following                 settings, which affects the processing of prepayments. Tab Criteria to Check Notes GL Accounts Specify the prepayment account in the  Prepayment                                     Account  box. If you do not specify a separate account for prepayments, the                                 vendor prepayments will be debited to the vendor AP account. Payment Settings Specify the default prepayment percent in the                                      Prepayment Percent  box. To learn how to configure the settings, you can complete  Prepayments for Purchase Orders: Implementation Activity. Other Settings That Affect the Workflow You can affect the workflow of processing purchases with prepayments by specifying                 additional settings as follows: To reduce input errors when users enter orders, set up the validation of order                     totals by selecting the  For Normal and Standard Orders                      check box in the  Validate Total on Entry  section of the                           ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) Purchase Orders Preferences (PO101000) form ( General                         Settings  tab).

In some cases, you need to prepay a percent of the cost of a purchase order before the vendor produces, ships, or delivers the goods to your company. While you are working with the purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, you can click '''Actions''' > '''Create Prepayment Request''' on the form toolbar. The system opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form with a new prepayment request linked to the purchase order, with the lines of the purchase order copied to the '''Document Details''' tab and the prepayment amount inserted in each prepayment request line.{br}

To simplify the creation of prepayment requests for purchase orders, you can define a standard percentage of the prepayment amount for the applicable system objects (those that correspond to a particular requirement for a prepayment); these default percentages can be used in the appropriate situations for calculating the prepayment amount in prepayment request lines. You can specify a default prepayment percent for the following system objects: [anchor|#ul_bm4_cfv_t3b]
*A particular purchase order: On the '''Vendor Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, specify this percent in the '''Prepayment Percent''' box.
*A stock item purchased by a specific vendor: On the '''Vendor Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, in a row with this vendor selected, specify this percent in the '''Prepayment Percent''' column.
*A non-stock item purchased by a specific vendor: On the '''Vendor Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, in a row with this vendor selected, specify this percent in the '''Prepayment Percent''' column.
*A particular vendor: Specify this percent in the '''Prepayment Percent''' box on the '''Payment Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form.

For each line of the prepayment request, the system calculates the value in the '''Prepayment Amount''' column by using the value in the '''Prepayment Percent''' column. The system checks related system settings in the following order and uses the first source value it finds:[anchor|#_3e02e879-88b4-4099-9a05-1a0677eb84f3]
#If a default prepayment percent is specified in the settings of a purchase order for which the prepayment request is prepared, the system inserts this percentage for the line (regardless of the applicable vendor and item settings).
#If a default prepayment percent is specified in the settings of the stock item or non-stock item selected in the line, the system inserts this percentage for this line (regardless of the applicable vendor settings).
#If a default prepayment percent is specified for the vendor selected for this prepayment, the system inserts this percentage for this line.

If a default prepayment percent is not specified for any of these system settings, the system inserts ''100'' as the default value, which indicates that the full amount of the purchase order line should be inserted in the related line of a prepayment request.{br}

You can manually override the default prepayment percent the system has inserted into in any line to change the prepayment amount; also, you can delete any of the lines copied from the original purchase order to exclude them from prepayment.]]></column>

If you are using another dataset, or if any system settings have been changed in ''U100'', these changes can affect the workflow of the activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the ''U100'' dataset to its initial state.
)))
==Story==
Suppose that the Wingman Printing Company vendor (from which SweetLife buys paper bags with personalized labels) notifies the SweetLife company that future orders will need to be partially paid in advance before the vendor starts to manufacture the goods for the order. The vendor requests that your company pay 15% of any order in advance, and for paper bags, the vendor instead requests a prepayment of 25%. You, as the implementation manager, need to configure the vendor so that the prepayment amount will be automatically filled in for each newly created prepayment.
==System Preparation==
Before you start making changes to the settings of the vendor and stock item, you need to launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded. To sign as a system administrator, use the ''gibbs'' login and ''123'' password.
==Step 1: Editing the Vendor Account==
Do the following to update the vendor account with the prepayment percent:[anchor|#_49376be4-1565-4e72-9c6a-7e0cf4bcdcd5]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form, open the ''PRINTICO'' vendor.
#On the '''Payment Settings''' tab, specify <tt>15</tt> in the '''Prepayment Percent''' box.
#On the '''GL Accounts''' tab, make sure that ''13200 (Deposits to Vendor)'' is selected in the '''Prepayment Account''' box.[anchor|#_ca619aa7-dd2a-4836-9858-210992199bc1]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

==Step 2: Editing the Stock Item Settings==
Do the following to specify the prepayment percent of the ''PAPERBAG'' stock item when it is included in a purchase order for the ''PRINTICO'' vendor:[anchor|#_11c9901a-a190-45a3-bfec-a43268827bfb]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, open the ''PAPERBAG'' item.
#On the '''Vendor Details''' tab, do the following in the existing row with the ''PRINTICO'' vendor:
#*Make sure that the check box in the '''Active''' column is elected.
#*In the '''Prepayment Percent''' column, enter <tt>25</tt>.[anchor|#_b4120433-772c-4bd5-b7a2-5e3f874dff6a]

==Story==
Suppose that the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company has ordered a large quantity of labeled paper bags for SweetLife’s needs. The Wingman Printing Company vendor has requested an advance payment in the amount of $500.{br}

Acting as the purchasing manager of SweetLife, you have to enter the purchase order and record a request for a prepayment. You then need to make a payment by check for the prepayment request, process the purchase order to completion, and make sure the prepayment was applied to the bill created for the purchase order.
==Configuration Overview==[anchor|#_01463151-2987-42e6-95ad-1e9b5cf17cdf]
For the purposes of this activity, the ''Inventory'' feature, which provides the ability to create purchase orders that include stock items, has been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in the system:[anchor|#ul_lc3_4qm_dlb]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form, the ''PRINTICO (Wingman Printing Company)'' vendor has been configured. The '''Allow AP Bill Before Receipt''' check box has been selected for the vendor on the '''Purchase Settings''' tab (which means that for this vendor, accounts payable bills can be processed before purchase receipts).
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, the ''PAPERBAG'' stock item have been configured.

==Process Overview==
In this activity, you will start with creating a purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form and adding the purchased items to it. Then you will create a prepayment request by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Create Prepayment Request'''; on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form, you will specify the prepayment amount for each line copied from the purchase order. To create a prepayment document from the prepayment request, you will pay the prepayment by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Pay Bill / Apply Adjustment''' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] form; you will review the prepared check on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_20_00|Checks and Payments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP302000|AP302000]) form. Then you will print the check and release the payment.{br}

To complete the processing of the purchase order, you will create a purchase receipt for the ordered items on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form and an accounts payable bill to the vendor on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form. On release of the AP bill, the system automatically applies the prepayment to the bill and updates the vendor's balance.
==System Preparation==
Do the following:[anchor|#_f811a610-8f11-49fe-9fd6-edb04d0e9b26][anchor|#_fbe45804-6669-45c0-92f3-0dc1e9e47266]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded. To sign in as a sales and purchasing manager, use the ''wiley'' login and the ''123'' password.[anchor|#_1683077b-25cd-47c8-990b-7161cfc55180]
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to today&rsquo;s date. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.[anchor|#_19f4b935-b387-4819-9c03-cb66eac47d2a]
#On the company and branch selection menu, on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure the ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center'' branch is selected.

==Step 1: Creating the Purchase Order==
To create a purchase order, do the following:[anchor|#_f83ff7b3-b4b4-48ec-aefb-6478fd5c99dd]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, create a purchase order with the following settings:
#*'''Type''': ''Normal''
#* '''Vendor''': ''PRINTICO''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Purchase of paper bags with company labels</tt>
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, add a row with the following settings:
#*'''Branch''': ''HEADOFFICE''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''PAPERBAG''
#* '''Warehouse''': ''WHOLESALE''
#* '''Order Qty.''': <tt>250</tt>
#*'''Unit Cost''': <tt>16.70</tt>
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box to prepare the purchase order for further processing.[anchor|#_31a73236-46be-4369-bb6e-4ea5709319ec]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

==Step 2: Creating a Prepayment Request==
Prepare a prepayment request for the purchase order as follows:[anchor|#_e3f10226-279d-4997-89ec-adaa1b0ca6fb]
#While you are still viewing the purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, on the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Create Prepayment Request'''.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form, which opens, in the only line of the prepared prepayment request, specify the following settings: 
#*'''Ext. Cost''': <tt>2000</tt>
#*'''Account''': ''81000''
#Make sure that the calculated '''Prepayment Amount''' is ''500'' in the prepayment request line.
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and save the prepayment request.
#Click '''Release''' on the form toolbar to release the prepayment request.

You have created a prepayment request to make the prepayment to the vendor.
==Step 3: Creating a Check to Pay for the Prepayment Request==
Prepare an AP check to pay the vendor in the prepayment amount as follows:[anchor|#_ddaec416-7a01-46f1-aa03-fe29e3871387]
#While you are still viewing the prepayment request on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form, on the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Pay Bill/Apply Adjustment'''.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_20_00|Checks and Payments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP302000|AP302000]) form, which is opened, review the check and verify that it has the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Type''': ''Check''
#* '''Vendor''': ''PRINTICO''
#* '''Payment Method''': ''CHECK''
#* '''Cash Account''': ''10200WH''
#* '''Payment Amount''': <tt>500</tt>
#*'''Description''': <tt>Prepayment for label printing</tt>
#On the '''Documents to Apply''' tab, make sure that the following settings are specified in the only row:
#*'''Document Type''': ''Prepayment''
#* '''Reference Nbr.''': The reference number of the document you created in Step 2
#*'''Amount Paid''': <tt>500</tt>
#Clear the '''Hold''' check box in the Summary area, and click '''Save''' on the form toolbar. The check is assigned the ''Pending Print'' status, which mean that it requires printing before it can be released.

==Step 4: Processing the Check==
Apply the check to prepayment request by doing the following:[anchor|#_2a47ca35-d090-48a4-953c-a24ab4d49276]
#While you are still viewing the check on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_20_00|Checks and Payments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP302000|AP302000]) form, on the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Print Check'''.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_50_50_00|Process Payments / Print Checks] ([~/?ScreenId=AP505000|AP505000]) form, which is opened, notice that the system has added a row with the check and selected the unlabeled check box for it. On the form toolbar, click '''Process'''.
#:A separate browser tab has opened showing a printable version of the selected check.
#Review the printable version of the check. (In a production system, you would click '''Print''' on the form toolbar to print the check.) Close the browser tab.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_50_52_00|Release Payments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP505200|AP505200]) form, which is opened, click '''Process'''. In the '''Processing''' pop-up window, which is opened, click '''Close'''.

You have created a check and applied it to the prepayment request you created earlier. Now the prepayment is ready to be applied to the vendor&rsquo;s bill.
==Step 5: Processing the Accounts Payable Bill with the Prepayment==
To create an accounts payable bill for the purchase order, do the following:[anchor|#_9fbacbcf-22ac-415c-ad2c-69f40d4e84f1]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, open the purchase order you created in Step 1, and click '''Actions''' > '''Enter AP Bill''' on the form toolbar. The system generates an accounts payable bill for the vendor of the goods and shows the created document on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form.
#Review the details of the prepared bill. (In a production environment, you would make sure that the details of the bill created in the system correspond to the details of the document that was received from the vendor.)
#On the '''Applications''' tab, make sure that the line with the prepayment has been automatically added to the table and that $500 was specified in the '''Amount Paid''' column.
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and on the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the bill. Make sure that the bill now has the ''Open'' status and that the bill&rsquo;s open balance has been decreased by the prepaid amount (see the following screenshot).[anchor|#_3a9dd853-41b7-4969-bdf3-a208657f3cb4][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_OrderMgmt_Purchase_Order_Prepayments.png|popup|Prepayment applied to the bill prepared for the purchase order|450px]

You have applied the prepayment you made for the vendor to the vendor&rsquo;s bill and released the application.
==Step 6: Processing the Purchase Receipt==
To complete the processing of the purchase order, create the purchase receipt for the purchase order as follows:[anchor|#_5a48f678-622e-4c30-883c-135d7f9a0374]
#Return to the purchase order to ''PRINTICO'' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, which still has a status of ''Open'', and review the '''Prepayments''' tab. Notice that the prepayment is now closed and that the full amount of the prepayment was applied to the order (as the '''Applied to Order''' column displays).
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Enter PO Receipt'''. The system prepares the purchase receipt for the selected purchase order and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form.
#In the Summary area, make sure the '''Create Bill''' check box is cleared (because you have already prepared a bill for the entire quantity), and save the prepared purchase receipt.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Release'''.
#On the '''Purchase Orders''' tab, make sure that the related purchase order now has a status of ''Closed''.

On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP505200|AP505200]) Release Payments (AP505200) form, which is opened, click                          Process . In the  Processing                      pop-up window, which is opened, click  Close . You have created a check and applied it to the prepayment request you created                 earlier. Now the prepayment is ready to be applied to the vendor's bill. Step 5: Processing the Accounts Payable Bill with the Prepayment To create an accounts payable bill for the purchase order, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form, open the purchase order                     you created in Step 1, and click  Actions Enter AP Bill  on the form toolbar. The system generates an accounts payable                     bill for the vendor of the goods and shows the created document on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form. Review the details of the prepared bill. (In a production environment, you would                     make sure that the details of the bill created in the system correspond to the                     details of the document that was received from the vendor.) On the  Applications  tab, make sure that the line with the                     prepayment has been automatically added to the table and that $500 was specified                     in the  Amount Paid  column. In the Summary area, clear the  Hold  check box, and on the                     form toolbar, click  Release  to release the bill. Make                     sure that the bill now has the  Open  status and that the bill's open                     balance has been decreased by the prepaid amount (see the following                         screenshot). Prepayment applied to the bill prepared for the purchase                             order You have applied the prepayment you made for the vendor to the vendor's bill and                 released the application. Step 6: Processing the Purchase Receipt To complete the processing of the purchase order, create the purchase receipt for the                 purchase order as follows: Return to the purchase order to  PRINTICO  on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form, which still has a status of                          Open , and review the  Prepayments  tab. Notice                     that the prepayment is now closed and that the full amount of the prepayment was                     applied to the order (as the  Applied to Order  column                     displays). On the form toolbar, click  Actions Enter PO Receipt . The system prepares the purchase receipt for the selected                     purchase order and opens it on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000)                     form. In the Summary area, make sure the  Create Bill  check box                     is cleared (because you have already prepared a bill for the entire quantity),                     and save the prepared purchase receipt. On the form toolbar, click  Release . On the  Purchase Orders  tab, make sure that the related                     purchase order now has a status of  Closed . ]]></column>

==Story==
Suppose that on January 30, 2020, the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company has ordered a large quantity of labeled paper bags for SweetLife’s needs. The Wingman Printing Company vendor has requested an advance payment in the amount of $500. Suppose that on February 7, 2020, the vendor notifies you that additional prepayment in the amount of $200 is needed for the order. Also suppose that the first prepayment request has not been paid yet.{br}

Acting as the purchasing manager in SweetLife, you have to enter the purchase order and record the prepayment request. Then you need to create the second prepayment for the same purchase order, and pay both prepayment requests with the same check. Finally, you process the order to completion and make sure that both prepayments have been applied to the AP bill that you prepare for the purchase order.
==Configuration Overview==[anchor|#_915da832-9f9f-4c0d-a422-ebededf11f8e]
For the purposes of this activity, the ''Inventory'' feature, which provides the ability to create purchase orders that include stock items, has been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in the system:[anchor|#ul_ohg_12t_dlb]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form, the ''PRINTICO (Wingman Printing Company)'' vendor has been configured. The '''Allow AP Bill Before Receipt''' check box has been selected for the vendor on the '''Purchase Settings''' tab (which means that for this vendor, accounts payable bills can be processed before purchase receipts).
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, the ''PAPERBAG'' stock item have been configured.

==Process Overview==
In this activity, to process a purchase order when multiple prepayments are required, you will start with creating a purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form and adding the purchased items to it. Then you will create the first prepayment request by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Create Prepayment Request'''; on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form, you will specify the prepayment amount for each line copied from the purchase order. Then you will create a subsequent prepayment request, and release both prepayment requests on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_50_10_00|Release AP Documents] ([~/?ScreenId=AP501000|AP501000]) form.{br}

Then you will pay two prepayment requests with a single AP check; you will do this by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Pay Bill / Apply Adjustment''' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] form while viewing one of the prepayment requests, and adding the second prepayment request to the check on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_20_00|Checks and Payments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP302000|AP302000]) form. Then you will print the check, and release the check and its application to two prepayment requests.{br}

To complete the processing of the purchase order, you will create a purchase receipt for the ordered items on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, and an accounts payable bill to the vendor on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form. On release of the AP bill, the system automatically applies the prepayments to the bill and updates the vendor's balance.

#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

==Step 2: Creating Prepayment Requests==
Prepare the two prepayment requests for the purchase order as follows:[anchor|#_e3f10226-279d-4997-89ec-adaa1b0ca6fb]
#While you are still viewing the purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, on the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Create Prepayment Request'''.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form, which opens, in the only line of the prepared prepayment request, specify the following settings: 
#*'''Ext. Cost''': <tt>2000</tt>
#*'''Account''': ''81000''
#Make sure that the calculated '''Prepayment Amount''' is ''500'' in the prepayment request line.
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save & Close''' to save the prepayment request and return to the purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form.
#On this form, review the '''Prepayments''' tab. The line with the prepared prepayment request in the amount of $500 is shown in the table.
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, click the Business Date menu button, and select ''2/7/2020'' from the calendar to change the business date.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Create Prepayment Request'''.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] form, which opens, in the only line of the prepared prepayment request, specify the following settings: 
#*'''Ext. Cost''': <tt>800</tt>
#*'''Account''': ''81000''
#Make sure that the calculated '''Prepayment Amount''' is ''200'' in the prepayment request line.
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box; on the form toolbar, click '''Save & Close''' to save the prepayment request and return to the purchase order.
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_50_10_00|Release AP Documents] ([~/?ScreenId=AP501000|AP501000]) form.
#In the rows with prepayment requests that you have prepared in this step, select the unlabeled check boxes and, on the form toolbar, click '''Release'''. In the '''Processing''' pop-up window, which is opened, click '''Close''' after the processing finishes.

==Step 3: Creating a Check to Pay for the Prepayment Requests==
Prepare an AP check for both prepayment requests as follows:[anchor|#_ddaec416-7a01-46f1-aa03-fe29e3871387]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form, open the $500 prepayment request that you have prepared for the purchase order.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Pay Bill/Apply Adjustment'''.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_20_00|Checks and Payments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP302000|AP302000]) form, which is opened, review the check and verify that it has the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Type''': ''Check''
#* '''Vendor''': ''PRINTICO''
#* '''Payment Method''': ''CHECK''
#* '''Cash Account''': ''10200WH''
#* '''Application Date''': ''2/7/2020''
#* '''Application Period''': ''02-2020''
#Change '''Description''' to <tt>Prepayments for label printing</tt>.
#Change the '''Payment Amount''' to <tt>700</tt>. (The '''Unapplied Balance''' of $200 appears in the Summary area.)
#On the '''Documents to Apply''' tab, verify the details of the row with the following settings:
#*'''Document Type''': ''Prepayment''
#* '''Reference Nbr.''': The reference number of the $500 prepayment you created in Step 2
#*'''Amount Paid''': <tt>500</tt>
#On the table toolbar, click '''Add Row'''. In the new row, do the following:
##In the '''Document Type''' column, select ''Prepayment''.
##In the '''Reference Nbr.''' column, select the reference number of the $200 prepayment you created in Step 2.
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box and, on the form toolbar, click '''Save'''. The check is assigned the ''Pending Print'' status, which means that the check needs to be printed before it can be released.

==Step 4: Processing the Check==
Apply the check to the prepayment requests by doing the following:[anchor|#_2a47ca35-d090-48a4-953c-a24ab4d49276]
#While you are still viewing the check on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_20_00|Checks and Payments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP302000|AP302000]) form, on the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Print Check'''.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_50_50_00|Process Payments / Print Checks] ([~/?ScreenId=AP505000|AP505000]) form, which is opened, notice that the system has added a line with the check and selected the unlabeled check box for it.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Process'''.
#:A separate browser tab has opened showing a printable version of the selected check.
#Review the printable version of the printed check. (In a production system, you would click '''Print''' on the form toolbar to print the check.) Close the browser tab.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_50_52_00|Release Payments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP505200|AP505200]) form, which is opened, click '''Process''' to process the line for which the unlabeled check box was selected automatically. In the '''Processing''' pop-up window, which is opened, click '''Close'''.

You have created a check and applied it to the prepayment requests that you created earlier. Now the prepayment is ready to be applied to the vendor&rsquo;s bill.
==Step 5: Processing the Accounts Payable Bill with the Prepayments==
To create an accounts payable bill for the purchase order, do the following:[anchor|#_9fbacbcf-22ac-415c-ad2c-69f40d4e84f1]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, open the purchase order that you have created earlier in this activity.
#On the '''Other Information''' tab, review the amount in the '''Unpaid Amount''' box: It is the order total minus the prepaid amount.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Enter AP Bill'''. The system generates an accounts payable bill for the vendor of the goods and shows the created document on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form.
#On the '''Applications''' tab, make sure that two lines with the prepayments have been automatically added to the table. Make sure that in each line, the '''Amount Paid''' equal to prepayment balance is specified ($500 and $200, respectively). 
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and on the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the bill. Make sure that the bill now has the ''Open'' status, and that the bill&rsquo;s open balance has been decreased by the prepaid amount (see the following screenshot).[anchor|#_3a9dd853-41b7-4969-bdf3-a208657f3cb4][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_OrderMgmt_Purchase_Order_Prepayments_2.png|popup|Prepayment applied to the bill prepared for the purchase order|450px]

You have applied the prepayments you made for the vendor to the vendor&rsquo;s bill and released the application.
==Step 6: Processing the Purchase Receipt==
To complete the processing of the purchase order, create the purchase receipt for the purchase order as follows:[anchor|#_5a48f678-622e-4c30-883c-135d7f9a0374]
#Return to the purchase order to ''PRINTICO'' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, which still has a status of ''Open'', and open the '''Prepayments''' tab. Notice that the prepayments are now closed and that the full amount of the prepayments was applied to the order (as the '''Applied to Order''' column displays).
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Enter PO Receipt'''. The system prepares the purchase receipt for the selected purchase order and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form.
#In the Summary area, make sure the '''Create Bill''' check box is cleared (because you have already prepared a bill for the entire quantity), and save the prepared purchase receipt.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Release'''.
#On the '''Purchase Orders''' tab, make sure that the related purchase order now has a status of ''Closed''.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Prepayments for Purchase Orders: To Process Multiple Prepayments for a Purchase         Order The following activity will walk you through the process of preparing multiple                 prepayments for a single purchase order, and applying these prepayments to an AP                 bill prepared for the vendor. The following activity is             based on the  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system             settings have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the             activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100              dataset to its initial state. Story Suppose that on January 30,  2020, the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company has ordered a large quantity of labeled                 paper bags for SweetLife’s needs. The Wingman Printing Company vendor has requested                 an advance payment in the amount of $500. Suppose that on February 7,  2020, the vendor notifies you that additional prepayment in the amount of $200 is                 needed for the order. Also suppose that the first prepayment request has not been                 paid yet. Acting as the purchasing manager in SweetLife, you have to enter the purchase order                 and record the prepayment request. Then you need to create the second prepayment for                 the same purchase order, and pay both prepayment requests with the same check.                 Finally, you process the order to completion and make sure that both prepayments                 have been applied to the AP bill that you prepare for the purchase order. Configuration Overview For the purposes of this activity, the  Inventory  feature, which provides the ability to create purchase orders that include stock items, has been enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS101000) form. The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in                 the system: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors (AP303000) form, the  PRINTICO (Wingman                         Printing Company)  vendor has been configured. The  Allow AP                         Bill Before Receipt  check box has been selected for the vendor                     on the  Purchase Settings  tab (which means that for this                     vendor, accounts payable bills can be processed before purchase receipts). On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form, the  PAPERBAG                      stock item have been configured. Process Overview In this activity, to process a purchase order when multiple prepayments are required,                 you will start with creating a purchase order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders                 (PO301000) form and adding the purchased items to it. Then you will create the first                 prepayment request by clicking  Actions Create Prepayment Request ; on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form, you will                 specify the prepayment amount for each line copied from the purchase order. Then you                 will create a subsequent prepayment request, and release both prepayment requests on                 the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP501000|AP501000]) Release AP Documents (AP501000) form. Then you will pay two prepayment requests with a single AP check; you will do this by                 clicking  Actions Pay Bill / Apply Adjustment  on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments form while                 viewing one of the prepayment requests, and adding the second prepayment request to                 the check on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP302000|AP302000]) Checks and Payments (AP302000) form. Then you will                 print the check, and release the check and its application to two prepayment                 requests. To complete the processing of the purchase order, you will create a purchase receipt                 for the ordered items on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form, and an                 accounts payable bill to the vendor on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments                 (AP301000) form. On release of the AP bill, the system automatically applies the                 prepayments to the bill and updates the vendor's balance. System Preparation Do the following: Launch the  Acumatica ERP             website, and sign in to a company with the  U100  dataset preloaded. To sign in as             a sales and purchasing manager, use the  wiley  login and the  123              password. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP             screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to  1/30/2020. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and             select  1/30/2020 on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and             process all documents in the system during this business date. On the company and branch selection menu, on the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP screen, make sure the  SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center  branch is selected. Step 1: Creating the Purchase Order To create a purchase order, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form, create a purchase order                     with the following settings in the Summary area: Type :  Normal Vendor :  PRINTICO Date :  1/30/2020Promised On :  1/30/2020Description :  Order of paper bags with                                 company labels On the  Document Details  tab, add a row with the following                         settings: Branch :  HEADOFFICE Inventory ID :  PAPERBAG Warehouse :  WHOLESALE Order Qty. :  250 Unit Cost :  16.70 In the Summary area, clear the  Hold  check box to prepare                     the purchase order for further processing. On the form toolbar, click  Save . Step 2: Creating Prepayment Requests Prepare the two prepayment requests for the purchase order as follows: While you are still viewing the purchase order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form, on the form toolbar, click  Actions Create Prepayment Request . On                      the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form, which opens, in the only                     line of the prepared prepayment request, specify the following settings:  Ext. Cost :  2000 Account :  81000 Make sure that the calculated  Prepayment Amount  is                          500  in the prepayment request line. In the Summary area, clear the  Hold  check box. On the form toolbar, click  Save & Close  to save the                     prepayment request and return to the purchase order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form. On this form, review the  Prepayments  tab. The line with                     the prepared prepayment request in the amount of $500 is shown in the                     table.

In the Summary area, clear the  Hold  check box; on the                     form toolbar, click  Save & Close  to save the                     prepayment request and return to the purchase order. Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP501000|AP501000]) Release AP Documents (AP501000) form. In the rows with prepayment requests that you have prepared in this step, select                     the unlabeled check boxes and, on the form toolbar, click                          Release . In the  Processing                      pop-up window, which is opened, click  Close  after the                     processing finishes. Step 3: Creating a Check to Pay for the Prepayment Requests Prepare an AP check for both prepayment requests as follows: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form, open the $500 prepayment                     request that you have prepared for the purchase order. On the form toolbar, click  Actions Pay Bill/Apply Adjustment . On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP302000|AP302000]) Checks and Payments (AP302000) form, which is opened, review                     the check and verify that it has the following settings in the Summary area: Type :  Check Vendor :  PRINTICO Payment Method :  CHECK Cash Account :  10200WH Application Date :  2/7/ 2020Application Period :  02- 2020Change  Description  to  Prepayments for label                         printing . Change the  Payment Amount  to  700 .                     (The  Unapplied Balance  of $200 appears in the Summary                     area.) On the  Documents to Apply  tab, verify the details of the                     row with the following settings: Document Type :  Prepayment Reference Nbr. : The reference number of the $500                             prepayment you created in Step 2 Amount Paid :  500 On the table toolbar, click  Add Row . In the new row, do                     the following: In the  Document Type  column, select                                  Prepayment . In the  Reference Nbr.  column, select the                             reference number of the $200 prepayment you created in Step 2. In the Summary area, clear the  Hold  check box and, on the                     form toolbar, click  Save . The check is assigned the                          Pending Print  status, which means that the check needs to be printed                     before it can be released. Step 4: Processing the Check Apply the check to the prepayment requests by doing the following: While you are still viewing the check on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP302000|AP302000]) Checks and Payments                     (AP302000) form, on the form toolbar, click  Actions Print Check . On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP505000|AP505000]) Process Payments / Print Checks (AP505000) form, which is opened, notice                     that the system has added a line with the check and selected the unlabeled check                     box for it. On the form toolbar, click  Process . A separate browser                         tab has opened showing a printable version of the selected check. Review the printable version of the printed check. (In a production system, you                     would click  Print  on the form toolbar to print the                     check.) Close the browser tab. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP505200|AP505200]) Release Payments (AP505200) form, which is opened, click                          Process  to process the line for which the unlabeled                     check box was selected automatically. In the  Processing                      pop-up window, which is opened, click  Close . You have created a check and applied it to the prepayment requests that you created                 earlier. Now the prepayment is ready to be applied to the vendor's bill. Step 5: Processing the Accounts Payable Bill with the Prepayments To create an accounts payable bill for the purchase order, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form, open the purchase order                     that you have created earlier in this activity. On the  Other Information  tab, review the amount in the                          Unpaid Amount  box: It is the order total minus the                     prepaid amount. On the form toolbar, click  Actions Enter AP Bill . The system generates an accounts payable bill for the vendor of                     the goods and shows the created document on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments                     (AP301000) form. On the  Applications  tab, make sure that two lines with                     the prepayments have been automatically added to the table. Make sure that in                     each line, the  Amount Paid  equal to prepayment balance is                     specified ($500 and $200, respectively).  In the Summary area, clear the  Hold  check box, and on the                     form toolbar, click  Release  to release the bill. Make                     sure that the bill now has the  Open  status, and that the bill's open                     balance has been decreased by the prepaid amount (see the following                         screenshot). Prepayment applied to the bill prepared for the purchase                             order You have applied the prepayments you made for the vendor to the vendor's bill and                 released the application. Step 6: Processing the Purchase Receipt To complete the processing of the purchase order, create the purchase receipt for the                 purchase order as follows: Return to the purchase order to  PRINTICO  on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form, which still has a status of                          Open , and open the  Prepayments  tab. Notice                     that the prepayments are now closed and that the full amount of the prepayments                     was applied to the order (as the  Applied to Order  column                     displays). On the form toolbar, click  Actions Enter PO Receipt . The system prepares the purchase receipt for the selected                     purchase order and opens it on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000)                     form. In the Summary area, make sure the  Create Bill  check box                     is cleared (because you have already prepared a bill for the entire quantity),                     and save the prepared purchase receipt. On the form toolbar, click  Release . On the  Purchase Orders  tab, make sure that the related                     purchase order now has a status of  Closed . ]]></column>

The following sections explains how you can cancel prepayments in the system if you have applied a prepayment to the wrong purchase order, or if the prepaid amount was incorrect.{br}{TOC}
==Voiding a Prepayment Request==
To cancel a prepayment request that was prepared for a purchase order if a check was not prepared for the prepayment request yet, open the prepayment request on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form, and on the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Void Prepayment'''. The system changes the status of the prepayment request to ''Voided''.{br}

If an AP check was prepared for a prepayment request, but the check has not yet been printed, you cannot void the prepayment request. You can, however, remove the line with this prepayment request from the '''Documents to Apply''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_20_00|Checks and Payments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP302000|AP302000]) form, or process the AP check to completion and then void it.{br}

To cancel the application to a purchase order of a prepayment request paid with an AP check, you must void the AP check, and the prepayment will be voided automatically. (The prepayment itself cannot be voided until the check is voided.) To void the check, open it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_20_00|Checks and Payments] form, and on the form toolbar, click '''Void'''. The system prepares the document with the ''Voided Check'' type and opens this document on the same form; the line with the prepayment is added on the '''Documents to Apply''' tab. After you release the voided check and its application, the system assigns the ''Voided'' status to the AP check and to the prepayment request.
==Canceling the Application of a Prepayment to a Purchase Order==
If a prepayment document was created manually on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_20_00|Checks and Payments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP302000|AP302000]) form, and the application of a prepayment to a purchase order has not been released yet, you can select the '''Hold''' check box to assign the prepayment the ''Reserved'' status; you then delete the line with a purchase order from the '''Orders to Apply''' tab.{br}

If the application of a prepayment to a purchase order has been released, you cannot delete the purchase order from the '''Orders to Apply''' tab; to cancel the application, you have to void the prepayment by clicking '''Void''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_20_00|Checks and Payments] form. The system creates a document of the ''Voided Check'' type; on release of this check, the prepayment is assigned the ''Voided'' status.
==Reversing a Prepayment Application to a Bill==
If the application of a prepayment document to an AP bill was released, you can reverse it to cancel the application. To do this, on the '''Application History''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_20_00|Checks and Payments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP302000|AP302000]) form, click the row of the bill whose application you want to reverse, and then click '''Reverse Application''' on the table toolbar. The system adds a reversing row with the opposite amount on the '''Documents to Apply''' tab. After you release the application of the reversing entry, the prepayment becomes unapplied to the bill, and system increases the prepayment balance by the amount that has been unapplied. Then you can apply this prepayment to another document, or void it, if needed.]]></column>

In Acumatica ERP, you can process direct purchase receipts that does not have corresponding purchase orders. {br}

The following diagram represents the general workflow of the processing of a direct purchase receipt. [anchor|#_08c3387e-7753-4eaf-a870-b3b350b70f02][anchor|#_cd127059-1cce-4f0d-8a40-18734f665efd][image:UserGuide/Images/PO_Direct_Receipt.png|popup|450px]
The remaining sections of this topic describe in detail the processing steps shown in the diagram.{br}{TOC}
==1. Enter the Purchase Receipt==
You create a new purchase receipt on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form and assign it the ''Receipt'' type. On the purchase receipt, you can list the stock and non-stock items to be received from the particular vendor. The reference number for a new purchase receipt is generated in accordance with the numbering sequence specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form. If the purchase receipt is created with the ''On Hold'' status, you should clear the '''Hold''' check box when you are ready to process the receipt further.
==2. Release the Purchase Receipt==
To release the purchase receipt, while you are viewing it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, you click '''Release''' on the form toolbar. Alternatively, you can release multiple purchase receipts at the same time by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_10_00|Release Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO501000|PO501000]) form. {br}

When the purchase receipt is released, the system automatically generates a corresponding inventory receipt, with the date and posting period of the purchase receipt, to add the received items to inventory. You can review the generated inventory receipt on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) form. 
==3. Prepare the Accounts Payable Bill==
If the '''Create Bill''' check box is selected for the purchase receipt on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, when you release the purchase receipt, the system generates an accounts payable bill to the vendor automatically. Otherwise, you need to prepare the bill manually from the related purchase receipt on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] form by clicking '''Actions &gt; Enter AP Bill''' on the form toolbar. {br}

You can view the generated AP bill on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form. For more information on the processing of AP bills, see [HelpRoot_Financials\Finance_ProcessingAPBills_Mapref|Processing AP Bills] and [HelpRoot_Financials\Finance_PayingAPBills_Mapref|Paying AP Bills].
==4. Release the Inventory Receipt==
The generated inventory receipt is released automatically if the '''Release IN Documents Automatically''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form. If this check box is cleared, you have to release the inventory receipt manually by clicking '''Release''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) form. On release of the inventory receipt, a batch of GL transactions is generated. {br}

You can release the receipt before or after preparing the AP bill.

In Acumatica ERP, you can process vendor returns if any purchased items need to be returned to the vendor for some reason.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#_536fc5b5-5bf8-4cf2-aa9b-34d212a87c28]
*Create a purchase return document
*Specify the items to be returned and define at which cost the items will be issued from inventory
*Process the purchase return and the related inventory and accounts payable documents

==Applicable Scenarios==
In most cases, the purchasing process is completed when your company receives the goods and the corresponding accounts payable bill is released to adjust your outstanding balance with the vendor. In some cases, however, items are delivered in an unsatisfactory condition or shipped by mistake and should be returned to the vendor for replacement or reimbursement. A vendor return can also occur when services were not rendered or were provided partially and your company should be reimbursed.{br}

The standard purchase return process includes the creation of a purchase return document, the specification of the returned items and their quantities, the issuing of the returned item from inventory, and the adjustment to the outstanding vendor balance in the system in the returned amount.
==Processing of a Purchase Return==
In general, the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form is the starting point for creating a purchase return, which is a document of the ''Return'' type that includes a line for each item being returned. {br}

You can create a purchase return from the applicable purchase receipt, whether or not it is linked to a purchase order. To do this, you open the purchase receipt, select the unlabeled check boxes on the '''Document Details''' tab for the lines of the items to be returned, and click '''Return''' on the form toolbar. The system copies the relevant information from the purchase receipt to a new purchase return on the form. In the copied line or lines, you must specify the quantity of items to be returned in the '''Receipt Qty.''' column and a reason code of the ''Vendor Return'' usage type in the '''Reason Code '''column. By default, the system inserts the reason code that is selected in the '''PO Return Reason Code''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form. ((({S:Warn}As an alternative to creating a purchase return from a purchase receipt, you can create a new purchase return manually on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] form and add any number of purchase receipts or purchase receipt lines to it by clicking '''Add PR''' or '''Add PR Line''' on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab.
)))
You can process returns for purchase receipt lines with both stock and non-stock items. For each item, you must specify the warehouse (and warehouse location, if applicable) from which the items will be issued to be sent back to the vendor. For stock items with lot or serial numbers, you have to click '''Allocations''' on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab and specify the particular lot or serial numbers for the units being returned. {br}

For purchase return lines that are linked to a purchase order, you can select the '''Open PO Line''' check box on the '''Document Details''' tab to specify that the system should change the status of the related purchase order to ''Open'' on release of the return (if you expect receiving of replacement items for the order and thus want to keep the purchase order open). If the '''Open PO Line''' check box is cleared, the related purchase order remains closed.{br}

After you have specified the purchase return details, you define at which cost the items will be issued from inventory, by selecting or clearing the '''Process Return with Original Cost''' check box. If the check box is selected, the items are issued from inventory at exactly the same cost at which the items were purchased. If the check box is cleared, the items are issued at the cost calculated by the system according to the items&rsquo; valuation methods.{br}

After you have prepared a purchase return document, you need to process issuing of items from inventory and adjust the vendor&rsquo;s balance in the system for the amount of returned items. On release of a purchase return, the inventory issue is generated automatically and can be viewed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form. On release of this issue, the quantities of returned items are deducted from the item quantities available at the specified warehouse. If the purchase receipt for which the return was created is linked to a purchase order, then on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form for the purchase order, the applicable values in the '''Qty. On Receipts''' column are decreased by the quantity of the listed item that is returned. Also, on release of the purchase return, the accounts payable debit adjustment is generated automatically if the '''Create Bill''' check box is selected for the purchase return on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] form. The generated debit adjustment can be viewed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form.{br}

The further processing of a purchase return depends on the agreement between your company and the vendor. You can complete the processing of the return by processing a vendor refund or by receiving replacement items for the original purchase order.
==Workflow of a Purchase Return==
For purchase return documents, the typical processing involves the actions and generated documents shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#_a1984738-091f-422a-bb27-79667792fcac][anchor|#_7e91b041-32e5-431e-98d8-82db70c9427c][image:Shared/Images/diag_OrderMgmt_Purchase_Return.png|popup|450px]]]></column>

The system copies the                     relevant information from the purchase receipt to a new purchase return on the                     form. In the copied line or lines, you must specify the quantity of items to be                     returned in the  Receipt Qty.  column and a reason code of                     the  Vendor Return  usage type in the  Reason Code                      column. By default, the system inserts the reason code that is                     selected in the  PO Return Reason Code  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) Purchase Orders Preferences (PO101000) form.  As an alternative to creating a purchase return from a purchase receipt, you                     can create a new purchase return manually on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts form and add any number of purchase                     receipts or purchase receipt lines to it by clicking  Add                         PR  or  Add PR Line  on the table toolbar of                     the  Document Details  tab. You can process returns for purchase receipt lines with both stock and non-stock                     items. For each item, you must specify the warehouse (and warehouse location, if                     applicable) from which the items will be issued to be sent back to the vendor.                     For stock items with lot or serial numbers, you have to click                          Allocations  on the table toolbar of the                          Document Details  tab and specify the particular lot                     or serial numbers for the units being returned.  For purchase return lines that are linked to a purchase order, you can select the                          Open PO Line  check box on the  Document                         Details  tab to specify that the system should change the status                     of the related purchase order to  Open  on release of the return (if you                     expect receiving of replacement items for the order and thus want to keep the                     purchase order open). If the  Open PO Line  check box is                     cleared, the related purchase order remains closed. After you have specified the purchase return details, you define at which cost                     the items will be issued from inventory, by selecting or clearing the                          Process Return with Original Cost  check box. If the                     check box is selected, the items are issued from inventory at exactly the same                     cost at which the items were purchased. If the check box is cleared, the items                     are issued at the cost calculated by the system according to the items'                     valuation methods. After you have prepared a purchase return document, you need to process issuing                     of items from inventory and adjust the vendor's balance in the system for the                     amount of returned items. On release of a purchase return, the inventory issue                     is generated automatically and can be viewed on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) Issues (IN302000) form. On release of this                     issue, the quantities of returned items are deducted from the item quantities                     available at the specified warehouse. If the purchase receipt for which the                     return was created is linked to a purchase order, then on the                          Document Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form for the purchase                     order, the applicable values in the  Qty.

Workflow of a Purchase Return For purchase return documents, the typical processing involves the actions and                     generated documents shown in the following diagram. ]]></column>

==Story==
Suppose that on January 30, 2020, the SweetLife purchasing manager notices that three packs of paper that were purchased and delivered on January 29, 2020 have been damaged during shipping. The purchasing manager has decided to return these packs to the Spectra Stationery Office vendor without requesting a replacement. You, acting as the purchasing manager, need to create and process a purchase return of the damaged items at the items&rsquo; original cost.
==Configuration Overview==For the purposes of this lesson, the ''Inventory'' feature, which provides the ability to create purchase orders that include stock items, has been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form, the ''STATOFFICE (Spectra Stationery Office)'' vendor is configured.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, the ''PAPER'', ''PEN'', and ''PENCIL'' stock items are configured.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form, the '''Process Return with Original Cost''' check box has been selected. The state of this check box is copied by default to each purchase return that is created; when the check box is selected, the system processes the return of items at the cost specified in the original receipt.{br}

Additionally, the purchase documents for which you will process a return have been created and processed in the system.
==Process Overview==
A purchase return document, which represents a vendor return in the system, is prepared based on the applicable purchase receipt. To create a purchase return, you open the purchase receipt on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, and on the '''Document Details''' tab, you select (by selecting the unlabeled check boxes) the lines of all items that need to be returned. Then on the form toolbar, you click '''Return'''; on the same form, the system copies the relevant information to a new document of the ''Return'' type that includes the lines selected for return. {br}

Before you process the prepared purchase return further, on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] form, you can correct the quantities to be returned (if you need to return only part of the purchased items) and the reason code for the line (if it is different than the default reason code inserted by the system). In the Summary area, you specify that the items should be issued from inventory at the cost at which they were purchased by selecting the '''Process Return with Original Cost''' check box. You then release the purchase return and review the related documents to make sure the return has been processed fully in the system.
==System Preparation==
Do the following:[anchor|#_f811a610-8f11-49fe-9fd6-edb04d0e9b26]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded. To sign in as a purchasing manager, use the ''wiley'' login and the ''123'' password.
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to''1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select ''1/30/2020'' from the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.
#On the company and branch selection menu, on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure the ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center'' branch is selected.

==Step 1: Creating a Purchase Return from the Related Purchase Receipt==
The easiest way to create a purchase return is to start from the purchase receipt in which you received the items to be returned. You create the purchase return from the purchase receipt as follows:[anchor|#_538ae4c2-dd46-4dc8-a1b6-3d6f205c47ea]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, open the purchase receipt to ''STATOFFICE'' dated ''1/29/2020''.
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, select the unlabeled check box in the line of the purchase receipt with the ''PAPER'' item.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Return''' to create a purchase return that corresponds to the purchase receipt and includes the selected line. The system creates a document with the ''Return'' type that corresponds to the purchase receipt and opens it on the same form.

==Step 2: Specifying the Settings of the Return ==
Do the following to define the specific settings of the return document:[anchor|#_d2e51864-ea0a-4ee4-bfaf-7a6feee89095]
#While you are still viewing the purchase return that was created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, in the Summary area, make sure that ''1/30/2020'' is specified as the '''Date'''.
#Make sure the '''Process Return with Original Cost''' check box is selected. With this check box selected, the items will be issued from inventory at exactly the same cost at which they were purchased.
#Select the '''Create Bill''' check box so that the system generates a debit adjustment automatically on release of the purchase return.
#In the only return line on the '''Document Details''' tab, change the '''Receipt Qty.''' to <tt>3</tt> (which is the quantity of items to be returned).
#In the line, clear the '''Open PO Line''' check box to indicate that no replacement is needed for returned items.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save''' to save the purchase return, which has the ''Balanced'' status and can thus be released.

==Step 3: Releasing the Purchase Return==
Do the following to release the purchase return and to review how the return of items is processed in the system:[anchor|#_7a8ca195-62a3-465b-a468-fbb2904a98b1]
#While you are still viewing the purchase return on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, click '''Release''' on the form toolbar to release it.
#On the '''Billing History''' tab, review the information about the debit adjustment that was prepared, and make sure that it now has a status of ''Open'' (indicating that it was released).
#On the '''Other Information''' tab, click the '''IN Ref. Nbr.''' link, and review the inventory issue, which is opened on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form. Make sure the issue has a status of ''Released''.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, open the purchase order to ''STATOFFICE'' for which the return was processed.
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, in the '''Qty. on Receipts''' column, notice that received quantity in the ''PAPER'' line has been decreased by the returned quantity and is now 17.
#On the '''PO History''' tab, review the documents related to the purchase order, as shown in the screenshot below. The left table shows the purchase receipt and purchase return; the right table shows the bill and the debit adjustment. In the line with the debit adjustment, notice the zero purchase price variance amount in the '''PPV Amount''' column, which means that the items were returned at the cost at which they were purchased.[anchor|#_f4de0bba-797d-4a77-93f9-b808fbb5888e][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_OrderMgmt_Purchase_Return_Original_Cost.png|popup|Documents related to the purchase order|450px]

==Self-Test Exercise==
For the same purchase order, process a purchase return of 3 ''PAPER'' items with the '''Process Return with Original Cost''' check box cleared, and review the generated documents and the cost at which the items are issued from inventory. ]]></column>

Step 1: Creating a Purchase Return from the Related Purchase Receipt The easiest way to create a purchase return is to start from the purchase receipt in                 which you received the items to be returned. You create the purchase return from the                 purchase receipt as follows: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form, open the                     purchase receipt to  STATOFFICE  dated  1/29/ 2020. On the  Document Details  tab, select the unlabeled check                     box in the line of the purchase receipt with the  PAPER  item. On the form toolbar, click  Return  to create a purchase                     return that corresponds to the purchase receipt and includes the selected line.                     The system creates a document with the  Return  type that corresponds to                     the purchase receipt and opens it on the same form. Step 2: Specifying the Settings of the Return  Do the following to define the specific settings of the return document: While you are still viewing the purchase return that was created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form, in the Summary area,                     make sure that  1/30/2020 is specified as the                      Date . Make sure the  Process Return with Original Cost  check box                     is selected. With this check box selected, the items will be issued from                     inventory at exactly the same cost at which they were purchased. Select the  Create Bill  check box so that the system                     generates a debit adjustment automatically on release of the purchase                     return. In the only return line on the  Document Details  tab,                     change the  Receipt Qty.  to  3                      (which is the quantity of items to be returned). In the line,                      clear                      the  Open PO Line  check box to indicate that no                     replacement is needed for returned items. On the form toolbar, click  Save  to save the purchase                     return, which has the  Balanced  status and can thus be released. Step 3: Releasing the Purchase Return Do the following to release the purchase return and to review how the return of items                 is processed in the system: While you are still viewing the purchase return on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form, click                          Release  on the form toolbar to release it. On the  Billing History  tab, review the information about                     the debit adjustment that was prepared, and make sure that it now has a status                     of  Open  (indicating that it was released). On the  Other Information  tab, click the  IN                         Ref. Nbr.  link, and review the inventory issue, which is opened                     on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) Issues (IN302000) form. Make sure the issue has                     a status of  Released . On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form, open the                     purchase order to  STATOFFICE  for which the return was processed. On the  Document Details  tab, in the  Qty. on                         Receipts  column, notice that received quantity in the                          PAPER  line has been decreased by the returned quantity and is now                     17. On the  PO History  tab, review the documents related to                     the purchase order, as shown in the screenshot below. The left table shows the                     purchase receipt and purchase return; the right table shows the bill and the                     debit adjustment. In the line with the debit adjustment, notice the zero                     purchase price variance amount in the  PPV Amount  column,                     which means that the items were returned at the cost at which they were                         purchased. Documents related to the purchase order Self-Test Exercise For the same purchase order, process a purchase return of 3  PAPER  items with                 the  Process Return with Original Cost  check box cleared, and                 review the generated documents and the cost at which the items are issued from                 inventory.  ]]></column>

The costs of items purchased from vendors may change over time, so the correct costs must be reflected on the purchase return document. To specify that items to be returned should be issued from inventory at exactly the same cost at which the items were purchased, you need to select the '''Process Return with Original Cost''' check box in the Summary area of the purchase return document on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form. {br}

On release of the purchase return, the system prepares an inventory issue document to update inventory, which you can review on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form, and a debit adjustment to decrease the vendor balance in the system, which you can review on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form.

In the general ledger transactions that are posted during the processing of a purchase return, the posted amount is the original cost of the item multiplied by the returned quantity.{br}

The original cost for stock items is defined depending on the valuation method specified for each item in the '''Valuation Method''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form:[anchor|#_6f4f5f07-f061-4531-8050-91a79d7baa42]
*For items with the FIFO valuation method, the system uses the average cost of the cost layer that corresponds to the purchase receipt for which the return is processed.
*For items with the average, specific, and standard valuation methods, the system uses the cost specified in the line of the original inventory receipt or purchase receipt.

For any of the valuation methods, the cost adjustments, such as landed costs or purchase price variance, are not included in the original cost. For more information on how the system calculates items&rsquo; costs depending on valuation methods, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Item_Costs_and_Valuation_Methods|Item Costs and Valuation Methods].
==Transactions Generated for a Return of Stock Items==
Once the purchase return of a stock item at original cost is released on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, the system automatically generates a corresponding inventory issue and releases it immediately; when the inventory issue is released, the availability data for the stock item or items in inventory is updated. For each line with a stock item being returned, the following general ledger transactions are generated on release of the corresponding inventory issue.[anchor|#table_z53_ddy_nv]

In Acumatica ERP, you can process vendor returns if any purchased items need to be returned to the vendor for some reason.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#_98787f81-0ba1-4643-b06c-38354fecbc62]
*Create a purchase return document
*Specify the items to be returned and define at which cost the items will be issued from inventory
*Process the purchase return and the related inventory and accounts payable documents

==Applicable Scenarios==
In most cases, the purchasing process is completed when your company receives the goods and the corresponding accounts payable bill is released to adjust your outstanding balance with the vendor. In some cases, however, items are delivered in an unsatisfactory condition or shipped by mistake and should be returned to the vendor for replacement or reimbursement. A vendor return can also occur when services were not rendered or were provided partially and your company should be reimbursed.{br}

The standard purchase return process includes the creation of a purchase return document, the specification of the returned items and their quantities, the issuing of the returned item from inventory, and the adjustment to the outstanding vendor balance in the system in the returned amount.
==Processing of a Purchase Return==
In general, the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form is the starting point for creating a purchase return, which is a document of the ''Return'' type that includes a line for each item being returned. {br}

You can create a purchase return from the applicable purchase receipt, whether or not it is linked to a purchase order. To do this, you open the purchase receipt, select the unlabeled check boxes on the '''Document Details''' tab for the lines of the items to be returned, and click '''Return''' on the form toolbar. The system copies the relevant information from the purchase receipt to a new purchase return on the form. In the copied line or lines, you must specify the quantity of items to be returned in the '''Receipt Qty.''' column and a reason code of the ''Vendor Return'' usage type in the '''Reason Code '''column. By default, the system inserts the reason code that is selected in the '''PO Return Reason Code''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form. ((({S:Warn}As an alternative to creating a purchase return from a purchase receipt, you can create a new purchase return manually on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] form and add any number of purchase receipts or purchase receipt lines to it by clicking '''Add PR''' or '''Add PR Line''' on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab.
)))
You can process returns for purchase receipt lines with both stock and non-stock items. For each item, you must specify the warehouse (and warehouse location, if applicable) from which the items will be issued to be sent back to the vendor. For stock items with lot or serial numbers, you have to click '''Allocations''' on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab and specify the particular lot or serial numbers for the units being returned. {br}

For purchase return lines that are linked to a purchase order, you can select the '''Open PO Line''' check box on the '''Document Details''' tab to specify that the system should change the status of the related purchase order to ''Open'' on release of the return (if you expect receiving of replacement items for the order and thus want to keep the purchase order open). If the '''Open PO Line''' check box is cleared, the related purchase order remains closed.{br}

After you have specified the purchase return details, you define at which cost the items will be issued from inventory, by selecting or clearing the '''Process Return with Original Cost''' check box. If the check box is selected, the items are issued from inventory at exactly the same cost at which the items were purchased. If the check box is cleared, the items are issued at the cost calculated by the system according to the items&rsquo; valuation methods.{br}

After you have prepared a purchase return document, you need to process issuing of items from inventory and adjust the vendor&rsquo;s balance in the system for the amount of returned items. On release of a purchase return, the inventory issue is generated automatically and can be viewed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form. On release of this issue, the quantities of returned items are deducted from the item quantities available at the specified warehouse. If the purchase receipt for which the return was created is linked to a purchase order, then on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form for the purchase order, the applicable values in the '''Qty. On Receipts''' column are decreased by the quantity of the listed item that is returned. Also, on release of the purchase return, the accounts payable debit adjustment is generated automatically if the '''Create Bill''' check box is selected for the purchase return on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] form. The generated debit adjustment can be viewed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form.{br}

The further processing of a purchase return depends on the agreement between your company and the vendor. You can complete the processing of the return by processing a vendor refund or by receiving replacement items for the original purchase order.
==Workflow of a Purchase Return==
For purchase return documents, the typical processing involves the actions and generated documents shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#_aaf6c295-d9ef-4040-8fad-99112fe61864][anchor|#_897a8d47-197c-40ce-b3fd-f231ea9a0688][image:Shared/Images/diag_OrderMgmt_Purchase_Return.png|popup|450px]]]></column>

The system copies the                     relevant information from the purchase receipt to a new purchase return on the                     form. In the copied line or lines, you must specify the quantity of items to be                     returned in the  Receipt Qty.  column and a reason code of                     the  Vendor Return  usage type in the  Reason Code                      column. By default, the system inserts the reason code that is                     selected in the  PO Return Reason Code  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) Purchase Orders Preferences (PO101000) form.  As an alternative to creating a purchase return from a purchase receipt, you                     can create a new purchase return manually on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts form and add any number of purchase                     receipts or purchase receipt lines to it by clicking  Add                         PR  or  Add PR Line  on the table toolbar of                     the  Document Details  tab. You can process returns for purchase receipt lines with both stock and non-stock                     items. For each item, you must specify the warehouse (and warehouse location, if                     applicable) from which the items will be issued to be sent back to the vendor.

For purchase return lines that are linked to a purchase order, you can select the                          Open PO Line  check box on the  Document                         Details  tab to specify that the system should change the status                     of the related purchase order to  Open  on release of the return (if you                     expect receiving of replacement items for the order and thus want to keep the                     purchase order open). If the  Open PO Line  check box is                     cleared, the related purchase order remains closed. After you have specified the purchase return details, you define at which cost                     the items will be issued from inventory, by selecting or clearing the                          Process Return with Original Cost  check box. If the                     check box is selected, the items are issued from inventory at exactly the same                     cost at which the items were purchased. If the check box is cleared, the items                     are issued at the cost calculated by the system according to the items'                     valuation methods. After you have prepared a purchase return document, you need to process issuing                     of items from inventory and adjust the vendor's balance in the system for the                     amount of returned items. On release of a purchase return, the inventory issue                     is generated automatically and can be viewed on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) Issues (IN302000) form. On release of this                     issue, the quantities of returned items are deducted from the item quantities                     available at the specified warehouse. If the purchase receipt for which the                     return was created is linked to a purchase order, then on the                          Document Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form for the purchase                     order, the applicable values in the  Qty. On Receipts                      column are decreased by the quantity of the listed item that is returned. Also,                     on release of the purchase return, the accounts payable debit adjustment is                     generated automatically if the  Create Bill  check box is                     selected for the purchase return on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts form.

The following sections provide details you can use to ensure that the system is configured properly for the processing of purchase returns at the cost calculated by the system, and to understand (and change, if needed) the settings that affect the processing workflow.{br}{TOC}
==Implementation Checklist==
Before you begin processing returns at the calculated cost, you should make sure the needed settings have been specified, as summarized in the following checklist.[anchor|#_75f5a845-9a95-409c-9ffd-7c022ec672dc]

==Settings that Affect the Workflow==
You can affect the workflow of processing purchase returns at the system-calculated cost by specifying additional settings as follows:[anchor|#_c5f7c2bf-d644-46c7-bf1b-63fd7129a7f3]
*To cause debit adjustments to be automatically created on release of purchase returns, select the '''Create Bill''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form. By default, the state of this check box is copied to each purchase return that is created. If the check box is cleared in a purchase return document, you can select it before releasing a purchase return.
*To set up the system to automatically release debit adjustments that are generated, select the '''Release AP Documents Automatically''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] form.

==Testing of Settings==
To make sure that all settings are configured correctly, we recommend that you process a purchase return at the system-calculated cost, as described in the [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\OrderMgmt_Purchase_Return_Calc_Cost_Process_Activity|Purchase Returns at the Calculated Cost: Process Activity].]]></column>
			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Purchase Returns at the Calculated Cost: Implementation Checklist The following sections provide details you can use to ensure that the system is configured     properly for the processing of purchase returns at the cost calculated by the system, and to     understand (and change, if needed) the settings that affect the processing workflow. Implementation Checklist Before you begin processing returns at the calculated cost, you should make sure the needed     settings have been specified, as summarized in the following checklist. Form Criteria to Check Notes Make sure that the basic inventory and order management preferences are configured, as         described in  Order Management with Inventory Configuration: General Information.  ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) Purchase Orders Preferences (PO101000) form Make sure that the  Process Return with Original Cost  check box         is cleared.  By default, the system copies the state of this check box to each purchase return that         is created. (You can clear this check box in an individual purchase return to mark it for         processing at the calculated cost.) Settings that Affect the Workflow You can affect the workflow of processing purchase returns at the system-calculated cost by     specifying additional settings as follows: To cause debit adjustments to be automatically created on release of purchase returns,       select the  Create Bill  check box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) Purchase Orders Preferences       (PO101000) form. By default, the state of this check box is copied to each purchase return       that is created. If the check box is cleared in a purchase return document, you can select it       before releasing a purchase return. To set up the system to automatically release debit adjustments that are generated, select       the  Release AP Documents Automatically  check box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) Purchase Orders Preferences form. Testing of Settings To make sure that all settings are configured correctly, we recommend that you process a     purchase return at the system-calculated cost, as described in the  Purchase Returns at the Calculated Cost: Process Activity. ]]></column>

==Story==
Suppose that on January 30, 2020, the SweetLife you, acting as a purchasing manager, notice that three packs of paper that were purchased and delivered on January 29, 2020 have been damaged during shipping. You have decided to return these packs to the Spectra Stationery Office vendor without requesting a replacement. You need to create and process a purchase return of the damaged items at the cost calculated by the system.[anchor|#section_rcz_kqm_dlb]
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, the ''Inventory'' feature, which provides the ability to create purchase orders that include stock items, has been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in the system:[anchor|#ul_hpq_qqm_dlb]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form, the ''STATOFFICE'' vendor has been configured.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, the ''PAPER'' stock item have been configured.

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, the purchase order has been created with stationary items ordered from the ''STATOFFICE'' vendor and, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, the related purchase receipt has been created and released.
==Process Overview==
A purchase return document, which represents a vendor return in the system, is prepared based on the applicable purchase receipt. In this activity, to create a purchase return, you will open the purchase receipt on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, and on the '''Document Details''' tab, you will select (by selecting the unlabeled check boxes) the lines of all items to be returned. Then on the form toolbar, you will click '''Return'''; on the same form, the system copies the relevant information to a new document of the ''Return'' type that includes the lines selected for return.{br}

Before you process the prepared purchase return further, on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] form, you will correct the quantities to be returned. In the Summary area, you will specify that the items should be issued from inventory at the cost calculated by the system by clearing the '''Process Return with Original Cost''' check box. You will then release the purchase return and review the related documents to make sure the return has been processed fully in the system.
==System Preparation==
Do the following:[anchor|#_f811a610-8f11-49fe-9fd6-edb04d0e9b26][anchor|#_ea1ca587-d734-453a-8f19-71cab550388f]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded. To sign in as a sales and purchasing manager, use the ''wiley'' login and the ''123'' password.[anchor|#_596d9d6d-470d-4c49-b711-1eaa1a1186ef]
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select ''1/30/2020'' on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.[anchor|#_df29be10-1676-42b6-9cbe-9dab70c5b3f7]
#On the company and branch selection menu, on the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure the ''SweetLife Head Office and Wholesale Center'' branch is selected.

==Step 1: Creating a Purchase Return from the Related Purchase Receipt==
The easiest way to create a purchase return is to start from the purchase receipt in which you received the items to be returned. You create the purchase return from the purchase receipt as follows:[anchor|#_538ae4c2-dd46-4dc8-a1b6-3d6f205c47ea]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, open the purchase receipt to ''STATOFFICE'' dated ''1/29/2020''.
#On the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]), which opens, select the unlabeled check box in the line of the purchase receipt with the ''PAPER'' item.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Return''' to create a purchase return that corresponds to the purchase receipt and includes the selected line. The system creates a document with the ''Return'' type and with appropriate settings copied from the purchase receipt, and opens it on the same form.

==Step 2: Specifying the Settings of the Return ==
Do the following to define the specific settings of the return document:[anchor|#_d2e51864-ea0a-4ee4-bfaf-7a6feee89095]
#While you are still viewing the purchase return that was created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, in the Summary area, make sure that 1/30/2020 is specified as the '''Date'''.
#Clear the '''Process Return with Original Cost''' check box. With this check box cleared, the items will be issued from inventory at the cost calculated by the system.
#Select the '''Create Bill''' check box to make the system generate a debit adjustment automatically on release of the purchase return.
#In the only return line on the '''Document Details''' tab, change the '''Receipt Qty.''' to <tt>3</tt> (which is the quantity of items to be returned).
#In the line, clear the '''Open PO Line''' check box to indicate that no replacement is needed for returned items.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save''' to save the purchase return, which has the ''Balanced'' status and can thus be released.

==Step 3: Releasing the Purchase Return==
Do the following to release the purchase return and to review how the return of items is processed in the system:[anchor|#_7a8ca195-62a3-465b-a468-fbb2904a98b1]
#While you are still viewing the purchase return on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, click '''Release''' on the form toolbar.
#On the '''Billing History''' tab, review the information about the debit adjustment that was prepared, and make sure that it now has a status of ''Open'' (reflecting that it was released).
#On the '''Other Information''' tab, click the '''IN Ref. Nbr.''' link, and review the inventory issue, which is opened on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form. Make sure the issue has a status of ''Released''.
#On '''Purchase Orders''' tab, click the link in the '''Order Nbr.''' column. The system opens the purchase order for which the return was processed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form.
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, in the '''Qty. on Receipts''' column, notice that received quantity in the ''PAPER'' line has been decreased by the returned quantity and is now 17.
#On the '''PO History''' tab, review the documents related to the purchase order, as shown in the following screenshot. The left table shows the purchase receipt and purchase return; the right table shows the bill and the debit adjustment. In the line with the debit adjustment, notice the nonzero purchase price variance amount in the '''PPV Amount''' column, which shows the difference between the amounts at which the items were purchased and at which the items were returned.[anchor|#_510874dc-bb39-4d37-9030-18c447b07450][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_OrderMgmt_Purchase_Return_Calc_Cost.png|popup|Documents related to the purchase order|450px]

The costs of items purchased from vendors may change over time, so the correct costs must be reflected on the purchase return document. To specify that items to be returned should be issued from inventory at the cost calculated by the system according to the items&rsquo; valuation methods, you need to clear the '''Process Return with Original Cost''' check box in the Summary area of the purchase return document on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form. {br}

On release of the purchase return, the system prepares an inventory issue document to update inventory, which you can review on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form, and a debit adjustment to decrease the vendor balance in the system, which you can review on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form. If the calculated cost at the time of the return differs from the cost at which the items were purchased, the purchase price variance difference is posted to general ledger.
==Rules of Cost Calculation==
In the general ledger transactions that are posted during the processing of a purchase return, posted amount is the calculated unit cost of the item multiplied by the returned quantity (which is specified in the '''Receipt Qty.''' column of the purchase return line on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form). The cost is calculated according to the issue rules of the item's valuation method specified for the item in the '''Valuation Method''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. (For instance, for items with ''Average'' as the valuation method, it is the current unit cost calculated at the moment of release of the issue that corresponds to the vendor return. For items with the ''Specific'' valuation method, the return cost is calculated as the accumulated quantity of items in the warehouse divided by the accumulated cost.)
==Transactions Generated for a Return of Stock Items==
Once the purchase return of a stock item at calculated cost is released on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, the system automatically generates a corresponding inventory issue and releases it immediately; when the inventory issue is released, the availability data for the included stock items in inventory is updated. For each line with a stock item being returned, the following general ledger transactions are generated on release of the corresponding inventory issue.[anchor|#table_z53_ddy_nv]

Purchase return lines of this type are added to the inventory issue generated on the release of the purchase return. For a line with a non-stock item, the following general ledger transactions are generated on release of the inventory issue that corresponds to the purchase return.[anchor|#_a90ebea8-db84-411f-87e4-b845aaa016d6]

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Purchase Returns at the Calculated Cost: Generated Transactions The costs of items purchased from vendors may change over time, so the correct costs must be     reflected on the purchase return document. To specify that items to be returned should be issued     from inventory at the cost calculated by the system according to the items' valuation methods,     you need to clear the  Process Return with Original Cost  check box in the     Summary area of the purchase return document on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form.  On release of the purchase return, the system prepares an inventory issue document to update     inventory, which you can review on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) Issues (IN302000) form, and a     debit adjustment to decrease the vendor balance in the system, which you can review on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form. If the calculated cost at the time of the return     differs from the cost at which the items were purchased, the purchase price variance difference     is posted to general ledger. Rules of Cost Calculation In the general ledger transactions that are posted during the processing of a purchase return,     posted amount is the calculated unit cost of the item multiplied by the returned quantity (which     is specified in the  Receipt Qty.  column of the purchase return line on     the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form). The cost is calculated according to the     issue rules of the item's valuation method specified for the item in the  Valuation      Method  box on the  General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form. (For instance, for items with  Average  as the     valuation method, it is the current unit cost calculated at the moment of release of the issue     that corresponds to the vendor return. For items with the  Specific  valuation method, the     return cost is calculated as the accumulated quantity of items in the warehouse divided by the     accumulated cost.) Transactions Generated for a Return of Stock Items Once the purchase return of a stock item at calculated cost is released on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form, the system automatically generates a     corresponding inventory issue and releases it immediately; when the inventory issue is released,     the availability data for the included stock items in inventory is updated. For each line with a     stock item being returned, the following general ledger transactions are generated on release of     the corresponding inventory issue.

Purchase return lines of this type are     added to the inventory issue generated on the release of the purchase return.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
The total cost of goods purchased generally includes the purchase price and additional charges, such as freight or other shipping costs and insurance; for an international shipment, it may also include customs duties and other taxes. All these charges, often referred to as ''landed costs'', affect the total product cost. Landed costs are the costs incurred, beyond the purchase price the vendor charges for the goods, in the process of bringing the goods to one of your company&rsquo;s warehouses. {br}

To accurately calculate the total product cost, you must consider all landed costs. By accurately analyzing total product cost statistics, your company can assign the most appropriate prices to the products you sell. {br}{TOC}
==Landed Cost Code Definition==
In Acumatica ERP, landed cost codes are used to capture various types of landed costs. For each type of landed costs your company may encounter, create a landed cost code to be used to enter and process that type of landed costs. {br}

Most landed costs are not fixed amounts associated with a specific inventory item. Landed costs may be fees, such as for shipping and handling, whose amount depends on the weight, volume, or quantity of items. Accordingly, you need to define how to allocate the incurred amounts among all items in the receipt. The landed cost amounts are ultimately paid to a carrier or customs office—the landed cost vendor—rather than to the vendor that sells the goods. {br}

In Acumatica ERP, you create and maintain landed cost codes by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_20_20_00|Landed Cost Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=PO202000|PO202000]) form. For each code, you specify the following information: [anchor|#ul_vgq_lnx_nv]
*The type of landed cost
*The method of allocating landed cost amounts among the lines of the documents added to landed cost document 
*The reason code to be used in the inventory adjustment that is generated on release of a landed cost document
*The accounts and subaccounts used to accrue landed cost amounts and landed cost variance
*The tax category (if the landed costs are subject to taxes)

A landed cost code is not associated with any specific currency, so if multicurrency support has been enabled in the system, landed costs are considered as specified in the currency of the document. 
==Landed Cost Allocation Method==
The allocation method of a landed cost defines how the landed cost is distributed among lines of the documents specified in the landed cost document. When you are creating a landed cost code for specific type of landed cost, you can select one of the following allocation methods: [anchor|#ul_ljq_lnx_nv]
*''By Quantity'': The landed cost amount is distributed among the document lines in proportion to their quantities. This adds a greater percentage of the landed cost to the goods purchased in the largest quantities. If units of measure (UOMs) other than the base UOMs are specified for items, item quantities are calculated with respect to the base UOMs.
*:((({S:Hint}Use this option for only documents that include similar items with the same base UOM or similar base UOMs. Do not use this option for documents that include disparate items with base units that cannot be compared, such as pallets and tons, or meters and pounds. 
)))
*''By Cost'': The landed cost amount is distributed among the document lines in proportion to their extended cost. The extended cost is calculated based on the item&rsquo;s valuation method. This adds a greater percentage of the landed cost amount to more expensive goods.
*''By Weight'': The landed cost amount is distributed among the inventory items proportionally to their weights. This adds a greater percentage of the landed cost to the goods that weigh the most. The weight of the base unit of the inventory item is specified on the '''Packaging''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form.
*''By Volume'': The landed cost amount is distributed among the applicable items proportionally to their volumes. This adds a greater percentage of the landed cost to goods with more bulk. The volume of the base unit of the inventory item is specified on the '''Packaging''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form.

When you add purchase receipts (or transfer receipts) to a landed cost document, the system automatically allocates the landed cost amounts between the added document lines. The system uses the allocation method to calculate the landed cost amount to be added to the cost of a particular inventory item listed on the adjustment. The system also recalculates the allocated amounts on any changes in the landed cost amounts or document lines to which these amounts are allocated.{br}

On release of the landed cost document, the system generates an inventory adjustment for the inventory items listed in the landed cost document to adjust the items&rsquo; costs.

With Acumatica ERP, your company can track the landed costs incurred for purchased or transferred stock items, to accurately calculate the total costs of the items. Landed costs in Acumatica ERP are processed through landed cost documents. In a landed cost document, you specify the landed cost amounts, and the purchase receipts or transfer receipts, to which these landed cost amounts should be allocated. {br}{TOC}
==General Workflow and Related Documents==
You can add to a single landed cost document either purchase receipts or transfer receipts (but not both types). The type of the added receipts does not affect the landed cost document workflow. The diagram below shows the processing steps for landed cost documents.[anchor|#_53a0eda2-c0f0-4b05-8770-62e7247e53b3][anchor|#_02578cd5-5d6c-4514-b39d-bff4d0f26b40][image:UserGuide/Images/LC_Process.png|popup|450px]
The following sections describe in detail the processing steps shown in the diagram.
==1. Enter the Landed Cost Document==
You create a new landed cost document on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_30_00|Landed Costs] ([~/?ScreenId=PO303000|PO303000]) form. The reference number for the new landed cost document is generated in accordance with the numbering sequence specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form. If the landed cost document is created with the ''On Hold'' status, you should clear the '''Hold''' check box for the document before releasing it.
==2. Add Receipt Lines to which Landed Costs Will Be Allocated==
You add the documents or particular document lines for which the landed costs were incurred by clicking '''Add PO Receipt''' or '''Add PO Receipt Line''' on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_30_00|Landed Costs] ([~/?ScreenId=PO303000|PO303000]) form. You then select the unlabeled check boxes in the rows of the needed lines in the dialog box that opens, and click '''Add&Close''' to add the selected lines. You can add the lines of either purchase receipts or transfer receipts to a landed cost document.
==3. Specify Landed Cost Codes and Amounts==
You add the landed costs to be allocated between the added receipt lines by adding the landed cost code and specifying the amount to be allocated on the '''Landed Costs''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_30_00|Landed Costs] ([~/?ScreenId=PO303000|PO303000]) form. 
==4. Release the Landed Cost Document==
To release the prepared landed cost document, you click '''Release''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_30_00|Landed Costs] ([~/?ScreenId=PO303000|PO303000]) form. Alternatively, you can release multiple landed cost documents at the same time by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_60_00|Release Landed Costs] ([~/?ScreenId=PO506000|PO506000]) form. {br}

When the landed cost document is released, the system automatically generates a corresponding inventory adjustment (one for each landed cost code) to update the cost of items in inventory. You can view the generated inventory adjustment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_30_00|Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=IN303000|IN303000]) form.
==5. Release the Inventory Adjustment==
The generated inventory adjustment is released automatically if the '''Release LC IN Adjustments Automatically''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form. If this check box is cleared, you have to release the inventory adjustment manually by clicking '''Release''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_30_00|Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=IN303000|IN303000]) form. {br}

On release of the inventory adjustment, a batch of GL transactions is generated. The costs of inventory items are updated according to the items&rsquo; valuation methods, as described in the [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_Updating_Cost_by_LC|Adding Landed Costs to Items' Costs].
==6. Prepare the Accounts Payable Bill==
If the '''Create Bill''' check box is selected in the landed cost document on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_30_00|Landed Costs] ([~/?ScreenId=PO303000|PO303000]) form, when you release the landed cost document, the system generates an AP bill to the landed cost vendor automatically. {br}

Otherwise, you need to prepare the bill from the purchase receipt by clicking '''Actions &gt; Enter AP Bill''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form. Alternatively, you can create a new AP bill manually on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form and add or link the lines of the landed cost document to the bill. For more information on the processing of AP bills, see [HelpRoot_Financials\Finance_ProcessingAPBills_Mapref|Processing AP Bills].{br}

If the exact amount of the landed costs has changed, in the generated AP bill, you can manually adjust the amount of the landed costs. Any difference will be posted to dedicated accounts, as described in the [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_LC_Postponed|Adjusting the Landed Cost Variance].

Release the Inventory Adjustment The generated inventory adjustment is released automatically if the 					 Release LC IN Adjustments Automatically  check box is 				selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) Purchase Orders Preferences (PO101000) form. If this check box 				is cleared, you have to release the inventory adjustment manually by clicking 					 Release  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN303000|IN303000]) Adjustments (IN301000) form.  On release of the inventory adjustment, a batch of GL transactions is generated. The 				costs of inventory items are updated according to the items' valuation methods, as 				described in the  Adding Landed Costs to Items' Costs. 6. Prepare the Accounts Payable Bill If the  Create Bill  check box is selected in the landed cost 				document on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO303000|PO303000]) Landed Costs (PO303000) form, when you release 				the landed cost document, the system generates an AP bill to the landed cost vendor 				automatically.  Otherwise, you need to prepare the bill from the purchase receipt by clicking  Actions > Enter AP Bill  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form. Alternatively, you can create a new AP bill 				manually on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form and add or link the 				lines of the landed cost document to the bill. For more information on the 				processing of AP bills, see  Processing AP Bills. If the exact amount of the landed costs has changed, in the generated AP bill, you 				can manually adjust the amount of the landed costs. Any difference will be posted to 				dedicated accounts, as described in the  Adjusting the Landed Cost Variance. ]]></column>

Some landed costs, such as freight, are typically known when the goods are received. Other types of landed costs may become known later, when a bill from the service provider is received. When you need to enter the landed costs of a specific type in a landed cost document, if the exact amount of the landed costs is not known yet, you can enter the estimated amount for the appropriate landed cost code in the landed cost document on the '''Landed Costs''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_30_00|Landed Costs] ([~/?ScreenId=PO303000|PO303000]) tab. {br}

Later, when the exact amount becomes known, you can manually adjust the amount of the landed costs in the accounts payable bill generated for the landed cost document, and release the bill. The difference between the estimated amount and the adjusted amount is automatically added to the Landed Cost Variance account specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_20_20_00|Landed Cost Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=PO202000|PO202000]) form for the landed cost used on the original receipt. {br}

The following accounts are involved in the GL transactions that are generated on release of the AP bill to the landed cost vendor:[anchor|#_47388038-5957-4c9a-9aae-86ce280882c3]
*Accounts Payable account of the landed cost vendor
*Landed Cost Accrual account of the landed cost code
*Landed Cost Variance account of the landed cost code

On release of the AP bill to the landed cost vendor, if the landed cost amount specified in the landed cost document hasn&rsquo;t been changed, the following general ledger transactions are posted:[anchor|#_f053a904-650d-4fa9-a144-2906891e82ea]
*Accounts Payable account: Cr, landed cost amount
*Landed Cost Accrual account: Dr, landed cost amount

On release of the AP bill to landed cost vendor, if the landed cost amount has been changed in the bill, the following general ledger transactions are posted:[anchor|#_b5b45459-974d-4bd0-b672-76b90a770cf1]
*Accounts Payable account: Cr, bill amount
*Landed Cost Accrual account: Cr, correction amount
*Landed Cost Variance account of the landed cost code: Dr, correction amount
*Landed Cost Accrual account: Dr, bill amount

On release of the landed cost document, the system generates the inventory adjustment that updates the items&rsquo; cost in inventory according to the allocated landed cost amounts and the valuation method of these items. The following sections describe how the system updates costs for the items of purchase receipts and transfer receipts.{br}{TOC}
==Cost Updating When Landed Costs Are Allocated to Purchase Receipts==
Upon release, an inventory adjustment updates the inventory costs of items differently depending on the valuation method of the item: [anchor|#ul_z4p_g3z_xv]
*For inventory items with the ''FIFO'' or ''Specific'' valuation method, the cost on the particular cost layer (created by the purchase receipt) is updated as follows: 
**If the layer still has the original quantity, the cost of all items on the layer is updated, and the landed cost amount from the Landed Cost Accrual account is transferred to the Inventory account assigned to the item.
**If the current quantity on the layer is less than the original quantity, the landed cost amount is moved from the Landed Cost Accrual account to update the Landed Cost Variance account of the stock item and the Inventory account in proportion with the sold and unsold quantities, respectively. (If you need to adjust the sales account on release of the inventory adjustment, you can use the same account for the COGS account and the Landed Cost Variance account.)
*For items with the ''Average'' valuation method, the landed cost amount from the Landed Cost Accrual account is transferred to the Inventory account assigned to the item and updates the average cost of the unit.
*:((({S:Warn}At the moment of inventory adjustment release, if some of the units listed on the purchase receipt were sold, the landed cost amount updates both the Landed Cost Variance account of the stock item and the Inventory account of the stock item proportionally to the unsold and sold quantities (as on the original purchase receipt), respectively. 
)))
*For items with the ''Standard Cost'' valuation method, the amount from the Landed Cost Accrual account is moved to the Landed Cost Variance account of the stock item.

==Cost Updating When Landed Costs Are Allocated to Transfer Receipts==
Upon release, an inventory adjustment updates the inventory costs of items differently depending on the valuation method of the item as follows: [anchor|#_1fcd950e-fbf4-4714-9131-83eacfc1a047]
*For items with the ''Standard cost'' valuation method, the landed cost amount is moved from the Landed Cost Accrual account to the Standard Cost Variance account. The following transactions are generated:
**Standard Cost Accrual account: Cr, landed cost amount
**COGS account: Dr, landed cost amount
*For items with the ''Average'' cost valuation method, the landed cost amount moved from the Landed Cost Accrual account to the Inventory account (determined by the posting class of the item) updates the average cost of the unit. The following transactions are generated:
**Landed Cost Accrual account: Cr, landed cost amount
**Inventory account: Dr, landed cost amount
*:((({S:Warn}At the moment of the release of the inventory adjustment, if some of the units (listed on the transfer receipt) were sold, the landed cost amount updates both the COGS account and the Inventory account of the item proportionally to the unsold and sold quantities (as specified on the original transfer receipt), respectively. 
)))
*For inventory items with the ''FIFO'' or ''Specific'' valuation method, the system creates a new cost layer based on the transfer receipt (this layer has the date and the quantity from the transfer receipt) and the amounts moved between accounts vary as follows, based on the quantity of the layer:
**If the layer still has the original quantity, the cost of all items in the layer is updated, and the landed cost amount from the Landed Cost Accrual account is transferred to the Inventory account assigned to the item.
**If the current quantity in the layer is less than the original quantity on the receipt, the landed cost amount is moved from the Landed Cost Accrual account to update the COGS account and the Inventory account in proportion to the sold and unsold quantities, respectively.

==An Example of Cost Updating for a Transferred FIFO Item ==
If a stock item with the ''FIFO'' valuation method was transferred from one warehouse to another, a new cost layer for the transferred quantity is created with the date of the transfer receipt. {br}

The history of receipts in the table below illustrates how the landed costs update the cost of the transferred item with the ''FIFO'' valuation method.[anchor|#_5587037c-9916-4c36-a31b-40b79f497856]

The purchase price variance (PPV) amount is the difference between an item&rsquo;s actual unit cost on a purchase receipt (calculated as the item extended cost divided by its quantity) and its actual unit cost on a bill (calculated as the extended cost divided by the quantity on the bill) multiplied by the quantity of the item on the bill. ((({S:Warn} In Acumatica ERP, on purchase orders, purchase receipts, inventory receipts, and bills, the purchase prices of items are referred to as ''costs''. 
)))
The difference may occur due to various reasons, such as exchange rate fluctuations or unplanned changes in the vendor price or delivery costs. Different businesses may use different approaches when accounting for the purchase price variance amounts. The topic describes the options available in Acumatica ERP for allocation of the purchase price variance amounts for stock items.{br}{TOC}
==PPV Calculation==
 Generally, the actual vendor prices and discounts may change frequently, and when you enter a purchase receipt on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form and specify an item by its inventory ID, the exact vendor price and applicable discounts are not known. Even if the unit cost appears automatically in the '''Unit Cost''' column, you can manually enter only the item quantity and the extended cost (which may include the vendor&rsquo;s current promotional price and discount for the specified quantity not yet configured in the system); the extended cost will not be recalculated based on the unit cost. For the PPV calculation, the system will use the actual unit cost (calculated as the extended amount per unit), not the unit cost that is available in the system and was inserted automatically. {br}

When you enter a related bill by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form, you know the prices and any additional costs, and you can reflect them on the bill. On release of a bill that is linked to the purchase receipt, the system calculates the purchase price variance amount for each line item as follows:[anchor|#ul_hnx_yfs_4t]
* Calculates the unit&rsquo;s actual cost on the purchase receipt as the extended cost on the purchase receipt divided by the quantity
* Calculates the unit&rsquo;s actual cost on the bill as the extended cost on the bill divided by the quantity on the bill
* Subtracts the unit&rsquo;s actual cost on the bill from the unit&rsquo;s actual cost on the receipt
* Multiplies the difference by the quantity on the bill

For example, the following documents (a purchase receipt and the AP bill linked to the receipt) were entered into the system.[anchor|#table_kry_w4s_4t]
===Receipt Details===
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="33%" ! Item
!width="33%" ! Quantity
!width="33%" ! Extended Cost
|- 
| New Item1
| 20
| 4500
|- 
| New Item2
| 30
| 9000
|}[anchor|#table_nl5_3ps_4t]
===Bill Details===
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="33%" ! Item
!width="33%" ! Quantity
!width="33%" ! Extended Cost
|- 
| New Item1
| 10
| 2000
|- 
| New Item2
| 30
| 9900
|}{br}

The PPV amounts are calculated as follows:[anchor|#table_wth_gqs_4t]
===PPV Calculation===
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="33%" ! Item
!width="33%" ! Quantity
!width="33%" ! PPV
|- 
| New Item1
| 10
| 250
|- 
| New Item2
| 30
| -900
|}
The ways the calculated PPV amounts can be allocated depend on the item valuation method and the selected allocation mode and are described in the following sections.
==PPV Allocation for Exchange Rate Changes==
By default, in a purchase receipt, the system inserts the currency rate that is current on the purchase receipt date. If needed, you can override the default currency rate if all of the following are true:[anchor|#_4917e597-18d0-4813-a652-0f68e58d618a]
*The ''Multi-Currency Accounting'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
*The '''Allow Changing Currency Rate on Receipt''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form.
*The '''Enable Rate Override''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form for the vendor specified in the purchase receipt.

The system will use the new exchange rate for calculating the unit cost of the items in the inventory receipt that it creates on release of the current purchase receipt. {br}

On release of an AP bill that is linked to this purchase receipt, the system calculates the purchase price variance amount for each line item as follows:[anchor|#_083759b9-30af-4012-8934-821fb782dd0e]
*Calculates the unit&rsquo;s actual cost on the purchase receipt based on the exchange rate of the purchase receipt
* Calculates the unit&rsquo;s actual cost on the bill based on the exchange rate of the bill
* Subtracts the unit&rsquo;s actual cost on the bill from the unit&rsquo;s actual cost on the receipt
* Multiplies the difference by the quantity on the bill

==PPV Allocation for Items with Standard Costs==
For stock items with ''Standard'' assigned as the cost valuation method on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, any PPV amounts are allocated to the Purchase Price Variance account defined by the posting class of the item. For more information, see the '''Standard Cost Valuation Method''' section of the [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Item_Costs_and_Valuation_Methods|Item Costs and Valuation Methods] topic.
==PPV Allocation Modes for Items with Other Valuation Methods==
In Acumatica ERP, you can select how you want to process the purchase price variance amounts for stock items with the following valuation methods: ''Average'', ''FIFO'', or ''Specific''. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form, you can select one of the following modes of PPV allocation:[anchor|#ul_l14_yys_hs]
*''Inventory Account'': To record the variance to the inventory accounts to update the item costs. If you select this mode, you also need to select the reason code (in the adjacent box) that will provide the expense accounts and subaccounts used for the allocation of the PPV amounts.
*''Purchase Price Variance Account'': To record any variance amounts to the purchase price variance accounts to be further processed as additional expenses. 

The modes of PPV allocation are discussed in detail in the sections below.
==The Inventory Account Mode of PPV Allocation==
If the ''Inventory Account'' mode is selected as the mode of PPV allocation, on release of a bill, an inventory adjustment for the PPV amounts is generated automatically. You can view the reference number of the adjustment in the '''PPV Ref. Nbr.''' column on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] form.{br}

Consider a few scenarios that may occur with a received stock item (with no lot or serial numbers) when the bill is released:[anchor|#ul_iq1_trt_hs]
*If no units of the item have been issued from a warehouse since the item was received, this adjustment debits the inventory account of the item for the positive variance amount and credits the PO Accrual account (or credits the inventory account for the negative amount and debits the PO Accrual account for the same amount). See [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_PPV_Scenario1|Purchase Price Variance Allocation: Example 1].
*If all the units of the item have been issued from a warehouse before the bill has been created and an adjustment has been generated, this adjustment debits the variance amount to the expense account associated with the reason code. 
*If some (but not all) of the units of the item have been issued from the warehouse, the adjustment distributes the variance amount proportionally between the quantity of units issued and the quantity of units still in the warehouse, and allocates the respective amounts to the expense account (associated with the reason code) and to the inventory account. For details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_PPV_Scenario2|Purchase Price Variance Allocation: Example 2].
*:((({S:Warn}If multiple bills are created for partial quantities of items from a receipt and certain quantities of the items (from that receipt) have been issued from the warehouse, the PPV amounts on each adjustment generated for a partial bill are allocated between the inventory accounts and the expense accounts in the same proportion in which the original quantities from the receipt are distributed between the quantities issued and the quantities still in stock.
)))
((({S:Warn}If a PPV adjustment would result in negative balance of the inventory account, the adjustment amount is posted to the expense account. 
)))
If you need to reverse the bill linked to the receipt, you can do this only if the adjustment has been released. On reversal of the bill, no new adjustment is created to revert the original adjustment—the original adjustment remains in the system. If you then create a second bill for the same purchase receipt, the system generates a new adjustment that adjusts the first (original) adjustment.
==The Purchase Price Variance Account Mode of PPV Allocation==
If ''Purchase Price Variance Account'' is selected as the mode of PPV allocation, on release of a bill, the entire PPV amount is recorded to the Purchase Price Variance account defined by the posting class of the item.

The Inventory Account Mode of PPV Allocation If the  Inventory Account  mode is selected as the mode of PPV allocation, on release         of a bill, an inventory adjustment for the PPV amounts is generated automatically. You can         view the reference number of the adjustment in the  PPV Ref. Nbr.          column on the  Document Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments form. Consider a few scenarios that may occur with a received stock item (with no lot or serial         numbers) when the bill is released: If no units of the item have been issued from a warehouse since the item was received,           this adjustment debits the inventory account of the item for the positive variance amount           and credits the PO Accrual account (or credits the inventory account for the negative           amount and debits the PO Accrual account for the same amount). See  Purchase Price Variance Allocation: Example 1. If all the units of the item have been issued from a warehouse before the bill has been           created and an adjustment has been generated, this adjustment debits the variance amount           to the expense account associated with the reason code.  If some (but not all) of the units of the item have been issued from the warehouse, the           adjustment distributes the variance amount proportionally between the quantity of units           issued and the quantity of units still in the warehouse, and allocates the respective           amounts to the expense account (associated with the reason code) and to the inventory           account. For details, see  Purchase Price Variance Allocation: Example 2. If multiple             bills are created for partial quantities of items from a receipt and certain quantities             of the items (from that receipt) have been issued from the warehouse, the PPV amounts on             each adjustment generated for a partial bill are allocated between the inventory             accounts and the expense accounts in the same proportion in which the original             quantities from the receipt are distributed between the quantities issued and the             quantities still in stock. If a PPV adjustment would result in negative balance of the inventory account, the         adjustment amount is posted to the expense account.  If you need to reverse the bill linked to the receipt, you can do this only if the         adjustment has been released. On reversal of the bill, no new adjustment is created to         revert the original adjustment—the original adjustment remains in the system. If you then         create a second bill for the same purchase receipt, the system generates a new adjustment         that adjusts the first (original) adjustment. The Purchase Price Variance Account Mode of PPV Allocation If  Purchase Price Variance Account  is selected as the mode of PPV allocation, on         release of a bill, the entire PPV amount is recorded to the Purchase Price Variance account         defined by the posting class of the         item .

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
An organization may want to pursue a clear, cost-efficient purchasing process that prioritizes the purchase of items from the most appropriate vendors at the best possible time and in the right quantities. To facilitate this process, an organization can use purchase requests and requisitions—that is, documents that track the items the organization wants to purchase from vendors. In Acumatica ERP, you can create requests, create purchase requisitions based on these requests, and solicit bids from multiple vendors so that your personnel can select the best bid.{br}

To use the requisition functionality, you must have the ''Purchase Requisitions'' feature enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

In this topic, you will find information about the basic process of purchase requisitions in Acumatica ERP.{br}{TOC}
==Request Classes in Acumatica ERP==
A request class is an entity in Acumatica ERP that contains the general settings for requests of a particular type. You can create a request class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_20_10_00|Request Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ201000|RQ201000]) form and specify the following settings for the class:[anchor|#ul_vf2_yhl_wfb]
*What the promised lead time is: In the '''Promised Lead Time (days)''' box (Summary area), you specify the number of days within which a request of the class should be fulfilled.
*Whether requests of the class are external or internal: External requests contain items requested by customers of your organization. To indicate that the request class will be used for external requests, you select the '''Customer Request''' check box in the Summary area. Internal requests are initiated by employees of your organization and contain items that the employees need in their work.
*Whether the items from a request of the class can be divided among multiple vendors: If a request contains multiple items, you can order these items from multiple vendors if one vendor cannot fulfill the entire request or if another vendor has lower prices for particular items. You select the '''Allow Multiple Vendors per Request''' check box, also in the Summary area, to indicate that the system can suggest multiple vendors to fulfill the request.
*Which items are available for ordering in requests of this class (optional): You can restrict the list of items that users can add to the request during creation to reduce the probability of mistakenly added items. To do this, you select the '''Restrict Requests Items to the Specified List''' check box in the Summary area, and you add the items to the list on the '''Request Class Item List''' tab.
*Whether the request must be validated against the budget: If you control expenses on particular items by using budgets, you can set up budget validation on the '''GL Accounts''' tab by selecting ''Warning'' or ''Error'' in the '''Budget Validation''' box (the default setting is ''None'') and specifying an expense account in the '''Expense Account''' box (and the corresponding subaccount, if applicable, in the '''Expense Sub. '''box).

==Purchase Requisition Usage==
In a simple case of using purchase requests and requisitions, you create one request or multiple requests, and then you create a purchase requisition based on the requests, manually select a vendor, and purchase items from this vendor (see the following diagram). You can use this simplified process, for example, when employees of your organization order low-cost items, such as office supplies. If you already work with a vendor that gives your company the best prices and discounts for these items, you do not need to gather bids from multiple vendors to save on price.[anchor|#fig_cv1_nq3_chb][anchor|#image_dv1_nq3_chb][image:UserGuide/Images/Requisition_Internal.png|popup|Overview of the simplified requisition process|450px]
If your organization works with multiple vendors that provide you with the same type of items (such as computers), you can request and process vendor bids to select the best offers. For example, if you have received an order for laptops from your employees, you can find a vendor or multiple vendors with the lowest prices to fulfill the order.{br}

Depending on the business processes of your organization, you can use budget validation for requests or approvals for requests and requisitions to secure the purchase requisitions process against fraud and unnecessary expenses. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\RQ__con_Extended_Requisitions|Extended Purchase Requisition Process].
==Basic Purchase Requisition Process==
The basic purchase requisition process includes the following steps (also shown in the diagrams below):[anchor|#ol_v1c_wfk_wfb]
#Creating a request: You create a request by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_10_00|Requests] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ301000|RQ301000]) form.

==Creation of a Purchase Requisition Document==
After the requests have been created, you create a requisition document. You can include multiple requests in one requisition if the items in these requests will be ordered from the same vendors. For creating a requisition, you can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_50_40_00|Create Requisitions] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ504000|RQ504000]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_20_00|Requisitions] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ302000|RQ302000]) form. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_50_40_00|Create Requisitions] form, you can create any number of requisitions. While on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_20_00|Requisitions] form, you can fully process a requisition (from creation to release).{br}

When the system is creating a requisition, it can merge lines with the same items into one line if the item was requested by the same requester (a customer or an employee) and has the same estimated unit cost. If you want the system to merge items in all requisitions, you can select the '''Merge Lines by Default''' check box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_10_10_00|Purchase Requisitions Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ101000|RQ101000]) form. Before you create any requisitions on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_50_40_00|Create Requisitions] form, you can select the '''Merge Lines''' check box in the Selection area to merge items for created requisitions, or clear the check box to not merge items.{br}

If a requisition has already been created, you can merge lines manually on the '''Document Details''' tab of the Requisitions form by selecting the Included check box for the lines in the list and clicking '''Merge Lines''' on the table toolbar.((({S:Warn}With manual merging in this way, the system will merge lines even if they have different unit costs and requesters. For external requests, we do not recommend that you merge items requested by different customers, because this may cause sales documents to be linked incorrectly to purchase requisitions.
)))
==Sending of Requests for Proposals==
If you have email functionality configured in the system, you can automatically send requests for proposals to vendors by email by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_20_00|Requisitions] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ302000|RQ302000]) form. To do this, on the '''Bidding''' tab, you select a vendor in the '''Bidding Vendors''' table and click '''Send Request'''. Alternatively, you can send requests to all vendors at once by clicking '''Vendor Notifications''' > '''Send All Requests''' on the form toolbar.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Basic Purchase Requisition Process An organization may want to pursue a clear, cost-efficient purchasing process that prioritizes     the purchase of items from the most appropriate vendors at the best possible time and in the     right quantities. To facilitate this process, an organization can use purchase requests and     requisitions—that is, documents that track the items the organization wants to purchase     from vendors. In  Acumatica ERP,     you can create requests, create purchase requisitions based on these requests, and solicit bids     from multiple vendors so that your personnel can select the best bid. To use the requisition functionality, you must have the  Purchase Requisitions  feature     enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. In this topic, you will find information about the basic process of purchase requisitions in       Acumatica ERP. Request Classes in  Acumatica ERPA request class is an entity in  Acumatica ERP     that contains the general settings for requests of a particular type. You can create a request     class on the   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ201000|RQ201000]) Request Classes (RQ201000) form and specify the following settings     for the class: What the promised lead time is: In the  Promised Lead Time (days)  box      (Summary area), you specify the number of days within which a request of the class should be      fulfilled. Whether requests of the class are external or internal: External requests contain items      requested by customers of your organization. To indicate that the request class will be used      for external requests, you select the  Customer Request  check box in the      Summary area. Internal requests are initiated by employees of your organization and contain      items that the employees need in their work. Whether the items from a request of the class can be divided among multiple vendors: If a      request contains multiple items, you can order these items from multiple vendors if one vendor      cannot fulfill the entire request or if another vendor has lower prices for particular items.      You select the  Allow Multiple Vendors per Request  check box, also in the      Summary area, to indicate that the system can suggest multiple vendors to fulfill the      request. Which items are available for ordering in requests of this class (optional): You can      restrict the list of items that users can add to the request during creation to reduce the      probability of mistakenly added items. To do this, you select the  Restrict Requests       Items to the Specified List  check box in the Summary area, and you add the items      to the list on the  Request Class Item List  tab. Whether the request must be validated against the budget: If you control expenses on      particular items by using budgets, you can set up budget validation on the  GL       Accounts  tab by selecting  Warning  or  Error  in the  Budget       Validation  box (the default setting is  None ) and specifying an expense      account in the  Expense Account  box (and the corresponding subaccount, if      applicable, in the  Expense Sub.  box). Purchase Requisition Usage In a simple case of using purchase requests and requisitions, you create one request or     multiple requests, and then you create a purchase requisition based on the requests, manually     select a vendor, and purchase items from this vendor (see the following diagram). You can use     this simplified process, for example, when employees of your organization order low-cost items,     such as office supplies. If you already work with a vendor that gives your company the best     prices and discounts for these items, you do not need to gather bids from multiple vendors to     save on price. Overview of the simplified requisition process If your organization works with multiple vendors that provide you with the same type of items     (such as computers), you can request and process vendor bids to select the best offers. For     example, if you have received an order for laptops from your employees, you can find a vendor or     multiple vendors with the lowest prices to fulfill the order. Depending on the business processes of your organization, you can use budget validation for     requests or approvals for requests and requisitions to secure the purchase requisitions process     against fraud and unnecessary expenses. For more information, see  Extended Purchase Requisition Process. Basic Purchase Requisition Process The basic purchase requisition process includes the following steps (also shown in the     diagrams below): Creating a request: You create a request by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ301000|RQ301000]) Requests      (RQ301000) form. Creating a purchase requisition based on one request or multiple requests: You create a      purchase requisition on the   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ504000|RQ504000]) Create Requisitions (RQ504000) form. Sending proposals to vendors by email (optional): You automatically send requests for      proposals to vendors by email by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ302000|RQ302000]) Requisitions      (RQ302000) form. Selecting a vendor (or multiple vendors) for the purchase:  If you manually select a vendor (or multiple vendors for different items) for the        requisition, you use the   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ302000|RQ302000]) Requisitions form. If you have run automatic bidding, you analyze and correct the automatic bidding results        by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ503000|RQ503000]) Complete Bidding (RQ503000) form. For details on selecting vendors, see  Processing and Selection of Bids. Creating all needed purchase orders (and, optionally, all needed sales orders for external      requests): You create these orders by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ302000|RQ302000]) Requisitions form. Sending all purchase orders that have been created to the applicable vendors: By using the         ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form, you send the created purchase order or orders      to the vendor or vendors selected to fulfill the requisition. Receiving items in a warehouse: You create and process the documents related to the items      being received in a warehouse by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders and   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) forms. Providing items to requesters: For external requests, you use the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) and   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) forms to      create and process the documents for shipping items to customers. For internal requests, you      can create and process the documents for issuing items to employees of your organization by      using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) Issues (IN302000) form. Overview of requisition process with bids (part 1) Overview of requisition process with bids (part 2) Creation of a Purchase Requisition Document After the requests have been created, you create a requisition document. You can include     multiple requests in one requisition if the items in these requests will be ordered from the     same vendors. For creating a requisition, you can use the   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ504000|RQ504000]) Create Requisitions     (RQ504000) or   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ302000|RQ302000]) Requisitions (RQ302000) form. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ504000|RQ504000]) Create Requisitions form, you can create any number of requisitions. While on the   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ302000|RQ302000]) Requisitions form, you can fully process a requisition (from creation to     release). When the system is creating a requisition, it can merge lines with the same items into one     line if the item was requested by the same requester (a customer or an employee) and has the     same estimated unit cost.

In this topic, you will read about the extended process of purchase requisitions.{br}{TOC}
==Advanced Purchase Requisition Process==
The purchasing process that involves budget validation and approval of requests and requisitions includes the following steps (also shown in the diagrams below):[anchor|#ol_v1c_wfk_wfb]
#Creating a request: You create a request by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_10_00|Requests] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ301000|RQ301000]) form.
#Validating a request against a budget: You analyze the validation results on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_10_00|Requests] form and correct the list of items if the request cost exceeds the budget.
#Approving the request: The employee that is assigned as the request approver approves or rejects the request by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_10_00|Requests] form.
#Creating a purchase requisition based on one request or multiple requests: You create a purchase requisition on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_50_40_00|Create Requisitions] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ504000|RQ504000]) form.
#Approving the requisition: The assigned requisition approver approves or rejects the requisition by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_10_00|Requests] form.
#Sending notifications to vendors: On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_20_00|Requisitions] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ302000|RQ302000]) form, you send a request for proposal to each vendor that may opt to participate in bidding by clicking the vendor on the '''Bidding''' tab (in the '''Bidding Vendors''' table) and clicking '''Send Request''' on the table toolbar.
#Entering vendor responses: You enter vendor responses into the system by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_30_00|Bidding Responses] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ303000|RQ303000]) form.
#Running automatic bidding: On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_50_30_00|Complete Bidding] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ503000|RQ503000]) form, you run automatic bidding among vendors.
#Selecting a vendor (or multiple vendors) for the purchase: You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_20_00|Requisitions] form to manually select a vendor (or multiple vendors for different items) for the requisition. If you have run automatic bidding, you analyze and correct the automatic bidding results by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_50_30_00|Complete Bidding] form.
#Creating all needed purchase orders (and, optionally, all needed sales orders for external requests): You create these orders from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_20_00|Requisitions] form.
#Sending all purchase orders that have been created to the applicable vendors: By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, you send the created purchase order or orders to the vendor or vendors selected to fulfill the requisition.
#Receiving items in a warehouse: You create and process the documents related to the items being received in a warehouse by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] and [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) forms.
#Providing items to requesters: For external requests, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) forms to create and process the documents for shipping items to customers. For internal requests, you create and process the documents for issuing items to employees of your organization by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form.

==Request and Requisition Approvals==
In the system, you can create approval maps so that requests that meet particular criteria are submitted for approval to the appropriate employees. For example, if the total cost of the items in a request exceeds a particular amount, the request must be approved by the head of the department whose employee requested the items.{br}

You can configure the system so that particular requisitions or all requisitions require approval. For example, approval can be set up so that all requisitions that contain computer equipment that costs more than a particular amount must be approved by the IT department before purchasing can take place.{br}

Before you turn on the approval of requests and requisitions, you should make sure that the needed approval maps and notification templates (if needed) have been configured. The approval map defines the employees designated for approving documents and the conditions that the documents must meet (if applicable) to be assigned for approval; the template of the notification email will be used by the system for notifying approvers about the documents pending their approval.{br}

You then enable the approval of purchase requests or requisitions on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_10_10_00|Purchase Requisitions Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ101000|RQ101000]) form by selecting the appropriate '''Require Approval''' check box (in the '''Request Settings''' or '''Requisition Settings''' section). Then on the '''Approval''' tab of this form, for each document type (request or requisition), you specify the approval map and, optionally, the template of the notification email. For the step-by-step instruction, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\RQ__how_Set_Up_Approval|To Set Up Approval of Requests and Requisitions].{br}

With approvals turned on, when a purchase request or requisition that is subject to approval has been created, taken off hold, and saved, the document is assigned the ''Pending Approval'' status. The responsible approver receives an email notification (if an email notification template has been specified for this type of document) about the document pending approval. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) form, an approver can review the list of documents pending approval, and can select one record or multiple records in the list and approve or reject all selected records.((({S:Warn}To be able to approve requests and requisitions, an approver must have access to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_10_00|Requests] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ301000|RQ301000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_20_00|Requisitions] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ302000|RQ302000]) forms accordingly.
)))
If the document is approved, the system assigns it the ''Open'' status, and document processing can continue.{br}

If the document is rejected, it is assigned the ''Rejected'' status, and you cannot continue processing the document. You can edit the document after you select the '''Hold''' check box on the corresponding form.
==Budget Validation for Requests==
If your organization allocates budgets for valuable internal purchases, you can configure budget validation for requests to prevent cost overruns of requested goods and services. An employee who is creating a request can see whether the cost of the items included in the request is below the budget. If the cost exceeds the budget, the employee can edit the list of items in the request.{br}

Before you set up this validation, you should make sure that the budgets have been created and released in the system on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_30_20_10|Budgets] ([~/?ScreenId=GL302010|GL302010]) form.{br}

The setup of budget validation for requests includes the following tasks:[anchor|#ol_znk_vdl_wfb]
#Defining the way the system will calculate the costs of items included in a request: On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_10_10_00|Purchase Requisitions Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ101000|RQ101000]) form, in the '''Budget Ledger''' box of the '''General Settings''' tab, you select the budget ledger that the system will use for verification. You can also specify the time period over which the system will aggregate amounts from all requests created. In the '''Budget Calculation''' box, you select one of the following options:
#*''YTD Values'': Calculates the total cost of requests created from the beginning of the financial year to the end of the current financial period
#*''PTD Values'': Calculates the total cost of requests created from the beginning of the financial period
#*''Annual'': Calculates the total cost of requests created for the current calendar year
#Turning on budget validation in the settings of each needed request class: On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_20_10_00|Request Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ201000|RQ201000]) form, you turn on budget validation by selecting the appropriate option in the '''Budget Validation''' box of the '''GL Accounts''' tab. (The default setting is ''None''.) If you select ''Warning'', a user will be able to save a request of this class even if the requested amount exceeds the budgeted amount, but the system will display a warning. If you select ''Error'', a user will not be able to save a request of this class with an amount that exceeds the budgeted amount, and the system will display an error message.

Approving the request: The employee that is assigned as the request approver approves or      rejects the request by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) Approvals (EP503010) or   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ301000|RQ301000]) Requests form. Creating a purchase requisition based on one request or multiple requests: You create a      purchase requisition on the   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ504000|RQ504000]) Create Requisitions (RQ504000) form. Approving the requisition: The assigned requisition approver approves or rejects the      requisition by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) Approvals or   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ301000|RQ301000]) Requests      form. Sending notifications to vendors: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ302000|RQ302000]) Requisitions (RQ302000) form,      you send a request for proposal to each vendor that may opt to participate in bidding by      clicking the vendor on the  Bidding  tab (in the  Bidding       Vendors  table) and clicking  Send Request  on the table      toolbar. Entering vendor responses: You enter vendor responses into the system by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ303000|RQ303000]) Bidding Responses (RQ303000) form. Running automatic bidding: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ503000|RQ503000]) Complete Bidding (RQ503000) form, you run      automatic bidding among vendors. Selecting a vendor (or multiple vendors) for the purchase: You use the   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ302000|RQ302000]) Requisitions form to manually select a vendor (or multiple vendors for different      items) for the requisition. If you have run automatic bidding, you analyze and correct the      automatic bidding results by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ503000|RQ503000]) Complete Bidding form. Creating all needed purchase orders (and, optionally, all needed sales orders for external      requests): You create these orders from the   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ302000|RQ302000]) Requisitions form. Sending all purchase orders that have been created to the applicable vendors: By using the         ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form, you send the created purchase order or orders      to the vendor or vendors selected to fulfill the requisition. Receiving items in a warehouse: You create and process the documents related to the items      being received in a warehouse by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders and   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) forms. Providing items to requesters: For external requests, you use the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) and   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) forms to      create and process the documents for shipping items to customers. For internal requests, you      create and process the documents for issuing items to employees of your organization by using      the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) Issues (IN302000) form. Process of purchase requisitions with budget validation and approval (part 1) Process of purchase requisitions with budget validation and approval (part 2) Request and Requisition Approvals In the system, you can create approval maps so that requests that meet particular criteria are     submitted for approval to the appropriate employees. For example, if the total cost of the items     in a request exceeds a particular amount, the request must be approved by the head of the     department whose employee requested the items. You can configure the system so that particular requisitions or all requisitions require     approval. For example, approval can be set up so that all requisitions that contain computer     equipment that costs more than a particular amount must be approved by the IT department before     purchasing can take place. Before you turn on the approval of requests and requisitions, you should make sure that the     needed approval maps and notification templates (if needed) have been configured. The approval     map defines the employees designated for approving documents and the conditions that the     documents must meet (if applicable) to be assigned for approval; the template of the     notification email will be used by the system for notifying approvers about the documents     pending their approval. You then enable the approval of purchase requests or requisitions on the  General      Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ101000|RQ101000]) Purchase Requisitions Preferences (RQ101000) form by selecting     the appropriate  Require Approval  check box (in the  Request      Settings  or  Requisition Settings  section). Then on the       Approval  tab of this form, for each document type (request or     requisition), you specify the approval map and, optionally, the template of the notification     email. For the step-by-step instruction, see  To Set Up Approval of Requests and Requisitions. With approvals turned on, when a purchase request or requisition that is subject to approval     has been created, taken off hold, and saved, the document is assigned the  Pending      Approval  status. The responsible approver receives an email notification (if an email     notification template has been specified for this type of document) about the document pending     approval. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) Approvals (EP503010) form, an approver can review the     list of documents pending approval, and can select one record or multiple records in the list     and approve or reject all selected records. To be able to approve requests and requisitions, an approver must have access to the   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ301000|RQ301000]) Requests (RQ301000) and   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ302000|RQ302000]) Requisitions (RQ302000) forms     accordingly. If the document is approved, the system assigns it the  Open  status, and document     processing can continue. If the document is rejected, it is assigned the  Rejected  status, and you cannot     continue processing the document. You can edit the document after you select the       Hold  check box on the corresponding form. Budget Validation for Requests If your organization allocates budgets for valuable internal purchases, you can configure     budget validation for requests to prevent cost overruns of requested goods and services. An     employee who is creating a request can see whether the cost of the items included in the request     is below the budget. If the cost exceeds the budget, the employee can edit the list of items in     the request. Before you set up this validation, you should make sure that the budgets have been created and     released in the system on the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL302010|GL302010]) Budgets (GL302010) form. The setup of budget validation for requests includes the following tasks: Defining the way the system will calculate the costs of items included in a request: On the         ([~/?ScreenId=RQ101000|RQ101000]) Purchase Requisitions Preferences (RQ101000) form, in the  Budget Ledger       box of the  General Settings  tab, you select the budget ledger that the      system will use for verification. You can also specify the time period over which the system      will aggregate amounts from all requests created. In the  Budget       Calculation  box, you select one of the following options: YTD Values : Calculates the total cost of requests created from the beginning of the        financial year to the end of the current financial period PTD Values : Calculates the total cost of requests created from the beginning of the        financial period Annual : Calculates the total cost of requests created for the current calendar        year Turning on budget validation in the settings of each needed request class: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ201000|RQ201000]) Request Classes (RQ201000) form, you turn on budget validation by selecting the      appropriate option in the  Budget Validation  box of the  GL       Accounts  tab. (The default setting is  None .) If you select  Warning ,      a user will be able to save a request of this class even if the requested amount exceeds the      budgeted amount, but the system will display a warning. If you select  Error , a user will      not be able to save a request of this class with an amount that exceeds the budgeted amount,      and the system will display an error message.

The bidding process entails sending requests for proposals to vendors and choosing the vendor that best meets your company&rsquo;s needs. The Purchase Requisitions module of Acumatica ERP supports and streamlines the bidding process, helping you to reduce purchase expenses. You can manually assign a vendor to the requisition or select the vendor as a result of the bidding process.{br}

In this topic, you will read about how to process and select bids.{br}{TOC}
==Bid Processing==
You begin the processing of vendors&rsquo; bids for a particular requisition when you receive responses (that is, bids) from vendors. The processing involves the following steps:[anchor|#ol_apb_pd3_chb]
#You enter responses into the system by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_30_00|Bidding Responses] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ303000|RQ303000]) form.
#You select the best bids in any of the following ways:
#*By using the automatic algorithm of selecting the best bids. This algorithm uses information about vendor&rsquo;s prices, minimal quantities, and bid quantities of the requested items. For more details, see [[#section_yr3_5c3_chb|Automatic Selection of Bids].
#*By analyzing responses and selecting vendors manually. For details, see [[#section_hrq_5c3_chb|Manual Selection of Bids].
[anchor|#section_yr3_5c3_chb]
==Automatic Selection of Bids==
You process the bids for a particular requisition by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_50_30_00|Complete Bidding] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ503000|RQ503000]) form. To run automatic bidding, you click '''Update Result''' on the form toolbar. The system selects a vendor or multiple vendors for each item automatically based on the offered price (bid unit cost) and the quantity limitations (bid quantity), if any, from vendor responses. You can view bidding results and correct them if you are not satisfied with the automatically selected vendors.{br}

If any vendor response has changed or been withdrawn after the system selected vendors for a requisition, you enter new responses on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_30_00|Bidding Responses] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ303000|RQ303000]) form. Then you go back to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_50_30_00|Complete Bidding] form, click '''Clear Result''' on the form toolbar to clear the selected vendors for all lines of a requisition, and click '''Update Result''' again.{br}

After you have analyzed and corrected the bidding results, you accept the results by clicking '''Complete Bidding''' on the toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_50_30_00|Complete Bidding] form. The system assigns the selected vendor or vendors to the requisition.[anchor|#section_hrq_5c3_chb]
==Manual Selection of Bids==
When selecting the best bids, you may want to analyze the bidding responses and select the bids manually. You may want to take into account not only the vendor offering the lowest price but also any of the following:[anchor|#ul_krq_5c3_chb]
*The number of days needed to deliver the order 
*The carrier used by a vendor
*The shipping terms used by a vendor
*Special offers from a vendor

You can select a vendor with a better bid by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_20_00|Requisitions] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ302000|RQ302000]) form as follows: You click the vendor line in the '''Bidding Vendors''' table on the '''Bidding''' tab and click '''Choose Vendor''' on the table toolbar.
==User Roles for Bid Processing==
To avoid fraud in selecting bids, you can control which employees can view bidding responses and results. If you want particular users to only enter bidding results, you create a user role that has access to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_30_00|Bidding Responses] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ303000|RQ303000]) form and does not have access to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_50_30_00|Complete Bidding] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ503000|RQ503000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_20_00|Requisitions] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ302000|RQ302000]) forms and assign this role to the users. For users who are selecting the best bids you create a user role with access to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_50_30_00|Complete Bidding] and [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_20_00|Requisitions] forms and without access to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_30_00|Bidding Responses] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ303000|RQ303000]) form and assign this role to the users. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\User_Roles_GeneralInfo|User Roles: General Information].
