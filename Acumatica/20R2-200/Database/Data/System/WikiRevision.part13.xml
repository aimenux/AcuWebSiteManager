A cost code represents an additional classification level for project revenues and costs in a construction project. You can associate cost codes with different documents and document lines across the system in which projects are referenced, such as general ledger transactions, accounts payable bills, purchase orders, accounts receivable invoices, expense entries, time cards, and lines of project budgets.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Plan the structure of cost codes to be used in construction projects
*Configure the structure of the cost code identifier and define cost codes
*Configure cost code tracking in the revenue budget lines of the project budget
*Configure cost code tracking in the cost budget lines of the project budget

==Applicable Scenarios==
You create cost codes and configure a project to use these cost codes if you need to further classify revenues and expenses in a budget of a construction project.[anchor|#section_ffb_gkv_gmb]
==Cost Code Configuration==
By tracking revenues and expenses by cost codes, you can analyze how much each project task costs, what the revenue is, and how the tracked values compare with the budgeted ones.{br}

To define the cost codes to be used in your projects, you need to perform the following tasks:[anchor|#ol_tv4_wp3_hmb]
#Plan the structure of cost code identifiers and the cost codes to be used based on the processes in your organization.
#Modify the ''COSTCODE'' segmented key based on your planned structure, if necessary.
#Add the planned cost codes to the table on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_95_00|Cost Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209500|PM209500]) form.
#Configure the use of cost codes in the cost budget and revenue budget of a particular project.

You can prepare the list of cost codes in an <tt>.xlsx</tt> or <tt>.csv</tt> file and upload the file to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_95_00|Cost Codes] form. Alternatively, you can add cost codes one by one on the form.[anchor|#section_yfj_1rt_gmb]
==Project Budget Tracking by Cost Codes==
When you create a document or a document line (or both) that you want to associate with a particular cost code, you first specify the applicable GL account, project, and project task for the line; you then assign the appropriate cost code to the line. In the lookup table that opens when you click the selector button on the applicable form, the system lists the cost codes that are used in budget lines of the project you have selected for the document or document line. The lookup table also lists the budget lines that have the same project task and the account group that corresponds to the GL account selected for the document or document line. You can select any of the available cost codes, or select a cost code that has not yet been used for the combination of project, project task, and account group.{br}

For a project, on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Project Properties''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, you can use the '''Revenue Budget Level''' and '''Cost Budget Level''' boxes to specify the way the system represents budget lines and classify revenues or expenses by cost codes as well as other factors. You do this by selecting the needed options in the '''Revenue Budget Level''' and '''Cost Budget Level''' boxes as follows:[anchor|#ul_j1h_5hj_hmb]
*If you select''Task and Cost Code'' or ''Task, Item, and Cost Code'' in the '''Revenue Budget Level''' box, you can view revenue budget lines by cost codes on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form for the project, and you can bill the project with the selected revenue budget level for progress.
*If you select''Task and Cost Code'' or ''Task, Item, and Cost Code'' in the '''Cost Budget Level''' box, you can view cost budget lines by cost codes on the '''Cost Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form for the project. You can also bill the project with the selected cost budget level for time and material.

You can change the cost code for each cost budget or revenue budget line manually, if needed.]]></column>

The ''COSTCODE'' segmented key on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form defines the identifiers of cost codes in the system. By default, this segmented key specifies that the cost code identifier is a one-segment key that consists of four numerals. For the key, you can define how many segments it is to have, what values may be used, whether these values should be validated, and whether auto-numbering should be used in one of the segments. You can also divide item identifiers into segments with specific values. For more information on configuring segmented keys, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Identifier_Segmentation|Segmented Identifiers].{br}

The [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_95_00|Cost Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209500|PM209500]) form contains a table in which you can define cost codes. By default, the table contains a row with ''0000'' in the '''Cost Code''' column and ''Default'' in the '''Description''' column.

==Applicable Scenarios==
You work with subcontracts when your company hires another company to perform a job or a part of the job.
==General Process==
 The subcontract workflow is similar to the workflow of a purchase order that contains service lines and non-stock lines only. Subcontracts are entered on the [HelpRoot_Construction\SC_30_10_00|Subcontracts] ([~/?ScreenId=SC301000|SC301000]) form. You first select a vendor (and its location, if multiple business locations are used in your system) and specify other general information of the subcontract such as date and owner. Then on the '''Document Details''' tab, you list the non-stock items that represent jobs and services that will be performed by the subcontractor. For each line, you specify a project and the following project specific entities: a project task, inventory ID, cost code.{br}

Accounts Payable bills are entered directly for a subcontract once the work has been completed and the AP document has been received from the vendor.
==Workflow of a Work with a Subcontract==
The typical process of working with subcontracts involves the actions and generated documents shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#_0a5022bf-d3be-4358-b104-89fbbedc900f][anchor|#_e4112741-8d90-48be-8edc-0998e2d6f093][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_Construction_Working_with_Subcontracts.png|popup|450px]
==Advanced Capabilities==
The following functionality is provided by subcontracts:[anchor|#_8d989d2d-54c0-4daa-aa0d-4fb7845772b0]
*Ability to enter prepayments for subcontracts
*Ability to enter partial AP bills for subcontracts
*Ability to complete or cancel subcontracts fully or line by line
*Change order functionality for project commitments
*Compliance tracking 
*Tax calculation
*Vendor prices

==Subcontract Specifics==
Comparing to purchase orders, subcontracts have the following specifics:[anchor|#_a6a9e7cd-b508-4f2f-827c-6c405a6b652d]
*Subcontracts do not include stock items and do not involve inventory management processes.
*Subcontracts do not use the purchase to order process and cannot be linked to sales orders.
*Subcontracts do not use the blanket order workflow, which is available for purchase orders.
*Vendor-specific printed formats can be defined for subcontracts and purchase orders separately

The following activity will walk you through the process of configuring subcontract mailing. That is, you will learn how to create a notification template and specify mailing settings for a vendor class of subcontractors.
==Story==
Suppose that the SweetLife company hired the Standard Hardware Company subcontractor to perform some part of a job on building a hotel. The company is going to send a contract to the subcontractor by email. Acting as an administrator, you need to create a notification template for the subcontractor and configure a vendor class of the subcontractor to have this template in the mailing settings.
==Process Overview==
To configure subcontract mailing, you first create a template on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_03|Notification Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=SM204003|SM204003]) form. You then add this template to the mailing list of the subcontract vendor class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_10_00|Vendor Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AP201000|AP201000]) form. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form, you can check the mailing settings of a particular vendor.
==System Preparation==
Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as a sales manager by using the ''admin'' username and the ''123'' password.
==Step 1: Creating a Notification Template==
Do the following:[anchor|#_fa742785-635f-4638-890f-918dff014a89]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_03|Notification Templates] (SM2040PL) form.[anchor|#_ee39d94f-5319-4b3c-8f51-84a141b7b3fd]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record'''.
#In the '''Screen Name''' box, select ''Subcontracts'' with the ''SC.30.10.00'' screen ID.
#In the '''Description''' box, type ''Subcontracts''.
#In the '''From''' box, select the ''System'' email account.
#:This is the default account from which emails with subcontracts will be sent to vendors.
#In the '''Subject''' box, type <tt>Subcontract email</tt>.
#In the text editor area of the '''Message''' tab, specify the following text:
#:<tt>Dear Vendor,</tt>
#:<tt>Please find your subcontract attached.</tt>
#:<tt>Sincerely yours,</tt>
#:<tt>SweetLife</tt>[anchor|#_5a735acb-1202-496a-9ea4-f1ee737af9ae]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

==Step 2: Adding Notification Template to a Subcontractor Class==
To add a notification template, do the following:[anchor|#_157bbfb8-a804-4c3c-b8df-06b8f140a5bc]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_10_00|Vendor Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AP201000|AP201000]) form.
#In the '''Class ID''' box, select ''SUBCON''.
#On the '''Mailing Settings''' tab, do the following:
##In the '''Mailings''' table, make sure that the ''SUBCONTRACT'' mailing is listed and has the '''Active''' check box selected.
##For the ''SUBCONTRACT'' mailing, in the '''Email Account''' column, select the ''System'' email account.
##Make sure that ''SC.64.10.00'' is specified in the '''Report''' column. 
##:This is the identifier of the Subcontract printed form that will be used for generating a short form of a subcontract to be attached to an email.
##In the '''Notification Template''' column, select the ''Subcontracts'' notification template.
##In the '''Recipients''' table, click '''Add Row''', and in the '''Contact Type''' column, select the ''Remittance''. Leave the default values for the remaining settings.[anchor|#_ad893b30-e085-4d4d-a9de-7e0341f816af]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

==Step 3: Reviewing Subcontractor Mailing Settings==
Do the following:[anchor|#_9f1c4112-4096-4dc5-a3ef-87486ef4fc3d]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form.
#In the '''Vendor''' box, select the ''HARDCO'' vendor.
#On the '''Mailing Settings''' tab, make sure that the settings of the ''SUBCONTRACT'' mailing have been copied from the ''SUBCON ''vendor class.

You can make corrections to a pro forma invoice with the ''Closed'' status even if the corresponding accounts receivable document created based on this pro forma invoice has already been released.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to:[anchor|#ul_nwj_gch_tbb]
*Make corrections to a pro forma invoice that has the corresponding AR document released
*Review the previous revision of the pro forma invoice.

==Applicable Scenarios==
You correct a pro forma invoice if you need to keep its reference and application numbers. For example, you may need to correct an existing pro forma invoice because it has been used for printing the [HelpRoot_Construction\PM_64_40_00|AIA Report] ([~/?ScreenId=PM644000|PM644000]) report.
==Making Corrections to a Pro Forma Invoice==
You can correct a pro forma invoice if the following conditions are met:[anchor|#_9cae59cc-0ba2-4837-ae3a-1672de8921fc]
*The corresponding accounts receivable document created based on the pro forma invoice is released.
*:((({S:Hint}If the status of the AR document is ''On Hold'' or ''Balanced'', you can just delete the AR document and adjust the pro forma invoice in an ordinary way.
)))
*The pro forma invoice has only progress billing lines.
*The application of payments are removed or the payments are voided for the corresponding account receivable document.
*Corresponding retainage invoices related to the pro forma invoice are reversed or deleted.
*The billing currency is the same as the project currency.

To assign a pro forma invoice the ''On Hold'' status so that it can be edited, on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]), you click '''Actions''' > '''Correct Pro Forma Invoice'''. The system changes the status of the pro forma invoice and adds a line with the previous revision of the pro forma invoice to the '''Previous Revisions''' table on the '''Financial Details''' tab.{br}

When you make all the needed adjustments to the pro forma invoice and release it, the system creates the accounts receivable document with the full amount of the corrected pro forma invoice. The system also creates a reversing AR document with the ''On Hold'' status to completely reverse the accounts receivable document related to the previous revision of the pro forma invoice.{br}

Accounts receivable documents of the old revision of a pro forma invoice, including reversing AR documents, are shown on the '''Financial Details''' tab ('''Previous Revisions''' table) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] form and on the '''Invoices''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form.[anchor|#section_i3l_d4p_mcb]

==Other Settings That Affect the Workflow==
You can affect the workflow of correcting pro forma invoices by specifying additional settings as follows:[anchor|#_50a95b7f-f671-4287-bf30-2454483b4280]
*To give accounts receivable invoices, including reversing documents and those created based on pro forma invoices, the ''Balanced'' status on creation, clear the '''Hold Documents on Entry''' check box on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''Data Entry Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) form.
*To make sending by email accounts receivable invoices optional, including those created based on pro forma invoices that have been agreed upon with the customer, clear the '''Send Invoices by Email''' check box on the '''Billing Settings''' tab ('''Print and Email Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form for applicable customers.
*To make printing accounts receivable invoices optional, including those created based on pro forma invoices that have been agreed upon with the customer, clear the '''Print Invoices''' check box on the '''Billing Settings''' tab ('''Print and Email Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form for applicable customers.
*To cause the system to automatically post general ledger transactions generated on release of all accounts receivable invoices, select the '''Automatically Post on Release''' check box on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''Posting Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] form.

With these settings specified, users in your company can correct pro forma invoices quickly and accurately with a minimum of manual actions.
==Validation of Configuration==
To make sure that all configuration has been performed correctly, we recommend that in your system, you correct a pro forma invoice by performing instructions similar to those described in [HelpRoot_Construction\Construction_PF_Correction_Process_Activity|Correcting Pro Forma Invoices: Process Activity].]]></column>

==Story==
Suppose that in January, the Thai Food Restaurant customer ordered five juicers along with the service of installation from the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company. The parties agreed to pay for the juicers and provided services monthly. SweetLife&rsquo;s project manager created a project for this work. In January, SweetLife delivered and installed two juicers; SweetLife&rsquo;s project accountant billed the customer. In February, SweetLife delivered and installed three juicers and the project accountant billed the customer.{br}

Suppose that the project accountant has realized that in January the customer was billed for one juicer and the corresponding service instead of two juicers. The pro forma invoice was already used for printing the AIA report, so the accountant cannot just create one more invoice but need to adjust the first pro forma invoice. Acting as the project accountant, you will correct the pro forma invoice.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Project Accounting'' feature has been enabled to support the project accounting functionality.{br}

*[HelpRoot_Construction\Construction_APBill_with_Retainage_GeneralInfo|AP Bills with Retainage: General Information]
*:If your company retains a part of the amount of a bill, to process the total amount of the bill, at least two bills are created in Acumatica ERP: the bill with retainage (that is, the bill for which part of the amount is retained) and the ''retainage bill'' (that is, the bill that contains the retained amount or the part of the retained amount to be paid). The bill with retainage is paid during the period of time agreed upon between your company and the vendor. The retainage bill is paid after the contractual work is finished. Multiple retainage bills can be created for one bill with retainage.

==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#_0cdc01ff-399b-426f-b21e-681d0cc8ad83]
*Create and process a bill with retainage held at the line level
*Release retainage for the bill
*Enter a payment for the retainage bill
*Pay an outstanding balance of the original bill

==Applicable Scenarios==
You create a bill with retainage when it is necessary to withhold a portion of the contract amount until the work has been completed to assure that the vendor (subcontractor) will satisfy its obligations and complete a particular project or part of a project.
==The Processing Workflow of a Bill with Retainage==
Typically, an AP bill with retainage goes through the following states during its life cycle:[anchor|#_69cbdf83-bfee-434a-be42-c1a7166164fc]
#Entering the bill with retainage and preparing the bill for release: A data entry person creates the bill with retainage in the system on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form. The balance of this bill equals the sum of the extended costs minus line discounts of the lines of the bill reduced by the retainage amount. The total amount of the bill (which is shown on the '''Retainage''' tab) is the detail total amount plus the retained amount. 
#Releasing the bill with retainage: An accountant releases the prepared bill with retainage. The released bill is assigned the ''Open'' status, affects the balances of the selected vendor and the GL accounts.
#Paying the bill with retainage: The accountant creates a payment in the system to pay the bill with retainage. He or she processes and releases the payment. The system reduces the balance of the bill with retainage by the amount paid. When the payment is released, the balance of the vendor is reduced by the paid amount and the GL accounts are updated. The bill with retainage still has the ''Open'' status. 
#Releasing a retainage: Once the work has been completed, the accountant releases the retainage for the original bill. He or she can release a part of the retained amount or the full retained amount. When the retainage is released, a retainage bill with the ''Open'' status is created in the system. When the retainage bill is released, the system updates the balances of the vendor, the related GL accounts, and the unreleased retainage amount of the bill with retainage. 
#Paying the retainage bill: The accountant creates a payment in the system to pay the retainage bill. He or she processes and releases the payment. The system reduces the balance of the retainage bill by the amount paid. The balance of the vendor is reduced by the paid amount and the GL accounts are updated. 
#:If the full retained amount has been released and paid, the bill with retainage is assigned the ''Closed'' status, and its unreleased and unpaid retainage amounts equal zero. 
#:If a part of the retained amount has been released and paid, the bill with retainage keeps the ''Open'' status. The system reduces the bill unreleased and unpaid retainage amounts by the retainage released and the retainage paid, respectively.
((({S:Warn}For documents with retainage, the invoice rounding functionality (when the ''Invoice Rounding'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form) is not supported, that is amounts in documents with retainage cannot be rounded.
)))
Open AP and unreleased retainage (retainage held) balances can be tracked at the AP bill summary level or at the line level. The option (whether the document balances are at the summary or line level) is determined for each document individually. The default option is inherited by a new document from the vendor record: the '''Pay by Line''' check box on the '''Payment Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form. If balances are tracked at the line level, payments are also applied to such AP bills at the line level.]]></column>

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
In this topic, you will read about how to set the preference settings related to retainage, configure classes for vendors who retain amounts on bills, and configure particular vendors (and vendor locations) that retain amounts on bills.{br}{TOC}
==General Retainage Settings==
In the '''Retainage Settings''' section on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_10_10_00|Accounts Payable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AP101000|AP101000]) form, you can do the following:[anchor|#_16c598aa-573e-4bfc-a76c-a47dd5eaadb5]
*To retain taxes calculated on the retained amount, you select the '''Retain Taxes''' check box. The system calculates and reports the taxes of the bills with retainage and retainage bills separately. You then need to specify the tax accounts to be debited by the amounts of retained taxes, as described in the [[#_9d3bd148-1ffb-4ced-aa86-4aaeb89e9162|Configuration of Taxes] section.
*:If this check box is cleared, the full tax amount is paid on the bill with retainage.
*To direct the system to automatically release retainage bills that you create on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_51_00_00|Release AP Retainage] ([~/?ScreenId=AP510000|AP510000]) form, you select the '''Automatically Release Retainage Bills''' check box.
*If the ''Project Accounting'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can select the '''Require Single Project per Document''' check box to configure the system to link all lines of AP documents with the same project specified by the user in the Summary area on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form.
*To be able to track retainage by document lines, enable the ''Payment Application by Line'' feature on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form.

==Configuration of Vendor Classes==
If your company works with bills with retainage, you can specify for a vendor class the default retainage payable account and subaccount (if applicable) to record the money that you withheld from the bills associated with the vendors of this class. You specify the account and subaccount in the '''Retainage Payable Account''' and '''Retainage Payable Sub.''' boxes, respectively, on the '''GL Accounts''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_10_00|Vendor Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AP201000|AP201000]) form.{br}

If you have specified the default account and subaccount for a vendor class, for vendors of the class, the system inserts these values into the '''Retainage Payable Account''' and '''Retainage Payable Sub.''' boxes, respectively, on the '''GL Accounts''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form for newly added vendors.{br}

To apply retainage to all bills of vendors created and assigned to a particular vendor class, you select the '''Apply Retainage''' check box in the '''Default Financial Settings''' section on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_10_00|Vendor Classes] form. That is, the '''Apply Retainage''' check box will be selected for such vendors on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form.{br}

To apply payments to individual lines of AP bills with retainage for vendors belonging to a particular vendor class, you can select the '''Pay by Line''' check box in the '''Default Financial Settings''' section on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_10_00|Vendor Classes] form. If a vendor assigned to this class is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form, the '''Pay by Line''' check box in the '''Default Payment Info''' section on the '''Financial Details''' tab of this form is selected by default.
==Configuration of Particular Vendors==
For each particular vendor for which your company needs to retain a certain amount of each bill total, you can specify default settings as follows on the '''General Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form:[anchor|#_fb3c9bbc-e121-4522-9068-82dcf9d9a037]
*If your company usually retains an amount on bills, you select the '''Apply Retainage''' check box in the '''Retainage Settings''' section of the '''General Info''' tab. If this check box is selected, the '''Apply Retainage''' check box is selected by default for the bills of the vendor on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form. If this check box is cleared for the vendor, the '''Apply Retainage''' check box is cleared for the bills of the vendor on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] form.
*If the '''Apply Retainage''' check box is selected, to specify the default percent to be retained from the amount of the bill document lines of the vendor, you specify the percent in the '''Retainage Percent''' box in the same section. The system enters this percent for bills of the vendor in the '''Default Retainage Percent''' box on the '''Retainage''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] form, and this percent is automatically applied to all lines on the '''Document Details''' tab.
*If you want to apply payments to individual lines of AP bills with retainage for a particular vendor, you can select the '''Pay by Line''' check box in the '''Default Payment Settings''' section on the '''Payment Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] form. If the vendor is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] form, the '''Pay by Line''' check box in the '''Default Payment Info''' section on the '''Financial Details''' tab of this form is selected by default.

If no Retainage Payable account and subaccount (if subaccounts are used in your system) are specified for the class to which the vendor is assigned, you can specify the account and subaccount in the '''Retainage Payable Account''' and '''Retainage Payable Sub.''' boxes, respectively, on the '''GL Accounts''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] form. This account and subaccount you specify will be used to record the amount that your company retains from the vendor bills. {br}

If the system has inserted the Retainage Payable account and subaccount (if applicable) specified for the vendor class to which the vendor is assigned, you can override the default account and subaccount of the class in the '''Retainage Payable Account''' and '''Retainage Payable Sub.''' boxes, respectively.{br}

The default values provided for the vendor can be overridden for a particular bill.
==Configuration of a Particular Vendor Location==((({S:Warn}You can create and configure multiple vendor locations only if the ''Business Account Locations'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
)))
For the default location, the Retainage Payable account and subaccount (if applicable) are those you have specified for the vendor. If a vendor has multiple locations, each non-default location has the same the Retainage Payable account and subaccount that were specified for the default location if the '''Same As Default Location&rsquo;s''' check box is selected on the '''GL Accounts''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_10|Vendor Locations] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303010|AP303010]) form. If you need to override the account and subaccount of a particular non-default location, clear the '''Same As Default Location&rsquo;s''' check box. {br}

The accounts specified for the vendor location selected in a bill will be used by default to post retainage entries. The default values provided for the vendor location can be overridden for a particular bill.[anchor|#_9d3bd148-1ffb-4ced-aa86-4aaeb89e9162]
==Configuration of Taxes==
If the taxes calculated on the retained amount are also retained—that is, if the '''Retain Taxes''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_10_10_00|Accounts Payable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AP101000|AP101000]) form,—you have to specify the accounts for retained taxes. To do so, on the '''GL Accounts''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\TX_20_50_00|Taxes] ([~/?ScreenId=TX205000|TX205000]) form, you specify the tax claimable account and subaccount in the '''Retainage Tax Claimable Account''' and '''Retainage Tax Claimable Subaccount''' boxes, respectively. This account and subaccount will be debited by the tax applied to the retained amount.{br}

The taxes from retainage documents are posted to tax accounts under the non-project code (''X'' by default).{br}

'''Posting of Retained Sales Taxes'''{br}

When a sales tax is applied to an accounts payable document with retainage and tax retainage is set up, on release of original and retainage bills, sales tax amounts are posted to the general ledger accounts as follows:{br}

On release of the original bill:[anchor|#_671d9858-a0c1-4f02-92bc-bbe1fada22c4]
*The total sales tax amount for a bill line is debited to the tax expense account (specified for the tax in the '''Tax Expense Account''' box of the '''GL Accounts''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\TX_20_50_00|Taxes] ([~/?ScreenId=TX205000|TX205000]) form).
*The retained tax amount is credited to the retainage payable account (specified in the '''Retainage Payable Account''' box on the '''Financial Details''' tab of the on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] form).

On release of the retainage bill: The retained sales tax amount is debited to the retainage payable account and credited to the accounts payable account (specified in the '''AP Account''' box on the '''Financial Details''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form).{br}

'''Posting of Retained Use Taxes'''{br}

When a use tax is applied to an accounts payable document with retainage and tax retainage is set up, on release of original and retainage bills, use tax amounts are posted to the general ledger accounts as follows:{br}

On release of the original bill:[anchor|#_a69659d4-a90c-4317-9421-cd7f2a9fd605]
*The total use tax amount for a line is debited to the tax expense account (specified for the tax in the '''Tax Expense Account''' box on the '''GL Accounts''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\TX_20_50_00|Taxes] ([~/?ScreenId=TX205000|TX205000]) form).
*The use tax amount that is not retained is credited to the tax payable account (specified for the tax in the '''Tax Payable Account''' box on the '''GL Accounts''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\TX_20_50_00|Taxes] form).
*The retained use tax amount is credited to the retainage tax payable account (specified for the tax in the '''Retainage Tax Payable Account''' box on the '''GL Accounts''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\TX_20_50_00|Taxes] form).

General Retainage Settings In the  Retainage Settings  section on the  General      Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP101000|AP101000]) Accounts Payable Preferences (AP101000) form, you can do the     following: To retain taxes calculated on the retained amount, you select the  Retain        Taxes  check box. The system calculates and reports the taxes of the bills with       retainage and retainage bills separately. You then need to specify the tax accounts to be       debited by the amounts of retained taxes, as described in the  Configuration of Taxes Configuration of Taxes section. If this check box is cleared, the full tax amount is paid on the bill with retainage. To direct the system to automatically release retainage bills that you create on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP510000|AP510000]) Release AP Retainage (AP510000) form, you select the  Automatically Release       Retainage Bills  check box. If the  Project Accounting  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features      (CS100000) form, you can select the  Require Single Project per Document       check box to configure the system to link all lines of AP documents with the same project      specified by the user in the Summary area on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000)      form. To be able to track retainage by document lines, enable the  Payment Application by       Line  feature on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features form. Configuration of Vendor Classes If your company works with bills with retainage, you can specify for a vendor class the     default retainage payable account and subaccount (if applicable) to record the money that you     withheld from the bills associated with the vendors of this class. You specify the account and     subaccount in the  Retainage Payable Account  and  Retainage      Payable Sub.  boxes, respectively, on the  GL Accounts  tab of     the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP201000|AP201000]) Vendor Classes (AP201000) form. If you have specified the default account and subaccount for a vendor class, for vendors of     the class, the system inserts these values into the  Retainage Payable      Account  and  Retainage Payable Sub.  boxes, respectively, on     the  GL Accounts  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors (AP303000)     form for newly added vendors. To apply retainage to all bills of vendors created and assigned to a particular vendor class,     you select the  Apply Retainage  check box in the  Default      Financial Settings  section on the  General Settings  tab of     the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP201000|AP201000]) Vendor Classes form. That is, the  Apply      Retainage  check box will be selected for such vendors on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors (AP303000) form. To apply payments to individual lines of AP bills with retainage for vendors belonging to a     particular vendor class, you can select the  Pay by Line  check box in the       Default Financial Settings  section on the  General      Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP201000|AP201000]) Vendor Classes form. If a vendor assigned to     this class is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form, the       Pay by Line  check box in the  Default Payment Info      section on the  Financial Details  tab of this form is selected by     default. Configuration of Particular Vendors For each particular vendor for which your company needs to retain a certain amount of each     bill total, you can specify default settings as follows on the  General      Info  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors (AP303000) form: If your company usually retains an amount on bills, you select the  Apply       Retainage  check box in the  Retainage Settings  section of      the  General Info  tab. If this check box is selected, the        Apply Retainage  check box is selected by default for the bills of the      vendor on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form. If this check box is cleared for      the vendor, the  Apply Retainage  check box is cleared for the bills of      the vendor on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments form. If the  Apply Retainage  check box is selected, to specify the default      percent to be retained from the amount of the bill document lines of the vendor, you specify      the percent in the  Retainage Percent  box in the same section. The system      enters this percent for bills of the vendor in the  Default Retainage       Percent  box on the  Retainage  tab on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments form, and this percent is automatically applied to all lines on the        Document Details  tab. If you want to apply payments to individual lines of AP bills with retainage for a      particular vendor, you can select the  Pay by Line  check box in the        Default Payment Settings  section on the  Payment       Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors form. If the      vendor is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments form, the  Pay       by Line  check box in the  Default Payment Info  section on      the  Financial Details  tab of this form is selected by default. If no Retainage Payable account and subaccount (if subaccounts are used in your system) are     specified for the class to which the vendor is assigned, you can specify the account and     subaccount in the  Retainage Payable Account  and  Retainage      Payable Sub.  boxes, respectively, on the  GL Accounts  tab of     the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors form. This account and subaccount you specify will be used     to record the amount that your company retains from the vendor bills.  If the system has inserted the Retainage Payable account and subaccount (if applicable)     specified for the vendor class to which the vendor is assigned, you can override the default     account and subaccount of the class in the  Retainage Payable Account  and       Retainage Payable Sub.  boxes, respectively. The default values provided for the vendor can be overridden for a particular bill. Configuration of a Particular Vendor Location You can create and configure multiple vendor locations only if the  Business Account      Locations  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. For the default location, the Retainage Payable account and subaccount (if applicable) are     those you have specified for the vendor. If a vendor has multiple locations, each non-default     location has the same the Retainage Payable account and subaccount that were specified for the     default location if the  Same As Default Location's  check box is selected     on the  GL Accounts  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303010|AP303010]) Vendor Locations (AP303020)     form. If you need to override the account and subaccount of a particular non-default location,     clear the  Same As Default Location's  check box.  The accounts specified for the vendor location selected in a bill will be used by default to     post retainage entries. The default values provided for the vendor location can be overridden     for a particular bill. Configuration of Taxes If the taxes calculated on the retained amount are also retained—that is, if the       Retain Taxes  check box is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP101000|AP101000]) Accounts Payable Preferences (AP101000) form,—you have to specify the accounts for retained taxes. To do so, on the       GL Accounts  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=TX205000|TX205000]) Taxes (TX205000) form,     you specify the tax claimable account and subaccount in the  Retainage Tax Claimable      Account  and  Retainage Tax Claimable Subaccount  boxes,     respectively. This account and subaccount will be debited by the tax applied to the retained     amount. The taxes from retainage documents are posted to tax accounts under the non-project code      ( X  by default). Posting of Retained Sales Taxes When a sales tax is applied to an accounts payable document with retainage and tax retainage     is set up, on release of original and retainage bills, sales tax amounts are posted to the     general ledger accounts as follows: On release of the original bill: The total sales tax amount for a bill line is debited to the tax expense account (specified      for the tax in the  Tax Expense Account  box of the  GL       Accounts  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=TX205000|TX205000]) Taxes (TX205000)      form). The retained tax amount is credited to the retainage payable account (specified in the        Retainage Payable Account  box on the  Financial       Details  tab of the on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments form). On release of the retainage bill: The retained sales tax amount is debited to the retainage     payable account and credited to the accounts payable account (specified in the  AP      Account  box on the  Financial Details  tab on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form). Posting of Retained Use Taxes When a use tax is applied to an accounts payable document with retainage and tax retainage is     set up, on release of original and retainage bills, use tax amounts are posted to the general     ledger accounts as follows: On release of the original bill: The total use tax amount for a line is debited to the tax expense account (specified for       the tax in the  Tax Expense Account  box on the  GL        Accounts  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=TX205000|TX205000]) Taxes (TX205000)       form). The use tax amount that is not retained is credited to the tax payable account (specified       for the tax in the  Tax Payable Account  box on the  GL        Accounts  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=TX205000|TX205000]) Taxes form). The retained use tax amount is credited to the retainage tax payable account (specified for       the tax in the  Retainage Tax Payable Account  box on the  GL        Accounts  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=TX205000|TX205000]) Taxes form). On release of the retainage bill: The retained use tax amount is debited to the retainage tax     payable account and credited to the tax payable account. ]]></column>

*:If a customer retains a part of the amount of an invoice, to process the total amount of the invoice, at least two invoices are created in Acumatica ERP: the invoice with retainage and the ''retainage invoice''. The invoice with retainage is paid during the period of time agreed upon between your company and the customer. The retainage invoice is an invoice that contains the retained amount or a part of the retained amount to be paid, and it is paid after the contractual work has been finished. Multiple retainage invoices can be created for one invoice with retainage.

==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Create a pro forma invoice and related AR invoice with retainage
*Process AR invoice with retainage
*Release the retainage from the AR invoice

==Applicable Scenarios==
You process an invoice with retainage when the customer withheld a part of the invoice amount until the work is substantially complete to assure that your company will satisfy its obligations and complete a construction project.
==The Processing Workflow of an Invoice with Retainage==
Typically, an AR invoice with retainage goes through the following states during its life cycle:[anchor|#_69cbdf83-bfee-434a-be42-c1a7166164fc]
#Entering the invoice with retainage and preparing the invoice for release: A data entry person creates the invoice with retainage in the system on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form. The balance of this invoice equals the sum of the extended prices minus line discounts of the lines of the invoice reduced by the retainage amount. The total amount of the invoice (which is shown on the '''Retainage''' tab) is the detail total amount plus the retained amount.
#Releasing the invoice with retainage: An accountant releases the prepared invoice. The released invoice is assigned the ''Open'' status, affects the balances of the selected customer and the General Ledger accounts, and requires further processing.
#Receiving a payment for the invoice with retainage: The accountant enters a payment in the system to pay the invoice, and then processes and releases the payment. The system reduces the balance of the invoice by the amount paid. When the payment is released, the balance of the customer is reduced by the paid amount and the General Ledger accounts are updated. The invoice still has the ''Open'' status.
#Releasing a retainage: Once the work has been completed, the accountant releases the retainage for the invoice. He or she can release a part of the retained amount or the full retained amount. When the retainage is released, a retainage invoice with the ''Balanced'' status is created in the system; the status is ''On Hold'' if the '''Hold Documents on Entry''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) form. 
#:When the retainage invoice is released, the system updates the balances of the customer, the related General Ledger accounts, and the unreleased retainage amount of the invoice with retainage.
#Receiving a payment for the retainage invoice: The accountant enters a payment in the system for the retainage invoice, and then processes and releases the payment. The system reduces the balance of the retainage invoice by the amount paid. The balance of the customer is reduced by the paid amount and the General Ledger accounts are updated. 
#:If the full retained amount has been released and paid, the invoice with retainage is assigned the ''Closed'' status, and its unreleased and unpaid retainage amounts equal zero. 
#:If a part of the retained amount has been released and paid, the invoice with retainage keeps the ''Open'' status. The system reduces the invoice&rsquo;s unreleased and unpaid retainage amounts by the retainage released and the retainage paid, respectively.

In this topic, you will read about how to set the preference settings related to retainage, how to configure classes for customers who retain amounts on invoices, and how to configure particular customers (and customer locations) that retain amounts on invoices.{br}{TOC}
==General Retainage Settings==
In the '''Retainage Settings '''section on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) form, you can do the following:[anchor|#_16c598aa-573e-4bfc-a76c-a47dd5eaadb5]
*To retain the taxes calculated on the retained amount, you select the '''Retain Taxes''' check box. The system calculates and reports the taxes of the invoice with retainage and retainage invoices separately. You then need to specify the tax accounts to be credited by the amounts of retained taxes, as described in the [[#_9d3bd148-1ffb-4ced-aa86-4aaeb89e9162|Configuration of Taxes] section.
*:If this check box is cleared, the full tax amount is paid on the invoice with retainage.
*To direct the system to automatically release retainage documents that you create on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_51_00_00|Release AR Retainage] ([~/?ScreenId=AR510000|AR510000]) form, you select the '''Automatically Release Retainage Documents''' check box.

==Configuration of Customer Classes==
If your company works with invoices with retainage, you can specify for a customer class the default retainage receivable account and subaccount (if applicable) to record the money that customers of the class withheld from invoices. You specify the account and subaccount in the '''Retainage Receivable Account''' and '''Retainage Receivable Sub.''' boxes, respectively, on the '''GL Accounts''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_10_00|Customer Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR201000|AR201000]) form.{br}

If you have specified the default account and subaccount for a customer class, for customers of the class, the system inserts these values into the '''Retainage Receivable Account''' and '''Retainage Receivable Sub.''' boxes, respectively, on the '''GL Accounts''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form for newly added customers.
==Configuration of Particular Customers==
For each particular customer for which your company needs to retain a certain amount of each invoice total, you can specify default settings as follows on the '''General Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form:[anchor|#_fb3c9bbc-e121-4522-9068-82dcf9d9a037]
*To direct the system to apply retainage when you create an invoice for the customer, you select the '''Apply Retainage''' check box in the '''Retainage Settings''' section of the '''General Info''' tab. If this check box is selected, the '''Apply Retainage''' check box is selected by default for each invoice of the customer on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form. If this check box is cleared for the customer, the '''Apply Retainage''' check box is cleared for the invoices of the customer on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] form by default, and you can select it manually to retain a part of amount of a particular invoice.
*If the '''Apply Retainage''' check box is selected, to specify the default percent to be retained from the line amount of each invoice of the customer, you specify the percent in the '''Retainage Percent''' box in the same section. The system enters this percent for each invoice of the customer in the '''Default Retainage Percent''' box on the '''Retainage''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] form, and this percent is applied by default to all lines on the '''Document Details''' tab.

If no Retainage Receivable account and subaccount (if subaccounts are used in your system) are specified for the class to which the customer is assigned, you can specify the account and subaccount in the '''Retainage Receivable Account''' and '''Retainage Receivable Sub.''' boxes, respectively, on the '''GL Accounts''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form. This account and subaccount you specify will be used to record the amount that the customer owes to your company for the invoices. {br}

Also, if the system has inserted the Retainage Receivable account and subaccount (if applicable) specified for the customer class to which the customer is assigned, you can override the default account and subaccount of the class in the '''Retainage Receivable Account''' and '''Retainage Receivable Sub.''' boxes, respectively.{br}

The default values provided for the customer can be overridden for a particular invoice.
==Configuration of a Particular Customer Location==((({S:Warn}You can create and configure multiple customer locations only if the ''Business Account Locations'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
)))
For the default location, the Retainage Receivable account and subaccount (if applicable) are those you have specified for the customer. If a customer has multiple locations and the '''Same As Default Location&rsquo;s''' check box is selected on the '''GL Accounts''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_20|Customer Locations] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303020|AR303020]) form for a non-default location, the non-default location has the same the Retainage Receivable account and subaccount that were specified for the default location. You clear the '''Same As Default Location&rsquo;s''' check box to override the account and subaccount of a non-default location in the '''Retainage Receivable Account''' and '''Retainage Receivable Sub.''' boxes, respectively. {br}

The account and subaccount specified for the customer location selected in an invoice will be used by default to post retainage entries. The default values provided for the customer location can be overridden for a particular invoice.[anchor|#_9d3bd148-1ffb-4ced-aa86-4aaeb89e9162]
==Configuration of Taxes==
If the taxes calculated on the retained amount are also retained—that is, if the '''Retain Taxes''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) form,—you have to specify the accounts for retained taxes. To do so, on the '''GL Accounts''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\TX_20_50_00|Taxes] ([~/?ScreenId=TX205000|TX205000]) form, you specify the tax payable account and subaccount in the '''Retainage Tax Payable Account''' and '''Retainage Tax Payable Subaccount''' boxes, respectively. This account and subaccount will be credited by the tax applied to the retained amount.]]></column>

If this check box      is selected, the  Apply Retainage  check box is selected by default for      each invoice of the customer on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form. If this      check box is cleared for the customer, the  Apply Retainage  check box is      cleared for the invoices of the customer on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos form by      default, and you can select it manually to retain a part of amount of a particular      invoice. If the  Apply Retainage  check box is selected, to specify the default      percent to be retained from the line amount of each invoice of the customer, you specify the      percent in the  Retainage Percent  box in the same section. The system      enters this percent for each invoice of the customer in the  Default Retainage       Percent  box on the  Retainage  tab on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos form, and this percent is applied by default to all lines on the        Document Details  tab. If no Retainage Receivable account and subaccount (if subaccounts are used in your system) are     specified for the class to which the customer is assigned, you can specify the account and     subaccount in the  Retainage Receivable Account  and  Retainage      Receivable Sub.  boxes, respectively, on the  GL Accounts  tab     of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers form. This account and subaccount you specify will be     used to record the amount that the customer owes to your company for the invoices.  Also, if the system has inserted the Retainage Receivable account and subaccount (if     applicable) specified for the customer class to which the customer is assigned, you can override     the default account and subaccount of the class in the  Retainage Receivable      Account  and  Retainage Receivable Sub.  boxes,     respectively.

*The following general ledger settings should be specified on the '''Posting Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_10_20_00|General Ledger Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=GL102000|GL102000]) form:
**Make sure that the '''Automatically Post on Release''' check box is selected. This setting causes GL batches to be immediately posted after they are released.
**Clear the '''Generate Consolidated Batches''' check box to cause every AR transaction you enter to be posted as an individual batch to the general ledger. (When this check box is selected, the system consolidates into a single batch all transactions in the same currency posted to the same period for all documents being released.)
*The following accounts receivable settings should be specified on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) form: 
**Select the '''Hold Documents on Entry''' check box in the '''Data Entry Settings''' section. This setting gives the created AR invoices the ''On Hold'' status.
**Clear the '''Require Payment Reference on Entry''' check box in the '''Data Entry Settings''' section. This setting means that you do not have to enter a payment reference number in the '''Payment Ref.''' box when creating an AR invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form.
**Make sure that the '''Automatically Post on Release''' check box is selected in the '''Posting Settings''' section. This setting causes AR invoices to be automatically posted to the general ledger once they are released.
**If you want to retain the taxes calculated on the retained amount, you select the '''Retain Taxes''' check box in the '''Retainage Settings''' section. If you want the full tax amount to be paid on the invoice with retainage, you leave this box cleared. For details on configuration of taxes with retainage, see [HelpRoot_Construction\Construction_ARInvoice_with_Retainage_GeneralInfo2|AR Invoices with Retainage: Configuration of the Default Retainage Settings].
**If you want the system to automatically release retainage documents that you create on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_51_00_00|Release AR Retainage] ([~/?ScreenId=AR510000|AR510000]) form, you select the '''Automatically Release Retainage Documents''' check box. To release them manually, you leave this check box cleared.

With these settings specified and entities defined, users in your company can record and process documents in Acumatica ERP quickly and accurately, with a minimum of manual actions.]]></column>

In Acumatica ERP Construction                         Edition, you can configure a project with contract cap retainage to be able to define the maximum retainage amount that can be held per project. For a project with the contract cap retainage, you perform progress billing, and the particular invoice amount is retained until the specified retainage limit is reached. {br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will do the following:[anchor|#_13a85a70-12c8-493c-a309-eaf5a2d06d14]
*Learn how to configure a project with contract cap and which settings affect the calculation
*Learn how the contract cap retainage is calculated
*Create pro forma invoices with retainage for the project until retainage cap is reached
*Release retainage for the project by several project budget lines

==Applicable Scenarios==
You configure a project with contract cap retainage when it is necessary to set the maximum retainage amount that can be held per project. When billing a project with contract cap retainage, the retainage is withheld for the invoice lines until the specified contract cap is reached.[anchor|#section_it2_vcv_qmb]
==Rules to Apply Retainage with Contract Cap==
Construction projects are typically billed by progress: it is assumed that the customer have to make partial payments to the general contractor as the work progresses. Requests for payments are prepared periodically, for example, monthly, and include the cost of the work accomplished since the previous payment to the general contractor has been made.{br}

In accordance with the project terms, the customer usually retains a prescribed percentage of each progress payment being made; a typical scenario is billing a project with a contract cap retainage, which means that the retainage is being withheld until it reaches agreed amount (which is typically specified as the percentage of the total project amount). After that, is the work is progressing satisfyingly, the subsequent progress payments are performed in full. The accumulated retainage is being held by the customer until the work receives final certification by the architect. Once the customer accepts the project, the final payment that includes the accumulated retainage is made to the general contractor.
When you bill a project for which the retainage with contract cap is configured, the selected contract cap retainage is applied to a project when you bill a project until the cap is reached. {br}

After the cap has been reached and the '''Total Retained Amount''' held per project is at its maximum, no new retainage amount is calculated for further invoices created during project billing. The '''Total Retained Amount''' held per project is reallocated between the invoice lines based on their weight and retainage capacity. That is, the invoices have the same total '''Allocated Retained Amount''' but with different portions of it in the invoice lines (which allocated to the lines is based on calculated line weight).{br}

You can gradually release the retainage held on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_51_00_00|Release AR Retainage] ([~/?ScreenId=AR510000|AR510000]) form to clear the '''Unreleased Retainage''' balance held on the AR invoice lines; this in turn cause decreasing of the '''Retained Amount'''in revenue budget lines on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. {br}

The total retainage amount held per project ('''Total Retained Amount''') stays the same across all the invoices prepared for the projectunless a change order that affects the project revenue budget has been released. If you configure the project to include change orders in the retainage calculation (that is, the '''Include CO''' check box is selected on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form), the contract total, completed percentage and the cap amount are recalculated in accordance with the changes in the revenue budget that has been introduced by the released change orders.[anchor|#section_tsd_ydv_qmb]
==Calculation of Retainage Amounts==
In a pro forma invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form prepared for a project with contract cap retainage, the system calculates the '''Allocated Retained Amount''' (that is, the amount of retainage that is considered to be held for the related revenue budget line in this pro forma invoice), by using the following formula:{br}

{{Allocated Retained Amount = (Total Retained Amount - Total Released Retainage) * Line Weight}}{br}

In this formula:{br}

{{Total Retained Amount}} is the sum of retained amounts summed up by all revenue budget lines of the project.{br}

{{Total Released Retainage}} is the sum of amounts of the released AR retainage documents that are related to the project.{br}

Once the contract cap is reached, in the subsequent invoices, the system reallocates the accumulated retainage amount on each billing line based on a line weight calculation. For each pro forma invoice line, {{Line Weight}} is calculated as follows:{br}

{{Line Weight = (Amount to Invoice + Previously Invoiced) / Total Completed}}{br}

where {{Total Completed}} is the sum of {{Amount to Invoice}} and {{Previously Invoiced}} amounts for all pro forma invoice lines.[anchor|#section_rn5_wdv_qmb]
==Retainage in AIA Reports==
The calculated '''Allocated Retained Amount''' of a pro forma invoice line is shown in the '''Retainage Held''' column in the continuation sheet of AIA report prepared on the [HelpRoot_Construction\PM_64_40_00|AIA Report] ([~/?ScreenId=PM644000|PM644000]) or [HelpRoot_Construction\PM_64_45_00|AIA Report with Quantity] ([~/?ScreenId=PM644500|PM644500]) form. In the AIA report prepared for the project with the contract cap retainage, the retainage held amount is equal to the allocated retained amount from pro forma invoice that was calculated by the formula. ((({S:Warn}In projects with other retainage modes, a pro forma invoice prepared for a project does not include the allocated retained amount. In the AIA report prepared for such project, the retainage held amount it is equal to the '''Retainage Amount''' of the pro forma invoice.
)))
The total retainage amount on the cover sheet of the AIA report is calculated as the sum of the held retainage amounts on the AIA continuation sheet. Once the retainage is released, the released retainage amount is included in the current payment due amount.]]></column>

You can gradually release the retainage held on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR510000|AR510000]) Release AR Retainage (AR510000) form to clear the       Unreleased Retainage  balance held on the AR invoice lines;      this in turn     cause  decreasing      of  the       Retained Amount in revenue budget lines on the       Revenue Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects     form .  The total retainage amount held per     project  ( Total Retained      Amount )  stays the same across all the     invoices  prepared for the project unless     a  change     order that affects the project revenue budget has been released. If you configure the project to     include change orders in the retainage calculation (that is, the  Include      CO  check box is selected on the  Summary  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form), the contract total, completed percentage and the     cap amount are recalculated in accordance with the changes in the revenue budget that has been     introduced by the released change orders. Calculation of Retainage Amounts In a pro forma invoice on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form     prepared for a project with contract cap retainage, the system calculates the       Allocated Retained Amount  (that is, the amount of retainage that is     considered to be held for the related revenue budget line in this pro forma invoice), by using     the following formula: Allocated Retained Amount = (Total Retained Amount - Total Released Retainage) * Line      Weight In this formula: Total Retained Amount  is the sum of retained amounts summed up by all revenue     budget lines of the project. Total Released Retainage  is the sum of amounts of the released AR retainage     documents that are related to the project. Once the contract cap is reached, in the subsequent invoices, the system reallocates the     accumulated retainage amount on each billing line based on a line weight calculation. For each     pro forma invoice line,  Line Weight  is calculated as follows: Line Weight = (Amount to Invoice + Previously Invoiced) / Total Completed where  Total Completed  is the sum of  Amount to Invoice  and       Previously Invoiced  amounts for all pro forma invoice lines. Retainage in AIA Reports The calculated  Allocated Retained Amount  of a pro forma invoice line is     shown in the  Retainage Held  column in the continuation sheet of AIA     report prepared on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM644000|PM644000]) AIA Report (PM644000) or   ([~/?ScreenId=PM644500|PM644500]) AIA Report with Quantity (PM644500) form. In the AIA report prepared for the project with the     contract cap retainage, the retainage held amount is equal to the allocated retained amount from     pro forma invoice that was calculated by the formula.  In projects with other retainage modes, a pro forma invoice prepared for a project does not     include the allocated retained amount. In the AIA report prepared for such project, the     retainage held amount it is equal to the  Retainage Amount  of the pro     forma invoice. The total retainage amount on the cover sheet of the AIA report is calculated as the sum of     the held retainage amounts on the AIA continuation sheet.

The following sections provide details you can use to ensure that the system is configured properly for billing projects with contract cap retainage, and to understand (and change, if needed) the settings that affect the processing workflow.
==Implementation Checklist==
We recommend that before you initially perform billing for projects with contract cap retainage, you make sure the needed features have been enabled, settings have been specified, and entities have been created, as summarized in the following checklist.[anchor|#_75f5a845-9a95-409c-9ffd-7c022ec672dc]

==Other Settings That Affect the Workflow==
You can affect the processing workflow by specifying additional system settings as follows:[anchor|#ul_jhk_3vf_kv]
*If the '''Change Order Workflow''' check box is selected for a project, select the '''Include CO''' check box to make the system calculate the '''Contract Total''' and contract '''Completed (%)''' based on the revised revenue budget values (with change orders included in the calculation). Otherwise, only original budget values will be used for calculation.
*The following general ledger settings should be specified on the '''Posting Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_10_20_00|General Ledger Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=GL102000|GL102000]) form:
**Make sure that the '''Automatically Post on Release''' check box is selected. This setting causes GL batches to be immediately posted after they are released.
**Clear the '''Generate Consolidated Batches''' check box to cause every AR transaction you enter to be posted as an individual batch to the general ledger. (When this check box is selected, the system consolidates into a single batch all transactions in the same currency posted to the same period for all documents being released.)
*The following accounts receivable settings should be specified on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) form: 
**Select the '''Hold Documents on Entry''' check box in the '''Data Entry Settings''' section. This setting gives the created AR invoices the ''On Hold'' status.
**Clear the '''Require Payment Reference on Entry''' check box in the '''Data Entry Settings''' section. This setting means that you do not have to enter a payment reference number in the '''Payment Ref.''' box when creating an AR invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form.
**Make sure that the '''Automatically Post on Release''' check box is selected in the '''Posting Settings''' section. This setting causes AR invoices to be automatically posted to the general ledger once they are released.
**If you want to retain the taxes calculated on the retained amount, you select the '''Retain Taxes''' check box in the '''Retainage Settings''' section. If you want to pay full tax amount on the invoice with retainage, you leave this box cleared. For details on configuration of taxes with retainage, see [HelpRoot_Construction\Construction_ARInvoice_with_Retainage_GeneralInfo2|AR Invoices with Retainage: Configuration of the Default Retainage Settings].
**If you want the system to automatically release retainage documents that you create on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_51_00_00|Release AR Retainage] ([~/?ScreenId=AR510000|AR510000]) form, you select the '''Automatically Release Retainage Documents''' check box. To release them manually, you leave this check box cleared.
*:With these settings specified and entities defined, users in your company can record and process documents in Acumatica ERP quickly and accurately, with a minimum of manual actions.

Firms managing construction projects have requirements to protect their clients, vendors, suppliers, and partners from many potential issues associated with compliance. These compliance issues might be associated with federal, state and local governmental requirements, but may also be legal and procedural. Compliance tracking allows a firm to establish the compliance items that should be captured for different types of entities, so that this information can be used for in-place warnings to users and for reports on project exposure.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#_51319559-9b31-4219-8298-e560f910d44f]
*Configure categories and statuses for compliance documents
*Enter compliance documents for a vendor
*Track expired compliance documents

==Applicable Scenarios==
You apply a compliance document to an entity in the system when it is necessary to warn about potential issues associated with compliance
==Compliance Type Creation==
The following types of compliance items are provided by default and can be extended with more types that you can track and report on:[anchor|#_d627ee76-91f2-4b49-b187-06d6065159b7]
*''Certificate''
* ''Insurance''
* ''Lien Waiver''
* ''Notice''
* ''Status''

You can configure common attributes that are available for all types of compliance, as well as define custom attributes for each compliance type on the [HelpRoot_Construction\CL_30_10_00|Compliance Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CL301000|CL301000]) form. Once a compliance type has been configured, the compliance items of that type can be recorded and viewed on the [HelpRoot_Construction\CL_40_10_00|Compliance Management] ([~/?ScreenId=CL401000|CL401000]) form.
==Warnings About Compliance Issues==
Each compliance item can be associated with various types of documents and with multiple entities, such as project, project task, cost code, vendor, and customer. On the '''Compliance''' tab of each of the forms listed below, you can enter and review the compliance items associated with the entity:[anchor|#_995b4834-1fa8-4d44-9424-e7364ce9008d]

 Acumatica ERP Construction                         Edition supports the functionality of joint payments. That is, you can create a bill for the vendor you work with and specify other vendors in the bill who are not a part of a project but partially provide services or materials for the project. You then can process payments for this bill.
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#_cc6e0f4e-9bd9-43d0-9490-3dee6cf9f03a]
*Specify joint payees for an accounts payable bill
*Specify joint amounts for different lines of an accounts payable bill
*Create joint checks and process the payments

==Applicable Scenarios==
You process a joint payment to register that the payment was made jointly to two or more parties. A joint check is used as a guarantee that the funds associated with the material or work provided to your company on a project are paid to a vendor that is not an active member of the project team.
==Creation of an AP Bill from Joint Payees==
You enter a bill for joint payees on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form. You perform the same steps as you do when you add a bill for one vendor, except that you select the '''Joint Payees''' check box, and specify the following settings for each payee involved on the '''Joint Payees''' tab:[anchor|#_5260ce57-74a1-4c7d-a995-f00d55b4bf0f]
*The joint payee.
*:You can specify a joint payee in any of the following ways:
**If the joint payee is registered in your system as a vendor, you can select that vendor in the '''Joint Payee (Vendor)''' column.
**If there is no vendor record that corresponds to the joint payee, you can simply type the name in the text box in the '''Joint Payee''' column.
*In the '''Bill Line Nbr.''' column, the bill line that corresponds to the item for which the joint payee is going to receive the payment.
*In the '''Joint Amount Owed''' box, the amount to be received by the payee.
*:If the '''Pay by Line''' check box is selected, on the '''Document Details''' tab, the '''Balance''' of the line is reduced by the amount specified in the '''Joint Amount Paid''' column when the payment is released. If the check box is cleared, the '''Joint Amount Paid''' affects the balance of the entire bill.
*:((({S:Warn}The sum of the joint amounts cannot be greater than or equal to the total amount of the bill. At first, the joint balance for each line equals the joint amount owed. Partial payments may be applied to the lines, and as a result, the joint balance will decrease until it is completely paid and thus reduced to zero.
)))

For details on creating a bill, see [HelpRoot_Financials\Finance_ProcessingAPBills_GeneralInfo|AP Bills: General Info]. 
==Payment to Joint Payees==
You create checks for the joint bill by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Pay Bill/Apply Adjustment'''. The system opens the '''Indicate Amounts to Pay''' dialog box, in which, you specify the amounts to be paid for each vendor. When you click '''Confirm''' in this dialog box, the system creates a separate check for each vendor. You then print and release checks to apply payment to the bill. For details on payments, see [HelpRoot_Financials\Finance_PayingAPBills_GeneralInfo|AP Bill Payments: General Information].{br}

==Settings That Affect the Workflow==
You use accounts payable forms to record purchases you make on credit. The following settings and entities should be specified and defined, respectively:[anchor|#ul_jhk_3vf_kv]
*The following general ledger settings should be specified on the '''Posting Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_10_20_00|General Ledger Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=GL102000|GL102000]) form:
**Make sure that the '''Automatically Post on Release''' check box is selected. This setting causes GL batches to be immediately posted after they are released.
**Clear the '''Generate Consolidated Batches''' check box to cause every AP transaction you enter to be posted as an individual batch to the general ledger. (When this check box is selected, the system consolidates into a single batch all transactions in the same currency posted to the same period for all documents being released.)
*The following accounts payable settings should be specified on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_10_10_00|Accounts Payable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AP101000|AP101000]) form: 
**Select the '''Hold Documents on Entry''' check box in the '''Data Entry Settings''' section. This setting gives the created AP bills the ''On Hold'' status.
**Clear the '''Require Vendor Reference''' check box in the '''Data Entry Settings''' section. This setting means that you do not have to enter a vendor reference number in the '''Vendor Ref.''' box when creating an AP bill on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form.
**Make sure that the '''Automatically Post on Release''' check box is selected in the '''Posting Settings''' section. This setting indicates that AP bills will be automatically posted to the general ledger once they are released.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form, for a particular bill with joint payees, you can select the '''Pay by Line''' check box. In this case, you have to specify for which line each payee will receive payment on the '''Joint Payees''' tab. On release of the related payment, the balance of the line will be decreased.
*:If the '''Pay by Line''' check box is cleared, you need to specify only the amount to be received by the payee. On release of the related payment, the balance of the bill will be decreased.

With these settings specified and entities defined, users in your company can record and process documents in Acumatica ERP quickly and accurately, with a minimum of manual actions.]]></column>

A lien waiver is a compliance document involved in the payment process for a project. The party that receives a payment (for instance, a contractor, subcontractor, or material supplier) signs a lien waiver to waive their rights against the property in exchange for the payment.
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#_a76539ea-c56f-4d34-85e0-de3be3918691]
*Configure automatic generation of lien waivers
*Set up warnings on outstanding lien waivers
*Configure the mailing of lien waivers
*Process lien waivers

==Lien Waiver Types==
Basic types of lien waivers:[anchor|#_76f56437-0c8a-44cf-8813-217c586d3c77]
*''Conditional'' waivers for ''partial'' (or progress) payment: Used when a progress payment on the project is expected. A signed lien waiver of this type becomes effective immediately after the payment has been received.
*''Conditional'' waivers for ''final'' payment: Used when the entire contract value is to be paid at one time or when the payment in question is the final payment for a project. A signed lien waiver of this type also becomes effective only after the payment has been received.
*''Unconditional'' waivers for ''partial'' (or progress payment): Used when a progress payment on the project is expected. A lien waiver of this type becomes effective after it has been signed, regardless of whether the payment has been actually received.
*''Unconditional'' waivers for ''final'' payment: Used for a one-time payment or for the final payment for a project. A lien waiver of this type becomes unconditionally effective once it has been signed even if no payment has been actually received.

Users can manually create new lien waivers, or automatic generation of lien waivers can be set up in the system, separately for conditional and unconditional lien waivers.]]></column>

The following activity will walk you through the process of configuring generation of lien waivers.
==Story==
Suppose that the SweetLife company wants conditional lien waivers to be automatically generated when payments linked to AP bills are submitted. You need to configure mailing of lien waivers and their automatic generation.
==Process Overview==
Brief description of workflow (with forms, on which particular actions are performed).
==System Preparation==
Sign in as an administrator by using the ''admin'' username and the ''123'' password.
==Step 1: Configuring the Mailing of Lien Waivers==
The processing of lien waivers includes emailing the documents to vendors who should return them signed. So that the system can generate emails with lien waivers attached, mailing should be properly configured.{br}

To configure the mailing, do the following:[anchor|#_afdbb42c-8eb8-4bef-bb8c-ad9904c257f6]
#Create a notification template for lien waivers as follows:
##On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_03|Notification Templates] (SM2040PL) form, click '''Add New Record''' on the form toolbar.
##In the '''Screen Name''' box, select the ''Print/Email Lien Waivers (CL502000)'' form.
##In the '''Description''' box, type <tt>Lien Waivers</tt>.
##In the '''Subject''' box, type<tt> Lien waiver email</tt>.
##In the text editor area on the '''Message''' tab, specify the following text:
##:''Dear Vendor,''
##: ''Here&rsquo;s your lien waiver.''
##: ''Sincerely yours,''
##: ''SweetLife''
##Save the changes.
#:When generating emails with lien waivers, the system will use the subject and the message body from the notification template.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_10_00|Vendor Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AP201000|AP201000]) form, select the ''SUBCON'' vendor class, click the '''Mailing Settings''' tab, and do the following:
##Make sure that the ''Conditional Final'' and ''Conditional Partial'' mailings are included in the '''Mailings''' table and marked as '''Active'''.
##For each of these mailings, select the ''Lien Waiver'' notification template in the '''Notification Template''' column and in the '''Recipients''' table below, add a row with ''Remittance'' selected in the '''Contact Type''' column and default settings specified in other columns.
##Make sure that in the '''Report''' column, ''CL642003'' is specified for the ''Conditional Final'' mailing and ''CL642001 ''for the ''Conditional Partial'' mailing. These are the identifiers of the printed forms that will be generated and attached to an email.
##Save the changes.
##:These settings will be copied for any new vendor of the class. Note that mailing settings may be overridden and set up as needed for any individual vendor. When generating emails with lien waivers, the system will specify the email address of the remittance contact of the vendor (which you can review on the '''Payment Settings''' tab of the Vendors form) as the recipient address. Emails will be sent from the default system email account.

==Step 2: Configuring Automatic Generation of Lien Waivers==
Do the following:[anchor|#_bbb8981e-330c-4ee3-879f-0bb7b74b4a2f]
#On the '''Lien Waiver Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_Construction\CL_30_10_00|Compliance Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CL301000|CL301000]) form, do the following:
##Select the''' Automatically Generate Lien Waivers''' check box in the '''Conditional Lien Waivers''' group of elements.
##Review the default settings and click '''Save''' on the form toolbar.
##:Because the '''Hold Documents on Entry''' check box is selected on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_10_10_00|Accounts Payable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AP101000|AP101000]) form, a lien waiver will be generated when the status of the accounts payable check (or checks) changes from ''On Hold'' to ''Pending Printing'' or ''Balanced''. (If the '''Hold Documents on Entry''' check box is cleared, a lien waiver is generated immediately when the accounts payable check is created with the ''Pending Printing'' or ''Balanced'' status.)
##:The through date is set to be the last day of the posting period of the accounts payable bill. This date defines by which date the party that signs a lien waiver agrees to waive their rights for the work completed since the previous lien waiver (if any).
##:The amount of an automatically generated final conditional lien waiver will equal the amount of the accounts payable bill.
#On the '''Lien Waiver Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, for the ''HOTEL'' project, review the '''Through Date''' setting and then, in the table below it, specify the following settings: 
#*'''Vendor Class''': ''SUBCON'' (this indicates that conditional lien waivers may be automatically generated only for vendors that belong to this vendor class)
#*'''Minimum Commitment Amount''': ''2000'' (lien waivers will be automatically generated for commitments whose amount is larger than or equal to the specified minimum amount)
#Save the changes.
#On the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_10_00|Vendor Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AP201000|AP201000]) form, for the ''SUBCON'' vendor class, select the '''Generate Lien Waivers Automatically''' check box to indicate that lien waivers will be automatically generated for vendors that belong to this vendor class. The lien waiver settings specified for the particular project will be used for generating the lien waivers.
#On the '''General Info tab''' of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form, create a vendor with the following settings specified:
#*'''Vendor ID''': ARCHCO
#*'''Vendor Name''': Architectural Design Company
#*'''Email''': main@abc.con
#*'''Vendor Class''': ''SUBCON''
#Make sure that the '''Generate Lien Waivers Based on Project Settings''' check box is selected.
#Save the changes.

These settings will be copied for any new vendor of                                 the class. Note that mailing settings may be overridden and set up                                 as needed for any individual vendor. When generating emails with                                 lien waivers, the system will specify the email address of the                                 remittance contact of the vendor (which you can review on the                                      Payment Settings  tab of the Vendors form) as the                                 recipient address. Emails will be sent from the default system email                                 account. Step 2: Configuring Automatic Generation of Lien Waivers Do the following: On the  Lien Waiver Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CL301000|CL301000]) Compliance                         Preferences Compliance Preferences (CL301000) form, do the following: Select the  Automatically Generate Lien Waivers  check box in the                                  Conditional Lien Waivers  group of elements. Review the default settings and click  Save  on the form                                 toolbar. Because the  Hold Documents on Entry  check box is                                 selected on the  General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP101000|AP101000]) Accounts Payable Preferences                                 (AP101000) form, a lien waiver will be generated when the status of                                 the accounts payable check (or checks) changes from  On Hold                                  to  Pending Printing  or  Balanced . (If the  Hold                                     Documents on Entry  check box is cleared, a lien waiver is                                 generated immediately when the accounts payable check is created                                 with the  Pending Printing  or  Balanced                                  status.) The through date is set to be the last day of the                                 posting period of the accounts payable bill. This date defines by                                 which date the party that signs a lien waiver agrees to waive their                                 rights for the work completed since the previous lien waiver (if                                 any). The amount of an automatically generated final                                 conditional lien waiver will equal the amount of the accounts                                 payable bill. On the  Lien Waiver Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects Projects (PM301000) form, for the  HOTEL  project, review the                          Through Date  setting and then, in the table below it, specify the                     following settings:  Vendor Class :  SUBCON  (this indicates that conditional lien                             waivers may be automatically generated only for vendors that belong to                             this vendor class) Minimum Commitment Amount :  2000  (lien waivers will be                             automatically generated for commitments whose amount is larger than or                             equal to the specified minimum amount) Save the changes. On the  General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP201000|AP201000]) Vendor Classes (AP201000)                     form, for the  SUBCON  vendor class, select the  Generate Lien Waivers                         Automatically  check box to indicate that lien waivers will be                     automatically generated for vendors that belong to this vendor class. The lien                     waiver settings specified for the particular project will be used for generating                     the lien waivers. On the  General Info tab  of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors Vendors                     (AP303000) form, create a vendor with the following settings specified: Vendor ID : ARCHCO Vendor Name : Architectural Design Company Email : main@abc.con Vendor Class :  SUBCON Make sure that the  Generate Lien Waivers Based on Project                         Settings  check box is selected.

Requests for information (RFIs) are used for obtaining information that is not present in (or cannot be inferred from) the contract documents. The RFI is usually submitted by a general contractor or subcontractor and a design or engineering professional is usually specified as a contact person who is expected to provide the needed information.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Create and process a new request for information
*Create a new request for information that relates to another request for information
*Create a change request from a request from information
*Mass-assign owners to requests for information

==Applicable Scenarios==
You process a request for information in the system in the following cases:[anchor|#_7165d0ed-fbf9-4bca-b563-a0155c7a9310]
*When some information is not present in a project, and your company requests it from an external expert (outgoing request)
*When someone, usually a subcontractor, requests a particular information about the project form your company (incoming request)

==Processing Workflow of Outgoing Request for Information==
Generally, in the system, the process consists of the following steps:[anchor|#_383087af-124b-4bd6-912c-c383c7095d89]
#Entering the request for information to the system: The project manager creates a request for information. The request for information has the ''New'' status.
#Opening the request for information: The project manager sends emails with the request to subject matter experts. The request for information has the ''Open'' status, indicating that the process has been started.
#Closing the request for information: When the necessary information has been sent, the owner of the document closes the request for information by changing its status to ''Closed'', indicating that the process has been completed or by creating a change request from the request for information. The manager also specifies the reason of closing of the request. 

==Processing Workflow of Incoming Request for Information==
Generally, in the system, the process consists of the following steps:[anchor|#_8a737417-dc7b-4b60-92f2-0747df3a9ac2]
#Entering the request for information to the system: The project manager creates a request for information with the '''Incoming''' check box selected and a person who is responsible for the answer specified in the '''Owner''' box of the [HelpRoot_Construction\PJ_30_10_00|Request for Information] ([~/?ScreenId=PJ301000|PJ301000]) form. The request for information has the ''New'' status.
#Opening the request for information: The project manager opens the request by changing its status to ''Open'', indicating that the process has been started. The manager also specifies the reason of opening of the request. 
#Closing the request for information: When the necessary information has been sent, the owner of the document closes the request for information by changing its status to ''Closed'', indicating that the process has been completed or by creating a change request from the request for information. The manager also specifies the reason of closing of the request.

A drawing log is a collection of drawings and designs related to a project. A member of a project team can create a drawing log, specify all relevant settings of the drawing log, and upload a drawing or a group of drawings to the drawing log. 
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#_2c236344-6f35-4c0f-8d98-480e106f960d]
*Configure drawing logs and set up disciplines and statuses
*Create drawing logs
*Upload and download images linked to drawing logs
*Link requests for information and project issues to existing drawing logs
*Email drawings and requests for information
*Create revisions of drawing logs

==Applicable Scenarios==
You create a drawing log when a new file with a drawing, design, or sketch needs to be associated with a project and no drawing log has already been created for the project.
==Drawing Log Creation==
You can create a drawing log on one of the following forms:[anchor|#_87b34863-8e9f-4412-aa4e-91b782a746cb]
*[HelpRoot_Construction\PJ_30_30_00|Drawing Log] ([~/?ScreenId=PJ303000|PJ303000]): On this entry form, you create one drawing log and specify all of its settings.
*[HelpRoot_Construction\PJ_40_30_00|Drawing Logs] ([~/?ScreenId=PJ403000|PJ403000]): On this inquiry form, you can view a list of drawing logs. You can also initiate the creation of a drawing log on this form.

If any changes have been made to the initial drawing, you can update the drawing by uploading a new file version to the existing drawing log or creating a new revision of the drawing. If the uploaded drawing is an update of a previous drawing in the log, you should specify the revision number that indicates the up-to-date version of the drawing.{br}

Additionally, you can upload sketches (that is, drafts of drawings). When you upload a sketch, you should specify the sketch number in the '''Sketch''' box.
==Related RFI and Project Issues==
To link a drawing log to a request for information (RFI), you can click '''Create''' > '''New RFI''' on the [HelpRoot_Construction\PJ_30_30_00|Drawing Log] ([~/?ScreenId=PJ303000|PJ303000]) form. The system creates the RFI, whose settings you specify, and links this RFI to the drawing log. When you send an email with the RFI, you can attach drawings from the linked drawing log to the email. Also, from the [HelpRoot_Construction\PJ_40_30_00|Drawing Logs] ([~/?ScreenId=PJ403000|PJ403000]) form, you can create an RFI that is linked to multiple drawing logs.{br}

From the [HelpRoot_Construction\PJ_30_30_00|Drawing Log] form, you can create a project issue linked to a particular drawing log. To do so, you click '''Create''' > '''New Project Issues'''. The system creates the project issue, whose settings you specify, and links this project issue to the drawing log. When you send an email with the project issue, you can attach drawings from the linked drawing log to the email. Also, from the [HelpRoot_Construction\PJ_40_30_00|Drawing Logs] form, you can create a project issue that is linked to multiple drawing logs.]]></column>

In Acumatica ERP Construction                         Edition, you can create photo logs. You can associate each photo log with a particular project and, optionally, a project task.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Create a photo log
*Upload photos to the photo log
*Download a ZIP archive with all the photos and files of the photo log
*Send an email with all the photos and files of the photo log
*Search for a photo log or a particular photo in the system

==Applicable Scenarios==
You create a photo log when you have any number of photos taken at a construction site, and you want to associate with one another and keep them for a project or project task.
==Preparation to Use Photo Logs==
Before you can starting using photo logs, numbering sequences should be specified for both photo logs and photos on the [HelpRoot_Construction\PJ_10_30_00|Photo Log Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PJ103000|PJ103000]) form.{br}

On the '''Status''' tab of this form, you can also define custom statuses for photo logs. The ''N/A'' status, which is the only predefined status in the system, specified by default for a new photo log. This status cannot be deleted, but you can change its name and description, if needed.{br}

On the '''Attributes''' tab of the form, you can specify the list of attributes that will be available for individual photos in a photo log. When a user adds a photo in the photo log, the user specifies the appropriate attribute values for the photo.
==Creation of a Photo Log==
You can create a photo log by using the [HelpRoot_Construction\PJ_30_50_00|Photo Log] ([~/?ScreenId=PJ305000|PJ305000]) form. This form opens when you click '''Add New Record''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_Construction\PJ_40_50_00|Photo Logs] ([~/?ScreenId=PJ405000|PJ405000]) form.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_Construction\PJ_30_50_00|Photo Log] form, you need to specify the project for which the photo log is being created, the date, and the status. Also, you can specify a project task and a brief description for the photo log.{br}

On the '''Photos''' tab, you need to click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar to open the [HelpRoot_Construction\PJ_30_50_10|Photo] ([~/?ScreenId=PJ305010|PJ305010]) form, through which you can upload a photos and add it to a photo log. To add the photo to the photo log, you click the '''Upload Photo''' button next to the '''Photo Log ID''' box (which the system initially fills in with the ID of the photo log from which you added the photo), select a photo in the '''Upload New Photo''' dialog box, click '''Upload''', and then save your changes. You can add any number of photos to a photo log.{br}

In the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_Construction\PJ_30_50_10|Photo] form, if you select the '''Main Photo''' check box, the photo is displayed in the preview area on the [HelpRoot_Construction\PJ_40_50_00|Photo Logs] form as the main photo of the entire photo log. Only one photo can be marked as the main photo for a photo log. If no photo is marked as the main photo of a photo log, the preview area remains empty. 
==Use of Photo Logs==
When working with photo logs on the [HelpRoot_Construction\PJ_40_50_00|Photo Logs] ([~/?ScreenId=PJ405000|PJ405000]) inquiry form, you can also do the following:[anchor|#_331e000c-ca07-497d-9924-1e51c6687db4]
*Narrow the list of photo logs by project and by project task by using the '''Project''' and '''Project Task''' boxes in the Selection area.
*Download photos from selected photo logs to a single ZIP archive by selecting the unlabeled check boxes for the needed photo logs in the table in the right pane and clicking '''Actions''' > '''Download Zip''' on the form toolbar.
*Email photos from selected photo logs as an email attachment by selecting the unlabeled check boxes for the needed photo logs in the table in the right pane and clicking '''Actions''' > '''Email''' on the form toolbar.

If you delete a photo log, all photos included in the photo log are also deleted.
To move a photo from one photo log to another, you can simply select the destination photo log in the '''Photo Log ID''' box for the photo on the [HelpRoot_Construction\PJ_30_50_10|Photo] ([~/?ScreenId=PJ305010|PJ305010]) form and save the changes.]]></column>

Learning Objectives In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following: Create a photo log Upload photos to the photo log Download a ZIP archive with all the photos and files of the photo log Send an email with all the photos and files of the photo log Search for a photo log or a particular photo in the system Applicable Scenarios You create a photo log when you have any number of photos taken at a construction site, and     you want to associate with one another and keep them for a project or project task. Preparation to Use Photo Logs Before you can starting using photo logs, numbering sequences should be specified for both     photo logs and photos on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PJ103000|PJ103000]) Photo Log Preferences (PJ103000) form. On the  Status  tab of this form, you can also define custom statuses for     photo logs. The  N/A  status, which is the only predefined status in the system, specified     by default for a new photo log. This status cannot be deleted, but you can change its name and     description, if needed. On the  Attributes  tab of the form, you can specify the list of     attributes that will be available for individual photos in a photo log. When a user adds a photo     in the photo log, the user specifies the appropriate attribute values for the photo. Creation of a Photo Log You can create a photo log by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=PJ305000|PJ305000]) Photo Log (PJ305000) form. This form     opens when you click  Add New Record  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PJ405000|PJ405000]) Photo Logs (PJ405000) form. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PJ305000|PJ305000]) Photo Log form, you need to     specify the project for which the photo log is being created, the date, and the status. Also,     you can specify a project task and a brief description for the photo log. On the  Photos  tab, you need to click  Add Row  on     the table toolbar to open the   ([~/?ScreenId=PJ305010|PJ305010]) Photo (PJ305010) form, through which     you can upload a photos and add it to a photo log. To add the photo to the photo log, you click     the  Upload Photo  button next to the  Photo Log ID      box (which the system initially fills in with the ID of the photo log from which you added the     photo), select a photo in the  Upload New Photo  dialog box, click       Upload , and then save your changes. You can add any number of photos to     a photo log. In the Summary area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PJ305010|PJ305010]) Photo form, if you select the  Main Photo  check box, the photo is displayed     in the preview area on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PJ405000|PJ405000]) Photo Logs     form as the main photo of the entire photo log. Only one photo can be marked as the main photo     for a photo log. If no photo is marked as the main photo of a photo log, the preview area     remains empty.  Use of Photo Logs When working with photo logs on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PJ405000|PJ405000]) Photo Logs (PJ405000) inquiry form, you     can also do the following: Narrow the list of photo logs by project and by project task by using the        Project  and  Project Task  boxes in the Selection      area. Download photos from selected photo logs to a single ZIP archive by selecting the unlabeled      check boxes for the needed photo logs in the table in the right pane and clicking  Actions Download Zip  on the form toolbar. Email photos from selected photo logs as an email attachment by selecting the unlabeled      check boxes for the needed photo logs in the table in the right pane and clicking  Actions Email  on the form toolbar. If you delete a photo log, all photos included in the photo log are also deleted. To move a photo from one photo log to another, you can simply select the destination photo log     in the  Photo Log ID  box for the photo on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PJ305010|PJ305010]) Photo (PJ305010) form and save the     changes. ]]></column>

In the construction industry, many independent activities may take place on a project site and in the office. To make sure that everyone is looking at the same data and that the data has been transferred from the field to the office accurately, ''daily field reports'' may be used by project managers and site supervisors to record observations, activities, and conditions that occur on a project site every day.{br}

In Acumatica ERP Construction                         Edition, the functionality of daily field reports (DFRs) provides members of a project team with a single location for updates about daily project activities, such as employee activities or subcontractor activities, as well as about daily weather observations, visitors to the site, and potential changes to a project budget. The daily field reports can be emailed to all relevant parties.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#_9a3653e0-5d18-4c3b-93ab-7bc935c3f5c5]
*Create and assign an approval map for daily field reports
*Create a daily field report
*Add to the daily field report the following entities:
**Labor time and activities
**Change requests
**Change orders
**Subcontractor activities
**Project issues
**Weather conditions

If the '''Enable History Log''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_Construction\PJ_10_10_00|Project Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PJ101000|PJ101000]) form, all new revisions of a daily field report are saved as PDF files and listed on the '''History''' tab on the [HelpRoot_Construction\PJ_30_40_00|Daily Field Report] ([~/?ScreenId=PJ304000|PJ304000]) form. A history log record is created when the status of the daily field report is changed to ''Completed''. The list of revisions is generated automatically and cannot be edited.
==Updates of Daily Field Reports==
A daily field report may be updated multiple times during the day, sometimes by different employees. You can update a daily field report only if it has the ''On Hold'' status—that is, if the '''Hold''' check box is selected for the daily field report on the [HelpRoot_Construction\PJ_30_40_00|Daily Field Report] ([~/?ScreenId=PJ304000|PJ304000]) form. If the daily field report has a different status, you need to select the '''Hold''' check box to put the document on hold before you start updating it.{br}{TOC}
==Deletion of Daily Field Reports==
You can delete an incorrect daily field report only if it is on hold and only if it has no related employee activities or subcontractor activities, no related change requests or project issues, and no records about weather conditions or visitors.
==Approval of Daily Field Reports==
If an approval workflow is configured in the system for daily field reports, a daily field report is assigned the ''Pending Approval'' status when you take the document off hold by clearing the '''Hold''' check box on the [HelpRoot_Construction\PJ_30_40_00|Daily Field Report] ([~/?ScreenId=PJ304000|PJ304000]) form.{br}

The authorized approver can approve the daily field report by using the '''Approve''' menu command on the '''Actions''' menu on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_Construction\PJ_30_40_00|Daily Field Report] form, or the approver can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) form to approve daily field reports along with documents of other types.{br}

If the approver rejects the daily field report, the document is assigned the ''Rejected'' status. Then it may be put on hold and updated as needed so that you can submit it for approval again.{br}

On the '''Approvals''' tab of the [HelpRoot_Construction\PJ_30_40_00|Daily Field Report] form, information about the approvals of the document is displayed. ((({S:Warn}This tab is available only if the ''Approval Workflow'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Daily Field Reports: General Information In the construction industry, many independent activities may take place on a project site         and in the office. To make sure that everyone is looking at the same data and that the data         has been transferred from the field to the office accurately,  daily field reports  may         be used by project managers and site supervisors to record observations, activities, and         conditions that occur on a project site every day. In  Acumatica ERP Construction                         Edition, the functionality of daily field reports (DFRs) provides members of a project team with         a single location for updates about daily project activities, such as employee activities or         subcontractor activities, as well as about daily weather observations, visitors to the site,         and potential changes to a project budget. The daily field reports can be emailed to all         relevant parties. Learning Objectives In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following: Create and assign an approval map for daily field reports Create a daily field report Add to the daily field report the following entities: Labor time and activities Change requests Change orders Subcontractor activities Project issues Weather conditions Site visitors Email the daily field report Settings That Affect the Daily Field Report  Before you can starting using daily field reports, a variety of settings need to be         specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PJ101000|PJ101000]) Project Management Preferences         (PJ101000) form, in the  Daily Field Report Settings  section of the            General Settings  tab. To determine the way daily field reports are         numbered, a numbering sequence should be entered in the  DFR Numbering           Sequence  box. If approvals will be required for daily field reports, on the  DFR Approval           Map  box, an approval map for daily field reports can be specified. Also, in         the  Pending Approval Notification  box, a notification template can be         specified. The system will use this template to generate notification emails for employees         who need to approve daily field reports. An employee will receive an approval notification         when a daily field report requires approval from this employee. The  DFR             Approval Map  and   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable FeaturesPending Approval Notification  boxes are available only if the              Approval Workflow  feature is enabled on the (CS100000) form. You can also select the  Enable History Log  check box to save all new         revisions of a daily field report as PDF files.  On the  Daily Field Report Copy Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PJ101000|PJ101000]) Project Management Preferences form, the settings of         daily field reports are listed. If the check box is selected for a setting, when a copy is         created through the use of the standard  Copy  and            Paste  actions on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PJ304000|PJ304000]) Daily Field Report (PJ304000) form, this         setting will be copied from an original daily field report to its copy. The default settings on the  Daily Field Report Copy Settings  tab of         the   ([~/?ScreenId=PJ101000|PJ101000]) Project Management Preferences form are initially         unavailable for editing. To be able to modify the list of settings, you should first select         the  Override Default Copy-Paste Settings  check box. Creation of Daily Field Reports You create a daily field report on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PJ304000|PJ304000]) Daily Field Report (PJ304000) form. In the            Project  box, you specify the related project, and in the            Project Manager  box, you select the employee who is responsible for         managing the project and authorized to approve the daily field report. In the daily field report, you can enter information about linked change requests,         subcontractor work, associated project issues, visitors to the project site, weather         conditions observed on the site, and activities of specific employees. When you save the new record, the identifier in the  DFR ID  box is         generated automatically in accordance with the numbering sequence specified for daily field         reports on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PJ101000|PJ101000]) Project Management Preferences         (PJ101000) form. Labor Time and Reporting Activities On the  Labor Time and Activities  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PJ304000|PJ304000]) Daily Field Report (PJ304000) form, you can         add a row for each employee time activity. In the row, you select the employee whose         activity should be included in the daily field report and specify the earning type, the sub         job, and the cost code for the activity. Also, you can enter the time that the employee         spent on the activity and specify whether this time is billable. You can enter multiple         lines if the employee performed different activities or if activities were performed by         different employees. The user can update or delete only time activity rows that have the  Open  status and         that are not included in employee time cards. The  Labor Time and Activities  tab is available only if the            Time Reporting on Activity  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form.

==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Create submittal types
*Create a submittal in the system
*Process a submittal
*Create a new revision of the submittal

==Applicable Scenarios==
You process a submittal when you want to track the process of verifying a document or another product that is necessary for a particular construction project.
==Submittal Processing Workflow==
You enter, modify, and process submittals on the [HelpRoot_Construction\PJ_30_60_00|Submittals] ([~/?ScreenId=PJ306000|PJ306000]) form.{br}

Generally, the processing of a submittal in the system consists of the following steps:[anchor|#_ad3a6f31-a354-4684-96db-9954ee90c40c]
#Entering the submittal: A user (who is then designated as the owner of the submittal) enters the submittal in the system. The submittal has the ''New'' status.
#:If the owner has the submittal products or documents, the owner can send them for approval at this point; if they are documents that can be attached to the submittal in the system, the owner can do so.
#Opening the submittal: When the submittal is ready, the owner indicates that the processing of the submittal has been started by opening the submittal in the system. This causes the submittal to have the ''Open'' status. 
#:If the documents have not yet been added, the owner sends an email to the responsible person in the submittal workflow to notify this person that they need to submit documents.
#Submitting documents and items: The submitter submits documents to the owner (if they have not been added by the owner).
#Approving documents and items: The owner sends the submittal documents or products for approval. The responsible persons approve or reject the submittal documents or items.
#Reviewing documents and items (optional): The owner sends the submittal documents or items for review.
#Closing the submittal: The owner indicates that the processing of the submittal has been completed by closing the submittal in the system. The submittal has the ''Closed'' status.

Also, if the submittal has been rejected, a new revision can be created for the submittal. The revision has the same submittal ID as the original submittal has but different revision ID. The system increases the value in the '''Revision ID''' box by 1 for each new revision. The system also copies the details of the submittal to the revision.]]></column>

To help employees to categorize and track the expenses, including the expenses related to a project, Acumatica ERP supports the use of corporate credit cards in expense receipts and claims. In this chapter, you will find topics that explain how to configure the system and process expense receipts with corporate cards.
==In This Chapter==
*[HelpRoot_Construction\Construction_Expense_Receipts_GeneralInfo|Expense Receipts with Corporate Cards: General Information]
*:Acumatica ERP supports the use of corporate credit cards on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_10_00|Expense Claim] ([~/?ScreenId=EP301000|EP301000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_10_20|Expense Receipt] ([~/?ScreenId=EP301020|EP301020]) forms. This helps employees to categorize and track the expenses, including the expenses related to a project. For example, while in the field, the workers of a construction company or professional service provider can buy something that they want to charge on a project and pay for it with a corporate card. Employees can still have out-of-pocket expenses that are reimbursed through the standard process.

==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#_5a30fe2a-6ab0-4096-bc8b-dabed226ebb2]
*Create a GL account, cash account, and payment method for a corporate credit card
*Create the corporate credit card in the system
*Create an expense receipt with the corporate credit card
*Process an expense claim for the expense receipt paid with the corporate credit card
*Reconcile a bank statement for the corporate credit card
*Create and release a bill for the bank

==Applicable Scenarios==
You process an expense receipt with a corporate credit card when you want to record expenses paid by a company corporate credit card. 
==Configuration of Corporate Cards==
Corporate credit cards can be configured on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_25_00|Corporate Cards] ([~/?ScreenId=CA202500|CA202500]) form. The card number is used for matching transactions on a bank statement. Multiple employees can use a single corporate card; these employees are listed in the table on the form.{br}

In order to create corporate cards on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_25_00|Corporate Cards] form, GL accounts, cash accounts, payment methods, and employees must be configured as described below.{br}

If the card currency differs from the currency of an employee who uses the corporate card, for this employee, the '''Enable Currency Override''' and '''Enable Rate Override''' check boxes must be selected on the '''General Info''' tab ('''Employee Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form. (The '''Currency ID''' box, where the employee currency is specified, can also be found in this section of the form.){br}

The cash account that is used for corporate cards should be configured as follows:[anchor|#_eaf11f35-9b48-4629-b84c-839653466414]
*A separate GL account should be configured for each bank and currency.
*Each GL account has a separate cash account with the following settings specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_20_00|Cash Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CA202000|CA202000]) form:
**The '''Clearing Account''' check box is cleared.
**The '''Restrict Visibility with Branch''' check box is cleared.
**The '''Use for Corporate Cards''' check box is selected.
**Only one payment method can be associated with the cash account.
**Optionally, the '''Requires Reconciliation''' check box is selected; if it is, a numbering sequence must be specified in the '''Reconciliation Numbering Sequence''' box. The predefined ''CARECON'' numbering sequence can be selected.
{br}

Although the cash account that is used for a corporate card must have only one associated payment method, this payment method can be selected for multiple cash accounts. If a payment method is selected for a cash account that is used for a corporate card, in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_40_00|Payment Methods] ([~/?ScreenId=CA204000|CA204000]) form, the '''Use in AP''' check box is selected. Also, on the '''Settings for Use in AP''' tab of the form, this payment method should have the following settings:[anchor|#_88735079-9395-4939-973b-95bc4b462db3]
*'''Not Required''' ('''Additional Processing''' section): Selected
*'''Require Unique Payment Ref.''' ('''Payment Settings''' section): Cleared

==Payment of Expense Receipts with Corporate Cards==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_10_20|Expense Receipt] ([~/?ScreenId=EP301020|EP301020]) form, in the '''Paid With''' box (in the '''Expense Details '''section of the '''Receipt Details''' tab), a user can select how the expense receipt has been paid. The following options are available:[anchor|#_1411788c-144d-4520-a3e0-8f3e519271a5]
*''Personal Account'': The company&rsquo;s expenses that the employee paid with his or her own funds and the company will need to reimburse this amount to the employee. This is the default option if the employee has no active corporate card assigned.
*''Corporate Card, Company Expense'': The company&rsquo;s expenses that are paid with a corporate card. This is the default option if the employee has an active corporate card assigned.
*''Corporate Card, Personal Expense'': The employee&rsquo;s personal expenses that are paid with a corporate card.

In the '''Corporate Card''' box, the user selects his or her corporate card. This box is unavailable on the form if ''Personal Account'' was selected in the '''Paid With''' box. The default corporate card, if any, is selected as follows:[anchor|#_fa68e37c-f829-43e1-a6d0-98e9b677a9d5]
*The corporate card used in the employee&rsquo;s most recent expense receipt is selected, if it is available. The most recent receipt is determined by the receipt&rsquo;s creation date ({{CreatedDate}}).
*If the corporate card that was used most recently is unavailable—that is, inactive, deleted, or not assigned to the employee—the employee&rsquo;s only active card or the first active card the system finds for the employee. The first corporate card is the first card in the employee&rsquo;s card list; this list is sorted alphabetically by name.

Corporate card expenses cannot be split. That is, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_10_20|Expense Receipt] form, in the '''Expense Details''' section of the '''Receipt Details''' tab, the '''Employee Part''' of an expense receipt paid with a corporate card must be zero.{br}

The '''Ref. Nbr.''' box, where a user can enter the reference number that usually matches the number of the original receipt, must be filled in if the '''Require Ref. Nbr. in Expense Receipts''' check box in selected on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_10_10_00|Time and Expenses Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=EP101000|EP101000]) form.
==Expense Claims for Expense Receipts Paid with Corporate Cards==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_10_00|Expense Claim] ([~/?ScreenId=EP301000|EP301000]) form, an expense claim can contain all the employee's expense receipts paid with corporate cards as long as they have the same card currency. Each expense claim line refers to an expense receipt. On release of an expense claim, the system creates documents as follows for the expense claim lines, depending on the value in the '''Paid With''' column:[anchor|#_0497cdd1-5185-401c-ad2a-29b56b794f48]
*''Personal Account'': A single AP bill is created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form for all the expense claim lines with positive amounts and a single AP debit adjustment is created on the same form for all the expense claim lines with negative amounts.
*''Corporate Card, Company Expense'': An AP quick check is created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_40_00|Quick Checks] ([~/?ScreenId=AP304000|AP304000]) form for each expense claim line, if the '''Post Summarized Corporate Card Company Expenses''' check box is cleared on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_10_10_00|Time and Expenses Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=EP101000|EP101000]) form.
*:If the '''Post Summarized Corporate Card Company Expenses''' check box in selected, the system creates a separate AP quick check for each group of the expense claim lines with the same date, corporate card, and reference number.
*:On release of this AP quick check, the system credits the card liability account and debits the expense account of the expense item specified in the expense receipt.
*''Corporate Card, Personal Expense'': A single AP debit adjustment is created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] form for all the expense claim lines.
*:On release of this AP debit adjustment, the system credits the card liability account and debits the employee&rsquo;s AP account.

==Bank Transactions Matching and Reconciliation==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_30_65_00|Import Bank Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=CA306500|CA306500]) form, an accountant can upload bank statement records for the liability cash account of a corporate card. If a bank statement record contains the corporate card number in text format, this number is shown in the '''Card Number''' column on the form. A single bank statement may contain transactions of all the corporate cards associated with the same cash account. For more information about importing bank transactions, see [HelpRoot_Financials\CA__CON_ImportBankTrans|Importing Transactions].{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_30_60_00|Process Bank Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=CA306000|CA306000]) form, for the liability cash account of a corporate card, the accountant can match an uploaded bank statement record to an existing payment, AP bill, or expense receipt as well as create a cash transaction if such a transaction has not found in the system. For details about matching bank transactions, see [HelpRoot_Financials\CA__CON_ProcessingImportTrans|Processing Imported Transactions].{br}

In the left pane of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_30_60_00|Process Bank Transactions] form, where the system shows the list of bank statement records, imported bank transactions contain the corporate card number in text format in the '''Card Number''' column.{br}

The system uses the available information about imported transactions for searching for matching documents and for calculating the relevance rate, which is a measure of how closely a document matches the selected transaction.{br}

The system uses the settings in the '''Weights for Relevance Calculation''' section of the '''Transaction Match Settings''' dialog box—'''Ref. Nbr. Weight''', '''Doc. Date Weight''', and '''Doc. Payee Weight'''—for searching payments and invoices as matching candidates. For more information about the matching process and the relevance calculation, see [HelpRoot_Financials\CA__CON_BankTran_MatchingSettings|Transaction Matching Settings].{br}

If no payment or invoice is found, the system uses certain settings in the '''Weights for Relevance Calculation''' and '''Expense Receipt Matching''' sections of the '''Transaction Match Settings''' dialog box—'''Ref. Nbr. Weight''', '''Doc. Date Weight''', and '''Amount Weight'''—for searching expense receipts for matching candidates.{br}

Unlike the relevance calculation for payments and invoices, for calculating the relevance rate for expense receipts, the system includes in the calculation the amount weight instead of the payee weight, using the following formula:{br}

{{AmountDistance() = NORMDIST(x, 0, DifferenceAmount, probability mass function) / NORMDIST(0, 0, DifferenceAmount, probability mass function)}}{br}

{{x = ABS(BankTransactionAmount - ExpenseCardCurrencyAmount)}}{br}

{{DifferenceAmount = Amount Difference Threshold (%) * BankTransactionAmount / 100}}{br}

Payments and invoices are selected as matching candidates by the exact amount of a bank transaction, which is consistent to the logic of bank transaction matching for regular bank accounts. The '''Amount Difference Threshold (%)''' is not applied for matching of payments and invoices and applied for matching of expense receipts that are recorded with the expense currency that differs from the card currency and therefore a difference between the amount of a bank transaction and the amount of an expense receipt may take place.{br}

The {{AmountDistance()}} formula returns a floating number that ranges in value from ''0'' to ''1''.{br}

The system calculates the relevance rate for an expense receipt by using the following formula:{br}

{{Match Relevance = DocDateWeight*DateDistance() + RefNbrWeight*RefNbrDistance() + AmountWeight*AmountDistance()}}{br}

If the user selects an imported bank transaction in the left pane of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_30_60_00|Process Bank Transactions] form, in the right pane, the system shows the list of matching documents it has found. Payments are shown on the '''Match to Payments''' tab. AP documents are shown on the '''Match to Invoices''' tab. A cash transaction can be created for the bank transaction on the '''Create Payment''' tab. Expense receipts are shown on the '''Match to Expense Receipts''' tab, which is displayed on the form only for cash accounts that are used for corporate cards—that is, cash accounts for which the '''Use for Corporate Cards''' check box selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_20_00|Cash Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CA202000|CA202000]) form.{br}

When a user auto-matches bank transactions, for each bank transaction, in the right pane, the system selects the '''Matched''' check box for the best candidate among all the found candidates by using the following rules:[anchor|#_7f418d5f-ed7c-4488-8ae5-a73f30b0c5a7]
#The best match is the document with the highest match relevance that is greater than 0.75.
#If multiple documents have the same highest match relevance, the system selects the first found document with the following priority: a payment, an AP document, and an expense receipt.
#If no documents have a match relevance greater than 0.75, the best match is a document that has a match relevance is equal to or greater than 0.2.
#:For example, if the match relevance of one document is 0.25 and the match relevance of another document is 0.5, the system selects the document with the match relevance of 0.5.
#:If more than one document satisfies this condition, the system selects the first found document with the following priority: a payment, an AP document, and an expense receipt.
#If only one document is found, it is the best match if its match relevance is equal to or greater than 0.2.

If none of the conditions above has been met, there is no best match for the transaction of the bank statement.{br}

Once an expense receipt and its corresponding bank statement record have been matched and processed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_30_60_00|Process Bank Transactions] form, they are no longer displayed on the form.
==Notes on the Matching Process==
There are the following limitations of the matching process:[anchor|#_6d324446-8bc9-4029-8279-9ed730e76126]
*If a user matches a bank transaction to an expense receipt in a different currency with the amount within the amount difference threshold, releases the corresponding claim, and the cash transaction is posted, and then the user unmatches the bank transaction from the expense receipt, the cash transaction will not appear as a candidate for matching on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_30_60_00|Process Bank Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=CA306000|CA306000]) form because the amounts differ.
*If a cash transaction originates from an expense claim, the cash transaction date in the system equals the expense claim date. There can be a significant delay between the date of the bank statement transaction and the date of the cash transaction in the system, which should be considered in the filter of dates in the '''Transaction Match Settings''' dialog box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_30_60_00|Process Bank Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=CA306000|CA306000]) form.

Configuration of Corporate Cards Corporate credit cards can be configured on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA202500|CA202500]) Corporate Cards     (CA202500) form. The card number is used for matching transactions on a bank statement. Multiple     employees can use a single corporate card; these employees are listed in the table on the     form. In order to create corporate cards on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA202500|CA202500]) Corporate Cards form,     GL accounts, cash accounts, payment methods, and employees must be configured as described     below. If the card currency differs from the currency of an employee who uses the corporate card, for     this employee, the  Enable Currency Override  and  Enable Rate      Override  check boxes must be selected on the  General Info      tab ( Employee Settings  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) Employees (EP203000) form. (The  Currency ID      box, where the employee currency is specified, can also be found in this section of the     form.) The cash account that is used for corporate cards should be configured as follows: A separate GL account should be configured for each bank and currency. Each GL account has a separate cash account with the following settings specified on the          ([~/?ScreenId=CA202000|CA202000]) Cash Accounts (CA202000) form: The  Clearing Account  check box is cleared. The  Restrict Visibility with Branch  check box is cleared. The  Use for Corporate Cards  check box is selected. Only one payment method can be associated with the cash account. Optionally, the  Requires Reconciliation  check box is selected; if         it is, a numbering sequence must be specified in the  Reconciliation Numbering          Sequence  box. The predefined  CARECON  numbering sequence can be         selected. Although the cash account that is used for a corporate card must have only one associated     payment method, this payment method can be selected for multiple cash accounts. If a payment     method is selected for a cash account that is used for a corporate card, in the Summary area of     the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA204000|CA204000]) Payment Methods (CA204000) form, the  Use in      AP  check box is selected. Also, on the  Settings for Use in      AP  tab of the form, this payment method should have the following settings: Not Required  ( Additional Processing  section):       Selected Require Unique Payment Ref.  ( Payment Settings        section): Cleared Payment of Expense Receipts with Corporate Cards On the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP301020|EP301020]) Expense Receipt (EP301020) form, in the  Paid      With  box (in the  Expense Details  section of the       Receipt Details  tab), a user can select how the expense receipt has been     paid. The following options are available: Personal Account : The company's expenses that the employee paid with his or her own      funds and the company will need to reimburse this amount to the employee. This is the default      option if the employee has no active corporate card assigned. Corporate Card, Company Expense : The company's expenses that are paid with a      corporate card. This is the default option if the employee has an active corporate card      assigned. Corporate Card, Personal Expense : The employee's personal expenses that are paid with      a corporate card. In the  Corporate Card  box, the user selects his or her corporate card.     This box is unavailable on the form if  Personal Account  was selected in the       Paid With  box. The default corporate card, if any, is selected as     follows: The corporate card used in the employee's most recent expense receipt is selected, if it is      available. The most recent receipt is determined by the receipt's creation date       ( CreatedDate ). If the corporate card that was used most recently is unavailable—that is, inactive, deleted,      or not assigned to the employee—the employee's only active card or the first active card the      system finds for the employee. The first corporate card is the first card in the employee's      card list; this list is sorted alphabetically by name. Corporate card expenses cannot be split. That is, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP301020|EP301020]) Expense Receipt form, in the  Expense Details      section of the  Receipt Details  tab, the  Employee      Part  of an expense receipt paid with a corporate card must be zero. The  Ref. Nbr.  box, where a user can enter the reference number that     usually matches the number of the original receipt, must be filled in if the  Require      Ref. Nbr. in Expense Receipts  check box in selected on the  General      Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP101000|EP101000]) Time and Expenses Preferences (EP101000)     form. Expense Claims for Expense Receipts Paid with Corporate Cards On the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP301000|EP301000]) Expense Claim (EP301000) form, an expense claim can     contain all the employee's expense receipts paid with corporate cards as long as they have the     same card currency. Each expense claim line refers to an expense receipt. On release of an     expense claim, the system creates documents as follows for the expense claim lines, depending on     the value in the  Paid With  column: Personal Account : A single AP bill is created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form for all the expense claim lines with      positive amounts and a single AP debit adjustment is created on the same form for all the      expense claim lines with negative amounts. Corporate Card, Company Expense : An AP quick check is created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP304000|AP304000]) Quick Checks (AP304000) form for each expense claim line, if the        Post Summarized Corporate Card Company Expenses  check box is cleared on      the  General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP101000|EP101000]) Time and Expenses Preferences (EP101000) form. If the  Post Summarized        Corporate Card Company Expenses  check box in selected, the system creates a       separate AP quick check for each group of the expense claim lines with the same date,       corporate card, and reference number. On release of this AP quick check, the system       credits the card liability account and debits the expense account of the expense item       specified in the expense receipt. Corporate Card, Personal Expense : A single AP debit adjustment is created on the         ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments form for all the expense claim lines. On       release of this AP debit adjustment, the system credits the card liability account and debits       the employee's AP account. Bank Transactions Matching and Reconciliation On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA306500|CA306500]) Import Bank Transactions (CA306500) form, an accountant can upload     bank statement records for the liability cash account of a corporate card. If a bank statement     record contains the corporate card number in text format, this number is shown in the       Card Number  column on the form. A single bank statement may contain     transactions of all the corporate cards associated with the same cash account. For more     information about importing bank transactions, see  Importing Transactions. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA306000|CA306000]) Process Bank Transactions (CA306000) form, for the liability cash     account of a corporate card, the accountant can match an uploaded bank statement record to an     existing payment, AP bill, or expense receipt as well as create a cash transaction if such a     transaction has not found in the system. For details about matching bank transactions, see  Processing Imported Transactions. In the left pane of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA306000|CA306000]) Process Bank Transactions form, where the system     shows the list of bank statement records, imported bank transactions contain the corporate card     number in text format in the  Card Number  column. The system uses the available information about imported transactions for searching for     matching documents and for calculating the relevance rate, which is a measure of how closely a     document matches the selected transaction. The system uses the settings in the  Weights for Relevance Calculation      section of the  Transaction Match Settings  dialog box— Ref. Nbr.      Weight ,  Doc. Date Weight , and  Doc. Payee      Weight —for searching payments and invoices as matching candidates. For more     information about the matching process and the relevance calculation, see  Transaction Matching Settings. If no payment or invoice is found, the system uses certain settings in the  Weights      for Relevance Calculation  and  Expense Receipt Matching      sections of the  Transaction Match Settings  dialog box— Ref.      Nbr. Weight ,  Doc. Date Weight , and  Amount      Weight —for searching expense receipts for matching candidates. Unlike the relevance calculation for payments and invoices, for calculating the relevance rate     for expense receipts, the system includes in the calculation the amount weight instead of the     payee weight, using the following formula: AmountDistance() = NORMDIST(x, 0, DifferenceAmount, probability mass function) /      NORMDIST(0, 0, DifferenceAmount, probability mass function) x = ABS(BankTransactionAmount - ExpenseCardCurrencyAmount) DifferenceAmount = Amount Difference Threshold (%) * BankTransactionAmount /      100 Payments and invoices are selected as matching candidates by the exact amount of a bank     transaction, which is consistent to the logic of bank transaction matching for regular bank     accounts. The  Amount Difference Threshold (%)  is not applied for matching     of payments and invoices and applied for matching of expense receipts that are recorded with the     expense currency that differs from the card currency and therefore a difference between the     amount of a bank transaction and the amount of an expense receipt may take place. The  AmountDistance()  formula returns a floating number that ranges in value     from  0  to  1 . The system calculates the relevance rate for an expense receipt by using the following     formula: Match Relevance = DocDateWeight*DateDistance() + RefNbrWeight*RefNbrDistance() +      AmountWeight*AmountDistance() If the user selects an imported bank transaction in the left pane of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA306000|CA306000]) Process Bank Transactions form, in the right pane, the system shows the list of     matching documents it has found. Payments are shown on the  Match to      Payments  tab. AP documents are shown on the  Match to      Invoices  tab. A cash transaction can be created for the bank transaction on the       Create Payment  tab. Expense receipts are shown on the  Match      to Expense Receipts  tab, which is displayed on the form only for cash accounts that     are used for corporate cards—that is, cash accounts for which the  Use for Corporate      Cards  check box selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA202000|CA202000]) Cash Accounts     (CA202000) form. When a user auto-matches bank transactions, for each bank transaction, in the right pane, the     system selects the  Matched  check box for the best candidate among all the     found candidates by using the following rules: The best match is the document with the highest match relevance that is greater than      0.75. If multiple documents have the same highest match relevance, the system selects the first      found document with the following priority: a payment, an AP document, and an expense      receipt. If no documents have a match relevance greater than 0.75, the best match is a document that      has a match relevance is equal to or greater than 0.2. For example, if the match relevance of       one document is 0.25 and the match relevance of another document is 0.5, the system selects       the document with the match relevance of 0.5. If more than one document satisfies this       condition, the system selects the first found document with the following priority: a payment,       an AP document, and an expense receipt. If only one document is found, it is the best match if its match relevance is equal to or      greater than 0.2. If none of the conditions above has been met, there is no best match for the transaction of     the bank statement. Once an expense receipt and its corresponding bank statement record have been matched and     processed on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA306000|CA306000]) Process Bank Transactions form, they are no longer displayed     on the form. Notes on the Matching Process There are the following limitations of the matching process: If a user matches a bank transaction to an expense receipt in a different currency with the      amount within the amount difference threshold, releases the corresponding claim, and the cash      transaction is posted, and then the user unmatches the bank transaction from the expense      receipt, the cash transaction will not appear as a candidate for matching on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA306000|CA306000]) Process Bank Transactions (CA306000) form because the amounts differ. If a cash transaction originates from an expense claim, the cash transaction date in the      system equals the expense claim date. There can be a significant delay between the date of the      bank statement transaction and the date of the cash transaction in the system, which should be      considered in the filter of dates in the  Transaction Match Settings       dialog box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA306000|CA306000]) Process Bank Transactions (CA306000) form. ]]></column>

==Story==
Suppose that engineers of the SweetLife company used a corporate card related to the New York Bank. At the end of January, 2020, the New York Bank sent a monthly statement and an accountant of the company reconciled this statement and processed a bill for the bank in the system.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this lesson, the standard set of features has been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_20_25_00|Chart of Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=GL202500|GL202500]) form, the ''29000 - Corporate Credit Card'' account has been created. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_20_00|Cash Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CA202000|CA202000]) form, the ''29000'' cash account linked to the GL account has been created.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_25_00|Corporate Cards] ([~/?ScreenId=CA202500|CA202500]) form, the ''000001 - USD Corporate Card'' corporate card has been added, as described in [HelpRoot_Construction\Construction_Expense_Receipts_Implem_Activity|Expense Receipts with Corporate Cards: Implementation Activity].{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form, the ''NYBANK'' vendor account for the New York Bank has been created. On the '''GL Accounts''' tab, in the '''Expense Account''' box, the ''29000 - Corporate Credit Card'' is selected for this account.

==Other Settings That Affect the Workflow==
The following settings and entities should be specified and defined, respectively:[anchor|#ul_jhk_3vf_kv]
*The following general ledger settings should be specified on the '''Posting Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_10_20_00|General Ledger Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=GL102000|GL102000]) form:
**Make sure that the '''Automatically Post on Release''' check box is selected. This setting causes GL batches to be immediately posted after they are released.
**Clear the '''Generate Consolidated Batches''' check box to cause every AP transaction you enter to be posted as an individual batch to the general ledger. (When this check box is selected, the system consolidates into a single batch all transactions in the same currency posted to the same period for all documents being released.)
*The following accounts payable settings should be specified on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_10_10_00|Accounts Payable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AP101000|AP101000]) form: 
**Select the '''Hold Documents on Entry''' check box in the '''Data Entry Settings''' section. This setting gives the created AP bills the ''On Hold'' status.
**Clear the '''Require Vendor Reference''' check box in the '''Data Entry Settings''' section. This setting means that you do not have to enter a payment reference number in the '''Vendor Ref.''' box when creating an AP bill on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form.
**Make sure that the '''Automatically Post on Release''' check box is selected in the '''Posting Settings''' section. This setting causes AP bills to be automatically posted to the general ledger once they are released.

With these settings specified and entities defined, users in your company can record and process documents in Acumatica ERP quickly and accurately, with a minimum of manual actions.]]></column>

==Story==
The SweetLife company buys goods from its suppliers and pays the sales tax on these purchases (input tax). The rate of the sales tax is 8.875%. You need to configure a sales tax of the ''Input'' type in the system, which will be applied to AP documents.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this lesson, the standard set of features has been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\TX_20_55_00|Tax Categories] ([~/?ScreenId=TX205500|TX205500]) form, the ''TAXABLE'' category has been created. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\TX_20_60_00|Tax Zones] ([~/?ScreenId=TX206000|TX206000]) form, the ''NYSTATE'' tax zone has been created.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_20_25_00|Chart of Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=GL202500|GL202500]) form, the ''24100 - Tax Payable'' and ''69000 - Tax Expenses'' accounts have been created. The ''69000 - Tax Expenses'' account is included in the ''MATERIAL'' account group.{br}

Before configuring a sales tax in the production environment, you should know exactly which calculation method should be applied in the '''Calculation Rule''' box of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\TX_20_50_00|Taxes] ([~/?ScreenId=TX205000|TX205000]) form (the '''Tax Settings''' tab).
==System Preparation==
Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as an administrator by using the ''admin'' username.
==Step: Creating a Sales Tax==

#:Leave the default values in the remaining columns. Note that reporting group can have one of the following types: 
#*An ''Output'' group is specified for a tax that must be paid to a tax agency.
#*An ''Input'' group is specified for a tax that can be claimed from a tax agency.
#On the '''Categories''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and select ''TAXABLE'' in the '''Tax Category''' column.
#On the '''Zones''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and select ''NYSTATE'' in the '''Tax Zone ID''' column.
#On the '''GL Accounts''' tab, specify the following settings:
#*'''Tax Payable Account''': ''24100 - Tax Payable''
#*:The Tax Payable account is the liability account that accumulates the tax amounts to be paid to the tax agency. The account is credited in the tax amount when taxable invoices are released.
#*'''Tax Expense Account''': ''69000 - Tax Expenses''
#*:The ''Tax Expenses'' account (''69000'') is included in the ''MATERIAL'' account group so that tax expenses are posted to the project specified for the AP document lines.
#:Note that the '''Use Tax Expense Account''' check box is selected and non-editable because the ''Sales'' tax type has been selected on the '''Tax Settings''' tab.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save''' to save your changes.

==Substantiated Billing Report==
In the construction industry, when contractors bill their customers, the customers may want to see proof of the costs. In this case, contractors need to provide supporting documentation along with the customer statement or invoice. Acumatica ERP Construction                         Editionincludes the following substantiated billing reports that you can use to retrieve costs for a specific billing period:[anchor|#ul_u4j_qxg_qmb]
*[HelpRoot_Construction\PM_65_00_00|Substantiated Billing] ([~/?ScreenId=PM650000|PM650000])
*:The substantiated billing report provides a list of costs for the specified period with all transactions related to payable invoices, labor, and other project expenses grouped by the cost codes. 
*[HelpRoot_Construction\PM_65_00_50|Substantiated Billing - Consolidated] ([~/?ScreenId=PM650050|PM650050])
*:In addition to the list of costs and transactions of a project for the specified period, the generated report includes all scanned or uploaded images of the PNG, JPG, JPEG, BMP, GIF, TIFF or TIF format attached to the corresponding cost records as separate pages. Also, the generated report file includes hyperlinks to the attached files that could not be included directly in the PDF file (such as, for example, encrypted PDF files). You can see these files by clicking the hyperlink and entering guest credentials into the Acumatica ERP sign-in page.

==WIP Report==
WIP (work-in-progress or work-in-process) is designed to track the progress of active jobs, as well as their financial performance. In addition to looking at the percentage of completion and the cost to complete, it also determines whether a job is overbilled or underbilled relative to its progress. When using the percentage-of-completion method for revenue recognition, companies include a WIP schedule with their financial statements. {br}

 Acumatica ERP Construction                         Edition supports several versions of WIP reporting, providing necessary information, and with the recent inclusion of a bonding report, surety companies have visibility into a business’s performance.[anchor|#section_skv_pn4_qmb]
==AIA Report==
The common construction billing format is known as AIA progress billing, named after the American Institute of Architects that produces its official forms. As a type of progress billing, AIA billing invoices (which are provided as AIA reports in Acumatica ERP Construction                         Edition) the customer based on the percentage of work completed for that billing period. For detailed description of the information included to AIA reports, see [HelpRoot_Construction\Construction_Reports_AIA|Construction Reports: AIA Reports].
==Bonding Report==
By using the [HelpRoot_Construction\PM_65_05_00|Construction Bonding Report], you can create a report of work in progress for projects for a selected date range. This report can be used by management as well as external entities, such as bonding companies, to determine the financial health of projects. The report gives a bigger snapshot of all the projects in the system and provides management confidence. You could analyze how much is actually billed for the project compared to the percentage of the project completion.{br}

The [HelpRoot_Construction\PM_65_05_00|Construction Bonding Report] ([~/?ScreenId=PM650500|PM650500])includes the following columns: Earned Revenue, Billed to Date, Unbilled Contract Amounts, as well as Cost Incurred to Date, Calculated Cost at Completion, Current Period Costs/Billings, as well as the prior year&rsquo;s Billings and Costs.]]></column>

The following sections describe the structure of the AIA report and the available report variations. Also, the sections provide information on and how you can reflect historic retainage and change order release, and how you can print the AIA report for billing the retainage solely.[anchor|#section_j3j_qpv_qmb]
==AIA Report Structure==
The AIA report consists of a signed summary sheet (AIA Document G702™–1992, Application and Certificate for Payment), followed by a schedule of values (G703™–1992, Continuation Sheet) that details the project tasks that has been completed and billed to date. Together, these documents are considered an application for payment, because the recipient will have a chance to review the schedule of values and either accept or dispute the billed amount. If they disagree, they will send back redlines so that the contractor can revise and resubmit the AIA billing application. The prepared document that includes both application sheet (G702) and continuation sheet (G703) is called AIA report{br}

In AIA report, application sheet along with continuation sheet provide convenient and complete forms on which the contractor can apply for payment and the architect can certify that payment is due. The application require the contractor to show the status of the contract sum to date, including the total amount of the work completed and stored to date, the amount of retainage (if any), the total of previous payments, a summary of change orders, and the amount of current payment requested. The continuation sheet breaks the contract sum into portions of the work in accordance with a schedule of values prepared by the contractor as required by the general conditions. ((({S:Warn}The AIA report does not publish a standard schedule of values form. AIA report serves as both the contractor’s application and the architect’s certification. Using AIA report helps to expedite payment and reduces the possibility of errors. If the application is properly completed and acceptable to the architect, the architect’s signature certifies to the owner that a payment in the amount indicated is due to the contractor. The form also allows the architect to certify an amount different than the amount applied for, with explanation provided by the architect.
)))[anchor|#section_tkv_pn4_qmb]
==Configuring AIA Report Parameters for a Project==
Based on project requirements, for a particular project, you define the format in which the AIA report will be prepared. To prepare the printable version of the AIA report, you select the line with the needed pro forma invoice in the table on the '''Invoices''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, and click '''AIA Report''' on the table toolbar; you can instead open the pro forma invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form and click the '''AIA Report''' button on the form toolbar.{br}

By default, a newly created project has the '''AIA Level''' setting set to ''Summary'' and the '''Show Quantity in AIA Report''' check box cleared. When you create an AIA report for such a project, the standard AIA report ([HelpRoot_Construction\PM_64_40_00|AIA Report]'' ([~/?ScreenId=PM644000|PM644000])'') with continuation sheet lines grouped by project tasks is prepared.{br}

If you need to include quantities to the lines of the continuation sheet of the AIA report prepared for a project, in the settings of the project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, select the '''Show Quantity in AIA Report''' check box, so that the system will create the [HelpRoot_Construction\PM_64_45_00|AIA Report with Quantity]'' ([~/?ScreenId=PM644500|PM644500])'' report. To list the continuation sheet lines without grouping by project tasks (that is, as they are presented in the corresponding pro forma invoice), select ''Detail'' in the '''AIA Level''' box.[anchor|#section_pbt_tqy_rmb]
==Date-Sensitive Data in AIA Reports==
AIA reports are date-sensitive, which means that the particular amounts are included or not included to the report based on the report date; this in turn could lead to differences between calculation of amounts in AIA reports and financial calculations in other documents. The date on which the AIA report is prepared affects the following amounts in AIA application sheet:[anchor|#ul_nx1_hry_rmb]
*To the '''Net Change by Change Orders''' amount, the system includes only change orders that have the approval date less then the invoice date of the pro forma invoice, for which the AIA report is being prepared.
*To the '''Retainage''' amount, the system does not include the retainage that have been released before creation of the pro forma invoice for which the AIA report is being prepared (that is, the invoice date of the retainage invoice is less then the invoice date of the pro forma invoice).
*To the '''Less Previous Certificates for Payment''' amount, the system includes the sum of the retainage amount that have been released before the date of the previous application (that is, the invoice date of the retainage invoice is less then or equal to the invoice date of the previous pro forma invoice prepared for the project).
*To the '''Current Payment Due''' amount, the system includes the amounts of retainage invoices that have been prepared since the last application (that is, the invoice date of the retainage invoice is greater then the invoice date of the previous pro forma invoice and is less then or equal to the invoice date of the pro forma invoice for which the AIA report is prepared).

The date on which the AIA report is prepared affects the following amounts in AIA continuation sheet:[anchor|#ul_zpr_5ty_rmb]
*To the amounts in the '''Change Orders''' and '''Change Qty.''' columns, the system includes only change orders that have the approval date less then the invoice date of the pro forma invoice, for which the AIA report is being prepared.
*To the '''Retainage Held''', the system does not include the retainage that have been released before creation of the pro forma invoice for which the AIA report is being prepared (that is, the invoice date of the retainage invoice is less then the invoice date of the pro forma invoice).
[anchor|#section_mdp_qp4_qmb]
==AIA Reports for Released Retainage==
If the ''Retainage Support'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can create AIA report that will include the retainage that has been fully or partially released (depending on the date for which the AIA report is prepared), or all released retainage at the end of the project.{br}

You can prepare an AIA report for released retainage if the following conditions are met:[anchor|#ul_f1c_dq4_qmb]
*The retainage in the financial period for which the report is being prepared has been released.
*The zero pro forma invoice has been created, and the invoice date of the zero pro forma invoice is the same as or later than the date of the corresponding AR retainage invoice.
*:A zero pro forma invoice could be created only if in the billing rule assigned to a project task, the '''Create Lines with Zero Amounts''' check box is selected in the progress billing step on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form. You run project billing for a project with a pending invoice amount of zero to prepare a zero pro forma invoice. 

If all conditions are met, to prepare the printable version of the AIA report, you select the line with the zero pro forma invoice in the table on the '''Invoices''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, and click '''AIA Report''' on the table toolbar (or open the zero pro forma invoice and click the '''AIA Report''' button on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form). Depending on the date for which the AIA report is prepared, the report will include the retainage that has been fully or partially released in the middle of the project, or all released retainage at the end of the project. In the prepared report, the total retainage amount on the cover sheet of the AIA report is calculated as the sum of the held retainage amounts on the AIA continuation sheet. ]]></column>

Configuring AIA Report Parameters for a Project Based on project requirements, for a particular project, you define the format in which the         AIA report will be prepared. To prepare the printable version of the AIA report, you select         the line with the needed pro forma invoice in the table on the            Invoices  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects         (PM301000) form, and click  AIA Report  on the table toolbar; you can         instead open the pro forma invoice on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices         (PM307000) form and click the  AIA Report  button on the form         toolbar. By default, a newly created project has the  AIA Level  setting set to            Summary  and the  Show Quantity in AIA Report  check box         cleared. When you create an AIA report for such a project, the standard AIA report (  ([~/?ScreenId=PM644000|PM644000]) AIA Report (PM644000) ) with continuation sheet lines grouped by         project tasks is prepared. If you need to include quantities to the lines of the continuation sheet of the AIA report         prepared for a project, in the settings of the project on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, select the  Show Quantity in AIA           Report  check box, so that the system will create the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM644500|PM644500]) AIA Report with Quantity (PM644500)  report. To list the continuation sheet lines         without grouping by project tasks (that is, as they are presented in the corresponding pro         forma invoice), select  Detail  in the  AIA Level  box. Date-Sensitive Data in AIA Reports AIA reports are date-sensitive, which means that the particular amounts are included or not         included to the report based on the report date; this in turn could lead to differences         between calculation of amounts in AIA reports and financial calculations in other documents.         The date on which the AIA report is prepared affects the following amounts in AIA         application sheet: To the  Net Change by Change Orders  amount, the system includes           only change orders that have the approval date less then the invoice date of the pro forma           invoice, for which the AIA report is being prepared. To the  Retainage  amount, the system does not include the           retainage that have been released before creation of the pro forma invoice for which the           AIA report is being prepared (that is, the invoice date of the retainage invoice is less           then the invoice date of the pro forma invoice). To the  Less Previous Certificates for Payment  amount, the system includes the sum           of the retainage amount that have been released before the date of the previous           application (that is, the invoice date of the retainage invoice is less then or equal to           the invoice date of the previous pro forma invoice prepared for the project). To the  Current Payment Due  amount, the system includes the           amounts of retainage invoices that have been prepared since the last application (that is,           the invoice date of the retainage invoice is greater then the invoice date of the previous           pro forma invoice and is less then or equal to the invoice date of the pro forma invoice           for which the AIA report is prepared). The date on which the AIA report is prepared affects the following amounts in AIA         continuation sheet: To the amounts in the  Change Orders  and  Change             Qty.  columns, the system includes only change orders that have the approval           date less then the invoice date of the pro forma invoice, for which the AIA report is           being prepared. To the  Retainage Held , the system does not include the retainage           that have been released before creation of the pro forma invoice for which the AIA report           is being prepared (that is, the invoice date of the retainage invoice is less then the           invoice date of the pro forma invoice). AIA Reports for Released Retainage If the  Retainage Support  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, you can create AIA report that         will include the retainage that has been fully or partially released (depending on the date         for which the AIA report is prepared), or all released retainage at the end of the         project. You can prepare an AIA report for released retainage if the following conditions are         met: The retainage in the financial period for which the report is being prepared has been           released. The zero pro forma invoice has been created, and the invoice date of the zero pro forma           invoice is the same as or later than the date of the corresponding AR retainage             invoice. A zero pro forma invoice could be created only if in the billing rule             assigned to a project task, the  Create Lines with Zero Amounts              check box is selected in the progress billing step on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules (PM207000) form. You run project billing for a             project with a pending invoice amount of zero to prepare a zero pro forma invoice.            If all conditions are met, to prepare the printable version of the AIA report, you select         the line with the zero pro forma invoice in the table on the  Invoices          tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, and click            AIA Report  on the table toolbar (or open the zero pro forma invoice         and click the  AIA Report  button on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form). Depending on the date for which         the AIA report is prepared, the report will include the retainage that has been fully or         partially released in the middle of the project, or all released retainage at the end of the         project. In the prepared report, the total retainage amount on the cover sheet of the AIA         report is calculated as the sum of the held retainage amounts on the AIA continuation sheet.        ]]></column>

If you override this value, the corresponding values in the cost budget line will be recalculated based on the recalculation mode of the line.
|- 
| '''Mode'''
| The mode that specifies how the amounts and quantities are recalculated for the cost budget line. The following options are available:[anchor|#ul_u2c_hs4_smb]
*''Auto'': If specified, the system automatically recalculates projected quantities and costs if any other projected value in the cost budget line is being changed.
*''Manual'': If specified, the system do not recalculate projected quantities and costs if any other projected value in the cost budget line is being changed.
*''Manual Quantity'': If specified, the system automatically recalculates projected costs if any other projected value in the cost budget line is being changed; the '''Projected Quantity to Complete''' and '''Projected Quantity at Completion''' values are preserved.
*''Manual Cost'': If specified, the system automatically recalculates projected quantities if any other projected value in the cost budget line is being changed; the '''Projected Cost to Complete''' and '''Projected Cost at Completion''' values are preserved.
