Form ID:  ([~/?ScreenId=AR630500|AR630500]){br}

You use this report to determine the state of the open documents at the end of a particular period. This report shows the documents (by statement cycle and by customer) that are outstanding at the end of the specified period, broken down by aging periods or financial periods, depending on the settings of the statement cycle specified for a customer. The balances are arranged by days past due on the last day of the specified period or by document dates. All the amounts are shown in the base currency. {br}{TOC}
==Calculation of Aging Periods==
The system calculates aging periods for this report based on the period you select in the '''Financial Period''' box on the '''Report Parameters''' tab of this report form and on the statement cycle settings specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_28_00|Statement Cycles] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202800|AR202800]) form as follows:[anchor|#ul_uqc_m5q_51b]
*If the '''Use Financial Periods For Aging''' check box is selected for the statement cycle, the system will use aging periods that correspond to the financial periods; the zero aging period (the leftmost column in the report) is the financial period you have selected on this report form.
*If the '''Use Financial Periods For Aging''' check box is cleared for the statement cycle, the system will use the aging periods that are specified for this statement cycle.

On the generated report, the selected financial period is displayed in the '''Fin. Period''' box and the last date of the period is displayed in the '''Aged On''' box. 
==Aging of Outstanding Documents==
The system distributes the open invoices, debit memos, and overdue charges over the financial periods or aging periods depending on the statement cycle settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_28_00|Statement Cycles] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202800|AR202800]) form:[anchor|#ul_gj5_g5q_51b]
*If ''Due Date'' is selected in the '''Age Based On''' box for the statement cycle, the system will compare the due dates of outstanding documents with the '''Aged On''' date you specify on this report form. The overdue balances are grouped by the aging periods or financial periods specified for the applicable statement cycle, while the balances that aren&rsquo;t overdue are displayed in the '''Current''' column of the report. 
*If ''Document Date'' is selected in the '''Age Based On''' box for the statement cycle, the system will compare the document dates of outstanding documents with the '''Aged On''' date you specify on this report form. The balances of the documents with dates the same as or later than the aging date are displayed in the '''Current''' column on this report; other outstanding balances are broken down by the number of days from the '''Aged On''' of the report through the document date.

For more information, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__CON_Using_AR_Aging_Reports|Using AR Aging Reports].
==Aging of Credit Amounts==
In the report, the amounts of open payments, prepayments, and credit memos are aged by periods if the '''Age Credits''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) form. If the credit amounts are aged, they are broken down by the number of days that have passed from the document date through the '''Aged On''' date of the report. By default, the '''Age Credits''' check box is cleared and the credit amounts are shown up in the '''Current''' column of the report. [anchor|#_b9805cd8-24d7-464d-96b0-c5adc42c6fbe]{br}

The balances are arranged by days past due on the last day                 of the specified period or by document dates. All the amounts are shown in the base                 currency.  Calculation of Aging Periods The system calculates aging periods for this report based on the period you select in                 the  Financial Period  box on the  Report                     Parameters  tab of this report form and on the statement cycle                 settings specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR202800|AR202800]) Statement Cycles (AR202800) form as                 follows: If the  Use Financial Periods For Aging  check box is                     selected for the statement cycle, the system will use aging periods that                     correspond to the financial periods; the zero aging period (the leftmost column                     in the report) is the financial period you have selected on this report                     form. If the  Use Financial Periods For Aging  check box is                     cleared for the statement cycle, the system will use the aging periods that are                     specified for this statement cycle. On the generated report, the selected financial period is displayed in the                      Fin. Period  box and the last date of the period is                 displayed in the  Aged On  box.  Aging of Outstanding Documents The system distributes the open invoices, debit memos, and overdue charges over the                 financial periods or aging periods depending on the statement cycle settings on the                       ([~/?ScreenId=AR202800|AR202800]) Statement Cycles (AR202800) form: If  Due Date  is selected in the  Age Based On  box                     for the statement cycle, the system will compare the due dates of outstanding                     documents with the  Aged On  date you specify on this                     report form. The overdue balances are grouped by the aging periods or financial                     periods specified for the applicable statement cycle, while the balances that                     aren't overdue are displayed in the  Current  column of the                     report.  If  Document Date  is selected in the  Age Based On                      box for the statement cycle, the system will compare the document dates of                     outstanding documents with the  Aged On  date you specify                     on this report form. The balances of the documents with dates the same as or                     later than the aging date are displayed in the  Current                      column on this report; other outstanding balances are broken down by the number                     of days from the  Aged On  of the report through the                     document date. For more information, see  Using AR Aging Reports. Aging of Credit Amounts In the report, the amounts of open payments, prepayments, and credit memos are aged                 by periods if the  Age Credits  check box is selected on the                       ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) Accounts Receivable Preferences (AR101000) form. If the credit amounts are                 aged, they are broken down by the number of days that have passed from the document                 date through the  Aged On  date of the report. By default, the                      Age Credits  check box is cleared and the credit amounts                 are shown up in the  Current  column of the report.

Form ID:  ([~/?ScreenId=AR631000|AR631000]){br}

You use this report to determine which documents are overdue for payment and for how long. The report shows all released AR documents in the system, and the document balances on the date specified in the '''Age as of Date''' box on this report form. That is, the report shows released AR documents whose document dates are earlier than or the same as the aging date. The documents are grouped by statement cycle and by customer, broken down by aging periods or financial periods, depending on the settings of the statement cycle specified for a customer. The amounts are in the base currency, and the balance of the AR documents is calculated as the difference between the original amount of the documents and the application amounts of the documents that were applied no later than the specified aging date.{br}{TOC}
==Calculation of Aging Periods==
The system calculates aging periods for this report based on the date you select in the '''Age as of Date''' box on the '''Report Parameters''' tab of this report form and on the statement cycle settings specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_28_00|Statement Cycles] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202800|AR202800]) form as follows:[anchor|#ul_gl5_qtn_t1b]
*If the '''Use Financial Periods for Aging''' check box is selected for the statement cycle, the system will use aging periods that correspond to the financial periods; the zero aging period (the leftmost column in the report) is the financial period of the '''Age as of Date''' on the '''Report Parameters''' tab.
*If the '''Use Financial Periods for Aging''' check box is cleared for the statement cycle, the system will show the aging periods that are specified in the statement cycle.

==Aging of Outstanding Documents==
The system distributes the open invoices, debit memos, and overdue charges over the financial periods or aging periods depending on the statement cycle settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_28_00|Statement Cycles] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202800|AR202800]) form:[anchor|#ul_dzv_2yn_t1b]
*If ''Due Date'' is selected in the '''Age Based On''' box for the statement cycle, the system will compare the due dates of outstanding documents with the '''Age as of Date''' you specify on this report form. The overdue balances are grouped by the aging periods or financial periods specified for the applicable statement cycle, while the balances that aren&rsquo;t overdue are displayed in the '''Current''' column of the report. 
*If ''Document Date'' is selected in the '''Age Based On''' box for the statement cycle, the system will compare the document dates of outstanding documents with the '''Age as of Date''' you specify on this report form. The balances of the documents with dates the same as or later than the aging date are displayed in the '''Current''' column on the report; other outstanding balances are broken down by the number of days from the '''Age as of Date''' through the document date.

For more information, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__CON_Using_AR_Aging_Reports|Using AR Aging Reports].
==Aging of Credit Amounts==
In the report, the amounts of open payments, prepayments, credit memos, and unapplied payments are aged by periods if the '''Age Credits''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) form. If the credit amounts are aged, they are broken down by the number of days that have passed from the document date through the '''Aged On''' date. By default, the '''Age Credits''' check box is cleared, and the credit amounts are shown as negative amounts in the '''Current''' column of the report. {br}

The balance of the retrieved credit documents is calculated as the difference between the original document amount and the total of the applications to which the document was applied no later than the specified aging date.[anchor|#_e52224b7-5d21-478c-8598-967ae9921c89]{br}

Form ID:  ([~/?ScreenId=AR631100|AR631100]){br}

This form is available only if the ''Multi-Currency Accounting'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. {br}

You use this multicurrency report to determine which documents are overdue for payment and for how long. The report shows all released AR documents in the system, and the document balances on the date specified in the '''Age as of Date''' box on this report form. That is, the report shows released AR documents whose document dates are earlier than or the same as the aging date. The documents are grouped by statement cycle and by customer, broken down by aging periods or financial periods, depending on the settings of the statement cycle specified for a customer. The amounts are shown in the currency of the document and in the base currency, and the balance of the AR documents is calculated as the difference between the original amount of the documents and the application amounts of the documents that were applied no later than the specified aging date. {br}{TOC}
==Calculation of Aging Periods==
The system calculates aging periods for this report based on the date you specify in the '''Age as of Date''' box on the '''Report Parameters''' tab of this report form and on the statement cycle settings specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_28_00|Statement Cycles] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202800|AR202800]) form as follows:[anchor|#ul_ssv_yzn_t1b]
*If the '''Use Financial Periods for Aging''' check box is selected for the statement cycle, the system will use aging periods that correspond to the financial periods; the zero aging period (the leftmost column in the report) is the financial period of the '''Age as of Date''' on the '''Report Parameters''' tab.
*If the '''Use Financial Periods for Aging''' check box is cleared for the statement cycle, the system will show aging periods that are specified in the statement cycle.

==Aging of Outstanding Documents==
The system distributes the open invoices, debit memos, and overdue charges over the financial periods or aging periods depending on the statement cycle settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_28_00|Statement Cycles] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202800|AR202800]) form:[anchor|#ul_xrv_yzn_t1b]
*If ''Due Date'' is selected in the '''Age Based On''' box for the statement cycle, the system will compare the due dates of outstanding documents with the '''Age as of Date''' you specify on this report form. The overdue balances are grouped by the aging periods or financial periods specified for the applicable statement cycle, while the balances that aren&rsquo;t overdue are displayed in the '''Current''' column of the report.
*If ''Document Date'' is selected in the '''Age Based On''' box for the statement cycle, the system will compare the document dates of outstanding documents with the '''Age as of Date''' you specify on this report form. The balances of the documents with dates the same as or later than the aging date of the report are displayed in the '''Current''' column on the report; other outstanding balances are broken down by the number of days from the '''Age as of Date''' through the document date.

For more information, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__CON_Using_AR_Aging_Reports|Using AR Aging Reports].
==Aging of Credit Amounts==
In the report, the amounts of open payments, prepayments, credit memos, and unapplied payments are aged by periods if the '''Age Credits''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) form. If the credit amounts are aged, they are broken down by the number of days that have passed from the document date through the '''Aging Date''' date. By default, the '''Age Credits''' check box is cleared and the credit amounts are shown as negative amounts in the '''Current''' column of the report. {br}

The balance of the retrieved credit documents is calculated as the difference between the original document amount and the total of the applications to which the document was applied no later than the specified aging date.[anchor|#_593af73d-819a-4872-85fe-2ec910f6f412]{br}

Form ID:  ([~/?ScreenId=AR631500|AR631500]){br}

This report is designed to show when you should expect to get payments for outstanding AR documents. The report shows all open AR documents recorded in the system, regardless of the current business date or the date specified in the '''Aging Date''' box on this report form. That is, the reports show open accounts receivable documents, even if they are posted to periods later than the aging date period. {br}

The documents are grouped by statement cycle and by customer, broken down by aging periods or financial periods, depending on the settings of the statement cycle specified for a customer. The amounts are shown in the base currency. {br}{TOC}
==Calculation of Aging Periods==
The system calculates aging periods for this report based on the date you specify in the '''Aging Date''' box on the '''Report Parameters''' tab of this report form and on the statement cycle settings specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_28_00|Statement Cycles] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202800|AR202800]) form as follows:[anchor|#ul_gl5_qtn_t1b]
*If the '''Use Financial Periods for Aging''' check box is selected for the statement cycle, the system will use aging periods that correspond to the financial periods; the zero aging period (the ''Past Due'' column) is the financial period of the '''Aging Date''' on the '''Report Parameters''' tab.
*If the '''Use Financial Periods for Aging''' check box is cleared for the statement cycle, the system will show the aging periods that are specified in the statement cycle.

==Aging of Outstanding Documents==
The system distributes the open invoices, debit memos, and overdue charges over the financial periods or aging periods, depending on the statement cycle settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_28_00|Statement Cycles] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202800|AR202800]) form:[anchor|#ul_dzv_2yn_t1b]
*If ''Due Date'' is selected in the '''Age Based On''' box for the statement cycle, the system will compare the due dates of outstanding documents with the '''Aging Date''' you specify on this report form. The overdue balances are displayed in the zero aging period (the '''Past Due''' column on the report), while the balances that aren&rsquo;t overdue are grouped by the aging periods or financial periods specified for the statement cycle. 
*If ''Document Date'' is selected in the '''Age Based On''' box for the statement cycle, the system will compare the document dates of outstanding documents with the '''Aging Date''' you specify on this report form. The balances of the documents with dates earlier than the aging date are displayed in the zero aging period on the report; other outstanding balances are broken down by the number of days from the '''Aging Date''' date of the report through the document date.

==Aging of Credit Amounts==
In the report, the amounts of open payments, prepayments, and credit memos that are recorded to the future periods are aged by periods if the '''Age Credits''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) form.

That is, the reports                 show open accounts receivable documents, even if they are posted to periods later                 than the aging date period.  The documents are grouped by statement cycle and by customer, broken down by aging                 periods or financial periods, depending on the settings of the statement cycle                 specified for a customer. The amounts are shown in the base currency.
