The project accounting functionality helps you monitor and manage costs, revenues, and budget for projects. You can define projects and specify their settings, including defining tasks and populating projects with employees, resources, and equipment. You can manage projects of varying complexity across different project types and industries. {br}

Projects in Acumatica ERP are seamlessly integrated with other Acumatica ERPfunctional areas, so you can automatically track project costs and budget and predict future revenue. You can associate any entered document with a specific project, which ensures that any project-related activity will be accounted for. {br}

You can maintain complete, structured information about projects, including tracking their costs, budget, and expected revenues. In Acumatica ERP, a ''project'' is defined as a one-time effort planned for execution within specific time and cost limits, and with an expected budget and revenue. A project can consist of one task or multiple tasks, and you can associate individual projects and tasks with workgroups. {br}

The following sections briefly describe the specifics of accounting for projects in Acumatica ERP. {br}{TOC}
==Integration with Other Functional Areas==
Integration of projects with other Acumatica ERPfunctional areas makes it possible to maintain complete project information as the project-related data is entered into the system. Integration with accounts payable and inventory and order management gives users the ability to track costs and re-invoice them with or without a premium and manage billing information. Integration with time and expenses allows to track labor costs related to specific projects and bill the employee labor.
==Labor Time and Cost Accounting==
 Acumatica ERP supports labor accounting through the attribution of labor hours to specific projects and tasks within projects. To this end, the time that employees spend on projects is recorded in time cards. 
==Flexible Budget Tracking==
You can easily compare actual project costs with the original and revised budgets. As a project progresses, you can also continuously track budget execution, including whether actual costs match the budget, and act appropriately by either adjusting expenditures or revising the budget. In Acumatica ERP, you can also implement continuous budgeting. 
==Fixed-Price and Cost-Based Projects==
 Acumatica ERP supports two types of projects: fixed-price and cost-based. With fixed-price projects, the price for the project is defined at the beginning of the project and is not changed until the end of the project. With cost-based projects, the final price of the project depends on the overall cost of fulfilling the project, and the costs may be invoiced again with or without a premium. You can also run projects with a cap. 
==Work-in-Progress Accounting==
When maintaining project accounting in Acumatica ERP, you can track the work in progress (WIP) performed in the project. Work in progress is the amount of work that was performed but not yet invoiced. By using this functionality, you can use for billing only those project expenses that are relevant for specific billing periods.
==External and Internal Projects==
By using the project accounting functionality, you can manage both external and internal projects. Generally, the scope of internal projects is limited to the physical and organizational boundaries of an organization; these projects serve the needs of the organization and never produce any revenue. On the other hand, an external project is revenue-driven, and the key objective is balancing costs and income to make sure the organization remains profitable, while meeting project goals and maximizing customer satisfaction. 
==Flexible Rate Calculation==
By using the flexible rate calculation engine in Acumatica ERP, you can implement complex pricing and accrual models that require the consideration of a large number of parameters. With this project management engine, you can differentiate rates depending on the project, task, account group, and employee class. You can even define different rates for specific dates or date ranges. 
==Billable Revenue Tracking==
You can track future revenues as a project progresses from task to task. By using Acumatica ERP, you can accommodate complex pricing models with a high level of granularity. 
==Templates for Projects and Tasks==
If your company routinely performs standardized projects (for instance, the building of standard houses), you do not need to create these projects from scratch and each time go through the entire procedure of defining a new project and its tasks. Instead, you can create templates for standard projects and tasks and use them each time you start a new project. For details, see [HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Templates_Mapref|Configuring Project Templates and Common Tasks].
==Commitment Tracking==
 Acumatica ERP supports tracking purchase orders by project as the project cost commitments. These commitments affect the execution status of a project. A user can track the budget and actual amounts of a project, as well as the original commitments that remain open. For details, see [HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Commitments_Mapref|Processing Commitments].
==Pro Forma Invoice Workflow==
You can enable pro forma invoice workflow for a particular project to agree for details with a customer before sending the final accounts receivable invoice. You can review and modify the draft invoice and reach agreement about the document with all required parties before the accounting team prepares the final accounts receivable invoice with all information copied from the pro forma invoice. With this process, the company can minimize corrections of accounts receivable documents. For details, see [HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Pro_Forma_Invoices_GeneralInfo|Processing Pro Forma Invoices: General Information].
==Automated Project Billing and Invoicing==
As a project progresses from milestone to milestone or when it is completed, you can define the project to automatically generate billing information and generate invoices for customers. This saves time, reduces errors, and helps you improve the cash flow in your organization.
==Project Security==
 Acumatica ERP provides you with the variety of options that can be used to set up security of specific projects. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Process_Project_Security|Project Processing: Project Security Configuration].]]></column>

This topic provides a general overview of the configuration steps that you have to perform before you can start using project accounting functionality in Acumatica ERP.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to perform the initial configuration for the project accounting functionality. In particular, you will do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Enable the needed system features
*Specify the minimum required configuration
*Learn the recommended settings that you can specify to make the system fit your business requirements

==Applicable Scenarios==
You perform the basic configuration of the project accounting functionality in any of the following cases:[anchor|#_3939fa6c-008b-4f52-8401-62dc6eff484e]
*When you initially implement Acumatica ERP and the ''Projects'' feature is included in your license.
*When you have purchased the ''Projects'' feature, and you need to configure project accounting in the already-implemented system.

==Integration of Projects with Other System Areas==
To track budgets, costs, and future revenues for projects, the project accounting functionality can be tightly integrated with other system areas: general ledger, accounts payable, accounts receivable, cash management, inventory and order management, customer management, and time and expenses. By using this integration, you can collect comprehensive information about transactions related to projects. The following diagram illustrates the integration of project accounting with other functional areas of Acumatica ERP.[anchor|#_66ec127b-b084-43d5-b66a-04ca61930b93][anchor|#_e615bdf7-bb54-4621-9d7e-8bd3efaadec3][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_Project_Basic_Integration.png|popup|450px]
You specify the system areas in which you are going to make integration with projects possible in the '''Visibility Settings''' section on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form. The active projects become visible in all the areas in which you want the ability to process documents or transactions related to particular projects; all related data entry forms get two additional elements—'''Project ''' and '''Task'''. Each time you enter a document or transaction, or a particular document or transaction line, that relates to a specific active project, you select the appropriate project and task to associate this document or transaction (or this particular document or transaction line) with the project; the information from these documents and transactions is represented in the project and affect project budget.{br}{TOC}
==Tracking Non-Project Transactions==
When you are initially configuring the project accounting functionality, you define the non-project code on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form. You specify this code for specific documents or transactions (or their lines) to indicate that they are not associated with any project. By default, this code is ''X'', but you can specify a different non-project code. If a particular transaction is not related to any project, you specify the non-project code in the document or transaction, or the document or transaction line. The information from the documents or document lines with the non-project code specified is not used in project accounting and does not update project balances. 
==Workflow of the Project Accounting Implementation==
To prepare the system for project accounting, you perform the following general steps:[anchor|#_e0ff54a2-6ece-47ee-afb6-b5b1baf1fea9]
#You configure basic company settings and implement the minimum general ledger, cash management, accounts payable, and accounts receivable functionality. For details, see [HelpRoot_Implement\Implementation_Guide| Acumatica ERP Implementation Guide].
#You perform basic configuration of inventory and order management and customer management areas if the ''Inventory and Order Management'' and ''Customer Management'' features are included in your license. For details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\config_InvMgmt_Basic_Implem_Activity|Order Management with Inventory Configuration: Implementation Activity] and [HelpRoot_Implement\Implementation_Guide| Acumatica ERP Implementation Guide].
#:((({S:Warn}Each particular feature may be subject to additional licensing; please consult the Acumatica ERP sales policy for details.
)))
#If time tracking in projects is planned, you perform basic configuration of time reporting functionality. For an example of configuration, see [HelpRoot_Projects\config_Project_Time_Tracking_GeneralInfo|Time Tracking Configuration: General Information].
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form, you specify the necessary settings (and any optional settings) to be used in project accounting, including the non-project code, which you use to indicate that specific documents or transactions (or their lines) are not associated with any project. For an example of configuration, see [HelpRoot_Projects\config_Project_Basic_Implem_Activity|Project Basic Configuration: Implementation Activity].
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_10_00|Account Groups] ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) form, you define the account groups that will aggregate information about the GL transactions related to the projects. For an example of defining account groups, see [HelpRoot_Projects\Account_Groups_Implem_Activity|Account Groups: Implementation Activity].
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, you create the billing rules to be used for billing projects. For details, see the topics of the [HelpRoot_Projects\Billing_Rules_Mapref|Creating Billing Rules] chapter.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, you configure a project. For details on the project life cycle and project configuration, see the topics of the [HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Process_Mapref|Processing Projects] chapter.

Tracking Non-Project Transactions When you are initially configuring the project accounting functionality, you define the     non-project code on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form. You     specify this code for specific documents or transactions (or their lines) to indicate that they     are not associated with any project. By default, this code is  X , but you can specify a     different non-project code. If a particular transaction is not related to any project, you     specify the non-project code in the document or transaction, or the document or transaction     line. The information from the documents or document lines with the non-project code specified     is not used in project accounting and does not update project balances.  Workflow of the Project Accounting Implementation To prepare the system for project accounting, you perform the following general steps: You configure basic company settings and implement the minimum general ledger, cash      management, accounts payable, and accounts receivable functionality. For details, see   Acumatica ERP Implementation Guide. You perform basic configuration of inventory and order management and customer management      areas if the  Inventory and Order Management  and  Customer Management  features are      included in your license. For details, see  Order Management with Inventory Configuration: Implementation Activity and   Acumatica ERP Implementation Guide. Each particular feature may be       subject to additional licensing; please consult the  Acumatica ERP       sales policy for details. If time tracking in projects is planned, you perform basic configuration of time reporting      functionality. For an example of configuration, see  Time Tracking Configuration: General Information. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PO101000) form, you specify the necessary settings      (and any optional settings) to be used in project accounting, including the non-project code,      which you use to indicate that specific documents or transactions (or their lines) are not      associated with any project. For an example of configuration, see  Project Basic Configuration: Implementation Activity. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) Account Groups (PM201000) form, you define the account      groups that will aggregate information about the GL transactions related to the projects. For      an example of defining account groups, see  Account Groups: Implementation Activity. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules (PM207000) form, you create the billing rules to be      used for billing projects. For details, see the topics of the  Creating Billing Rules chapter. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, you configure a project.

You perform the following implementation activity to prepare the system for creating and processing projects.
==Story==
Suppose that you, as the implementation manager of the SweetLife Fruit & Jams company, need to configure the minimum required functionality to prepare the system for accounting for projects.
==System Preparation==
Before you start configuring the basic project functionality, you perform the following instructions:[anchor|#_140fbc65-18b3-407a-b9ea-828e26b0a4d2]
#In a new tenant, prepare the company with the basic settings, as described in the [HelpRoot_Implement\config_Basic_Company_GeneralInfo|Company Without Branches: General Information].
#Sign in to a company as a system administrator with the ''admin'' username.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, enable the ''Projects'' feature.

==Step: Reviewing Basic Project Accounting Functionality==
To perform basic configuration of the project accounting functionality, proceed as follows:[anchor|#_a8a5f17e-125f-4a16-b8b8-b0a3b165f29c]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form. 
#On the '''General Settings''' tab ('''General Settings''' section), make sure that ''X'' is selected in the '''Non-Project Code''' box. This is the code that will be used by default in all transactions and documents that are not related to any projects.
#Make sure that ''&lt;N/A&gt;'' is selected in the '''Empty Item Code''' and ''HOUR'' is selected in the '''Empty Item UOM''' box. The system will insert this item ID and UOM, respectively, in project-related lines that are not associated with a specific item.
#Make sure the '''Automatically Post on Release''' check box is selected.
#Select the '''Automatically Release Allocation''' check box. 
#In the '''Visibility Settings''' section of the '''General Settings''' tab, make sure the check boxes are selected for all areas in which the projects will be used.

==In This Chapter==
*[HelpRoot_Projects\config_Project_Mailings_GeneralInfo|Project Mailing Configuration: General Information]
*:Your organization's policies might require users to print documents of specific types, either for internal needs or for sending them by postal mail to customers or vendors that prefer not to receive the documents through email. In Acumatica ERP, you can define mailing settings to send particular documents to customers by email. The following sections describe the use of mailings for sending and printing project-related documents.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\config_Project_Mailings_Invoices|Project Mailing Configuration: Invoice Mailings]
*:For individual projects, you can configure different formats for printable pro forma invoices and accounts receivable invoices. The invoice format may depend on the project type; for instance, an installation project may have one invoice format, and a repair project may have a different invoice format. Also, a default invoice format can be specified for particular customers, with this format used for all projects of this customer unless the user specifies a different format. For example, a company might use a particular invoice format for government customers, or for customers who work with a particular bank to get loans for their projects (and this bank dictates the invoice format).
*[HelpRoot_Projects\config_Project_Mailings_ProForma_Invoices|Project Mailing Configuration: Pro Forma Invoices]
*:You can email a pro forma invoice with any status to the customer for review. To do this, you select the invoice and then invoke the '''Email Pro Forma Invoice''' action on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\config_Project_Mailings_Project_Quotes|Project Mailing Configuration: Project Quotes]
*:You can email a project quote that has been submitted and approved (if approval of project quotes is set up in the system) to the customer for review if the status of the project quote is ''Prepared'' or ''Sent''. To do this, while viewing the quote on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) form, you invoke the '''Send Quote''' action on the form toolbar. The system creates an email activity and lists the activity on the '''Activities''' tab of the form; it also attaches a printable version of the quote to the email. sends the email the recipient, and changes the status of the quote to ''Sent''.

In Acumatica ERP, you can define mailing settings to send particular documents to customers by email. The following sections describe the use of mailings for sending and printing project-related documents.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Define mailing settings for project quotes
*Define mailing settings for pro forma invoices
*Define mailing settings for accounts receivable invoices

==Applicable Scenarios==
You define mailing settings to print documents as well as automatically send documents of a specific type by email.[anchor|#section_ot2_1g3_4mb]
==Mailing Configuration==
The functionality you use to print and send documents of a specific type by email is referred to as a ''mailing''. Acumatica ERP provides predefined mailings that you can configure for printing and sending different types of documents to customers and vendors. The system generates emails for active mailings when a user selects an action that initiates email generation.{br}

The body of the email can be configured as one of the following: [anchor|#ul_nz5_nnv_2h]
*An Acumatica ERP report, such as a pro forma invoice, accounts receivable invoice or project quote. Reports define how to arrange the information available in documents of specific types for emailing or printing. On the '''Mailing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form, where you specify the settings of each mailing, you select the format for report-based documents: ''HTML'', ''Excel'', or ''PDF''. If you select ''PDF'', the document will be sent as an email attachment.
*Text—personalized at the moment the email is generated—based on a notification (email) template. Placeholders used in the template will be replaced with information from the vendor or customer record. For example, template-based emails can be used to notify customer contacts about expiration of their credit cards. When the system generates these emails for multiple customers, placeholders are replaced by the particular customer&rsquo;s information, such as card type, partial card number, and expiration date.

==Defining Printing Forms of Invoices for Projects==
On the '''Mailing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, you can specify a custom format and an email notification template that should be used for the printing and emailing of the invoices prepared for the particular project. When you create a new project, the system copies all the predefined mailing settings from the '''Mailing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form, but you can override them. You can use the following predefined mailings:[anchor|#ul_odx_jys_qbb]
*''PROFORMA'': The mailing with this identifier is used to print pro forma invoices. By default, this mailing uses the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\PM_64_20_00|Pro Forma Invoice] ([~/?ScreenId=PM642000|PM642000]) report for printing the pro forma invoice.
*''INVOICE'': The mailing with this identifier is used to print project-related accounts receivable invoices. By default, this mailing uses the ProInvoice/Memo (PM641000) report, which is a copy of the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\AR_64_10_00|Invoice/Memo] ([~/?ScreenId=AR641000|AR641000]) report, for printing the invoice.

If you need to override the printing form of pro forma invoices or accounts receivable invoices for a project, you edit the respective mailing setting but do not edit the mailing identifier, which is the system setting. For example, suppose you need to override the printing form of pro forma invoices for a project. For the ''PROFORMA'' mailing of this project, you select the needed project report in the '''Report''' column of the '''Mailing''' table on the '''Mailing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form.
==Printing Invoices==
When you print a pro forma invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form, the system uses the report specified for the ''PROFORMA'' mailing of the corresponding project on the '''Mailing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form.

When you print an project-related accounts receivable invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form, the system uses one of the following reports:[anchor|#ul_sd3_krt_qbb]

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Project Mailing Configuration: Invoice Mailings For individual projects, you can configure different formats for printable pro forma invoices         and accounts receivable invoices. The invoice format may depend on the project type; for         instance, an installation project may have one invoice format, and a repair project may have         a different invoice format. Also, a default invoice format can be specified for particular         customers, with this format used for all projects of this customer unless the user specifies         a different format. For example, a company might use a particular invoice format for         government customers, or for customers who work with a particular bank to get loans for         their projects (and this bank dictates the invoice format). Defining Printing Forms of Invoices for Projects On the  Mailing Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects         (PM301000) form, you can specify a custom format and an email notification template that         should be used for the printing and emailing of the invoices prepared for the particular         project. When you create a new project, the system copies all the predefined mailing         settings from the  Mailing Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form, but you can override them. You can use the         following predefined mailings: PROFORMA : The mailing with this identifier is used to print pro forma invoices.           By default, this mailing uses the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM642000|PM642000]) Pro Forma Invoice (PM642000) report for           printing the pro forma invoice. INVOICE : The mailing with this identifier is used to print project-related           accounts receivable invoices. By default, this mailing uses the ProInvoice/Memo (PM641000)           report, which is a copy of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR641000|AR641000]) Invoice/Memo (AR641000) report, for           printing the invoice. If you need to override the printing form of pro forma invoices or accounts receivable         invoices for a project, you edit the respective mailing setting but do not edit the mailing         identifier, which is the system setting. For example, suppose you need to override the         printing form of pro forma invoices for a project. For the  PROFORMA  mailing of this         project, you select the needed project report in the  Report  column of         the  Mailing  table on the  Mailing Settings  tab         of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form. Printing Invoices When you print a pro forma invoice on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form,         the system uses the report specified for the  PROFORMA  mailing of the corresponding         project on the  Mailing Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. If the corresponding project has no mailing         setting with the  PROFORMA  identifier, an error occurs. When you print an project-related accounts receivable invoice on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form, the system uses one of the following         reports: The report specified for the  INVOICE  mailing, if one is specified, of the           corresponding project on the  Mailing Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form.

 During the configuration of Acumatica ERP, you create account groups to facilitate the aggregation, tracking, control, and management of information related to the project budget, costs, and future revenues. This chapter explains how to define account groups and map general ledger accounts to these account groups.
==In This Chapter==
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Account_Groups_GeneralInfo|Account Groups: General Information]
*:An account group is an entity in Acumatica ERP that you map to a subset of general ledger accounts and then specify in project-related documents. Because they are mapped to general ledger accounts, account groups facilitate transfer of the project-related financial information between the general ledger transactions and project transactions.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Account_Groups_Config_Prereq|Account Groups: Configuration Prerequisites]
*:Before starting to create account groups, you must be sure that the system has been configured properly and that all required entities have been created, as described in the following sections.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Account_Groups_Implem_Activity|Account Groups: Implementation Activity]
*:In the following implementation activity, you will learn how to create account groups.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Account_Groups_Reports_Inquiries|Account Groups: Related Reports and Forms]
*:In the following sections, you can find details about report and inquiry forms that provide users with project information broken down by account groups.

An account group is an entity in Acumatica ERP that you map to a subset of general ledger accounts and then specify in project-related documents. Because they are mapped to general ledger accounts, account groups facilitate transfer of the project-related financial information between the general ledger transactions and project transactions.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#_fd935d55-7cff-4e13-876b-9877cce0a2f0]
*Prepare the system for the creation of account groups
*Create an account group and map accounts to this group
*Review the chart of accounts and find the account group associated with a particular GL account

==Applicable Scenarios==
You may need to create an account group in the following cases:[anchor|#ul_env_32l_fhb]
*When you are initially configuring project accounting functionality
*When you are going to track a particular type of expenses or other type of project balances separately

==Types of Account Groups==
You create account groups on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_10_00|Account Groups] ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) form. An account group can belong to one of the following types: ''Asset'', ''Liability'', ''Expense'', ''Income'', or ''Off-Balance''. An account group may include one or more general ledger accounts of particular types:[anchor|#_5426088b-41cc-476d-a9c8-b195ea3e3a85]
*An account group of the ''Asset'' or ''Liability'' type may include asset or liability accounts. Transactions posted to these account groups will be displayed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_90_00|Project Budget] ([~/?ScreenId=PM309000|PM309000]) form and on the '''Balances''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, but will not be displayed on the '''Revenue Budget''' and '''Cost Budget''' tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form.
*An account group of the ''Income'' or ''Expense'' type may include accounts of any type (income, expense, asset, or liability).Transactions posted to these account groups will be displayed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_90_00|Project Budget] ([~/?ScreenId=PM309000|PM309000]) form, on the '''Balances''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, and on the '''Revenue Budget''' and '''Cost Budget''' tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form.
*An account group of the ''Off-Balance'' type may include accounts of any type (income, expense, asset, or liability).

You can use account groups of the ''Off-Balance'' type to collect and track for projects statistical and other information that is unrelated to finance. Account groups of the ''Off-Balance'' type are not mapped to any general ledger accounts; thus, the transactions posted to account groups of this type will not update the general ledger. For example, you might define an off-balance group for unrecognized revenue: You may want to see the amount in your project reporting, but you do not want to post to the general ledger until actual billing is done and thus revenue is recognized. As another example, you can create an off-balance group for recording all work hours spent by employees on the project. You may want to know the total amount associated with the number of work hours spent, but you do not want to post those amounts to general ledger. In addition, you can select the '''Expense''' check box to track the off-balance account group as expenses: the system will display the transactions posted to this account group on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_90_00|Project Budget] form, on the '''Balances''' and '''Cost Budget''' tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form.
==Recommendations for Creating Account Groups==
Before you define account groups, you should first identify the accounts that will be used in project-related transactions. We recommend that you consider the following rules and limitations as you plan the account groups you will create:[anchor|#ul_tx3_2vh_vl]
*Each general ledger account can be mapped to only one account group. 
*Accounts receivable accounts (accounts debited by project billing) and accounts payable accounts (accounts credited by vendor bills) should not be included in account groups.
*Accounts that are linked to cash accounts (that is, accounts for which the '''Cash Account''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_20_25_00|Chart of Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=GL202500|GL202500]) form) should not be included in account groups.
*Allocation and billing rules select transactions by account groups. If transactions of two accounts should follow different allocation or billing rules or use different rates, these two accounts should be included in different account groups. If the transactions usually use the same rate, consider including their accounts in one group.

==Configuring the System==
Before you create account groups, you need to make sure that on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_20_25_00|Chart of Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=GL202500|GL202500]) form, all GL accounts that are necessary for performing the financial operations of the company have been configured, as described in [HelpRoot_Implement\config_Basic_Company_Implem_Activity_COA|General Ledger: To Create a Chart of Accounts]. 
==Configuring the Account Group Identifier==
The ''ACCGROUP'' segmented key on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form defines the structure of identifiers of account groups. By default, this segmented key specifies that the account group identifier is an alphanumeric string of up to 10 characters. For the key, you can define how many segments it is to have, what values may be used, whether these values should be validated, and whether auto-numbering should be used in one of the segments. You can also divide account group identifiers into segments with specific values. For more information on configuring segmented keys, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Identifier_Segmentation|Segmented Identifiers].]]></column>

 The billing procedure in Acumatica ERP is based on billing rules that specify the conditions for which the system calculates amounts to be billed to customers. The topics of this chapter describe how to configure billing rules for projects.
==In This Chapter==
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Billing_Rules_GeneralInfo|Billing Rules: General Information]
*:In Acumatica ERP, billing rules are used to automate the calculation of amounts being billed to customers for a particular project. To each project task, you assign a particular billing rule which define which transactions should be used for billing and which accounts should be used to record the transactions that are generated in the billing process.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Billing_Rules_Config_Prereq|Billing Rules: Configuration Prerequisites]
*:Before starting to create billing rules, you must be sure that the system has been configured properly and that all required entities have been created, as described in the following sections.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Billing_Rules_Progress_Billing|Billing Rules: Progress Billing]
*:Each billing rule can include only one step of the ''Progress Billing'' type. For the billing rule step for this type, you can define the following settings:
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Billing_Rules_Implem_Activity_Progress|Billing Rules: To Configure a Progress Billing Rule]

In Acumatica ERP, billing rules are used to automate the calculation of amounts being billed to customers for a particular project. To each project task, you assign a particular billing rule which define which transactions should be used for billing and which accounts should be used to record the transactions that are generated in the billing process. {br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Configure billing rules for progress billing
*Configure billing rules for time and material billing
*Configure combined billing rules with multiple steps of different types
*Use billing rates and item prices in billing rules

==Applicable Scenarios==
You configure a billing rule to specify how the customers should be billed based on the project conditions:[anchor|#_ee8938bd-d477-44fc-8a4d-53604b47360f]
*You configure a progress billing rule if you need to prepare an invoice for the customer that includes the services provided as a part of a fixed-price project.
*You configure a time and material billing rule if you need to prepare an invoice for the customer based on the project transactions that record the time and material spent on the project.
*You configure a combined billing rule that includes both progress billing and time and material billing steps if you need to calculate invoice amounts differently based on different project stages.

==Configuration of Billing Rules ==
The billing process is defined by the billing rule of each project task. A billing rule is assigned to each project on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Billing and Allocation Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. When a task is added to the project on the '''Tasks''' tab of this form, by default, it is assigned the billing rule assigned to the corresponding project, but a different billing rule can be specified for the task.{br}

Billing rules are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form. In the left pane, you specify the sequence of steps for the selected billing rule. Then in the right pane, you define the calculation rules and invoice settings for each step. You can add either of the following to each billing rule:[anchor|#ul_gdm_dcl_2bb]
*A single ''Progress Billing'' step to bill pending invoice amounts based on the progress of the performed work
*A single ''Time and Material'' step (or multiple steps of this type) to bill transactions by different account groups

A simple billing rule includes only one billing step. More complex billing rules consist of multiple steps with different conditions. Each step of a billing rule has a variety of settings, including the following, that depend on the step type:[anchor|#ul_ccd_fzk_2bb]
*The account group that is used as a filter to select the transactions for billing if this is a ''Time and Material'' billing step. 
*:When the billing procedure is run, the system selects all the transactions that are due for billing. Normally, you use the same account group (or groups) for billing that you use for accumulating the unrecognized revenue. By running billing for these account groups, you recognize the revenue.
*The formulas to define the description of the invoice and the description of each invoice line, to make the system compose each type of description dynamically during the billing process.
*The formulas to calculate the amount and the quantity of the invoice lines if this is a ''Time and Material'' billing step. In these formulas, you can use fields and attributes from such system entities as the project, project budget, project task, project transaction, customer, vendor, employee, inventory item, and account group. You can also use different sources of the project rates: those from the rate tables can be configured on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_60_00|Rate Tables] ([~/?ScreenId=PM206000|PM206000]) form, and those from sales price lists, which are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form.
*The sources of the sales account and the destination branch for each invoice line.
*:The billing process uses the originating branch from the project settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form and the destination branches from the sources according to the billing rules. When an accounts receivable invoice is released, the accounts receivable account is updated under the originating branch of the invoice, while the revenue amounts are recorded to the destination branches of the invoice lines.
*The invoice group, if you want to make the system create separate invoices (either pro forma invoices or accounts receivable invoices, depending on the billing workflow of the project) for particular steps with the same invoice group during the project billing .
*Non-billable transactions that do not contribute to the amount billed to the customer and that you may decide to include in the invoice.
*Grouping criteria by date, employee, vendor, and inventory item for the invoice lines if this is a ''Time and Material'' billing step.

==Formulas and Parameters in Billing Rules==
In formulas that are used in the settings of billing rules, you can use the ''@Rate'' parameter to refer to billing rates defined in the rate tables on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_60_00|Rate Tables] ([~/?ScreenId=PM206000|PM206000]) form. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Projects\Billing_Rates_GeneralInfo|Billing Rates: General Information].{br}

For project transactions with associated stock or non-stock items, you can retrieve the effective sales price of an inventory item by using the ''@Price'' parameter. For instance, to implement a price model that estimates the project billable amount as the billable quantity of the provided services multiplied by the price, you can use the following formula: <tt>=&#91;PMTran.BillableQty&#93;&#42;@Price</tt>.{br}

Also, in formulas that are used in the settings of a billing rule, you can use the following data access classes to retrieve the data:[anchor|#_08adbc35-6de2-425f-93d4-bd17b7f41183]
*{{PMAccountGroup}}
*{{PMBudget}}
*:When you bill a project using a billing rule with a formula that uses the {{PMBudget}} data access class, for each budget line of the project, the system retrieves {{PMBudget}} records that are associated with the same project, project task, account group, and inventory item, as well as cost code if the ''Cost Code'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
*{{PMProject}}
*{{PMTask}}
*{{PMTran}}
*{{Customer}}
*{{EPEmployee}}
*{{InventoryItem}}
*{{Vendor}}

In these formulas, you can use fields and           attributes from such system entities as the project, project budget, project task, project           transaction, customer, vendor, employee, inventory item, and account group. You can also           use different sources of the project rates: those from the rate tables can be configured           on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM206000|PM206000]) Rate Tables (PM206000) form, and those from sales price lists,           which are defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) Sales Prices (AR202000) form. The sources of the sales account and the destination branch for each invoice line. The             billing process uses the originating branch from the project settings on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form and the destination branches from the sources according             to the billing rules. When an accounts receivable invoice is released, the accounts             receivable account is updated under the originating branch of the invoice, while the             revenue amounts are recorded to the destination branches of the invoice lines. The invoice group, if you want to make the system create separate invoices (either pro           forma invoices or accounts receivable invoices, depending on the billing workflow of the           project) for particular steps with the same invoice group during the project billing           . Non-billable transactions that do not contribute to the amount billed to the customer           and that you may decide to include in the invoice. Grouping criteria by date, employee, vendor, and inventory item for the invoice lines if           this is a  Time and Material  billing step. Formulas and Parameters in Billing Rules In formulas that are used in the settings of billing rules, you can use the  @Rate          parameter to refer to billing rates defined in the rate tables on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM206000|PM206000]) Rate Tables (PM206000) form. For more information, see  Billing Rates: General Information. For project transactions with associated stock or non-stock items, you can retrieve the     effective sales price of an inventory item by using the  @Price  parameter. For     instance, to implement a price model that estimates the project billable amount as the billable     quantity of the provided services multiplied by the price, you can use the following formula:       =[PMTran.BillableQty]*@Price . Also, in formulas that are used in the settings of a billing rule, you can use the following         data access classes to retrieve the data: PMAccountGroup PMBudget When you bill a project using a billing rule with a formula that             uses the  PMBudget  data access class, for each budget line of the             project, the system retrieves  PMBudget  records that are associated with             the same project, project task, account group, and inventory item, as well as cost code             if the  Cost Code  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form.

For a billing rule defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, you specify the sequence of steps in the left pane and the settings of each step in the right pane, including the billing type, which can be ''Time and Material'' or ''Progress Billing''. {br}

The following sections list the settings that you can specify for a billing rule step of the ''Progress Billing'' type, and describes the process of billing a project for progress by using a simple one-step billing rule.[anchor|#_0a89707b-1302-43f9-81e6-3e4c4b701d62]

*The invoice group of the steps of the billing rules to which the project tasks refer.
[anchor|#_2663eee4-287d-4fb7-8b80-5e5793f9bcd3]
==The Progress Billing Process==
Progress billing is a simple billing workflow for the projects that are gradually billed at a fixed contract amount. Progress billing does not involve project transactions. The progress billing can be performed for only a project that is pending billing—that is, the project has at least one revenue budget line with the billable project revenue, which is a nonzero '''Pending Invoice Amount''' on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, including a negative amount. {br}

To bill a project task by its progress, you need to create a billing rule on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form and configure a step of the ''Progress Billing'' type in this rule. Then you assign the configured billing rule to project tasks on the '''Tasks''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. {br}

During the project life cycle, you specify the '''Completed (%)''' value on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab for the needed revenue budget lines to indicate that the project tasks are being performed. The system calculates the '''Pending Invoice Amount''' by using the following formula:{br}

{{Pending Invoice Amount = Revised Budgeted Amount * ( Completed (%) / 100 ) - Draft Invoices Amount - Actual Amount}}{br}

Alternatively, you can specify the '''Pending Invoice Amount''' directly in the revenue budget line; the system will calculate the '''Completed (%)''' value accordingly.{br}

When you run the project billing by clicking the '''Run Project Billing''' button on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the system prepares a pro forma invoice or an accounts receivable invoice depending on the project workflow, which is defined by the state of the '''Create Pro Forma On Billing''' check box on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. {br}

The system creates an invoice with the amounts copied from the '''Pending Invoice Amount''' column of the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form for the corresponding revenue budget lines. Once an invoice is prepared, the '''Draft Invoices Amount''' of the revenue budget lines is updated with the amount for which the invoice has been prepared, and the '''Pending Invoice Amount''' becomes zero. In the revenue budget lines that are billed by a billing rule that includes a single step of the ''Progress Billing'' type, the '''Actual Quantity''' is always zero.{br}

During the billing process, the system groups the billable amounts into invoices based on the following:[anchor|#_9563edcc-0166-48dd-bf54-6ea6836868f7]
*The invoice group of the steps of the billing rules to which the project tasks refer
*The customer
*The customer location
*The '''Bill Separately''' setting of each project task defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form
{br}

If the project billing is performed by using the pro forma invoice workflow, the invoice lines that are produced by the progress billing steps are shown in the prepared pro forma invoice on the '''Progress Billing''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form. If you manually adjust the '''Amount to Invoice''' of a pro forma invoice line, the system automatically recalculates the '''Total Completed (%)'''—the percentage of the revised budgeted amount of the revenue budget line of the project that has been invoiced by all the pro forma invoices of the project, including the current one. However, the system does not update the '''Completed (%)''' of the corresponding revenue budget line on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form accordingly. Also, the system does not update the '''Completed (%)''' of the revenue budget line if the related pro forma invoice with the corresponding progress billing line is deleted. ((({S:Warn}If a project task is billed by a billing rule that has no ''Progress Billing'' step, when the value in the '''Completed (%)''' column is updated on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the system does not recalculate the '''Pending Invoice Amount''' column for the revenue budget line, and the system ignores any pending invoice amount of these lines during the billing process.

To bill a project task by its progress, you need to create a billing rule on the                       ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules (PM207000) form and                 configure a step of the  Progress Billing  type in this rule. Then you assign                 the configured billing rule to project tasks on the  Tasks  tab                 of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form.  During the project life cycle, you specify the  Completed (%)                  value on the  Revenue Budget  tab for the needed revenue budget                 lines to indicate that the project tasks are being performed. The system calculates                 the  Pending Invoice Amount  by using the following                 formula: Pending Invoice Amount = Revised Budgeted Amount * ( Completed (%) / 100 ) -                     Draft Invoices Amount - Actual Amount Alternatively, you can specify the  Pending Invoice Amount                  directly in the revenue budget line; the system will calculate the                      Completed (%)  value accordingly. When you run the project billing by clicking the  Run Project                     Billing  button on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, the system prepares a pro forma                 invoice or an accounts receivable invoice depending on the project workflow, which                 is defined by the state of the  Create Pro Forma On Billing                  check box on the  Summary  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form.

Once an invoice is prepared, the  Draft Invoices                     Amount  of the revenue budget lines is updated with the amount for                 which the invoice has been prepared, and the  Pending Invoice                     Amount  becomes zero.

))){br}{TOC}
==Story==
Suppose that you, as the project accountant of the SweetLife Fruit & Jams company, need to configure a billing rule to be used for billing a customer based on the progress of a project that your company completes for the customer.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Project Accounting'' feature has been enabled to support the project accounting functionality.
==Process Overview==
You will configure a billing rule for progress billing on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form.
==System Preparation==
Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded; you should sign in as Pam Brawner by using the ''brawner'' username and the ''123'' password.
==Step 1: Configuring a Billing Rule==
To configure a billing rule to be used for progress billing, perform the following instructions:[anchor|#ol_qvk_dvs_sbb]
#On the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, click '''Add New Record''' to create a new billing rule.
#In the Summary area, specify <tt>PRGRULE</tt> as the '''Billing Rule ID''' and <tt>Billing projects by progress</tt> as the '''Description'''. 
#In the left pane, add a row for the billing rule step, and specify the following settings in the row:
#*'''Active''': Selected
#*'''Step ID''': <tt>10</tt>
#*'''Description''': <tt>Billing by progress</tt>
#In the right pane, specify the following settings for the step (which is selected in the left pane):
#*'''Billing Type''': ''Progress Billing''
#* '''Invoice Description Formula''': <tt>=&rsquo;Invoice for &rsquo;+&#91;PMProject.ContractCD&#93;</tt>
#*:The system uses this formula to define the description of the invoice created based on the billing rule. The {{PMProject.ContractCD}} data field stores the project identifier.
#*'''Line Description Formula''': <tt>=&#91;PMBudget.Description&#93;</tt>
#*:The system uses this formula to define the description of the invoice line created based on the billing step. The {{PMBudget.Description}} data field stores the description of a project budget line.
#*'''Use Sales Account from''': ''Account Group''
#*:The system uses as the sales account the default account of the account group of a revenue budget line of a project.
#*'''Create Lines with Zero Amount''': Cleared
#Save the billing rule you have created.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Billing Rules: To Configure a Progress Billing Rule The following implementation activity will walk you through the process of                 configuring a progress billing rule. The following activity is             based on the  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system             settings have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the             activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100              dataset to its initial state. Story Suppose that you, as the project accountant of the SweetLife Fruit & Jams                 company, need to configure a billing rule to be used for billing a customer based on                 the progress of a project that your company completes for the customer. Configuration Overview For the purposes of this activity, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000)                 form, the  Project Accounting  feature has been enabled to support the project                 accounting functionality. Process Overview You will configure a billing rule for progress billing on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules (PM207000) form. System Preparation Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the  U100  dataset preloaded; you                 should sign in as Pam Brawner by using the  brawner  username and the                      123  password. Step 1: Configuring a Billing Rule To configure a billing rule to be used for progress billing, perform the following                 instructions: On the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules (PM207000) form,                     click  Add New Record  to create a new billing rule.

The following sections list the settings that you can specify for a billing rule step of the ''Time and Material'' type, and describes the process of billing a project for progress by using a simple one-step billing rule.[anchor|#_179906c8-4b48-4894-b6ad-4043a144056b]
==Configuration of a Billing Rule Step==
For a billing rule step of the ''Time and Material'' type, you can define the following settings:[anchor|#_3201502a-a2a8-4701-b370-04200e3442c6]
*The account group that is used as a filter to select the transactions for billing by the ''Time and Material'' billing steps. When the billing procedure is run, the system selects all the transactions that are due for billing and have the particular account group. Normally, you use for billing the same account group or groups that you use for accumulating the unrecognized revenue. 
*A formula to define the description of the invoice and a formula to define the description of each invoice line, to make the system compose these descriptions dynamically during the billing process.
*A formula to calculate the amount of the invoice lines created by the ''Time and Material'' billing steps, and another formula to calculate the quantity of these invoice lines. In these formulas, you can use fields and attributes from such entities as the project, project budget, project task, project transaction, customer, vendor, employee, inventory item, and account group. You can also use different sources of the project rates: those from rate tables, which can be configured on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_60_00|Rate Tables] ([~/?ScreenId=PM206000|PM206000]) form; and those from sales price lists, which are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form.
*The source of the sales account and the source of the destination branch for each invoice line.
*:The billing process uses the originating branch from the project settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form and the destination branches from the sources according to the billing rules. When an accounts receivable invoice is released, the accounts receivable account is updated under the originating branch of the invoice, while the revenue amounts are recorded to the destination branches of the invoice lines.
*The invoice group, which can be used during billing to make the system create separate invoices (either pro forma invoices or accounts receivable invoices, depending on the billing workflow of the project) for particular steps with the same invoice group during the project billing.
*Non-billable transactions that do not contribute to the amount billed to the customer and that you may decide to include in the invoice.
*Grouping criteria by date, employee, vendor, and inventory item for the invoice lines created by the ''Time and Material'' billing steps.

==The Time and Material Billing Process==
The time and material billing workflow is provided for project tasks that require to be billed based on project transactions. Time and material billing can be performed for only for project tasks of a project that is pending billing—that is, the project has at least one unbilled transaction that is ready to be billed on the invoice date. The ''Time and Material'' billing steps can be run once the project transactions that match the selection criteria have been processed. Optionally, the allocation process can be executed for these transactions before billing.{br}

To bill a project task for time and material, you need to create a billing rule on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form and configure a step or multiple steps of the ''Time and Material'' type in this rule. Multiple ''Time and Material'' steps are used in a billing rule for different account groups of transactions that should be used to determine the invoiced amounts by different formulas. You assign the configured billing rule to project tasks on the '''Tasks''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. {br}

When you run the project billing by clicking the '''Run Project Billing''' button on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the system prepares a pro forma invoice or an accounts receivable invoice, depending on the project workflow, which is defined by the state of the '''Create Pro Forma On Billing''' check box on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. {br}

The system creates an invoice based on the unbilled project transactions with amounts calculated by the billing rules of the project tasks. In the billing, the system includes the transactions with a date that is earlier than the billing date and does not include the transactions with the date that is later than the billing date. The transactions with the same date as the invoice date are billed if ''Include Trans. created on billing date'' is selected as the '''Billing Cut-off Date''' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form; if ''Exclude Trans. created on billing date'' is selected, the system skips the transactions with the same date as the invoice date.{br}

During the billing process, the system groups the billable amounts into separate invoices based on the following:[anchor|#_7bb591bd-5dac-4e32-acf8-d9b053a567f4]
*The invoice group of the steps of the billing rules to which the project tasks refer
*The customer
*The customer location
*The '''Bill Separately''' setting of each project task defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form
{br}

If the project billing is performed by using the pro forma invoice workflow, the invoice lines that are produced by the ''Time and Material'' billing steps are displayed on the '''Time and Material''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form.]]></column>

))){br}{TOC}
==Story==
Suppose that you, as the project accountant of the SweetLife Fruit & Jams company, need to configure a billing rule to be used for billing customers for the materials that have been spent on providing services as part of the project, and for the time that has been spent by SweetLife&rsquo;s employees performing work for the project.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Project Accounting'' feature has been enabled to support the project accounting functionality.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_10_00|Account Groups] ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) form, the following account groups have been configured:[anchor|#_7a1efe78-4d7b-44d9-bf73-0ce98d348556]
*The ''MATERIAL'' account group of the expense type, which aggregates the amounts posted to the ''50000 – GOGS – Inventory'' account
*The ''LABOR'' account group of the expense type, which aggregates the amounts posted to the ''54100 – Project Labor Expense'' account.

==Process Overview==
You will create a billing rule for time and material billing on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, and add to this rule two steps for billing different account groups.
==System Preparation==
Before you start configuring a billing rule, you need to launch the Acumatica ERP website and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded. To sign in as a project accountant, use the ''brawner'' username and the ''123'' password.
==Step 1: Configuring a Billing Rule and Adding a Step==
To configure a billing rule to be used for time and material billing and to then add a step for billing for materials, perform the following instructions:[anchor|#ol_qvk_dvs_sbb]
#On the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, click '''Add New Record''' to create a new billing rule.
#In the Summary area, specify <tt>MATTIME</tt> as the '''Billing Rule ID''' and <tt>Billing rule for materials with markup</tt> as the '''Description'''. 
#In the left pane, add a row for the billing rule step, and specify the following settings in the row:
#*'''Active''': Selected
#*'''Step ID''': <tt>10</tt>
#*'''Description''': <tt>Billing for materials (cost with markup)</tt>
#In the right pane, specify the following settings for the step (which is selected in the left pane because it is the only step):
#*'''Billing Type''': ''Time and Material''
#* '''Account Group''': ''MATERIAL''
#*:This step of the billing rule will be used for processing project transactions related to the account group, which includes expenses for materials.
#*'''Invoice Description Formula''': <tt>=&rsquo;Invoice for &rsquo;+&#91;PMProject.ContractCD&#93;</tt>
#*:The system uses this formula to define the description of the invoice created based on the billing rule. The {{PMProject.ContractCD}} data field stores the project identifier.
#*'''Line Quantity Formula''': <tt>=&#91;PMTran.BillableQty&#93;</tt>
#*'''Line Amount Formula''': <tt>=&#91;PMTran.Amount&#93;&#42;1.25</tt>
#*:The invoiced amount is calculated as the amount of a project transaction multiplied by 1.25.
#*'''Line Description Formula''': <tt>=&#91;PMTran.Description&#93;</tt>
#*'''Use Sales Account from''': ''Inventory Item''
#* '''Create Lines with Zero Amount and Quantity''': Cleared
#Save your changes.

==Step 2: Adding One More Step to the Billing Rule==
To add and configure a step for billing for labor, do the following:
#While you are still viewing the ''MATTIME'' billing rule on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, In the left pane, add a row for the second step of the billing rule, and specify the following in the row:
#*'''Active''': Selected
#*'''Step ID''': <tt>20</tt>
#*'''Description''': <tt>Billing for employee time</tt>
#In the right pane, specify the following settings for the new step (which is selected in the left pane):
#*'''Billing Type''': ''Time and Material''
#* '''Account Group''': ''LABOR''
#*:This step of the billing rule will be used for processing project transactions related to the account group, which includes expenses for employee labor.
#*'''Invoice Description Formula''': <tt>=&rsquo;Invoice for &rsquo;+&#91;PMProject.ContractCD&#93;</tt>
#*:The system uses this formula to define the description of the invoice created based on the billing rule. The {{PMProject.ContractCD}} data field stores the project identifier.
#*'''Line Quantity Formula''': <tt>=&#91;PMTran.BillableQty&#93;</tt>
#*'''Line Amount Formula''': <tt>=&#91;PMTran.Amount&#93;&#42;1.25</tt>
#*:The invoiced amount is calculated as the amount of a project transaction multiplied by 1.25.
#*'''Line Description Formula''': <tt>=&#91;PMTran.Description&#93;</tt>
#*'''Use Sales Account from''': ''Inventory Item''
#* '''Create Lines with Zero Amount and Quantity''': Cleared
#Save the created billing rule.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Billing Rules: To Configure a Time and Material Rule The following implementation activity will walk you through the process of                 configuring a time and material billing rule. The following activity is             based on the  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system             settings have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the             activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100              dataset to its initial state. Story Suppose that you, as the project accountant of the SweetLife Fruit & Jams                 company, need to configure a billing rule to be used for billing customers for the                 materials that have been spent on providing services as part of the project, and for                 the time that has been spent by SweetLife's employees performing work for the                 project. Configuration Overview For the purposes of this activity, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000)                 form, the  Project Accounting  feature has been enabled to support the project                 accounting functionality. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) Account Groups (PM201000) form, the following account groups                 have been configured: The  MATERIAL  account group of the expense type, which aggregates the                     amounts posted to the  50000 – GOGS – Inventory  account The  LABOR  account group of the expense type, which aggregates the amounts                     posted to the  54100 – Project Labor Expense  account. Process Overview You will create a billing rule for time and material billing on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules (PM207000) form, and add to this rule two steps for                 billing different account groups.

Step 4: Configuring a Billing Rule Step with Billing for Subcontractors’                 Services To add and configure a fourth step to the billing rule for billing customers on                 services provided by subcontractors, do the following: While you are still reviewing the  COMBRULE  billing rule on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules (PM207000) form, in the left pane, add a row for                     the fourth step of the billing rule, and specify the following settings in the                         row: Active : Selected Step ID :  40 Description :  Re-invoice subcontractor                                 services In the right pane, specify the following settings for the new step, which is                     selected in the left pane: Billing Type :  Time and Material Account Group :  SUBCON This step of the                                 billing rule will be used for processing project transactions                                 related to the account group, which includes services provided by                                 subcontractors. Rate Type : Empty This step of billing rule does                                 not use billing rates, so the rate type is not specified. Invoice Description Formula :  ='Invoice                                 for '+[PMProject.ContractCD] The system uses this                                 formula to define the description of the invoice created based on                                 the billing rule. The  PMProject.ContractCD  data                                 field stores the project identifier.

You have configured the combined billing rule that can be used for billing the first                 part of project for progress and the rest of the project for time and materials. To                 bill the project by using this rule, you need to assign the rule to the project                 tasks. To review how a project is billed when you use a combined billing rule,                 complete the  Project Billing: To Bill a Project with Combined Rule                 activity. ]]></column>

==Story==
Suppose that as part of a contract to provide juicers to multiple restaurants, the Thai Food Restaurant customer has ordered a juicer from the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company, along with the following services: site review, installation, and training of employees on operating the juicer. The SweetLife project accountant has created a project to account for the provided work and has generated a pro forma invoice for the project. Then suppose that the project accountant has reviewed the prepared pro forma invoice, and has decided that the following changes should be made:[anchor|#_6e77a8b2-4d16-4246-bbdd-bffc1df0c80a]
*The invoice’s description should be corrected to be more clear. The updated description will say ''Invoice for'' followed by the identifier of the project.
*The processing of the travel expenses related to the project needs to be added to the billing rule. Per the agreement with the customer, these will be billed with a fixed margin coefficient of 1.4.
*The invoice lines should be grouped by inventory item.

Acting as the project accountant, you need to update the billing rule and verify that invoices are generated in the appropriate format. 
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Project Accounting'' feature has been enabled to provide support for the project accounting functionality.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, the ''TIMEMATERIAL'' billing rule has been configured.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, the ''TOMYUM10'' project has been created. On the '''Tasks''' tab, the ''TIMEMATERIAL'' billing rule is specified for each project task. Also, the '''Create Pro Forma on Billing''' check box is selected on the '''Summary''' tab, indicating that a pro forma invoice is created when the project is billed.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) form, the ''PM00000006'' batch of project transactions related to the project has been created and released.
==Process Overview==
You will bill the project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form; you will also review how the current billing rules work, and how the prepared pro forma invoice looks on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form. Then you will delete the pro forma invoice, to cancel billing, and modify the billing rule on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form. You will change the description of the invoices to be created, add a new step to a billing rule for processing the travel expenses, and configure the grouping of project transactions for employee labor to a single line.{br}

After you make these changes to the billing rule, you will bill the project again on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. Finally, you will review the pro forma invoice created with the modified billing rule on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] form.
==System Preparation==
Before you begin performing the steps of this activity, perform the following instructions to prepare the system:[anchor|#_6c9e4914-0e56-4fc0-9f9d-df880dcd99b6]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded; you should sign in as Pam Brawner by using the ''brawner'' username and the ''123'' password.[anchor|#_ad3b4f11-1ed4-43f4-aab9-374041ea6998]
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select ''1/30/2020'' on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.

==Step 1: Billing the Project==
To bill the project for the Thai Food Restaurant customer, do the following:[anchor|#_6d5166ea-40e0-4605-94ac-8ea9f15e6e8f]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''TOMYUM10'' project, and on the '''Cost Budget''' tab, review the cost budget of the project. Notice the line with the ''PHASE3'' task: travel expenses are associated with the ''TRAVEL'' account group, while the employee&rsquo;s labor on conducting a training are associated with the ''LABOR'' account group.
#:To review a pro forma invoice for this project with the existing ''TIMEMATERIAL'' billing rule, you will bill the project.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Run Project Billing'''.
#:The system creates a pro forma invoice and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form. Review the details of the pro forma invoice, which should be improved on in the following regards:
#*The pro forma invoice description is ''Invoice for TOMYUM10''. While the description is correctly noting the project identifier in the system, you would like the invoice description also include the description of the project.
#*On the '''Time and Material''' tab, there is no line with the ''TRAVEL'' inventory item because the line has not been processed by the billing rule, which does not include a time and material step for the ''TRAVEL'' account group. 
#*On the '''Time and Material''' tab, there are three lines with the ''PHASE3'' task and ''TRAINING'' inventory item. For a more typical and easier-to-grasp way of presenting invoice lines, multiple lines with the same inventory item should be grouped into one line.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Delete''' to delete the pro forma invoice.

You need to modify the billing rule, and perform the billing process for the project again.
==Step 2: Modifying the Billing Rule==
To change the ''TIMEMATERIAL'' billing rule, do the following:[anchor|#_fdcbc4bb-03bd-4803-ac4c-d1d2065b1582]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, open the ''TIMEMATERIAL'' billing rule.
#To modify the description of invoices created with the billing rule, do the following:
##In the left pane, click the ''10 - Material cost plus markup'' step so that you can modify the settings of this step.
##In the right pane, enter the following formula in the '''Invoice Description Formula''' box:
##:<tt>=&rsquo;Invoice for &rsquo;+&#91;PMProject.ContractCD&#93;+&rsquo;(&rsquo;+&#91;PMProject.Description&#93;+&rsquo;)&rsquo;</tt>
##Repeat the two previous actions twice to specify the same invoice description formula for the ''20 - Labor from non-stock price'' and ''30 - Re-invoice subcontractors'' steps of the billing rule. (This needs to be done for each of the lines, because the system uses the invoice description formula of the first billing step that satisfies the grouping conditions of the project transactions to be billed, and this could be any of the steps.)
#To add a billing step to bill travel expenses with a fixed margin coefficient of 1.4, do the following:
##In the left pane, add a new row, and specify the following settings in the row:
##*'''Active''': Selected
##*'''Step ID''': <tt>40</tt>
##*'''Description''': <tt>Travel cost plus markup</tt>
##In the right pane, specify the following settings for the step selected in the left pane (see the screenshot below):
##*'''Billing Type''': ''Time and Material''
##* '''Account Group''': ''TRAVEL''
##*:With this step of the billing rule, the system processes the project transaction that debits accounts mapped to the ''TRAVEL'' account group.
##*'''If @Rate is not defined''': ''Set @Rate to 0''
##* '''Invoice Description Formula''': <tt>=&rsquo;Invoice for &rsquo;+&#91;PMProject.ContractCD&#93;+&rsquo;(&rsquo;+&#91;PMProject.Description&#93;+&rsquo;)&rsquo;</tt>
##*'''Line Quantity Formula''': <tt>=&#91;PMTran.BillableQty&#93;</tt>
##*:The system uses the quantity of the project transaction as the quantity of an invoice line.
##*'''Line Amount Formula''': <tt>=&#91;PMTran.Amount&#93;&#42;1.4</tt>
##*:The system uses the amount of the project transaction multiplied by 1.4 as the amount of the invoice line.
##*'''Line Description Formula''': <tt>=&#91;PMTran.Description&#93;</tt>
##*:The system uses the description of the project transaction as the description of the invoice line.
##*'''Use Sales Account from''': ''Inventory Item''[anchor|#_82bf2e6f-e3c5-43bc-be1f-4c74da5129eb][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_Config_Billing_Rules.png|popup|The new step of the billing rule|400px]
#To group project transactions with the ''LABOR'' account group into a single invoice line if they also have the same inventory item, do the following:
##In the left pane, click the ''20 - Labor from non-stock price'' step.
##In the right pane, in the '''Aggregate Transactions By''' section, select the '''Inventory ID''' check box.
#Save your changes to the billing rule.

==Step 3: Billing a Project With the Updated Billing Rule==
To bill the project with the billing rule that you have modified and review how the changes to the billing rule affect the prepared pro forma invoice, do the following:[anchor|#_6bf80533-656f-47e4-9fdb-3989ca88efd8]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''TOMYUM10'' project.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Run Project Billing'''.
#:The system creates a pro forma invoice and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form. Notice the following changes to the pro forma invoice, as the screenshot below shows: 
#*The description of the pro forma invoice is now ''Invoice for TOMYUM10 (А juicer with the installation and training for employees)''.
#*On the '''Time and Material''' tab, a line with the ''TRAVEL'' inventory item has appeared. 
#*On the '''Time and Material''' tab, there is only one line with the ''PHASE3'' task and ''TRAINING'' inventory item.[anchor|#image_vfy_y5s_wmb][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Billing_Rules_Process_Activity2.png|popup|The pro forma invoice generated by updated billing rule|450px]
#Click the line with the ''PHASE3'' task and ''TRAINING'' inventory item, and on the table toolbar, click '''View Transaction Details''' to review the list of project transactions corresponding to the invoice line. Notice that three transactions were grouped into one line during the billing, based on the aggregation setting of the billing rule you have modified.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Billing Rules: To Modify a Billing Rule In this activity, you will learn how to update the settings of an existing billing rule,         and review how this affects the documents generated by the project billing process.  The following activity is             based on the  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system             settings have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the             activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100              dataset to its initial state.

The updated description           will say  Invoice for  followed by the identifier of the project. The processing of the travel expenses related to the project needs to be added to the           billing rule. Per the agreement with the customer, these will be billed            with a fixed margin           coefficient of 1.4. The invoice lines should be grouped by inventory item. Acting as the project accountant, you need to update the billing rule and verify that         invoices are generated in the appropriate format.  Configuration Overview For the purposes of this activity, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features         (CS100000) form, the  Project Accounting  feature has been enabled to provide support         for the project accounting functionality. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules (PM207000) form, the  TIMEMATERIAL  billing         rule has been configured. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, the  TOMYUM10          project has been created. On the  Tasks  tab, the  TIMEMATERIAL          billing rule is specified for each project task. Also, the  Create Pro Forma on           Billing  check box is selected on the  Summary  tab,         indicating that a pro forma invoice is created when the project is billed. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) Project Transactions (PM304000) form, the  PM00000006          batch of project transactions related to the project has been created and released. Process Overview You will bill the project on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000)         form; you will also review how the current billing rules work, and how the prepared pro         forma invoice looks on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form.         Then you will delete the pro forma invoice, to cancel billing, and modify the billing rule         on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules (PM207000) form. You will change the         description of the invoices to be created, add a new step to a billing rule for processing         the travel expenses, and configure the grouping of project transactions for employee labor         to a single line. After you make these changes to the billing rule, you will bill the project again on the             ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form. Finally, you will review the pro forma         invoice created with the modified billing rule on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices form. System Preparation Before you begin performing the steps of this activity, perform the following instructions         to prepare the system: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the  U100  dataset preloaded; you should           sign in as Pam Brawner by using the  brawner  username and the  123            password. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP             screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to  1/30/2020. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and             select  1/30/2020 on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and             process all documents in the system during this business date. Step 1: Billing the Project To bill the project for the Thai Food Restaurant customer, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, open the              TOMYUM10  project, and on the  Cost Budget  tab, review the           cost budget of the project. Notice the line with the  PHASE3  task:            travel expenses are           associated with  the  TRAVEL  account           group , while the           employee's labor on conducting a training are associated with the              LABOR  account group. To review a pro forma invoice for this             project with the existing  TIMEMATERIAL  billing rule, you will bill the             project. On the form toolbar, click  Run Project Billing . The system             creates a pro forma invoice and opens it on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form. Review the details of the pro             forma invoice, which should be improved on in the following regards: The pro forma invoice description is  Invoice for TOMYUM10 . While the               description is correctly noting the project identifier in the system, you would like               the invoice description also include the description of the project. On the  Time and Material  tab, there is no line with the                  TRAVEL  inventory item because the line has not been                processed by the               billing rule, which does not include a time and material step for the  TRAVEL                account group .  On the  Time and Material  tab, there are three lines with the                  PHASE3  task and  TRAINING  inventory item. For a more typical and               easier-to-grasp way of presenting invoice lines, multiple lines with the same               inventory item should be grouped into one line. On the form toolbar, click  Delete  to delete the pro forma           invoice. You need to modify the billing rule, and perform the billing process for the project         again. Step 2: Modifying the Billing Rule To change the  TIMEMATERIAL  billing rule, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules (PM207000) form, open the              TIMEMATERIAL  billing rule. To modify the description of invoices created with the billing rule, do the             following: In the left pane, click the  10 - Material cost plus markup  step so that you               can modify the settings of this step. In the right pane, enter the following formula in the  Invoice Description                 Formula  box: ='Invoice for                   '+[PMProject.ContractCD]+'('+[PMProject.Description]+')' Repeat the two previous actions twice to specify the same invoice description               formula for the  20 - Labor from non-stock price  and  30 - Re-invoice                 subcontractors  steps of the billing rule. (This needs to be done for each of the               lines, because the system uses the invoice description formula of the first billing               step that satisfies the grouping conditions of the project transactions to be billed,               and this could be any of the steps.) To add a billing step to bill travel expenses with a fixed margin coefficient of 1.4, do           the following: In the left pane, add a new row, and specify the following settings in the row: Active : Selected Step ID :  40 Description :  Travel cost plus                     markup In the right pane, specify the following settings for the step selected in the left               pane (see the screenshot below): Billing Type :  Time and Material Account Group :  TRAVEL With this step of the                     billing rule, the system processes the project transaction that debits accounts                     mapped to the  TRAVEL  account group. If @Rate is not defined :  Set @Rate to 0 Invoice Description Formula :  ='Invoice for                     '+[PMProject.ContractCD]+'('+[PMProject.Description]+')' Line Quantity Formula :                      =[PMTran.BillableQty] The system uses the quantity of                     the project transaction as the quantity of an invoice line. Line Amount Formula :                      =[PMTran.Amount]*1.4 The system uses the amount of the                     project transaction multiplied by 1.4 as the amount of the invoice                   line. Line Description Formula :                      =[PMTran.Description] The system uses the description                     of the project transaction as the description of the invoice line. Use Sales Account from :  Inventory Item The new step of the billing rule To group project transactions with the  LABOR  account group into a single invoice           line if they also have the same inventory item, do the following: In the left pane, click the  20 - Labor from non-stock price  step. In the right pane, in the  Aggregate Transactions By  section,               select the  Inventory ID  check box. Save your changes to the billing rule. Step 3: Billing a Project With the Updated Billing Rule To bill the project with the billing rule that you have modified and review how the changes         to the billing rule affect the          prepared pro forma          invoice, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, open the              TOMYUM10  project. On the form toolbar, click  Run Project Billing . The system             creates a pro forma invoice and opens it on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form. Notice the following changes             to the pro forma             invoice , as the             screenshot below shows :  The description of the pro forma invoice is now  Invoice for TOMYUM10 (А juicer                 with the installation and training for employees) . On the  Time and Material  tab, a line with the  TRAVEL                inventory item has appeared.  On the  Time and Material  tab, there is only one line with the                  PHASE3  task and  TRAINING  inventory item. The pro forma invoice generated by updated billing rule Click the line with the  PHASE3  task and  TRAINING  inventory item, and on           the table toolbar, click  View Transaction Details  to review the           list of project transactions corresponding to the invoice line. Notice that three           transactions were grouped into one line during the billing, based on the aggregation           setting of the billing rule you have modified. ]]></column>

==Story==
Suppose that the West BBQ Restaurant customer has contacted the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company and requested a maintenance service for a juicer. This is a new type of service that the company has not previously provided for any customer. SweetLife&rsquo;s employee has visited the customer and provided two hours of the new maintenance service. {br}

Acting as the project accountant, you need to update the billing rule used in the project to track the new type of expenses and bill the customer for the provided services.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Project Accounting'' feature has been enabled to support the project accounting functionality.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, the ''STANDARD'' billing rule has been created.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form, the ''WESTBBQ'' customer has been configured. 
==Process Overview==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, you will add a new step to the billing rule; for the step, you will configure processing transactions related to the new maintenance service. Then you will create a new project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form that includes a task for the maintenance service and uses the updated billing rule. You will also create project transactions on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) form to record the provided maintenance work and update the actual project values. Finally, you will bill a project and review the prepared pro forma invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form.
==System Preparation==
Before you begin performing the steps of this activity, perform the following instructions to prepare the system:[anchor|#_6c9e4914-0e56-4fc0-9f9d-df880dcd99b6]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded; you should sign in as Pam Brawner by using the ''brawner'' username and the ''123'' password.
#To create a new labor item to represent the maintenance service, complete the [HelpRoot_Projects\Non_Stock_Item_Projects_Implem_Activity|Labor Items: To Configure a Labor Item].

==Step 1: Modifying a Billing Rule==
To add to an existing billing rule a billing step to bill maintenance expenses with a fixed margin coefficient of 1.2, do the following:[anchor|#ol_qvk_dvs_sbb]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, open the ''STANDARD'' billing rule.
#In the left pane, add a row, and specify the following settings for it:
#*'''Active''': Selected
#*'''Step ID''': <tt>40</tt>
#*'''Description''': <tt>Maintenance cost plus markup</tt>
#In the right pane, specify the following settings for the step selected in the left pane:
#*'''Billing Type''': ''Time and Material''
#* '''Account Group''': ''MAINTSERV''
#*:In this step of the billing rule, the system processes a project transaction that debits accounts mapped to the ''MAINTSERV'' account group.
#*'''If @Rate is not defined''': ''Set @Rate to 0''
#* '''Invoice Description Formula''': <tt>=&rsquo;Invoice for &rsquo;+&#91;PMProject.ContractCD&#93;</tt>
#*'''Line Quantity Formula''': <tt>=&#91;PMTran.BillableQty&#93;</tt>
#*:The system uses the quantity of the project transaction as the quantity of each invoice line.
#*'''Line Amount Formula''': <tt>=&#91;PMTran.BillableQty&#93;&#42;1.2&#42;@Price</tt>
#*:The invoiced amount is calculated as the amount of the project transaction multiplied by the price of the related inventory item with the markup.
#*'''Line Description Formula''': <tt>=&#91;PMTran.Description&#93;</tt>
#*:The system uses the description of the project transaction as the description of the invoice line.
#*'''Use Sales Account from''': ''Inventory Item''
#* '''Create Lines with Zero Amount and Quantity''': Cleared
#Save your changes to the billing rule.

==Step 2: Creating a Project==
To create a project that represents the maintenance work SweetLife will do for the West BBQ Restaurant customer, do the following:[anchor|#_f952e5b4-ae52-4fc4-a141-24fa16fbdc17]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, click '''Add New Record''' on the form toolbar, and specify the following settings ini the Summary area:
#*'''Project ID''': <tt>WESTBBQ</tt>
#*'''Customer''': ''WESTBBQ - West BBQ Restaurant''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Maintenance service for a juicer</tt>
#On the '''Summary''' tab, specify the following settings:
#*'''Change Order Workflow''': Cleared
#*'''Billing Period''': ''On Demand''
#To add a task to the new project, on the table toolbar of the '''Tasks''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the new row:
#*'''Task ID''': <tt>SERVICE</tt>
#*'''Description''': <tt>Maintenance service for a juicer</tt>
#*'''Billing Rule''': ''STANDARD''
#*:This is the billing rule you have modified in the previous step.
#*'''Status''': ''Active''
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and on the form toolbar, click '''Save'''; the project now has the ''Active'' status.

==Step 3: Creating and Processing a Project Transaction==
To update the actual values of the project, create and process a project transaction for two hours of maintenance work by doing the following:[anchor|#_9720e720-d5f4-4184-a1b0-dfb37b908181]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) form, create a new transaction, and in the Summary area, specify ''PM'' as the''' Module''' and <tt>Maintenance service for WESTBBQ</tt> as the '''Description'''.
#In the table on the '''Document Details''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the row:
#*'''Project''': ''WESTBBQ''
#* '''Project Task''': ''SERVICE''
#* '''Account Group''': ''MAINTSERV''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''MAINTSERV''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>2</tt>
#*'''Unit Rate''': <tt>80.00</tt>
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save''', and then click '''Release'''.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''WESTBBQ'' project, and on the '''Cost Budget''' tab, notice that a line with the cost of the provided maintenance service has appeared with an '''Actual Amount''' of 160. 

==Step 4: Billing the Project and Reviewing the Billed Amount==
To bill the project and review the document prepared for the customer, do the following: [anchor|#_99a78877-47ff-43fe-b8e7-73ce8b8037a1]
#While you are still reviewing the ''WESTBBQ'' project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, on the form toolbar, click '''Run Project Billing'''.
#:The system creates a pro forma invoice and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form.
#On the '''Time and Material''' tab, review the invoice line that the system has created for the project transaction that you processed in the previous step. The '''Billed Amount''', which is calculated by using the line amount formula you have specified for the new step of the billing rule, is $192, which is the transaction quantity (2) multiplied by the default price of the labor item ($80) and then multiplied by 1.2.
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and on the form toolbar, click '''Release'''. The system closes the pro forma invoice (which is now assigned the ''Closed'' status), and creates an accounts receivable invoice based on the pro forma invoice.
#On the '''Financial Details''' tab, click the link in the '''AR Ref. Nbr.''' box to open the accounts receivable invoice that the system created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form.
#In the Summary area of the form, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and on the form toolbar, click '''Release'''.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''WESTBBQ'' project. Notice that in the Summary area, the '''Actual Income''' box now shows $192, which is the total amount of the invoice that you have processed.

Step 4: Billing the Project and Reviewing the Billed Amount To bill the project and review the document prepared for the customer, do the                 following:  While you are still reviewing the  WESTBBQ  project on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, on the form toolbar, click                          Run Project Billing . The system creates a pro forma                         invoice and opens it on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000)                         form. On the  Time and Material  tab, review the invoice line                     that the system has created for the project transaction that you processed in                     the previous step. The  Billed Amount , which is calculated                     by using the line amount formula you have specified for the new step of the                     billing rule, is $192, which is the transaction quantity (2) multiplied by the                     default price of the labor item ($80) and then multiplied by 1.2. In the Summary area, clear the  Hold  check box, and on the                     form toolbar, click  Release . The system closes the pro                     forma invoice (which is now assigned the  Closed  status), and creates an                     accounts receivable invoice based on the pro forma invoice. On the  Financial Details  tab, click the link in the                          AR Ref. Nbr.  box to open the accounts receivable                     invoice that the system created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos                     (AR301000) form. In the Summary area of the form, clear the  Hold  check                     box, and on the form toolbar, click  Release . On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, open the  WESTBBQ                      project. Notice that in the Summary area, the  Actual                         Income  box now shows $192, which is the total amount of the                     invoice that you have processed.  ]]></column>

In Acumatica ERP, each project can consist of one project task or multiple project task. A project task is the smallest identifiable piece of work that is a part of the project, and you can select a billing rule for each project task to determine how it will be billed. In the following sections, you will find information about creating project tasks.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Create a project task for a particular project
*Configure the rules of the project task completion
*Configure a project task to be billed separately from other project tasks
*Set a project task as a default for a project

==Applicable Scenarios==
You create a project task in the following cases:[anchor|#_7165d0ed-fbf9-4bca-b563-a0155c7a9310]
*When you are configuring a new project from the beginning
*When you need to add a new project task to existing project

==Project Task Settings==
You create new project tasks in a project by adding a row for each task to the '''Tasks''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form; you can then review the settings of the project task on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form. Each project task is linked to a particular project and has a unique identifier. Project tasks are always defined within the scope and limitations of a specific project; a particular project task may have the additional limitations within the scope of the project.((({S:Hint}You can create new project tasks directly from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] form by specifying the identifier of the project to which the project task relates, the identifier of the new project task, and the settings specific for the project task.
)))
For a project task, you can define the following settings, which are specific to the task and do not extend to the project: [anchor|#ul_txb_4gb_nr]
*Date range: You can narrow the date range of the task, as long as it remains within the start and end dates of the project. The start and end dates are specified for information purposes and do not affect any processes performed for this project task.
*Billing rule (and optional rate ): By default, the system assigns to the added project task the billing rule that is specified on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form for the project. Billing rules are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form. 
*:If complex billing rules have to be configured for billing the project task, you also need assign the appropriate rate table to the project task.
*Separate billing: You can select the '''Bill Separately''' check box on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] form to make the system create a separate invoice for the project task.
*Allocation rule: You can define the allocation rule for a particular project task. 
*:By default, to a newly added project task the system assigns the default allocation rule of the project which is specified on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form.
*Method of calculating task completion percentage: You can define the project task to be completed manually or based on the budgeted quantity or amount.
*Default project task: You can specify this project task as the default one for the project; only one default project task can be specified. The system automatically inserts the default project task on data entry forms when the project is selected. 
*Visibility settings: The project task may be visible only in the parts of the system in which the associated project is visible. You can leave these default visibility settings, or apply additional visibility limitations for the project task.

A project task can have the ''In Planning'', ''Active'' or ''Canceled'' status. The statuses of individual tasks do not affect the status of the corresponding project.
==Grouping Invoices by Project Tasks==
During the billing process, the system groups the billable amounts into invoices based on the settings of the project tasks and their billing rules. By default, the system creates a single invoice for a project even if the project tasks have different billing rules assigned, except for the project tasks that have the '''Bill Separately''' check box selected on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form.{br}

The system also creates a separate invoice for all the billing steps of billing rules for which the same '''Invoice Group''' is specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form. That is, if some tasks of a project have a billing rule or multiple billing rules with billing steps that have the same invoice group, during the project billing, the system creates a separate invoice for all the invoice lines created with these billing steps.
==Mapping Accounts to Project Tasks==
When you create a document, you specify a project task for each line where it is applicable. When you run a billing procedure for a project, or process project-related documents, the system may automatically generate additional invoice lines—for instance, to include a discount or freight charge. These lines are automatically associated with the project being billed, but you may also need these transactions to automatically be associated with specific project tasks. To define the project in this way, you need to map specific general ledger accounts to tasks within the project in the '''Default Task for GL Account''' section on the '''Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. Once you map a general ledger account to a project task, any transactions automatically generated by the system and associated with this account will be linked to this project task.]]></column>

A project task is the smallest identifiable piece of work that is a part of the project. A project task may require more than one financial period to complete, and the project task may be billed when it is completed or when the entire project is completed. The allocation rules for projects are usually straightforward and use the percentage-of-completion scheme to evaluate the revenue earned during a specific financial period. {br}

For each project task in a project, you can select which method will be used to evaluate the completion percentage of the project task in the '''Completion Method''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form (in the '''Task Properties''' section of the '''Summary''' tab). The following sections describe the available methods that can be used to evaluate or calculate the percentage of project task completion.
==Manual Completion of a Project Task==
In the '''Completion Method''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form (in the '''Task Properties''' section of the '''Summary''' tab), you select ''Manual'' if it is not possible to select one cost line whose actual amount or quantity would reflect the overall project task progress. This may be the case if different cost lines are expressed as quantities measured in different UOMs, or some of the lines have budgets expressed as amounts with other line budgets expressed as quantities. {br}

With this method, you evaluate the project task progress by using all the available information and manually specify the project task completion percentage in the '''Completed (%)''' box. You can change the value as often as is needed; we recommend that you update it before you perform an allocation for the project.
==Completion by Budgeted Quantity==
In the '''Completion Method''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form (in the '''Task Properties''' section of the '''Summary''' tab), you select ''Budgeted Quantity'' to calculate the project task completion percentage for all cost budget lines associated with the project task for which the '''Auto Completed (%)''' check box is selected on the '''Cost Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. The method is applicable for only the project tasks having a separate cost budget line whose actual quantity reflects the project task's overall progress, so that you select the '''Auto Completed (%)''' check box for only this cost budget line.
The system calculates the percentage based on the quantities in the '''Actual Quantity''' and '''Revised Budgeted Quantity''' columns on the '''Cost Budget''' tab by using the following formula: {br}

{{Completed (%) = SUM (Actual Quantity) / SUM (Revised Budgeted Quantity}}),{br}

where the actual quantities and revised budgeted quantities are summed up by all the cost budget lines related to this project task (the UOMs specified in cost budget lines are ignored).{br}

For example, suppose that a project task has a budget for 100 hours of consulting (at a cost of $100 per hour) for a customer company and a budget for 25 round trips (at a cost of $10 per hour) to the customer location. If you select the consulting cost for tracking the project task completion, with 40 hours of consulting completed, the percentage of the project task completion is calculated as 40%. Splitting or merging consulting sessions may change the number of required round trips; however, the project task progress should be measured by the actual hours of consulting performed.
==Completion by Budgeted Amounts==
In the '''Completion Method''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form (in the '''Task Properties''' section of the '''Summary''' tab), you select ''Budgeted Amount'' for a project task if all cost lines have budgeted amounts. With this method selected, the system calculates the project task completion percentage for all the cost budget lines associated with the project task for which the '''Auto Completed (%)''' check box is selected on the '''Cost Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. {br}

The system calculates the percentage based on the amounts in the '''Actual Amount''' and '''Revised Budgeted Amount''' columns on the '''Cost Budget''' tab by using the following formula: {br}

{{Completed (%) = SUM (Actual Amount) / SUM (Revised Budgeted Amount)}}
where the actual amounts and revised budgeted amounts are summed up by all the cost budget lines related to this project task (the UOMs specified in cost budget lines are ignored).

Completion by Budgeted Amounts In the  Completion Method  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) Project Tasks         (PM302000) form (in the  Task Properties  section of the            Summary  tab), you select  Budgeted Amount  for a project task         if all cost lines have budgeted amounts. With this method selected, the system calculates         the project task completion percentage for all the cost budget lines associated with the         project task for which the  Auto Completed (%)  check box is selected         on the  Cost Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects         (PM301000) form.  The system calculates the percentage based on the amounts in the  Actual           Amount  and  Revised            Budgeted            Amount  columns on the  Cost Budget  tab         by using the following formula:          Completed (%) =            SUM           ( Actual           Amount )            /  SUM           ( Revised            Budgeted            Amount ) where the actual amounts and revised budgeted amounts are summed up by all the cost budget         lines related to this project task (the UOMs specified in cost budget lines are         ignored).

Before starting to create project tasks, you must be sure that the system has been configured properly and that all required entities have been created, as described in the following sections.{br}{TOC}
==Enabling the Needed Features==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Projects'' feature must be enabled.
==Configuring Project Task Identifiers==
The ''PROTASK'' segmented key on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form defines the identifier of the project tasks. By default, this segmented key specifies that the project task identifier is an alphanumeric string of up to 10 characters. For the key, you can define how many segments it is to have, what values may be used, whether these values should be validated, and whether auto-numbering should be used in one of the segments. You can also divide item identifiers into segments with specific values. For more information on configuring segmented keys, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Identifier_Segmentation|Segmented Identifiers].
==Configuring the System==
You need to make sure the following tasks have been performed in Acumatica ERP before you begin creating project tasks:[anchor|#_e153756e-f2d7-4f8f-9f6f-3fb0ba37b502]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form, the basic project accounting settings have been specified: numbering sequences, non-project code, visibility settings, and posting settings. The actual combination of settings you need to specify depends on the processes in your organization and on the features enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. For an example of basic project configuration, see [HelpRoot_Projects\config_Project_Basic_Implem_Activity|Project Basic Configuration: Implementation Activity].
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, the project for which you are going to create a task or multiple tasks has been created. For an example of creating a project, see [HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Process_Implem_Activity_Fixed_Price|Project Processing: To Create a Fixed-Price Project] and [HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Process_Implem_Activity_Cost_Plus|Project Processing: To Create a Cost-Plus Project].
*Optional: On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, each billing rule that you will assign to a project task has been created.

)))
==Story==
Suppose that the SweetLife Fruit & Jams company is managing a project for the HM&rsquo;s Bakery and Cafe customer, which has ordered the installation of two juicers. A project for this work is currently in progress; the installation of the juicers is 75% completed and is supposed to be completed by 1/30/2020. {br}

Then suppose that the customer notifies you that its employees need training on operating the juicers; you need to add a project task for this activity to the project and add to the cost budget a cost budget line related to this task. You are planning to start training on 1/30/2020. You want to bill the customer separately for the conducted training, and to close the project task based on the budgeted quantity, which is 16 hours of training.{br}

Acting as a SweetLife project accountant, you need to add a new project task for the employee training to the existing project, and specify the settings of the project task. Because the other project tasks are going to be completed soon, you also will set the newly added project task as the default task of the project, so that the system will populate this task automatically in all related documents in which a user will select this project. 
==Process Overview==
In this activity, you will add a new project task to the existing project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, and specify the standard settings of the project task. Then you will enter specific settings for the project task on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Project Accounting'' feature has been enabled to support the project accounting functionality.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, the ''HMBAKERY2'' project has been created.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form, the ''PHASE1'' and ''PHASE2'' project tasks have been created for the ''HMBAKERY2'' project. For both tasks, in the '''Task Properties''' section of the '''Summary''' tab, '''Completed (%)''', which represents the completion percentage, is 75%, and the '''End Date''' is 1/30/2020.
==System Preparation==
Before you start creating a project task, sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded; you should sign in as a project accountant with the ''brawner'' username and ''123'' password.
==Step 1: Adding a Project Task to the Project==
To add a new project task to a project, do the following:[anchor|#_fa742785-635f-4638-890f-918dff014a89]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''HMBAKERY2'' project.
#On the '''Tasks''' tab, add a new row, and specify the following settings in the row:
#*'''Task ID''': ''TRAINING''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Employee training</tt>
#*'''Billing Rule''': ''TM''
#* '''Status''': ''Active''
#* '''Start Date''': 1/30/2020
#* '''Default''': Selected
#Save your changes.

==Step 2: Configuring Advanced Settings for the Project Task==
To review the newly added project task and specify advanced settings for it, do the following:[anchor|#_9f1c4112-4096-4dc5-a3ef-87486ef4fc3d]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form, select ''HMBAKERY2'' as the '''Project''' and ''TRAINING'' as the '''Project Task'''.
#On the '''Summary''' tab, select the '''Bill Separately''' check box to make the system bill this project task separately.
#In the '''Completion Method''' box, select ''Budgeted Quantity''.
#Save your changes.

==Step 3: Adding the Related Cost Budget Line==
To add the costs related to conducting a training to the budget, do the following:[anchor|#_c005a84a-6aef-4cd8-bc62-faf5960ce481]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''HMBAKERY2'' project.
#On the '''Cost Budget''' tab, add a line with the following settings:
#*'''Project Task''': ''TRAINING''
#* '''Account Group''': ''LABOR''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Training for employees</tt>
#*'''Original Budgeted Quantity''': <tt>16</tt>
#*'''UOM''': ''HOUR''
#* '''Unit Rate''': <tt>40</tt>
#*'''Auto-Completed (%)''': Selected

You have added a new project task to the project, configured the project task settings, and budgeted the new project task.
==Testing of Settings==
To make sure that all settings have been specified correctly, perform the following steps:[anchor|#_36531b5b-bd53-4aeb-8af4-09409c06c5c3]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) form, create a new project transaction.
#In the Summary area, make sure that ''PM'' is selected in the '''Module''' box, and enter <tt>An 8-hour training session</tt> as the '''Description'''.
#Add a new line with the following settings:
#*'''Project''': ''HMBAKERY2''
#* '''Project Task''': ''TRAINING''
#* '''Account Group''': ''LABOR''
#* '''UOM''': ''HOUR''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>8.00</tt>
#*'''Unit Rate''': <tt>45.00</tt>
#Save your changes to the project transaction, and release it.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''HMBAKERY2'' project.
#On the '''Cost Budget''' tab, review the cost budget line with the ''PHASE3'' project task that you have added earlier in this activity. Notice that '''Actual Amount''' in this line is now ''360'' and the '''Actual Quantity''' is ''8'', meaning that the project transaction that you have processed has affected the cost budget (see the following screenshot).[anchor|#_207d65e2-df5d-4437-ab94-6f8ec1c1e17d][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_Project_Tasks.png|popup|The cost budget line affected by the project transaction|450px]
#On the '''Tasks''' tab, review the '''Completed (%)''' box in the line with the ''TRAINING'' task, and notice that 50% of the task has been completed.

Your organization may plan to perform projects that are similar to one another, and the projects may have tasks that are like other tasks in the same project or tasks in other projects. In this case, you can expedite the process of creating projects by using project and task templates. You can create any number of templates that include all the boilerplate parameters for all types of projects and for all types of tasks. {br}

This chapter describes how to configure project templates and common tasks, how to create a new project based on a project template, and how to create a project template based on the project.
==In This Chapter==
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Templates_GeneralInfo|Project Templates and Common Tasks: General Information]
*:In Acumatica ERP, you can create project templates from scratch by adding every detail that you think will be required for a typical project of specific type. Alternatively, you can create a template based on an existing project which you think is a typical representative of projects of specific type.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Templates_Config|Project Templates and Common Tasks: Configuration Prerequisites]
*:Before starting to create project templates and common tasks, you must be sure that the system has been configured in a proper way and all required entities have been created, as described in this topic.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Templates_Implem_Checklist|Project Templates and Common Tasks: Implementation Checklist]
*:To ensure that the system is configured properly for creating project templates and common tasks, make sure that the features and settings listed in the table are configured as described in the following table.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Templates_Process_HandsOn|Project Templates and Common Tasks: Process Activity]
*:The following hands-on exercise will walk you through the process of configuring project templates. You will create a common task and add this task to a project. A common task is a task that can be added to any project and that provides default settings, such as general, budget, and billing settings. You will also learn how to create a new project based on a project template, how to reestablish the budget structure of the project, and how to create a project template based on the project.

*Create a project template
*Create a common task
*Create a project based on the project template
*Add a task to the project by using the common task
*Restructure a budget before and after billing
*Create a new template from the project

==Applicable Scenarios==
You create project templates and common tasks if you need to ease the creation of typical projects and typical tasks for existing projects, respectively.
==Templates Created from Existing Projects==
You can create a template based on an existing project. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, select a project that is a typical project of specific type and click '''Create Template''' from the '''Actions''' menu. A template will be created with all the tasks that were included in the project. You can modify the created template as you want. You can delete some of the tasks and add new tasks.
==Templates from Scratch==
You can create project templates from scratch by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_00|Project Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) form. {br}

When you create a project template, you can specify as many settings as you want, including the following:[anchor|#ul_h3w_blj_jn]
*'''General information''': The broad information about the projects, including the default account and subaccount, default accrual account and subaccounts, and billing period. In the '''Status''' box, you can specify whether the specific project template is available for creating new projects. You can create projects only by using project templates with the ''Active'' status. 
*'''Visibility settings''': The list of functional areas where the projects based on this template will be visible.
*'''Template tasks''': The tasks to be included in the projects based on this template. Tasks for the project template can be added by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_10|Project Template Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208010|PM208010]) form.
*'''List of employees''': The employees who will work on the projects and the project manager who will be monitoring projects of the type. You also specify labor items and hourly rates for employees working on this project. Also, you can specify whether only the listed employees can work for the project.
*'''List of equipment''': The equipment to be used for the projects with appropriate non-stock items designating setup, run, and suspend rates and respective prices specific for projects of the type. You can specify whether only the listed equipment can be used for these projects.

==Template Tasks and Common Tasks==
A project template may include tasks that are actually templates of tasks that can be included in projects based on the template. You can add task templates to the project template. {br}

 You add the tasks to the project template and specify the settings for these tasks by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_10|Project Template Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208010|PM208010]) form. When you create a new template task, you can specify whether it is automatically included in all projects based on the project template. {br}

Template task settings include the following: [anchor|#ul_a5v_54s_mn]
*'''General settings''' are overall information about the task, including approver, tax category, default subaccount, and billing period. The general settings also include ''Visibility Settings'', the list of functional areas in which this project task must be visible. You can make tasks visible only in the functional areas in which the parent project is visible—the scope for the task cannot be wider than the scope for the project.
*'''Recurring billing''' can be used to implement the flat-price scenario with recurring payments when your future project uses flat rates for services or products you provide to your customer regularly. For more information about recurring billing, see [HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Billing_Project_Recurring_Billing|Project Billing: Recurring Billing].

When a user creates a new project based on a project template, the user can add to the new project any of the tasks associated with this project template and any of the existing common tasks. {br}

Common tasks are also templates of tasks, but they are not linked to any specific project template and, as such, can be added to any new or existing project. You can create common tasks with the help of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_30|Common Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208030|PM208030]) form. Generally, you provide the same types of settings for common tasks as for the template tasks: general, budget, and recurring billing settings. ]]></column>

==Story==
Suppose that the Lake Cafe customer has ordered a juicer, along with the following services: site review, installation, and training of employees on operating the juicer. The project accountant has analyzed the past projects and realized that customers are usually doing typical fixed-price projects that involve the sale of a juicer, along with the services of installation and site review. Sometimes customers&rsquo; projects also involve training on operating the juicer. {br}

The project accountant decides to create a new project template for such a project, and to create a common task for training on operating juicers (so the task can be quickly added to projects as needed). Then the project accountant creates a project for the customer based on the created project template and common task. During the lifecycle of a project, the project accountant adjusts the project budget structure and saves the list of budget revisions for the project.{br}

You will perform the needed actions in the system, acting as the project accountant.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Project Accounting'' feature has been enabled to support the project accounting functionality.
==Process Overview==
You create a project template on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_00|Project Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) form. You create a common task on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_30|Common Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208030|PM208030]) form. Then you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form to create a project based on the created project template and add the common task to the project. You adjust the project budget and save project budget revisions on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form.{br}

Finally, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form to initiate the creation of a project template based on a selected project. You complete the creation of a project template on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_00|Project Templates] form.
==System Preparation==
To sign in to the system and prepare to perform the instructions of the activity, do the following:[anchor|#_6c9e4914-0e56-4fc0-9f9d-df880dcd99b6]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the U100 dataset preloaded as Pam Brawner by using the ''brawner'' username and the ''123'' password.[anchor|#_f31605f4-a232-4fa2-9dd7-64fa3db8df97]
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select ''1/30/2020'' on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.

==Step 1. Creating a Project Template==
A project template is an entity that you select when creating a new project to auto-populate the budget, settings, and attributes of the project with default values that are appropriate for projects of the type. (You can override these values, if needed.) To create a new project template, do the following:[anchor|#_b82d266e-1e09-4588-a0b3-c9891941a196]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_00|Project Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) form, create a new project template with the following settings, as shown in the screenshot below:
#*'''Template ID''': <tt>INSTALL</tt>
#*'''Status''': ''Active''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Installation project</tt>
#*'''Summary''' tab:
#**'''Revenue Budget Level''' ('''Project Properties''' section): ''Task and Item''
#** '''Project Manager''' ('''Project Properties''' section): ''EP00000001 - Pam Brawner''
#** '''Billing Period''' ('''Billing and Allocation Settings''' section): ''On Demand''
#** '''Billing Rule''' ('''Billing and Allocation Settings''' section): ''COMBINED''[anchor|#image_alb_ppj_by][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_Templates.png|popup|Settings of the project template|450px]
#On the '''Tasks''' tab, add to the project each task listed in the following table by clicking '''Add Row''' and specifying the listed identifier and description in the row.
#:{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="50%" ! '''Task ID'''
!width="50%" !  '''Description'''
|- 
| <tt>PHASE 1</tt>
| <tt>Site review</tt>
|- 
| <tt>PHASE 2</tt>
| <tt>Installation</tt>
|}
#:By default, the system inserts ''By Billing Period'' as the '''Billing Option''' of each project task.
#On the '''Revenue Budget''' tab, add each line of the project revenue that is listed in the following table by clicking '''Add Row '''and specifying the listed settings in the row.
#:{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="25%" ! '''Project Task'''
!width="25%" !  '''Inventory ID'''
!width="25%" !  '''Original Budgeted Quantity'''
!width="25%" !  '''Unit Rate'''
|- 
|  ''PHASE 1''
|  ''SITEREVIEW''
| <tt>2.00</tt>
| <tt>50.00</tt>
|- 
| ''PHASE 2''
|  ''JUICER10''
| <tt>1.00</tt>
| <tt>1,500.00</tt>
|- 
| ''PHASE 2''
|  ''INSTALL''
| <tt>4.00</tt>
| <tt>100.00</tt>
|}
#:For each line, the system inserts ''REVENUE'' as the '''Account Group''' because the ''REVENUE'' account group is the only account group of the income type.
#Save your changes to the project template.
#:When you save the project template, the system automatically creates project template tasks corresponding to the tasks you have added to the project template.
#On the '''Tasks''' tab, in the '''Task ID''' column, click the ''PHASE 1'' link to open the task on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_10|Project Template Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208010|PM208010]) form.
#:On the '''Summary''' tab of this form, which the system has opened in a pop-up window, notice that the '''Automatically Include in Project''' check box is selected by default. (See the following screenshot.) With this setting, the project template task will be automatically included in any project created based on the associated project template.[anchor|#image_lbk_4pb_3cb][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_Templates2.png|popup|The project template task|450px]

You have created a project template and project template tasks. In the next step, you will create a common task.
==Step 2. Creating a Common Task==
A common task is a task that can be added to any new or existing project (unlike a project template task, which is associated with just one project template). To create a common task, perform the following instructions:[anchor|#_9f5808af-1653-4d47-98c6-e4c568c2872a]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_30|Common Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208030|PM208030]) form, create a new common task with the following settings:
#*'''Task ID''': <tt>TRAINING</tt>
#*'''Description''': <tt>Training on juicer usage</tt>
#On the '''Budget''' tab, add a budget line with the following settings, as shown in the screenshot below: 
#*'''Account Group''' ''LABOR''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''TRAINING''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Training on juicer usage</tt>
#*'''UOM''': ''HOUR''
#* '''Unit Rate''': <tt>50</tt>[anchor|#_30626444-24a9-494c-a379-f11ae3023182][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_Templates4.png|popup|The common task|450px]
#Save your changes to the common task.

You have created a common task. In the next step, you will create a project based on the project template you have created.
==Step 3. Creating a Project Based on the Project Template==
You can use the active template you have created to quickly create a new project based on this template. To create a project based on template, do the following:[anchor|#_e439e111-d177-4d9e-a954-236f391c4ce1]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, create a project, and specify the following settings: 
#*'''Project ID''': <tt>INSTLAKE</tt>
#*'''Customer''': ''LAKECAFE - Lake Cafe''
#* '''Template''': ''INSTALL - Installation project''
#:When you select the project template, the system fills in the relevant elements of the project with the settings specified for the template, including tasks and revenue budget lines.
#In the Summary area, enter <tt>Installation project for Lake Cafe</tt> as the '''Description''' of the project.
#On the table toolbar of the '''Tasks''' tab, click '''Activate Tasks''' to change the status of the added tasks to ''Active''.
#On the '''Revenue Budget''' tab, specify the settings in the following table as the revenue budget lines; these settings establish the original budgeted quantities of each task and inventory item.
#:{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="33%" ! '''Project Task'''
!width="33%" !  '''Inventory ID'''
!width="33%" !  '''Original Budgeted Quantity'''
|- 
|  ''PHASE 1''
|  ''SITEREVIEW''
| <tt>4.00</tt>
|- 
| ''PHASE 2''
|  ''INSTALL''
| <tt>8.00</tt>
|- 
| ''PHASE 2''
|  ''JUICER10''
| <tt>2.00</tt>
|}
#:When you enter the '''Original Budgeted Quantity''', the system automatically calculates the '''Original Budgeted Amount''' as the '''Original Budgeted Quantity''' multiplied by the '''Unit Rate'''.
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and save the project (which now has the ''Active'' status).

You have created the project based on the project template. In the next step, you will add the common task to the project.
==Step 4. Adding the Common Task to the Project==
The common task that you have created in this activity can be easily added to any project. To add it to the ''CUST1'' project, perform the following instruction:[anchor|#_d05565b0-3374-47f9-8664-70ae04d0cd95]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''INSTLAKE'' project.
#On the table toolbar of the '''Tasks''' tab, click '''Add Common Tasks'''.
#In the '''Add Tasks''' dialog box, which has opened in a pop-up window, all common tasks are listed. Select the check box in the unlabeled column for the line with the ''TRAINING'' common task, as shown in the following screenshot, and click '''Add Common Tasks'''.
#:The system adds the common task to the project and closes the dialog box.[anchor|#_e60cbc62-80f8-4443-a06c-42e15e4d0975][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_Templates6.png|popup|Selection of the common task for the project|300px]
#On the '''Tasks''' tab, select ''Active'' as the '''Status''' of the ''TRAINING'' task (which you just added).
#On the '''Cost Budget''' tab, make sure that the line with the ''TRAINING'' common task has been successfully added to the budget.
#Save your changes to the project.

You have added the common task to the project. In the next step, you will restructure the revenue budget of the project.
==Step 5. Restructuring the Project Budget==
Each particular project, even one based on a template, is unique and might require various changes. Also, the lifecycle of a project can lead to adjustments to your project budget structure and require you to store the list of budget revisions. To restructure the project budget and save the original version of the budget, do the following:[anchor|#_1216a88d-831f-4bdc-8268-3a784f5aaab3]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''INSTLAKE'' project.
#To create a backup of the original revenue budget of the project, do the following:
##On the table toolbar of the '''Revenue Budget''' tab, click '''Export to Excel''' ([image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_ExportToExcel.png|Selection of the common task for the project]).
##:The system exports the revenue budget to an Excel file.
##On your computer, locate the created file, and rename it to <tt>INSTLAKE&#95;Revenue&#95;Budget.xlsx</tt>.
#To attach to the project the file with the exported revenue budget, do the following:
##On the form title bar, click '''Files'''.
##In the '''Files''' dialog box, which has opened in a pop-up window, click '''Browse''', and open the <tt>INSTLAKE&#95;Revenue&#95;Budget.xlsx</tt> file.
##Click '''Upload''' to upload the selected file.
##:The system uploads the selected file to the project and shows the file in the table of the dialog box.
##In the line with the uploaded <tt>INSTLAKE&#95;Revenue&#95;Budget.xlsx</tt> file, click the ''Edit'' link, which is shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_ba0646d0-b3c9-4e97-81ab-26b6fe8550a9][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_Templates8.png|popup|Selection of the common task for the project|300px]
##:On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_10|File Maintenance] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202510|SM202510]) form, which has opened in a new tab, you can check the document revision, upload a new version of the document, or delete the document.
##On the '''Versions''' tab, enter <tt>The original revenue budget of the project</tt> in the '''Comment''' column for the uploaded file, as shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_9b62de61-3599-4dea-8056-3f7877e06eb2][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_Templates9.png|popup|The comment on the uploaded file|450px]
##Save your changes to the file.
#To upload a new revision of the revenue budget of the project to the file with the original revenue budget, do the following:
##On the form toolbar click '''Upload New Version'''.
##In the '''File Upload''' dialog box, which has opened in a pop-up window, click '''Choose File''', and open the <tt>INSTLAKE&#95;Revenue&#95;Budget&#95;1.xlsx</tt> file, which is provided with the training materials.
##Click '''Upload''' to upload the selected file.
##:The system uploads the selected file as a new file version and closes the dialog box.
##On the '''Versions''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_10|File Maintenance] form, enter <tt>Revision 1</tt> in the '''Comment''' column for the uploaded file with a '''Version ID''' of ''2'', as shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_3ffc85bf-013b-441e-8973-883ccf9fd3b5][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_Templates10.png|popup|A new revision of the uploaded file|450px]
##Save your changes to the file, and close the browser tab with the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_10|File Maintenance] form.
#Go back to the browser tab with the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, and close the '''Files''' dialog box.
#On the '''Revenue Budget''' tab, click the topmost line in the table, and on the table toolbar, click '''Delete Row''' ([image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_DeleteRow.png|A new revision of the uploaded file]). Repeat this for each revenue budget line until you have deleted all the revenue budget lines of the project.
#On the '''Summary''' tab ('''Project Properties''' section), select ''Task'' as the '''Revenue Budget Level'''.
#On the table toolbar of the '''Revenue Budget''' tab, click '''Load Records from File''' ([image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_LoadRecordsfromFile.png|A new revision of the uploaded file]), and upload the revenue budget from the <tt>INSTLAKE&#95;Revenue&#95;Budget&#95;1.xlsx</tt> file. While you are uploading the lines, leave the default column mapping.
#:The revenue budget of the project with the uploaded lines should look like the revenue budget shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#image_alb_zzj_by][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_Templates11.png|popup|The revenue budget of the project uploaded from the Excel file|450px]
#Save your changes to the project.

You have restructured the revenue budget of the project and attached budget revisions to the project. In the next step, you will bill the project.
==Step 6. Billing the Project==
To process the transactions of this project and bill the project, do the following:[anchor|#_aae7eb57-9fae-4f8a-9a1a-c76b6b817ea3]
#On the toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) form, click '''Add a New Record''' ([image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_AddNewRecord.png|The revenue budget of the project uploaded from the Excel file]) to create a new batch of transactions, and in the Summary area, specify <tt>The INSTLAKE project: training</tt> as the '''Description'''.
#On the table toolbar, click '''Load Records from File''' ([image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_LoadRecordsfromFile.png|The revenue budget of the project uploaded from the Excel file]), and upload the transactions from the <tt>INSTLAKE&#95;Project&#95;Transactions.xlsx</tt> file. While you are uploading the lines, leave the default column mapping.
#:The '''Total Amount''' in the Summary area of the form should be ''3,680.00''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save''' to save the project transactions, and then click '''Release''' to release them.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''INSTLAKE'' project, and make sure that the system has updated the cost budget of the project. The '''Expenses''' box in the Summary area of the form should now contain ''3,680.00''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Run Project Billing'''. The system has created a pro forma invoice, which should look like that shown in the following screenshot, and opened it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form.[anchor|#image_x3z_fcf_gcb][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_Templates12.png|popup|The pro forma invoice created during the billing|450px]
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and on the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the pro forma invoice. The system creates the accounts receivable invoice based on the pro forma invoice and assigns the ''Closed'' status to the pro forma invoice.
#On the '''Financial Details''' tab, click the link in the '''AR Ref. Nbr.''' box to open the created accounts receivable invoice.
#In the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form, which the system has opened in a pop-up window, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and on the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the accounts receivable invoice.

You have billed the project. In the next step, you will restructure the revenue budget of the project again.
==Step 7. Restructuring the Project Budget After Billing==
Suppose that after the billing you realized that you needed an extra level of detail of the revenue budget. To perform one more budget revision after billing, do the following:[anchor|#_de8ae040-9872-409a-8394-4859807e3506]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''INSTLAKE'' project.
#To create a backup of the current revision of the revenue budget of the project, do the following:

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Project Templates and Common Tasks: Process Activity The following                 h ands-on                 exercis e will walk you through the process of configuring project                 templates. You will create a common task and add this task to a project. A common                 task is a task that can be added to any project and that provides default settings,                 such as general, budget, and billing settings. You will also learn how to create a                 new project based on a project template, how to reestablish the budget structure of                 the project, and how to create a project template based on the project. The following activity is             based on the  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system             settings have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the             activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100              dataset to its initial state. Story Suppose that the Lake Cafe customer has ordered a juicer, along with the following                 services: site review, installation, and training of employees on operating the                 juicer. The project accountant has analyzed the past projects and realized that                 customers are usually doing typical fixed-price projects that involve the sale of a                 juicer, along with the services of installation and site review. Sometimes                 customers' projects also involve training on operating the juicer.  The project accountant decides to create a new project template for such a project,                 and to create a common task for training on operating juicers (so the task can be                 quickly added to projects as needed). Then the project accountant creates a project                 for the customer based on the created project template and common task.                  During                 the lifecycle of a project, the project accountant adjusts the project budget                 structure and saves the list of budget revisions for the                 project. You will perform the needed actions in the system, acting as the project                 accountant. Configuration Overview For the purposes of this activity, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000)                 form, the  Project Accounting  feature has been enabled to support the project                 accounting functionality. Process Overview You create a project template on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) Project Templates (PM208000) form.                 You create a common task on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM208030|PM208030]) Common Tasks (PM208030) form.                 Then you use the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form to create a project                 based on the created project template and add the common task to the project. You                 adjust the project budget and save project budget revisions on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form. Finally, you use the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form to initiate the creation of                 a project template based on a selected project. You complete the creation of a                 project template on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) Project Templates form. System Preparation To sign in to the system and prepare to perform the instructions of the activity, do                 the following: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the U100 dataset preloaded as Pam                     Brawner by using the  brawner  username and the  123  password. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP             screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to  1/30/2020. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and             select  1/30/2020 on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and             process all documents in the system during this business date. Step 1. Creating a Project Template A project template is an entity that you select when creating a new project to                 auto-populate the budget, settings, and attributes of the project with default                 values that are appropriate for projects of the type. (You can override these                 values, if needed.) To create a new project template, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) Project Templates (PM208000) form, create a new project                     template with the following settings, as shown in the screenshot below: Template ID :  INSTALL Status :  Active Description :  Installation                                 project Summary  tab: Revenue Budget Level  ( Project                                         Properties  section):  Task and Item Project Manager  ( Project                                         Properties  section):  EP00000001 - Pam                                         Brawner Billing Period  ( Billing and                                         Allocation Settings  section):  On                                     Demand Billing Rule  ( Billing and                                         Allocation Settings  section):                                      COMBINED Settings of the project template On the  Tasks  tab, add to the project each task listed in                     the following table by clicking  Add Row  and specifying                     the listed identifier and description in the row. Task ID Description PHASE 1 Site review PHASE 2 Installation By default, the system inserts  By Billing Period  as the                              Billing Option  of each project task. On the  Revenue Budget  tab, add each line of the project                     revenue that is listed in the following table by clicking  Add Row                      and specifying the listed settings in the row. Project Task Inventory ID Original Budgeted Quantity Unit Rate PHASE 1 SITEREVIEW 2.00 50.00 PHASE 2 JUICER10 1.00 1,500.00 PHASE 2 INSTALL 4.00 100.00 For each line, the system inserts  REVENUE  as the                              Account Group  because the  REVENUE  account                         group is the only account group of the income type. Save your changes to the project template. When you save the project template,                         the system automatically creates project template tasks corresponding to the                         tasks you have added to the project template. On the  Tasks  tab, in the  Task ID                      column, click the  PHASE 1  link to open the task on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM208010|PM208010]) Project Template Tasks (PM208010) form. On the                              Summary  tab of this form, which the system has                         opened in a pop-up window, notice that the  Automatically Include                             in Project  check box is selected by default. (See the                         following screenshot.) With this setting, the project template task will be                         automatically included in any project created based on the associated                         project template. The project template task You have created a project template and project template tasks. In the next step, you                 will create a common task. Step 2. Creating a Common Task A common task is a task that can be added to any new or existing project (unlike a                 project template task, which is associated with just one project template). To                 create a common task, perform the following instructions: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM208030|PM208030]) Common Tasks (PM208030) form, create a new common task                     with the following settings: Task ID :  TRAINING Description :  Training on juicer                                 usage On the  Budget  tab, add a budget line with the following                     settings, as shown in the screenshot below:  Account Group LABOR Inventory ID :  TRAINING Description :  Training on juicer                                 usage UOM :  HOUR Unit Rate :  50 The common task Save your changes to the common task. You have created a common task. In the next step, you will create a project based on                 the project template you have created. Step 3. Creating a Project Based on the Project Template You can use the active template you have created to quickly create a new project                 based on this template. To create a project based on template, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, create a project, and                     specify the following settings:  Project ID :  INSTLAKE Customer :  LAKECAFE - Lake Cafe Template :  INSTALL - Installation                             project When you select the project template, the system fills in the relevant                         elements of the project with the settings specified for the template,                         including tasks and revenue budget lines. In the Summary area, enter  Installation project for Lake                         Cafe  as the  Description  of the                     project. On the table toolbar of the  Tasks  tab, click                          Activate Tasks  to change the status of the added                     tasks to  Active . On the  Revenue Budget  tab, specify the settings in the                     following table as the revenue budget lines; these settings establish the                     original budgeted quantities of each task and inventory item. Project Task Inventory ID Original Budgeted Quantity PHASE 1 SITEREVIEW 4.00 PHASE 2 INSTALL 8.00 PHASE 2 JUICER10 2.00 When you enter the  Original Budgeted Quantity ,                         the system automatically calculates the  Original Budgeted                             Amount  as the  Original Budgeted                             Quantity  multiplied by the  Unit                         Rate . In the Summary area, clear the  Hold  check box, and save                     the project (which now has the  Active  status). You have created the project based on the project template. In the next step, you                 will add the common task to the project. Step 4. Adding the Common Task to the Project The common task that you have created in this activity can be easily added to any                 project. To add it to the  CUST1  project, perform the following                 instruction: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, open the  INSTLAKE                      project. On the table toolbar of the  Tasks  tab, click                          Add Common Tasks . In the  Add Tasks  dialog box, which has opened in a pop-up                     window, all common tasks are listed. Select the check box in the unlabeled                     column for the line with the  TRAINING  common task, as shown in the                     following screenshot, and click  Add Common Tasks . The                         system adds the common task to the project and closes the dialog                         box. Selection of the common task for the project On the  Tasks  tab, select  Active  as the                          Status  of the  TRAINING  task (which you just                     added). On the  Cost Budget  tab, make sure that the line with the                          TRAINING  common task has been successfully added to the budget. Save your changes to the project. You have added the common task to the project. In the next step, you will restructure                 the revenue budget of the project. Step 5. Restructuring the Project Budget Each particular project, even one based on a template, is unique and might require                 various changes. Also, the lifecycle of a project can lead to adjustments to your                 project budget structure and require you to store the list of budget revisions. To                 restructure the project budget and save the original version of the budget, do the                 following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, open the  INSTLAKE                      project. To create a backup of the original revenue budget of the project, do the                         following: On the table toolbar of the  Revenue Budget  tab,                             click  Export to Excel  ( ). The system exports                                 the revenue budget to an Excel file. On your computer, locate the created file, and rename it to                                  INSTLAKE_Revenue_Budget.xlsx . To attach to the project the file with the exported revenue budget, do the                         following: On the form title bar, click  Files . In the  Files  dialog box, which has opened in a                             pop-up window, click  Browse , and open the                                  INSTLAKE_Revenue_Budget.xlsx  file. Click  Upload  to upload the selected file. The                                 system uploads the selected file to the project and shows the file                                 in the table of the dialog box. In the line with the uploaded                                  INSTLAKE_Revenue_Budget.xlsx  file, click the                                  Edit  link, which is shown in the following screenshot. Selection of the common task for the project On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202510|SM202510]) File Maintenance (SM202510) form, which                                 has opened in a new tab, you can check the document revision, upload                                 a new version of the document, or delete the document. On the  Versions  tab, enter  The                                 original revenue budget of the project  in the                                  Comment  column for the uploaded file, as                             shown in the following screenshot. The comment on the uploaded file Save your changes to the file. To upload a new revision of the revenue budget of the project to the file with                     the original revenue budget, do the following: On the form toolbar click  Upload New                             Version . In the  File Upload  dialog box, which has opened                             in a pop-up window, click  Choose File , and open                             the  INSTLAKE_Revenue_Budget_1.xlsx  file, which is                             provided with the training materials. Click  Upload  to upload the selected file. The                                 system uploads the selected file as a new file version and closes                                 the dialog box. On the  Versions  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202510|SM202510]) File Maintenance form, enter  Revision                                 1  in the  Comment  column for the                             uploaded file with a  Version ID  of  2 , as                             shown in the following screenshot. A new revision of the uploaded file Save your changes to the file, and close the browser tab with the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202510|SM202510]) File Maintenance form. Go back to the browser tab with the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, and                     close the  Files  dialog box. On the  Revenue Budget  tab, click the topmost line in the                     table, and on the table toolbar, click  Delete Row  ( ). Repeat this for each revenue                     budget line until you have deleted all the revenue budget lines of the                     project. On the  Summary  tab ( Project                         Properties  section), select  Task  as the                          Revenue Budget Level . On the table toolbar of the  Revenue Budget  tab, click                          Load Records from File  ( ), and upload the revenue budget from the                          INSTLAKE_Revenue_Budget_1.xlsx  file. While you are                     uploading the lines, leave the default column mapping. The revenue budget of                         the project with the uploaded lines should look like the revenue budget                         shown in the following screenshot. The revenue budget of the project uploaded from the Excel                             file Save your changes to the project. You have restructured the revenue budget of the project and attached budget revisions                 to the project. In the next step, you will bill the project. Step 6. Billing the Project To process the transactions of this project and bill the project, do the                 following: On the toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) Project Transactions (PM304000) form, click                          Add a New Record  ( ) to create a new batch of                     transactions, and in the Summary area, specify  The INSTLAKE project:                         training  as the  Description . On the table toolbar, click  Load Records from File                          ( ), and upload the transactions from the                          INSTLAKE_Project_Transactions.xlsx  file. While you are                     uploading the lines, leave the default column mapping. The  Total                             Amount  in the Summary area of the form should be                              3,680.00 . On the form toolbar, click  Save  to save the project                     transactions, and then click  Release  to release                     them. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, open the  INSTLAKE                      project, and make sure that the system has updated the cost budget of the                     project. The  Expenses  box in the Summary area of the form                     should now contain  3,680.00 . On the form toolbar, click  Run Project Billing . The                     system has created a pro forma invoice, which should look like that shown in the                     following screenshot, and opened it on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices                     (PM307000) form.

Employees&rsquo; reported time will be tracked in the project and billed automatically when project billing is run. {br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to configure the system so that employee time can be tracked for individual projects. In particular, you will do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Prepare the system for the configuration of time tracking
*Enable the needed system features
*Specify the minimum required configuration so that time cards (and time activities, if applicable) can be used to track employee time spent for a project
[anchor|#section_adl_lp2_dmb]
==Applicable Scenarios==
When you are initially configuring accounting for projects, you configure time tracking if your organization is going to bill the customers for the for the time employees spend working on any projects.[anchor|#section_zhk_d3w_2mb]
==Time Tracking with Time Cards in Projects==
If time tracking is in use in your organization, the time the employees spend on daily activities is recorded in time cards to track the expenses. A time card is a weekly report on the time an employee has spent each day on particular activities, including project-related ones. If time tracking is configured for use with projects, the time reported by employees is logged to the related project (or to the non-project code if no project is involved). The employee time logged to a particular project is billed during the project billing procedure. {br}

When a time card that includes project-related activities is released, for each line of a time card that relates to a project, the system retrieves the labor cost rate at which the employee&rsquo;s labor is billed and generates the corresponding project transaction. The project transaction affects the cost budget of the related project: The system either updates the actual amount and quantity of the existing line or adds a new cost budget line with the incurred costs. Further, this project transaction is billed according to the billing rule specified for the corresponding project task.[anchor|#section_mwn_sdb_xmb]
==Time Tracking with Time Activities in Projects==
You can configure the system so that an employee will report working hours by using time cards in combination with time activities. The information from time activities entered by employee is then copied to the employee time card that relates to the week that includes a date for which the time activity has been entered. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Projects\config_Project_Time_Tracking_TimeActivities|Time Tracking Configuration: Tracking Time with Time Activities].
==Workflow of the Time Tracking Implementation==
To prepare the system for time reporting for projects, you perform the following general steps:[anchor|#_e0ff54a2-6ece-47ee-afb6-b5b1baf1fea9]
#You specify the minimum required configuration for time reporting, as demonstrated in the [HelpRoot_Projects\config_Project_Time_Tracking_Implem_Activity|Time Tracking Configuration: To Configure Time Tracking in Projects].
#Optionally, you configure time tracking with time activities, as illustrated in the [HelpRoot_Projects\config_Project_Time_Tracking_Implem_Activity2|Time Tracking Configuration: To Track Time with Time Activities].
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, you define labor non-stock items that correspond to the services provided by employees; then on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form, you assign the labor items to the employees who will perform those types of labor. For an example of the creation of labor items, see [HelpRoot_Projects\Non_Stock_Item_Projects_Implem_Activity|Labor Items: To Configure a Labor Item].
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_99_00|Labor Cost Rates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209900|PM209900]) form, you define labor cost rates that are specific to employees, projects, and project tasks. For an example of this task being performed, see [HelpRoot_Projects\Non_Stock_Item_Projects_Implem_Activity_LaborCostRates|Labor Items: To Define Labor Cost Rates].
#You configure the basic project accounting settings, as demonstrated in the [HelpRoot_Projects\config_Project_Basic_Implem_Activity|Project Basic Configuration: Implementation Activity].

After you perform the basic time tracking configuration, employees will be able to log project-related work by using time cards (and, optionally, time activities).]]></column>

The following section explains how to configure the system to track time spent on project by using time activities that an employee enters on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_10|Activity] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306010|CR306010]) form to record the provided services.[anchor|#section_qkg_g12_fmb]
==Combining of Time Cards and Time Activities==
In Acumatica ERP, an employee can report working hours by using time cards in combination with time activities. If tracking of time with time activities is configured in the system, the '''Track Time''' check box becomes available in a time activity on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_10|Activity] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306010|CR306010]) form; in each activity an employee provides the description of the performed services and report working hours spent on these services. The reported data from a time activity is then copied to the employee time card that relates to the week that includes a date for which the time activity has been entered. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_50_00|Employee Time Card] ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]) form, the employee can view the details of all time activities associated with a particular time card. {br}

A time activity can be released individually, or within the time card to which it is added. When the time card is released, all the associated time activities are released automatically. For time activities associated with a project, a project transaction is created during time card release. During the project billing procedure, based on the time and material step of the billing rule configured for the account group associated with this project transaction, the applicable customer is billed for the reported employee time spent on the project. 
==Configuration of Time Tracking with Time Activities==
To configure the tracking of time with time activities, you perform the following general steps:[anchor|#_52a4cfb0-43fb-4512-aff3-1fe00dcecbb7]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you enable the ''Time Reporting on Activity'' feature.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_10_20_00|Earning Types] ([~/?ScreenId=EP102000|EP102000]) form, you select the '''Billable''' check box for the earning types that will be specified in the time activities that must be billed within a project. The earning type determines how the system calculates the cost of employee labor.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_10_20_00|Activity Types] ([~/?ScreenId=CR102000|CR102000]) form, you select the '''Track Time''' check box for the activity types for which you want to track time. In the newly entered time activities of the type, the '''Track Time''' check box will be selected by default.

After you perform these configuration steps, employees will be able to log project work and specify the information required for billing (that is, the earning type for the time activity, and the total billable time spent on a particular project).]]></column>

==In This Chapter==
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Non_Stock_Item_Projects_GeneralInfo|Labor Items: General Information]
*:Among other items your company sells, it may sell the labor of its employees. In Acumatica ERP, you can define a certain type of labor available for sale (that is, a type performed regularly by your company) by creating a labor item. A labor item is a non-stock item containing information that includes the default price and the sales account to be used for transactions. Labor items are used in projects for recording information on the hourly rates of the applicable employees, the GL accounts used for tracking labor in projects, and the taxes that apply to this labor.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Non_Stock_Items_Projects_Billing_Rules|Labor Items: Rules of Billing]
*:If the ''Time Reporting on Activity'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can bill projects for employee time spent on work provided for these projects. The system uses data from labor items for each invoice that the system generates when a time activity or case has been billed. The following sections explain in which order the system selects the labor items for activity billing and case billing.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Non_Stock_Item_Projects_Config_Prereq|Labor Items: Configuration Prerequisites]
*:Before starting to create labor items, you must be sure that the system has been configured properly and that all required entities have been created, as described in the following sections.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Non_Stock_Item_Projects_Implem_Activity|Labor Items: To Configure a Labor Item]
*:The following activity will walk you through the process of configuring a labor non-stock item that will then be used for billing employee labor within projects.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Non_Stock_Item_Projects_Labor_Costs|Labor Items: Labor Cost Rates in Projects]
*:On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_99_00|Labor Cost Rates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209900|PM209900]) form, you can define labor cost rates that are specific to particular entities, such as the employee, labor item, project, and project task.

Among other items your company sells, it may sell the labor of its employees. In Acumatica ERP, you can define a certain type of labor available for sale (that is, a type performed regularly by your company) by creating a labor item. A labor item is a non-stock item containing information that includes the default price and the sales account to be used for transactions. Labor items are used in projects for recording information on the hourly rates of the applicable employees, the GL accounts used for tracking labor in projects, and the taxes that apply to this labor. {br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#_ad1cb001-77e5-4905-8726-4c48f1400218]
*Prepare the system for the configuration of labor items
*Create a new labor item
*Assign a labor item to an employee
*Configure labor cost rates for an employee

==Applicable Scenarios==
You may need to create a labor item in any of the following cases:[anchor|#_6d7f8545-8117-49a0-87c8-6c56b6eb3a5b]
*When you are going to track the cost of employees&rsquo; labor in a particular project
*When you need to sell the same type of labor at different prices
*When you are going to add a new type of expenses to projects

==Labor Item Settings==
Non-stock items of the ''Labor'' type are used as a source of general ledger accounts for transactions that the system generates in the process of project billing. {br}

You create labor items and maintain information about their properties by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. On this form, you can enter and maintain a variety of settings for a labor item, including the following: [anchor|#ul_aq5_rtp_jq]
*The identifier: To every labor item you assign a unique identifier (in the '''Inventory ID''' box of the Summary area) based on the ''INVENTORY'' segmented key. If you need to change the ID of an existing non-stock item (that is, one that has already been saved), you can click '''Actions''' > '''Change ID''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form.
*The item type: The item type is selected in the '''Type''' box of the '''General Settings''' tab ('''Item Defaults''' section). When creating a labor item, you select the ''Labor'' item type.
*The valuation method: When you select the ''Labor'' type for the item, ''Standard Cost'' is inserted in the '''Cost Based On''' box of the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab ('''Cost Accrual''' section).
*Units of measure: For each labor item, in the '''Unit of Measure''' section of the '''General Settings''' tab, you can select the unit of measure (UOM) used as the base unit for the item.
*General ledger accounts: Each labor item must have the expense account specified on the '''GL Accounts''' tab; the expense account must be mapped to the appropriate account group. If needed, you can also specify sales and expense accrual accounts. 
*Price information: On the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab, you can specify settings related to the price and cost of the item, including the default price defined for a labor item (in the '''Default Price''' box of the '''Price Management''' section), which is used as the unit rate in the revenue budget lines.

To ensure that the system will be able to obtain the required settings from each labor item when an invoice is generated, you need to associate this labor item with the appropriate entity (that is, an employee, a case, a project, or a contract), which may depend on the type of the billing process that you use. If no labor items are specified for the entities associated with the invoice, the system will not generate the invoice.
==Labor Items in Time Cards==
You can use time tracking for your activities to facilitate the process of labor tracking and costing. For instance, with time activities, you can bill projects based on the billable time spent on related activities. In Acumatica ERP, to account for work hours and overtime hours spent on projects, employees use time cards. To calculate the cost of labor, the system uses the labor cost rates defined for each employee on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_99_00|Labor Cost Rates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209900|PM209900]) form. The cost of overtime labor is calculated based on the employee work hour rates multiplied by the factor specified in the '''Multiplier''' column of the ''Overtime'' earning type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_10_20_00|Earning Types] ([~/?ScreenId=EP102000|EP102000]) form.

If the ''Time Reporting on Activity'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can bill projects for employee time spent on work provided for these projects. The system uses data from labor items for each invoice that the system generates when a time activity or case has been billed. The following sections explain in which order the system selects the labor items for activity billing and case billing.{br}{TOC}
==Time Activity Billing==
When time activities, which are created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_70_00|Employee Time Activities] ([~/?ScreenId=EP307000|EP307000]) form, are being billed, the system determines the labor item to be used in the invoice and inserts it automatically in each applicable line of the invoice on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form. The system uses the first labor item that it finds in a search of the following places in the system (listed in the order in which the system searches the location for a labor item value):[anchor|#_98f1f9fd-3deb-4c53-8890-a7de75da0de8]
#The '''Employees''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form for the project associated with the activity being billed, in the '''Labor Item''' column of the '''Overrides''' table for the employee who is the owner of the activity being billed. This table contains a list of labor items for a particular employee associated with the project, with one specific labor item for each earning type of the particular activity. 
#The '''Labor Item Overrides''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form for the employee who is the owner of the activity being billed. In the table on this tab, a specific labor item can be specified for each earning type. 
#The '''General Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form for the employee who is the owner of the activity being billed: On this tab, a labor item can be specified that is to be used for the employee regardless of the earning type of the particular activity.

==Case Billing==
During the billing of a case that has been created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_00|Cases] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306000|CR306000]) form, the system determines the labor item to be used in the invoice and inserts it automatically in the invoice line. For the cases whose case class has the ''Per Case'' billing mode specified, the system always uses the labor item and overtime labor item specified on the '''Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_60_00|Case Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR206000|CR206000]) form.{br}

For cases whose case class uses the ''Per Activity'' billing mode, the system uses the first labor item that it finds in a search of the following places in the system (listed in the order in which the system searches the location for a labor item values; the search ends when the system finds a value):[anchor|#ol_f1b_pkc_jq]
#The '''Labor Items''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_60_00|Case Classes] form for the case class of the case being billed. In the table on this tab, a labor item can be specified for each earning type; the listed labor items and earning types are not associated with any specific employee. If a row with the earning type of the activity is specified on this tab, the same default price and the same sales account (those specified for the labor item) are used for all case-related activities of the class with the same earning type, regardless of their owner.
#The '''Employee Override''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CT_30_10_00|Customer Contracts] ([~/?ScreenId=CT301000|CT301000]) form for the contract specified for the case being billed. In the table on the '''Employee Override''' tab, a specific labor item can be specified for a particular employee (selected in the '''Employee''' column) related to the contract. The table can also include a row with ''All Employees'' selected in the '''Employee''' column and a particular labor item that will be used for all other employees. Additionally, on this tab, a separate labor item can be specified for each earning type. 
#The '''Employees''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form for the project associated with the activities related to the case being billed, in the '''Labor Item''' column of the '''Overrides''' table for the employee who is the owner of the activity being billed. This table contains a list of labor items can be specified for each particular employee associated with the project, with one specific labor item for each earning type. 
#The '''Labor Item Overrides''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form for the employee who is the owner of the activities related to the case being billed. In the table on this tab, a specific labor item can be specified for each earning type for the employee. 
#The '''General Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form for the employee who is the owner of the activities related to the case being billed. On this tab, a labor item can be specified that is to be used for the employee regardless of the earning type of the particular activity.

Before starting to create labor items, you must be sure that the system has been configured properly and that all required entities have been created, as described in the following sections.{br}{TOC}
==Enabling the Needed Features==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Projects'' feature must be enabled.
==Configuring the System==
You need to make sure the following tasks have been performed in Acumatica ERP before you begin creating labor items for projects:[anchor|#_e153756e-f2d7-4f8f-9f6f-3fb0ba37b502]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form, the basic project accounting settings have been specified: numbering sequences, non-project code, visibility settings, and posting settings. The actual combination of settings you need to specify depends on the processes in your organization and on the features enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. For details, see [HelpRoot_Projects\config_Project_Basic_Implem_Activity|Project Basic Configuration: Implementation Activity].
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_10_00|Account Groups] ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) form, the GL accounts used for labor items have been mapped to appropriate account groups. (Otherwise, the transactions related to labor on projects will not be visible in projects.) For details on configuring account groups, see [HelpRoot_Projects\Account_Groups_Implem_Activity|Account Groups: Implementation Activity].
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) form, all necessary system-wide units of measure that you will use for labor items have been added. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\UOMs_Mapref|Creating Units of Measure].
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\TX_20_55_00|Tax Categories] ([~/?ScreenId=TX205500|TX205500]) form, the necessary tax categories have been created.

==Configuring Posting Classes==
If the ''Inventory and Order Management'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form in your system, a posting class must be specified in non-stock item you create, including each labor item. Before you create labor items, make sure that on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) form, the necessary posting classes have been created. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Posting_Classes_Mapref|Creating Posting Classes].
==Configuring Labor Item Identifiers==
The ''INVENTORY'' segmented key on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form defines the structure of the identifiers of non-stock items. By default, this segmented key specifies that the item identifier is an alphanumeric string of up to 10 characters. For the key, you can define how many segments it is to have, what values may be used, whether these values should be validated, and whether auto-numbering should be used in one of the segments. You can also divide item identifiers into segments with specific values.

Enabling the Needed Features On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, the  Projects  feature must be         enabled. Configuring the System You need to make sure the following tasks have been performed in  Acumatica ERP before you begin creating labor items for projects: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form, the basic project accounting           settings have been specified: numbering sequences, non-project code, visibility settings,           and posting settings. The actual combination of settings you need to specify depends on           the processes in your organization and on the features enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. For details, see  Project Basic Configuration: Implementation Activity. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) Account Groups (PM201000) form, the GL accounts used for labor           items have been mapped to appropriate account groups. (Otherwise, the transactions related           to labor on projects will not be visible in projects.) For details on configuring account           groups, see  Account Groups: Implementation Activity. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) Units of Measure (CS203100) form, all necessary system-wide units           of measure that you will use for labor items have been added. For details, see  Creating Units of Measure. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=TX205500|TX205500]) Tax Categories (TX205500) form, the necessary tax categories           have been created. Configuring Posting Classes If the  Inventory and Order Management  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form in your system, a posting class must be         specified in non-stock item you create, including each labor item. Before you create labor         items, make sure that on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) Posting Classes (IN206000) form, the necessary         posting classes have been created. For details, see  Creating Posting Classes. Configuring Labor Item Identifiers The  INVENTORY  segmented key on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) Segmented Keys (CS202000) form         defines the structure of the identifiers of non-stock items. By default, this segmented key         specifies that the item identifier is an alphanumeric string of up to 10 characters. For the         key, you can define how many segments it is to have, what values may be used, whether these         values should be validated, and whether auto-numbering should be used in one of the         segments. You can also divide item identifiers into segments with specific values. For more         information on configuring segmented keys, see  Segmented Identifiers. ]]></column>

))){br}{TOC}
==Story==
Suppose that you, as a project accountant, are updating the system configuration for the SweetLife Fruit & Jams company. To be able to bill the customers for the provided labor within the projects, you need to create a labor item that will represent the maintenance services provided by a particular employee, Eric Killian, to SweetLife&rsquo;s customers who have purchased juicers. 
==Process Overview==
You will create a non-stock item representing the maintenance labor on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form and specify the item’s settings, including the expense account that has been mapped to an appropriate account group. You will also specify the default price for the item. Then on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form, you will assign this labor item to the employee who will perform maintenance work.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Project Accounting'' feature has been enabled to support the project accounting functionality.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_20_25_00|Chart of Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=GL202500|GL202500]) form, the ''54500 – Maintenance Expenses'' account has been defined and mapped to the ''MAINTSERV'' account group, which has been configured on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_10_00|Account Groups] ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) form.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) form, the ''NONSTOCK'' posting class has been configured.
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form, the ''EP00000006 – Eric Killian'' employee record has been created.
==System Preparation==
To prepare to perform the steps of the activity, you need to sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded as Pam Brawner, a project accountant, by using the ''brawner'' username and the ''123'' password.
==Step 1: Creating the Labor Item==
To create the labor item that will be used to represent maintenance services, perform the following instructions:[anchor|#_46d95757-01ae-4b52-8328-3485f456c18d]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, click '''Add New Record''' on the form toolbar, and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Inventory ID''': <tt>MAINTSERV</tt>
#*'''Description''': <tt>Juicer maintenance service</tt>
#On the '''General Settings tab''', specify the following settings:
#*'''Type''': ''Labor''
#* '''Posting Class''': ''NONSTOCK''
#*:Based on the settings of the ''NONSTOCK'' posting class, the system will use the GL accounts specified for the inventory item.
#*'''Tax Category''': ''EXEMPT''
#* '''Base Unit''': ''HOUR''
#* '''Sales Unit''': ''HOUR''
#* '''Purchase Unit''': ''HOUR''
#In the '''Default Price''' box on the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab, enter <tt>80</tt>.
#On the '''GL Accounts''' tab, specify the following accounts:
#*'''Expense Accrual Account''': ''11010 – AR Accrual Account''
#* '''Expense Account''': ''54500 - Maintenance Expenses''
#* '''Sales Account''': ''40000 – Sales Revenue''
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

==Step 2: Assigning the Labor Item to an Employee==
To assign the labor item you have created to the employee who will perform the labor, perform the following instructions:[anchor|#_bf23f24f-a307-4410-b167-dbf57024334e]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form, open the ''EP00000006 – Eric Killian'' employee record.
#In the '''Labor Item''' box on the '''General Info''' tab, select ''MAINTSERV''.
#Save your changes to the employee record.

You have created the labor item to be used for maintenance service and specified an expense account that is mapped to a particular account group. You also have associated this labor item with the particular employee who will perform this work. Now you can proceed with specifying labor cost rates for the employee, as described in [HelpRoot_Projects\Non_Stock_Item_Projects_Implem_Activity_LaborCostRates|Labor Items: To Define Labor Cost Rates],]]></column>

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
In Acumatica ERP, you can define labor rates that are used to determine the cost of employee time spent on a particular project, and bill the customers based on this cost. The following sections explain how the project-specific labor cost rates are specified and retrieved in projects.
==Creation of Labor Cost Rates==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_99_00|Labor Cost Rates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209900|PM209900]) form, you can define labor cost rates that are specific to particular entities, such as the employee, labor item, project, and project task. {br}

When you define a labor cost rate, you specify its type, the rate, and an optional description and external reference number of the rate. Based on the type you select, particular columns become available so you can specify the particular entity the rate applies to and other relevant details. In the '''Type''' column of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_99_00|Labor Cost Rates] form, you select one of the following options:[anchor|#_12cb5eb1-8dd1-4fd2-93eb-3934cb7e894c]
*''Labor Item'': If you select this type, in the row, you must also select the labor item and the rate.
*''Employee'': If you select this type, in the row, you must select the employee and the rate; optionally, you can also select a particular labor item to which the rate applies.
*''Project'': If you select this type, in the row, you must select the project and the rate. Optionally, you can select any of the following to which the rate applies: the project task, the employee, and the labor item.

For each labor cost rate, regardless of its type, you specify the effective date. If there are multiple labor cost rates with the same settings, the system uses the rate with the most recent effective date that precedes the current date. You can also create a labor cost rate with the same settings as an existing labor cost rate but with an effective date that is later than the latest effective date of the existing labor cost rate.[anchor|#_39bef90a-5d37-4004-b28e-f3669a65e8c8]
==Units Of Measure in Labor Cost Rates==
When you specify the rate for a row with a labor item selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_99_00|Labor Cost Rates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209900|PM209900]) form, you specify the rate for the base unit of measure (UOM) of the labor item. The base UOM of the labor item should be convertible into minutes so that the system can convert the base UOM to a minute. That is, there should be conversion rules from a minute to the base UOM and from the base UOM to a minute on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) form.{br}

When you create a labor cost rate for a labor item with a base UOM that is not an hour, make sure that you enter the rate for the base UOM of the labor item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_99_00|Labor Cost Rates] form so that the system calculates the correct amount when a time activity with this labor item is released.{br}

For example, suppose that you have the ''TRAINING'' labor item, whose base UOM is ''UNIT''. According to the conversion rules specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) form, one unit equals four hours. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_99_00|Labor Cost Rates] form, when you add a labor cost rate with an employee and the ''TRAINING'' labor item, you should specify the rate in the base UOM, which is ''UNIT''. When the employee enters a time card on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_50_00|Employee Time Card] ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]) form and in a time activity on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_10|Activity] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306010|CR306010]) form selects the ''TRAINING'' labor item, the time is reported in hours even though the base UOM of the selected item is not an hour. When the time card with the corresponding time activities is released, the system generates a project transaction with the ''TRAINING'' labor item in the base UOM of the item. If the employee has reported eight hours, the project transaction will contain two ''TRAINING'' units.
==Retrieval of Labor Cost Rates==
When you create a time card on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_50_00|Employee Time Card] ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]) form, for each line, you select the employee, project, project task, labor item, and date. For each time card line, the system retrieves the most appropriate labor cost rate from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_99_00|Labor Cost Rates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209900|PM209900]) form. The system selects the most specific existing labor cost rate among the defined labor cost rates that matches all the settings specified in the time card line. The system looks for the following sets of settings that match the time card settings and uses the first set it finds:[anchor|#_ec226c69-4ac9-47ce-8421-032722a7c68e]
*The ''Project'' rate type, project, project task, employee, labor item, and effective date
*The ''Project'' rate type, project, project task, employee, and effective date
*The ''Project'' rate type, project, project task, labor item, and effective date
*The ''Project'' rate type, project, project task, and effective date
*The ''Project'' rate type, project, employee, labor item, and effective date
*The ''Project'' rate type, project, employee, and effective date
*The ''Project'' rate type, project, labor item, and effective date
*The ''Project'' rate type, project, and effective date
*The ''Employee'' rate type, employee, labor item, and effective date
*The ''Employee'' rate type, employee, and effective date
*The ''Labor Item'' rate type, labor item, and effective date

If there are multiple labor cost rates with the same settings, the system uses the rate with the actual effective date corresponding to the date of the time card line in the time zone in which the time card line was reported.]]></column>

You can also 				create a labor cost rate with the same settings as an existing labor cost rate but 				with an effective date that is later than the latest effective date of the existing 				labor cost rate. Units Of Measure in Labor Cost Rates When you specify the rate for a row with a labor item selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM209900|PM209900]) Labor Cost Rates (PM209900) form, you specify the rate for                 the base unit of measure (UOM) of the labor item. The base UOM of the labor item                 should be convertible into minutes so that the system can convert the base UOM to a                 minute. That is, there should be conversion rules from a minute to the base UOM and                 from the base UOM to a minute on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) Units of Measure                 (CS203100) form. When you create a labor cost rate for a labor item with a base UOM that is not an hour, make sure                 that you enter the rate for the base UOM of the labor item on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM209900|PM209900]) Labor Cost Rates form so that the system calculates the                 correct amount when a time activity with this labor item is released. For example, suppose that you have the  TRAINING  labor item, whose base UOM is  UNIT .                 According to the conversion rules specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) Units of Measure (CS203100) form, one unit equals four                 hours. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM209900|PM209900]) Labor Cost Rates form, when you add a                 labor cost rate with an employee and the  TRAINING  labor item, you should                 specify the rate in the base UOM, which is  UNIT . When the employee enters a                 time card on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]) Employee Time Card (EP305000) form and in                 a time activity on the    ([~/?ScreenId=CR306010|CR306010]) Activity (CR306010) form                 selects the  TRAINING  labor item, the time is reported in hours even though                 the base UOM of the selected item is not an hour. When the time card with the                 corresponding time activities is released, the system generates a project                 transaction with the  TRAINING  labor item in the base UOM of the item. If the                 employee has reported eight hours, the project transaction will contain two                      TRAINING  units. Retrieval of Labor Cost Rates When you create a time card on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]) Employee Time Card 				(EP305000) form, for each line, you select the employee, project, project task, 				labor item, and date. For each time card line, the system retrieves the most 				appropriate labor cost rate from the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM209900|PM209900]) Labor Cost Rates (PM209900) 				form. The system selects the most specific existing labor cost rate among the 				defined labor cost rates that matches all the settings specified in the time card 				line. The system looks for the following sets of settings that match the time card 				settings and uses the first set it finds: The  Project  rate type, project, project task, employee, labor item, and 					effective date The  Project  rate type, project, project task, employee, and effective 					date The  Project  rate type, project, project task, labor item, and effective 					date The  Project  rate type, project, project task, and effective date The  Project  rate type, project, employee, labor item, and effective 					date The  Project  rate type, project, employee, and effective date The  Project  rate type, project, labor item, and effective date The  Project  rate type, project, and effective date The  Employee  rate type, employee, labor item, and effective date The  Employee  rate type, employee, and effective date The  Labor Item  rate type, labor item, and effective date If there are multiple labor cost rates with the same settings, the system uses the 				rate with the actual effective date corresponding to the date of the time card line 				in the time zone in which the time card line was 				reported. ]]></column>

In the following implementation activity, you will learn how to define labor cost rates.
==Story==
Suppose that in the SweetLife Fruit & Jams company, the price of the consulting services depends on the qualifications of the consultant who provides the service. You, as the SweetLife project accountant, need to define the labor cost rates for three of your company&rsquo;s consultants: [anchor|#_f3038160-5cab-4f9a-9d31-8b32d044fa6d]
*Pam Brawner, a project manager, whose work rate is $48 per hour
*Jon Waite, a senior consultant, whose work rate is $44 per hour
*Alberto Jimenez, a junior consultant, whose work rate is $40 per hour

==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, the ''Project Accounting'' feature has been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, the ''CONSULTJR'', ''CONSULTSR'', and ''CONSULTPM'' labor items have been created; on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form, these items are assigned to the ''EP00000004 - Alberto Jimenez'', ''EP00000003 - Jon Waite'', and ''EP00000001 – Pam Brawner'' employees, respectively. The base unit of all items is ''HOUR''. 
==Process Overview==
You will define labor cost rates that are based on the employee who performed the work on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_99_00|Labor Cost Rates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209900|PM209900]) form.
==System Preparation==

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
In Acumatica ERP, you can define labor rates that are used to determine the cost of employee time spent on a particular project, and bill the customers based on this cost. The following sections explain how the labor cost rates are specified and retrieved in construction projects.
==Creation of Labor Cost Rates==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_99_00|Labor Cost Rates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209900|PM209900]) form, you can define labor cost rates that are specific to particular entities, such as the employee, project, project task, labor item, date, union local, certified job, and workers' compensation code. {br}

When you define a labor cost rate, you specify its type, the rate, and an optional description and external reference number of the rate. Based on the type you select, particular columns become available so you can specify the particular entity the rate applies to and other relevant details. In the '''Type''' column of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_99_00|Labor Cost Rates] form, you select one of the following options:[anchor|#_12cb5eb1-8dd1-4fd2-93eb-3934cb7e894c]
*''Labor Item'': If you select this type, in the row, you must also select the labor item and the rate.
*''Employee'': If you select this type, in the row, you must select the employee and the rate; optionally, you can also select a particular labor item to which the rate applies.
*''Project'': If you select this type, in the row, you must select the project and the rate. Optionally, you can select any of the following to which the rate applies: the project task, the employee, and the labor item.
*''Union Wage'': If you select this type, in the row, you must select the applicable union local and labor item.
*:You might define a rate of this type if an employee is a member of a local branch of a union; in this case, the union requires the company to pay the dictated union rate, which is usually higher than the prevailing wage rate.
*''Prevailing Wage'': If you select this type, in the row, you must select the project and labor item.
*:You might define a rate of this type if a government entity requires the construction companies to pay a non-union employee no less than the dictated prevailing wage rate. The prevailing wage is a government mechanism to equalize the wage rates that are paid by a construction company to non-union workers compared to labor union workers for the same type of work performed for a certified job. (A certified job is a job performed for government, such as a construction project of a municipal building.) 

For each labor cost rate, regardless of its type, you specify the effective date. If there are multiple labor cost rates with the same settings, the system uses the rate with the most recent effective date that precedes the current date. You can also create a labor cost rate with the same settings as an existing labor cost rate but with an effective date that is later than the latest effective date of the existing labor cost rate.[anchor|#_552e9322-1bf3-45a7-9fb9-2d2054318118]
==Units Of Measure in Labor Cost Rates==
When you specify the rate for a row with a labor item selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_99_00|Labor Cost Rates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209900|PM209900]) form, you specify the rate for the base unit of measure (UOM) of the labor item. The base UOM of the labor item should be convertible into minutes so that the system can convert the base UOM to a minute. That is, there should be conversion rules from a minute to the base UOM and from the base UOM to a minute on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) form.{br}

When you create a labor cost rate for a labor item with a base UOM that is not an hour, make sure that you enter the rate for the base UOM of the labor item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_99_00|Labor Cost Rates] form so that the system calculates the correct amount when a time activity with this labor item is released.{br}

For example, suppose that you have the ''TRAINING'' labor item, whose base UOM is ''UNIT''. According to the conversion rules specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) form, one unit equals four hours. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_99_00|Labor Cost Rates] form, when you add a labor cost rate with an employee and the ''TRAINING'' labor item, you should specify the rate in the base UOM, which is ''UNIT''. When the employee enters a time card on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_50_00|Employee Time Card] ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]) form and in a time activity on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_10|Activity] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306010|CR306010]) form selects the ''TRAINING'' labor item, the time is reported in hours even though the base UOM of the selected item is not an hour. When the time card with the corresponding time activities is released, the system generates a project transaction with the ''TRAINING'' labor item in the base UOM of the item. If the employee has reported eight hours, the project transaction will contain two ''TRAINING'' units.
==Time Card Population==
When you create a time card on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_50_00|Employee Time Card] ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]) form, for each line, you select the employee, project, project task, labor item, date, union local, certified job, and worker compensation code.{br}

In a time card, the system automatically populates the '''Union Local''' column with the union local copied from the settings of the employee specified on the '''General Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form if the employee’s union local is specified is one of the union locals of the project specified on the '''Union Locals''' tab of the of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, or if the project has no union local. Otherwise, the system leaves the column blank.{br}

The system automatically selects the '''Certified Job''' check box in the time card line if for the corresponding project, the '''Certified Job''' check box is selected in the '''Project Properties''' section on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. In a time card, you can override the automatically selected '''Certified Job''' and '''Union Local''' settings, if needed.
==Retrieval of Labor Cost Rates==
For each time card line on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_50_00|Employee Time Card] ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]) form, the system retrieves the cost rate from the labor cost rate table on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_99_00|Labor Cost Rates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209900|PM209900]) form as follows:[anchor|#_067e04ad-4815-4e87-bbe6-3f2b17399431]
#Among labor cost rates of the ''Project'', ''Employee'', and ''Labor Item'' rate types, the system selects the most specific existing labor cost rate among the defined labor cost rates that matches all the settings specified in the time card line and is effective on the date of the document. The system looks for the following sets of settings that match the time card settings and uses the first set it finds:
#*The ''Project'' rate type, project, project task, employee, and labor item
#*The ''Project'' rate type, project, project task, and employee
#*The ''Project'' rate type, project, project task, and labor item
#*The ''Project'' rate type, project, and project task
#*The ''Project'' rate type, project, employee, and labor item
#*The ''Project'' rate type, project, and employee
#*The ''Project'' rate type, project, and labor item
#*The ''Project'' rate type, and project
#*The ''Employee'' rate type, employee, and labor item
#*The ''Employee'' rate type, and employee
#*The ''Labor Item'' rate type, and labor item
#For the time card line, if the '''Certified Job''' check box is selected and a '''Union Local''' is specified, the system selects the ''Union Wage'' and ''Prevailing Wage'' rate types that match the settings specified in the time card line. Then the system compares the most specific labor cost rate that has been found in the previous step with the selected labor cost rates of the ''Union Wage'' and ''Prevailing Wage'' rate types. Based on the comparison, the system selects the higher labor cost rate.
#If there are multiple labor cost rates with the same settings, the system uses the rate with the actual effective date corresponding to the date of the time card line in the time zone in which the time card line was reported.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Labor Items: Labor Cost Rates in Construction In  Acumatica ERP, you can define labor rates that are used to determine the cost of employee time spent on         a particular project, and bill the customers based on this cost.  The         following sections explain how the labor cost rates are specified and retrieved in         construction projects. Creation of Labor Cost Rates On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM209900|PM209900]) Labor Cost Rates (PM209900) form, you can define labor cost rates         that are specific to particular entities, such as the employee, project, project task, labor         item, date, union local, certified job, and workers' compensation code.  When you define a labor cost rate, you specify its type, the rate, and an optional         description and external reference number of the rate. Based on the type you select,         particular columns become available so you can specify the particular entity the rate         applies to and other relevant details. In the  Type  column of the             ([~/?ScreenId=PM209900|PM209900]) Labor Cost Rates form, you select one of the following options: Labor Item : If you select this type, in the row, you must also select the labor           item and the rate. Employee : If you select this type, in the row, you must select the employee and           the rate; optionally, you can also select a particular labor item to which the rate           applies. Project : If you select this type, in the row, you must select the project and the           rate. Optionally, you can select any of the following to which the rate applies: the           project task, the employee, and the labor item. Union Wage : If you select this type, in the row, you must select the applicable           union local and labor item. You might define a rate of this type if an employee is a             member of a local branch of a union; in this case, the union requires the company to pay             the dictated union rate, which is usually higher than the prevailing wage rate. Prevailing Wage : If you select this type, in the row, you must select the project           and labor item. You might define a rate of this type if a government entity requires the             construction companies to pay a non-union employee no less than the dictated prevailing             wage rate. The prevailing wage is a government mechanism to equalize the wage rates that             are paid by a construction company to non-union workers compared to labor union workers             for the same type of work performed for a certified job. (A certified job is a job             performed for government, such as a construction project of a municipal building.)            For each labor cost rate, regardless of its type, you specify the effective date. If there         are multiple labor cost rates with the same settings, the system uses the rate with the most         recent effective date that precedes the current date. You can also create a labor cost rate         with the same settings as an existing labor cost rate but with an effective date that is         later than the latest effective date of the existing labor cost rate. Units Of Measure in Labor Cost Rates When you specify the rate for a row with a labor item selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM209900|PM209900]) Labor Cost Rates (PM209900) form, you specify the rate for                 the base unit of measure (UOM) of the labor item. The base UOM of the labor item                 should be convertible into minutes so that the system can convert the base UOM to a                 minute. That is, there should be conversion rules from a minute to the base UOM and                 from the base UOM to a minute on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) Units of Measure                 (CS203100) form. When you create a labor cost rate for a labor item with a base UOM that is not an hour, make sure                 that you enter the rate for the base UOM of the labor item on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM209900|PM209900]) Labor Cost Rates form so that the system calculates the                 correct amount when a time activity with this labor item is released. For example, suppose that you have the  TRAINING  labor item, whose base UOM is  UNIT .                 According to the conversion rules specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) Units of Measure (CS203100) form, one unit equals four                 hours. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM209900|PM209900]) Labor Cost Rates form, when you add a                 labor cost rate with an employee and the  TRAINING  labor item, you should                 specify the rate in the base UOM, which is  UNIT . When the employee enters a                 time card on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]) Employee Time Card (EP305000) form and in                 a time activity on the    ([~/?ScreenId=CR306010|CR306010]) Activity (CR306010) form                 selects the  TRAINING  labor item, the time is reported in hours even though                 the base UOM of the selected item is not an hour. When the time card with the                 corresponding time activities is released, the system generates a project                 transaction with the  TRAINING  labor item in the base UOM of the item. If the                 employee has reported eight hours, the project transaction will contain two                      TRAINING  units. Time Card Population When you create a time card on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]) Employee Time Card (EP305000)         form, for each line, you select the employee, project, project task, labor item, date, union         local, certified job, and worker compensation code. In a time card, the system automatically populates the  Union Local          column with the union local copied from the settings of the employee specified on the            General Info  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) Employees (EP203000) form if the employee’s union local is specified is one of the union locals of         the project specified on the  Union Locals  tab of the of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, or if the project has no union local.         Otherwise, the system leaves the column blank. The system automatically selects the  Certified Job  check box in the         time card line if for the corresponding project, the  Certified Job          check box is selected in the  Project Properties  section on the            Summary  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects         (PM301000) form. In a time card, you can override the automatically selected            Certified Job  and  Union Local  settings, if         needed. Retrieval of Labor Cost Rates For each time card line on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]) Employee Time Card (EP305000)         form, the system retrieves the cost rate from the labor cost rate table on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM209900|PM209900]) Labor Cost Rates (PM209900) form as follows: Among labor cost rates of the  Project ,  Employee , and  Labor Item            rate types, the system selects the most specific existing labor cost rate among the           defined labor cost rates that matches all the settings specified in the time card line and           is effective on the date of the document. The system looks for the following sets of           settings that match the time card settings and uses the first set it finds: The  Project  rate type, project, project task, employee, and labor item The  Project  rate type, project, project task, and employee The  Project  rate type, project, project task, and labor item The  Project  rate type, project, and project task The  Project  rate type, project, employee, and labor item The  Project  rate type, project, and employee The  Project  rate type, project, and labor item The  Project  rate type, and project The  Employee  rate type, employee, and labor item The  Employee  rate type, and employee The  Labor Item  rate type, and labor item For the time card line, if the  Certified Job  check box is           selected and a  Union Local  is specified, the system selects the              Union Wage  and  Prevailing Wage  rate types that match the settings           specified in the time card line. Then the system compares the most specific labor cost           rate that has been found in the previous step with the selected labor cost rates of the              Union Wage  and  Prevailing Wage  rate types. Based on the comparison, the           system selects the higher labor cost rate. If there are multiple labor cost rates with the same settings, the system uses the rate           with the actual effective date corresponding to the date of the time card line in the time           zone in which the time card line was           reported. ]]></column>

A project in Acumatica ERP is a one-time endeavor with its own budget, costs, and revenues; the funding and deliverables of a project are usually finite. In the system, a project contains various specifications that affect project completion, such as the date range, customer, and resources (including employees and equipment).{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Plan a project
*Create a project and specify its settings
*Set up project security
*Process a project during its life cycle

==Applicable Scenarios==
You create a project to plan work performed for a customer, define budgets for the planned work, track the progress of completion of the planned work, bill the customers for the provided services, and track the costs and revenues of the provided services.
==Type of Projects==
You can use projects for tracking activities involving customer interaction (external projects) and in-house works (internal projects). The key objective of external projects is balancing costs and income to make sure the organization remains profitable, while meeting project goals and maximizing customer satisfaction. The scope of internal projects is typically limited to the physical and organizational boundaries of your organization; these projects serve the needs of the organization and never produce any revenue. {br}

Depending on which activities you are going to track within a project, you can assign it one of the following types:[anchor|#_a4b3b341-7129-4c26-ac45-3268b193d479]
*A fixed-price project, which is an external project in which services and products are provided to customers at a fixed price; the price of the project is defined at the beginning of the project and is not changed during its completion (unless any change orders are being processed for the project).
*A cost-plus project, which is an external project in which the prices are calculated as a percentage of the costs. The final price of the cost-plus project depends on the overall cost of fulfilling the project, and the costs may be billed with or without a premium. 
*An internal project, which is used to track activities completed within your company. The scope of these projects is limited to the physical and organizational boundaries of an organization; these projects serve the needs of the organization and never produce any revenue. Internal projects have budgets, do not include billing settings, and are not associated with any customer. 

==Project Settings==
You create a new project and specify its settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. When you are manually adding a new project to the system, you enter the following information: [anchor|#_60fdc592-ef21-4286-a8b0-b869f5a70ece]
*General information: This information includes the description, start date, end date, and billing period. You also select determine when the project is billed: on the date of the customer statement, at the end of each month, at the end of each quarter, or at the end of each year.
*Project tasks: You must define the project tasks of the project. A project task in a project is a separate work unit with its own life cycle, budget, cost, revenue, and billing rule. Budgeted, revised, and actual amounts in the project are tracked by account group balances, each of which is the total of all the corresponding amounts in the project tasks. That is, the project does not have any balances beyond those in the project tasks of the project.
*Employees: You specify the employees to be involved in the project. If needed, you can specify different labor classes for regular working hours and for overtime hours.
*Equipment: You can list the equipment to be used in the project. For a particular piece of equipment, you can override the default run, standby, and suspend rates.
*Budget: You specify the budget, which holds the estimated expenses and revenues for a project.

Also, you can create a project from a project quote. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Project_Quotes_GeneralInfo|Processing Project Quotes: General Information].]]></column>

In Acumatica ERP, you can use roles to provide access to forms according to employees&rsquo; responsibilities and restriction groups to limit the visibility of particular projects to onlythe responsible team, as described in this topic.[anchor|#_20fab7d7-3c2d-4f08-b0df-a43ce69bd671]((({S:Warn}In Acumatica ERP, you can configure groups with direct and inverse restriction. In this topic, for simplicity, groups with direct restriction are used in examples. You can use inverse restriction groups in the same way as you use direct restriction groups. For details on the types of restriction groups, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Types_of_Restriction_Groups|Types of Restriction Groups].
))){br}{TOC}
==Usage Scenarios==
The most common scenarios of managing the security of projects are the following:[anchor|#_e7140181-0be1-4650-b91a-8950ea7660ac]
*Managing access to forms based on users’ roles: Each employee involved with a project has specific tasks. You can configure user roles that will give employees access to project-related forms according to their responsibilities. For details, see [[#_11cb0b04-fdcd-447b-bf19-47ed4cdfa2b9|Access to Forms Based on Roles].
*Managing the visibility of particular projects by user: If your organization has multiple project teams and multiple employees have the same functional responsibilities in different projects, you can make particular projects available to employees of only a particular project team by using restriction groups. For more information, see [[#_fa1ee400-9351-44cf-b017-9a3cb3397669|Visibility of Projects by Users].
*Managing the visibility of projects by area of the system: If a project should be associated with transactions in a particular system area (such as accounts payable), you can make it visible only within this area. For details, see [[#_6dbea516-fa29-4011-a27f-975f8470ef8e|Visibility of Projects by Area].
[anchor|#_11cb0b04-fdcd-447b-bf19-47ed4cdfa2b9]
==Access to Forms Based on Roles==
By using the user security forms, you can configure access rights to the project-related forms for each employee, in accordance with the employee&rsquo;s typical responsibilities. For more information about user roles, see [HelpRoot_Administration\User_Roles_GeneralInfo|User Roles: General Information].{br}

For example, you can create the following roles for employees of your organization who work with projects: [anchor|#_9fd88dae-4dbb-4ed7-8692-7359838b6a16]
*''Project Manager:'' A role for an employee who coordinates projects and is responsible for achieving the project goals. In the system, this person sets up pricing in projects, creates tasks, and configures projects and project templates. This role should have access to project-related forms—that is, the forms in the '''Projects''' workspace—including those listed in the '''Preferences''' category. Also, this role may require access to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) form so that the users with this role can approve projects.
*''Project Controller'': A role for an employee who controls project transactions, performs allocations, and runs project billing. This role should have full access to project-related forms—that is, the forms in the '''Projects''' workspace—including those listed in the '''Processes''' category.
*''Project Accountant'': A role for an employee who plans and executes the project budget and enters project transactions. This role should have access to project-related forms—that is, the forms in the '''Projects''' workspace—including those listed in the '''Transactions''' and '''Profiles''' categories.
*''Project Team Member:'' A role for an employee who works for a project and enters time sheets and time cards. This role should have access to project-related forms—that is, the forms in the '''Projects''' workspace—including those listed in the '''Transactions''' and '''Profiles''' categories. It should also have access to the forms listed in the '''Time Tracking''' category of the '''Time and Expenses''' workspace.
[anchor|#_fa1ee400-9351-44cf-b017-9a3cb3397669]
==Visibility of Projects by Users==
By using the row-level security forms of Acumatica ERP, you can configure the system to hide or display particular projects for employees, in addition to implementing task-based roles. Employees who have access to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form can view or edit all the projects available in your organization. You may need to use restriction groups to restrict the visibility of specific projects to only employees of the project team. For details on restriction groups, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Overview_of_Restriction_Groups|Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP].{br}

As a simple example, suppose that you need to restrict the visibility of projects to employees in your organization given the following: [anchor|#_ede165f1-8de2-4522-8e37-b5d97bfc13bd]
*There are two projects in your organization: ''Project Y'' and ''Project Z''.
*User PM is a project manager who controls all projects in your organization.
*User AC is an accountant who plans budgets and performs transactions for all projects in your organization.
*Users E1 and E2 are engineers who work on ''Project Y''.
*Users E3 and E4 are engineers who work on ''Project Z''.

To configure the visibility of projects according to the listed statements, you would do the following on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_20_00|Project Access] ([~/?ScreenId=PM102000|PM102000]) form:[anchor|#_85c60efb-c9d5-48a9-a459-0fd9e2cfe5a6]
#You create two restriction groups of type ''A'' (with direct restriction): Group 1 for ''Project Y'' and Group 2 for ''Project Z''.
#You include the following entities in Group 1:''Project Y'', user PM, user AC,  and users E1 and E2.
#In Group 2, you include ''Project Z'', user PM, user AC, and users E3 and E4.

With the settings you have specified, the users’ visibility of projects would be the following:[anchor|#_f0e2499b-528e-4a0a-bd52-fc8ad408e3ff]
*Users PM and AC can see both ''Project Y'' and ''Project Z''.
*Users E1 and E2 can see only ''Project Y''.
*Users E3 and E4 can see only ''Project Z''.
[anchor|#_6dbea516-fa29-4011-a27f-975f8470ef8e]
==Visibility of Projects by Area==
After you have created a project in Acumatica ERP, the project is available system-wide by default. You can control the visibility of projects within functional areas of the system in the following ways:[anchor|#_8bb274f4-bc2a-44ce-8b09-d693f363293c]
*Display or hide the '''Project''' boxes and columns on forms: If you use projects in a particular functional area (for example, accounts receivable), you can configure the system to display the boxes and columns where a user can select a project on forms only within this area. In the '''Visibility Settings''' section of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form, you can select the check boxes for the areas where these elements should be displayed and clear the check boxes for the areas where the elements should not be displayed..
*Display or hide a project: If the project transactions of a particular project should be performed within a particular area (for example, inventory), you can make the project visible only in this area so that users can select only appropriate projects when they are preparing documents. You can select areas in the '''Visibility Settings''' section of the '''General Info''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. After you have selected an area, users can select the project in documents generated on the related forms, and the release of these documents automatically updates the project data.
*Display or hide the tasks of a project: If employees need to process documents related to a project in multiple areas, but the users perform particular tasks of a project in a certain area (for example, the ''Warehouse operations'' task requires users to enter inventory transactions and the ''Customer payments'' task is performed in accounts receivable), you can select the areas where the task will be displayed in the settings of the task. You select these areas in the '''Visibility Settings''' section of the '''General Info''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form.

==Forms for Project Security==
In the following table, you can find the list of the forms that you can use to manage restriction groups with projects. The table also includes the task that you can perform by using each form.[anchor|#_df593029-2d2b-4eec-8fb3-c9785f3038f4]

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Project Processing: Project Security Configuration Many organizations use projects to achieve their business objectives efficiently.                     An organization may have multiple projects in                     progress  at                     a given time . By limiting users' access to and visibility of                     information about particular projects and related transactions, managers can                     properly organize the work on each project. In  Acumatica ERP, you can use roles to provide access to forms according to employees'                     responsibilities and restriction groups to                      limit                      the visibility of particular projects                      to  only the                      responsible team, as described in this topic. In  Acumatica ERP,             you can configure groups with direct and inverse restriction. In this topic, for             simplicity, groups with direct restriction are used in examples. You can use inverse             restriction groups in the same way as you use direct restriction groups. For details on             the types of restriction groups, see  Types of Restriction Groups. Usage Scenarios The most common scenarios of managing the security of projects are the                     following: Managing access to forms based on                          users’                          role s :                         Each employee involved with a project has                          specific                         tasks. You can configure user roles that will                          give                          employees access to project-related forms according to their                         responsibilities. For details, see  Access to Forms Based on Roles Access to Forms Based on Roles. Managing the visibility of particular projects by user: If your organization                         has multiple project teams and multiple employees have the same functional                         responsibilities in different projects, you can make particular projects                         available to employees of only a particular project team by using                         restriction groups. For more information, see  Visibility of Projects by Users Visibility of Projects by Users. Managing the visibility of projects by                          area                          of the system : If a project should be associated with                         transactions in a particular system area (such as                          a ccounts                          p ayable),                         you can make it visible only within this area. For details, see  Visibility of Projects by Area Visibility of Projects by Area. Access to Forms Based on Roles By using the user security forms, you can configure access rights to the project-related forms                     for each                     employee ,                      in accordance with the employee's typical responsibilities. For more information                     about user roles, see                          User Roles: General Information. For example, you can create the following roles for employees of your organization who work with projects:  Project Manager:  A role for an employee who                             coordinates                              project s                              and is responsible for achieving the project goals. In the system, this                             person sets up pricing in projects, creates tasks, and configures                             projects and project templates. This role should have access to                             project-related                             forms —that                             is, the forms in the  Projects                              workspace—including those listed in the                                  Preferences                              category .                             Also, this role may                              require                              access to the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) Approvals (EP503010)                             form so that the users with this role can approve projects. Project Controller : A role for an employee who controls project transactions, performs                             allocations, and runs project billing. This role should have full access                             to project-related                             forms —that                             is, the forms in the  Projects                              workspace—including those listed in the                                  Processes                              category . Project Accountant : A role for an employee who plans and executes the project budget and                             enters project transactions. This role should have access to                             project-related                             forms —that                             is, the forms in the  Projects                              workspace—including those listed in the                                  Transactions  and                                  Profiles                              categor ies . Project Team Member:  A role for an employee who works for a project and enters time                             sheets and time cards. This role should have access                             to                              project-related                             forms —that                             is, the forms in the  Projects                              workspace—including those listed in the                                  Transactions  and                                  Profiles                              categories .                              It should also have access to the forms listed in the  Time                                 Tracking  category of the  Time and                                 Expenses                              workspace. Visibility of Projects by Users By using the row-level security                     forms  of                          Acumatica ERP, you can configure the system to hide or display particular                     projects for employees, in addition to implementing task-based roles. Employees                     who have access to the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000)                     form                      can                      view or edit all the projects available in your organization. You may need to                     use restriction groups to restrict the visibility of specific projects to only                     employees of the project team. For details on restriction groups, see  Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP. As                     a simple  example, suppose that you need to restrict the                     visibility of projects to employees in your organization                      given                      the following:  There are two projects in your organization:  Project Y  and  Project Z . User                          PM                          is a project manager who controls all projects in your organization. User AC is an accountant who plans budgets and                          performs                          transactions for all projects in your organization. Users E1 and E2 are engineers who work on  Project Y . Users E3 and E4 are engineers who work on  Project Z . To configure the visibility of projects according to the listed statements, you would do the following on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM102000|PM102000]) Project Access (PM102000) form: You create two restriction groups of type  A  (with direct                         restriction):                          Group 1  for  Project Y  and Group 2 for  Project                             Z . You                         include the following entities in  Group 1 : Project                         Y ,                          u ser                         PM,                          u ser                         AC,                                                   and u sers E1 and E2 . In Group 2, you include  Project                         Z ,                          u ser                         PM,                          u ser                         AC,                          and                         u sers E3 and E4 . With                     the settings you have                      specified ,                     the  users’                      visibility of projects would be the following: Users PM and AC can see both  Project Y  and  Project Z . Users E1 and E2 can see only  Project Y . Users E3 and E4 can see only  Project Z . Visibility of Projects by Area After you have created a project in  Acumatica ERP, the project is available system-wide by default. You can control the                     visibility of projects within functional                     areas  of                     the system  in the following ways: Display or hide the                              Project                          boxes and columns on forms: If you                          use                          projects in a particular functional area (for example,                          a ccounts                          r eceivable),                         you can configure the system to display the boxes and columns where a user                         can select a project on forms only within this area. In the                              Visibility Settings  section of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form, you can select                          the                         check boxes for the                          areas                          where these elements should be displayed and clear the check boxes for the                         areas where the elements should not be displayed. . Display or hide a project: If the project                         transactions                          of a particular project  should be performed within a                         particular area (for example,                          i nventory),                         you can make the project visible only in this area so that users can select                         only appropriate projects when they are preparing documents. You can select                         areas in the  Visibility Settings  section of the                              General Info  tab on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. After you have                         selected an area, users can select the project in documents generated on the                         related forms, and the release of these documents automatically updates the                         project data. Display or hide                          the  tasks of a project: If employees need to process                         documents related to a project in multiple areas, but the users perform                         particular tasks of a project in a certain area (for example, the                              Warehouse operations  task requires                          users                         to enter  inventory transactions and the  Customer                             payments  task is performed                          in                          a ccounts                          receivable ),                         you can select the areas where the task will be                         displayed                          in the settings of the task . You select these areas in the                              Visibility Settings  section of the                              General Info  tab on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) Project Tasks (PM302000) form. Forms for Project Security In the following table, you can find the list of the forms that you can use to manage restriction                     groups with projects. The table also includes the                     task                      that you can                      perform                      by using each form.

Before starting to create a project, you must be sure that the system has been configured properly and that all required entities have been created, as described in the following sections.{br}{TOC}
==Enabling the Needed Features==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Projects'' feature must be enabled.
==Configuring Project Identifiers==
The ''PROJECT'' segmented key on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form defines the identifier of the projects. By default, this segmented key specifies that the project identifier is an alphanumeric string of up to 10 characters. For the key, you can define how many segments it is to have, what values may be used, whether these values should be validated, and whether auto-numbering should be used in one of the segments. You can also divide item identifiers into segments with specific values. For more information on configuring segmented keys, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Identifier_Segmentation|Segmented Identifiers].
==Configuring the System==
Before you enter any new project, you must ensure that the following are configured: [anchor|#_164d581d-362e-4b22-8005-856a4e40097c]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form, the basic project accounting settings have been specified: numbering sequences, non-project code, visibility settings, and posting settings. The actual combination of settings you need to specify depends on the processes in your organization and on the features enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. For an example of configuring basic project settings, see [HelpRoot_Projects\config_Project_Basic_Implem_Activity|Project Basic Configuration: Implementation Activity].
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_10_00|Account Groups] ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) form, the account groups that will be used in the project have been created. Account groups make it possible to transfer financial and non-financial information between project management forms and other functional areas by associating any transactions posted in other areas with the related project. For an example of configuring an account group, see [HelpRoot_Projects\Account_Groups_GeneralInfo|Account Groups: General Information].
*Optional: On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_42_00|Rate Tables] ([~/?ScreenId=PM204200|PM204200]) form, each rate table that you will assign to a project task has been created, and the rate table has been configured on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_60_00|Rate Tables] ([~/?ScreenId=PM206000|PM206000]) form. The rate tables define pricing models in which price may differ depending on different sets of factors. For details, see [HelpRoot_Projects\Billing_Rates_GeneralInfo|Billing Rates: General Information].
*Optional: On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, each billing rule that you will assign to a project task has been created. These rules define which transactions should be used for billing and which accounts should be used to record the transactions that are generated in the billing process. For details, see [HelpRoot_Projects\Billing_Rules_GeneralInfo|Billing Rules: General Information].
*Optional: On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_75_00|Allocation Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207500|PM207500]) form, each allocation rule that you will assign to a project task has been created. If your project uses a complex cost accrual model, you must specify appropriate allocation rules to correctly track project expenditures and future revenues. For an example of defining allocation rules, see [HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Allocation_WIP_CP_Implem_Activity|Billing Cost-Plus Projects with WIP Costs: Implementation Activity] and [HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Allocation_WIP_FP_Implem_Activity|Billing Fixed-Price Projects with WIP Costs: Implementation Activity].

Configuring the System Before you enter any new project, you must ensure that the following are configured:  On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form, the basic project accounting           settings have been specified: numbering sequences, non-project code, visibility settings,           and posting settings. The actual combination of settings you need to specify depends on           the processes in your organization and on the features enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form.            For an example of           configuring basic project settings,  see  Project Basic Configuration: Implementation Activity. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) Account Groups (PM201000) form, the account groups that will be           used in the project have been created. Account groups make it possible to transfer           financial and non-financial information between project management forms and other           functional areas by associating any transactions posted in other areas with the related           project. For  an example           of configuring an account group , see  Account Groups: General Information. Optional: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM204200|PM204200]) Rate Tables (PM204200) form, each rate table that           you will assign to a project task has been created, and the rate table has been configured           on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM206000|PM206000]) Rate Tables (PM206000) form. The rate tables define pricing           models in which price may differ depending on different sets of factors. For details, see              Billing Rates: General Information. Optional: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules (PM207000) form, each billing rule that           you will assign to a project task has been created. These rules define which transactions           should be used for billing and which accounts should be used to record the transactions           that are generated in the billing process. For details, see  Billing Rules: General Information. Optional: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207500|PM207500]) Allocation Rules (PM207500) form, each allocation rule           that you will assign to a project task has been created. If your project uses a complex           cost accrual model, you must specify appropriate allocation rules to correctly track           project expenditures and future           revenues.  For an example           of defining allocation rules, see  Billing Cost-Plus Projects with WIP Costs: Implementation Activity and  Billing Fixed-Price Projects with WIP Costs: Implementation Activity. ]]></column>

==Story==
Suppose that the Lake Cafe customer has ordered a juicer from the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company, along with the site review and installation services. The work will start on ''1/1/2020'' and must be completed by ''1/30/2020''. SweetLife’s project accountant has decided to create a fixed-price project that will involve the sale of the juicer, along with the provided services, which you will define as the tasks of the project. The project will be billed once, when both of the project tasks are completed. Also, the project accountant has decided to skip the creation of a pro forma invoices, because all amounts have already been budgeted and agreed upon with the customer.{br}

Acting as the project accountant, you will create the new project and specify its settings.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Project Accounting'' feature has been enabled to support the project accounting functionality.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, the ''JUICER15'' stock item has been defined.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, the ''SITEREVIEW'' and ''INSTALL'' non-stock items have been defined.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, the ''STANDARD'' billing rule has been defined.
==Process Overview==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, you will create a new project and specify its general settings on the '''Summary''' tab. Then on the '''Tasks''' tab, you will add the project tasks that will be performed during the completion of a project. On the '''Revenue Budget''' tab, you will define the planned revenue budget for the project.

==Story==
Suppose that the Lake Cafe customer has contacted the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company and ordered training of its employees on operating the juicer it purchased from SweetLife. The training sessions will start on ''1/1/2020'' and must be completed by ''1/30/2020''. The project accountant has analyzed the requirements and decided to account for the provided services by defining a small cost-plus project (with only a single task for the training of employees); the expected project profitability is 20%. Because the number of training sessions may be changed during the project completion by the customer&rsquo;s request, the project will be billed once when all training sessions have been provided. The project accountant has decided to skip the creation of pro forma invoices, because project amounts have already been agreed upon with the customer.{br}

Acting as the project accountant, you will create the new project and specify its settings.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Project Accounting'' feature has been enabled to support the project accounting functionality.{br}

You have finished configuring the project. Now you can complete the [HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Process_Process_Activity_Cost_Plus|Project Processing: To Process a Cost-Plus Project] activity to practice completing the project life cycle.]]></column>
			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Project Processing: To Create a Cost-Plus          Project The following activity will walk you through the process of configuring a simple                 fixed-price project from its initial creation. The following activity is             based on the  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system             settings have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the             activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100              dataset to its initial state. Story Suppose that the Lake Cafe customer has contacted the SweetLife Fruits & Jams                 company and ordered training of its employees on operating the juicer it purchased                 from SweetLife. The training sessions will start on  1/1/ 2020 and must be completed by  1/30/2020. The project accountant has analyzed the requirements and decided to                 account for the provided services by defining a small cost-plus project (with only a                 single task for the training of employees); the expected project profitability is                 20%. Because the number of training sessions may be changed during the project                 completion by the customer's request, the project will be billed once when all                 training sessions have been provided. The project accountant has decided to skip the                 creation of pro forma invoices, because project amounts have already been agreed                 upon with the customer. Acting as the project accountant, you will create the new project and specify its                 settings. Configuration Overview For the purposes of this activity, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000)                 form, the  Project Accounting  feature has been enabled to support the project                 accounting functionality. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form, the  TRAINING  non-stock                 item has been defined. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules (PM207000) form, the  TM  billing rule                 has been defined. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) Account Groups (PM201000) form, the  LABOR  account                 group has been defined. Process Overview On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, you will create a new project                 and specify its general settings on the  Summary  tab. Then on                 the  Tasks  tab, you will add the project task that will be                 performed during the completion of the project. On the  Cost                     Budget  tab, you will define the budget for the project. System Preparation To sign in to the system and prepare to perform the instructions of the activity, do                 the following: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the  U100  dataset preloaded; you                     should sign in as Pam Brawner by using the  brawner  username and the                          123  password. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP             screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to  1/30/2020. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and             select  1/30/2020 on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and             process all documents in the system during this business date. Step 1: Creating a Project and Specifying Its General Settings To create a new project and specify basic settings for it, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, create a project, and                     specify the following settings in the Summary area:  Project ID :                              INSTLAKE02 Customer :  LAKECAFE - Lake Cafe Description :  Training project for Lake                                 Cafe On the  Summary  tab, specify the following settings: Revenue Budget Level :  Task and Item Cost Budget Level :  Task and Item Start Date :  1/1/ 2020End Date :  1/30/2020Project Manager :  EP00000001 - Pam                             Brawner Change Order Workflow : Cleared Billing Currency :  USD Billing Period :  On Demand You select the                                      On Demand  billing period to indicate that the billing can                                 be performed at any time. Billing Rule :  TM This rule will be                                 specified by default in all project tasks added to the                             project. Create Pro Forma On Billing : Cleared You are                                 clearing this check box because you want to create accounts                                 receivable invoices when you bill the project. Save your changes to the project (which currently has the  In Planning                      status). Step 2: Adding Project Tasks To add project tasks to the project, do the following: On the  Tasks  tab, click  Add Row  on                     the table toolbar, and add the project task with the following settings: Task ID :  TRAINING Description :  Training on juicer                                 usage Status :  Active Notice that the  TM  billing rule has been automatically specified                         for both added tasks. Save your changes to the project. Step 3: Specifying the Project Cost Budget To configure the project cost budget, do the following: On the  Cost Budget  tab, click  Add                         Row  and specify the following settings in the added row: Project Task :  TRAINING Inventory ID :  TRAINING Account Group :  LABOR Original Budgeted Quantity :                                  16 UOM :  HOUR Unit Rate :  40 For each budget line, the system automatically calculates the                              Original Budgeted Amount  as the                              Original Budgeted Quantity  multiplied by the                              Unit Rate . Save your changes to the project. You have finished configuring the project. Now you can complete the  Project Processing: To Process a Cost-Plus Project activity to practice                 completing the project life cycle. ]]></column>

In Acumatica ERP, a project is a one-time or recurring endeavor with a specific scope, time frame, and budget. From the project’s initiation to its completion, a project goes through the following stages and is assigned the statuses shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#_615ace42-d273-4d3a-81aa-fa55bb86217f][anchor|#_a92cb867-951b-45d3-b498-51fddc3b2fd1][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_Projects_Life_Cycle.png|popup|450px]
Each stage is described in greater detail in the sections below.{br}{TOC}
==Project Estimation==
During the project estimation stage, you specify project settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, define activities and estimate the time required for completion of each project task, populate the project with employees, resources, and equipment. Each project, once it has been created and saved in the system, is assigned the ''In Planning'' status.{br}

A project with the ''In Planning'' status is not available for selection on data entry forms in other functional areas in which the project is visible. You can add new activities to projects and project tasks that have the ''In Planning'' status by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] and [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) forms. For instance, you can add an employee activity for planning budgets for project tasks. However, the transactions generated for completed activities (if any) cannot be released until the project gets the ''Active'' status.
==Project Acceptance==
The acceptance stage includes reaching an agreement with all the stakeholders, including customers and employees, as well as estimating the budget for the project and the expenditures it will entail. {br}

If the approval of projects is required in your system, the project is submitted for approval and is assigned the ''Pending Approval'' status once it is taken off hold. The project has this status until it is approved or rejected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) form by an assigned employee. If approved, the project is assigned the ''Active'' status. If rejected, the project is assigned the ''In Planning'' status and requires additional changes before it can be submitted for approval again. For more information on approvals, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__con_Project_Approval|Approval of Projects and Project-Related Activities].
==Project Execution==
During the execution stage, the project is in progress and project transactions can be posted to it. In this stage, the project retains the ''Active'' status. Project tasks are completed individually; the completion of a project task does not affect the completion of the project to which the task belongs.{br}

Active projects and their project tasks become available for selection on the forms of the functional areas in which the projects are visible. When you create a project-related transaction or document, you need to specify the specific project and project task to indicate that this transaction or document must be tracked within the project; also, you can specify whether the transaction or document is billable for the project task. Transactions in which the non-project code is specified are not tracked in any project.{br}

If any budget changes occur during the course of the project, the system preserves the initial budget amounts, and tracks the revised figures for the project budget.
==Project Completion==
The project is considered completed when all its tasks are completed. Once the project is finished, the project accountant completes it by manually assigning it the ''Completed'' status, and analyzes the project profitability. Project transactions can no longer be posted to a project with the ''Completed'' status.((({S:Warn}To simplify the tracking of a project completion percentage, you can create a separate dedicated task and use it exclusively to manually specify the project completion percentage, which you evaluate by using all the information available about the progress of project tasks and project-related transactions.

))){br}{TOC}
==Story==
Suppose that the Lake Cafe customer has ordered a juicer from the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company, along with the site review and installation services. SweetLife&rsquo;s project accountant has created a fixed-price project to account for this work. In the period from ''1/1/2020'' through ''1/30/2020'', the company employees have performed work related to the project tasks. {br}

Acting as the project accountant, you need to support the project during the entire project life cycle.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Project Accounting'' feature has been enabled to support the project accounting functionality.
==Process Overview==
You will activate the project to indicate that it has been started. Then you will create project-related transactions on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) form to record the provided services. You will bill the project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form and review the prepared AR invoice. Then you will close the project, and review the profitability report on the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\PM_62_40_00|Project Profitability] ([~/?ScreenId=PM624000|PM624000]) report form.
==System Preparation==
To sign in to the system and prepare to perform the instructions of the activity, do the following:[anchor|#_6c9e4914-0e56-4fc0-9f9d-df880dcd99b6]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded; you should sign in as Pam Brawner by using the ''brawner'' username and the ''123'' password.[anchor|#_db2f494a-2a2d-44fd-bae8-908e347618ba]
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select ''1/30/2020'' on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.
#Create the ''INSTLAKE01'' project, as described in [HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Process_Implem_Activity_Fixed_Price|Project Processing: To Create a Fixed-Price Project].

==Step 1: Activating the Project==
To indicate that the ''INSTLAKE01'' project has been started, do the following:[anchor|#_330dda74-89b9-400e-ab6a-0c49304157d2]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''INSTLAKE01'' project, which you have created in [HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Process_Implem_Activity_Fixed_Price|Project Processing: To Create a Fixed-Price Project].
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box.
#Save your changes to the project (which now has the ''Active'' status).

==Step 2: Uploading Project Transactions==
To upload and process the transactions of this project, do the following:[anchor|#_aae7eb57-9fae-4f8a-9a1a-c76b6b817ea3]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) form, create a new transaction with ''PM'' selected as the '''Module''' in the Summary area. 
#In the '''Description''' box, type <tt>The services for the INSTLAKE01 project</tt>.
#On the table toolbar, click '''Load Records from File''' ([image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_LoadRecordsfromFile.png]), and upload the transactions from the <tt>INSTLAKE01&#95;Project&#95;Transactions.xlsx</tt> file. While you are uploading the transactions, leave the default column mapping.
#Make sure that the '''Total Amount''' in the Summary area is ''3,200.00''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save''' to save the batch of project transactions, and then click '''Release''' to release it.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''INSTLAKE01'' project, and make sure that the '''Actual Expenses''' box in the Summary area now shows ''3,200.00''. On the '''Cost Budget''' tab, notice that the system has updated the cost budget of the project—that is, the cost budget lines have been added. Also, the '''Actual Quantity''' and '''Actual Amount''' columns have been populated with the amounts from the released project transactions.

==Step 3: Billing a Project==
To create an accounts receivable invoice for the project, do the following:[anchor|#_546ef340-93cc-4177-9230-9d97cd7320c0]
#While you are still reviewing the ''INSTLAKE01'' project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, on the form toolbar, click '''Run Project Billing'''. The system creates an AR invoice, which should look like the one shown in the following screenshot, and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form.[anchor|#image_x3z_fcf_gcb][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_Process_Activity_Fixed_Price.png|popup|The AR invoice created during the billing|450px]
#In the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] form, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and on the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the accounts receivable invoice.
#Return to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form with the ''INSTLAKE01'' project opened, and make sure that the '''Actual Income''' box in the Summary area now shows ''4,000.00'', which is the amount the customer has been billed.

==Step 4: Closing the Project==
To complete the project and analyze its profitability, do the following:
#While you are still reviewing the ''INSTLAKE01'' project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, on the '''Tasks''' tab, specify the following settings for both lines in the table:
#*'''Completed (%)''': <tt>100</tt>
#*'''Status''': ''Completed''
#* '''End Date''': ''1/30/2020'' (the system specifies this date automatically when you change the task’s status to ''Completed'')
#In the '''Status''' box in the Summary area, select ''Completed''.
#Save your changes to the project.
#On the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\PM_62_40_00|Project Profitability] ([~/?ScreenId=PM624000|PM624000]) report form, click '''Run Report''', and review the generated report, which shows the profitability calculated for the ''INSTLAKE01'' project. The calculated margin is $800.

==Story==
Suppose that the Lake Cafe customer has ordered training of tits employees from the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company. SweetLife&rsquo;s project accountant has created a cost-plus project to account for the provided services. Twenty hours of training sessions have been conducted in the period from ''1/1/2020'' through ''1/30/2020''. {br}

Acting as the project accountant, you need to support the project during the entire project life cycle.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Project Accounting'' feature has been enabled to support the project accounting functionality.
==Process Overview==
You will activate the project to indicate that it has been started. Then you will create project-related transactions on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) form to record the provided services. You will bill the project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form and review the prepared AR invoice. Then you will close the project, and review the profitability report on the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\PM_62_40_00|Project Profitability] ([~/?ScreenId=PM624000|PM624000]) report form.
==System Preparation==
To sign in to the system and prepare to perform the instructions of the activity, do the following:[anchor|#_6c9e4914-0e56-4fc0-9f9d-df880dcd99b6]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded; you should sign in as Pam Brawner by using the ''brawner'' username and the ''123'' password.[anchor|#_546f1242-5d2e-4f1c-a3dd-a05788017165]

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[In Acumatica ERP, you run the procedure of project billing to automatically generate customer invoices based on the accounting data related to the projects.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Make sure that the project is pending billing
*Make sure that the project is ready to be billed
*Run project billing for a single project or multiple projects
*Process the documents that have been generated during the project billing
*Review how the project’s actual amounts are updated with the billed amounts

==Applicable Scenarios==
You run project billing at a time that depends on the project billing period defined for the project to prepare an invoice for the customer. You can bill the customer based on the current progress of the project, or for the time and material spent on the project.
==Billing Process Preparation==
The billing procedure in Acumatica ERP is straightforward and depends on the type of the step of the billing rule that is specified for each project task on the '''Tasks''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, as follows:[anchor|#ul_f5v_bnw_xmb]
*For the ''Time and Material'' steps of the billing rules of project tasks, the system selects all the outstanding allocated project transactions and generates an invoice for the customer based on these transactions and the billing rule.
*For the ''Progress Billing'' steps of the billing rules of project tasks whose processing does not involve allocations, the system generates an invoice with the billable project revenue, meaning the revenue budget lines with a nonzero '''Pending Invoice Amount''' listed on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form.

For the billing process for a project to be run successfully, the project must meet the following criteria:[anchor|#ul_hhc_2m1_hbb]
*The project is an external project (that is, a project associated with a customer).
*All the mandatory settings should be specified for the project and its tasks.
*The project status should be ''Active'', ''Completed'', or ''Suspended''.
*The status of the project tasks should be ''Active'' or ''Completed'', and a billing rule should be specified for these tasks.
*The project should have a provision for billing, such as a billable line of the revenue budget associated with the task for progress billing, or an unbilled project transaction associated with the task within this billing period for time and material billing.
*The steps of the billing rule should be applicable to the billing provisions. For example, the billing rule of a task that is supposed to be billed by a revenue budget line should have a ''Progress Billing'' step.
*The rate table must be specified for a project task, if the related billing rule is configured using the ''@Rate'' parameter.
*Sales prices must be configured for non-stock items, if the related billing rule is configured using the ''@Price'' parameter.

==Projects Pending Billing==
The billing procedure could be run only for a project that is pending billing—that is, at least one of the following exist for the project:[anchor|#_cee1a718-6ea2-4c7c-bf8e-a8961a466456]
*A revenue budget line with a nonzero '''Pending Invoice Amount''' on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form; the amount may be positive or negative.
*An amount postponed to the next billing from a pro forma invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form for which the corresponding accounts receivable invoice is released.
*A project task for which a recurring billing item is defined on the '''Recurring Billing''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form.
*An unbilled transaction that is ready to be billed on the invoice date—that is, the date of the transaction is not later than the invoice date. Transactions with a date the same as the invoice date are billed if ''Include Trans. created on billing date'' is selected in the '''Billing Cut-off Date''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form; if ''Exclude Trans. created on billing date'' is selected instead, the system skips the transactions with a date on the billing date.
*:The invoice date for all the projects except those that are billed on demand is the '''Next Billing Date''' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form (in the '''Billing and Allocation Settings '''section of the '''Summary''' tab); for the projects that are billed on demand (that is, for which the '''Billing Period''', which is specified in the same section of the form, is ''On Demand''), the invoice date is the business date. 

==Billing Procedure==
You run the project billing procedure for a project pending billing by opening the project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form and clicking '''Run Project Billing''' on the form toolbar. Depending on the workflow specified for the project, which is based on the state of the '''Create Pro Forma On Billing''' check box (in the '''Billing and Allocation Settings '''section of the '''Summary''' tab), the system creates a pro forma invoice or an accounts receivable invoice with a date that is the same as the '''Next Billing Date''' specified for the project in the same section. For projects with the ''On Demand'' billing period, the date of the prepared invoice is the business date.]]></column>

For a billing rule defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, you specify the sequence of steps in the left pane and the settings of each step in the right pane, including the billing type, which can be ''Time and Material'' or ''Progress Billing''. You specify ''Progress Billing'' rules for project tasks, which are then billed by their progress.[anchor|#_6fb101a7-eb3a-4409-b53b-fd3281977a78]
==The Progress Billing Process==
Progress billing is a simple billing workflow for the projects that are gradually billed at a fixed contract amount. Progress billing does not involve project transactions. The progress billing can be performed for only a project that is pending billing—that is, the project has at least one revenue budget line with the billable project revenue, which is a nonzero '''Pending Invoice Amount''' on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, including a negative amount. {br}

To bill a project task by its progress, you need to create a billing rule on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form and configure a step of the ''Progress Billing'' type in this rule. Then you assign the configured billing rule to project tasks on the '''Tasks''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. {br}

During the project life cycle, you specify the '''Completed (%)''' value on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab for the needed revenue budget lines to indicate that the project tasks are being performed. The system calculates the '''Pending Invoice Amount''' by using the following formula:{br}

{{Pending Invoice Amount = Revised Budgeted Amount * ( Completed (%) / 100 ) - Draft Invoices Amount - Actual Amount}}{br}

Alternatively, you can specify the '''Pending Invoice Amount''' directly in the revenue budget line; the system will calculate the '''Completed (%)''' value accordingly.{br}

When you run the project billing by clicking the '''Run Project Billing''' button on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the system prepares a pro forma invoice or an accounts receivable invoice depending on the project workflow, which is defined by the state of the '''Create Pro Forma On Billing''' check box on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. {br}

The system creates an invoice with the amounts copied from the '''Pending Invoice Amount''' column of the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form for the corresponding revenue budget lines. Once an invoice is prepared, the '''Draft Invoices Amount''' of the revenue budget lines is updated with the amount for which the invoice has been prepared, and the '''Pending Invoice Amount''' becomes zero. In the revenue budget lines that are billed by a billing rule that includes a single step of the ''Progress Billing'' type, the '''Actual Quantity''' is always zero.{br}

During the billing process, the system groups the billable amounts into invoices based on the following:[anchor|#_5649f57c-0644-4b61-bc7b-bf527bccefb4]
*The invoice group of the steps of the billing rules to which the project tasks refer
*The customer
*The customer location
*The '''Bill Separately''' setting of each project task defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form
{br}

If the project billing is performed by using the pro forma invoice workflow, the invoice lines that are produced by the progress billing steps are shown in the prepared pro forma invoice on the '''Progress Billing''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form. If you manually adjust the '''Amount to Invoice''' of a pro forma invoice line, the system automatically recalculates the '''Total Completed (%)'''—the percentage of the revised budgeted amount of the revenue budget line of the project that has been invoiced by all the pro forma invoices of the project, including the current one. However, the system does not update the '''Completed (%)''' of the corresponding revenue budget line on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form accordingly. Also, the system does not update the '''Completed (%)''' of the revenue budget line if the related pro forma invoice with the corresponding progress billing line is deleted. ((({S:Warn}If a project task is billed by a billing rule that has no ''Progress Billing'' step, when the value in the '''Completed (%)''' column is updated on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the system does not recalculate the '''Pending Invoice Amount''' column for the revenue budget line, and the system ignores any pending invoice amount of these lines during the billing process.

You specify  Progress Billing  rules for project tasks,         which are then billed by their progress. The Progress Billing Process Progress billing is a simple billing workflow for the projects that are gradually                 billed at a fixed contract amount. Progress billing does not involve project                 transactions. The progress billing can be performed for only a project that is                 pending billing—that is, the project has at least one revenue budget line with the                 billable project revenue, which is a nonzero  Pending Invoice                     Amount  on the  Revenue Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, including a negative                 amount.  To bill a project task by its progress, you need to create a billing rule on the                       ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules (PM207000) form and                 configure a step of the  Progress Billing  type in this rule. Then you assign                 the configured billing rule to project tasks on the  Tasks  tab                 of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form.  During the project life cycle, you specify the  Completed (%)                  value on the  Revenue Budget  tab for the needed revenue budget                 lines to indicate that the project tasks are being performed. The system calculates                 the  Pending Invoice Amount  by using the following                 formula: Pending Invoice Amount = Revised Budgeted Amount * ( Completed (%) / 100 ) -                     Draft Invoices Amount - Actual Amount Alternatively, you can specify the  Pending Invoice Amount                  directly in the revenue budget line; the system will calculate the                      Completed (%)  value accordingly. When you run the project billing by clicking the  Run Project                     Billing  button on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, the system prepares a pro forma                 invoice or an accounts receivable invoice depending on the project workflow, which                 is defined by the state of the  Create Pro Forma On Billing                  check box on the  Summary  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form.  The system creates an invoice with the amounts copied from the  Pending                     Invoice Amount  column of the  Revenue Budget                  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form for the corresponding                 revenue budget lines. Once an invoice is prepared, the  Draft Invoices                     Amount  of the revenue budget lines is updated with the amount for                 which the invoice has been prepared, and the  Pending Invoice                     Amount  becomes zero. In the revenue budget lines that are billed by                 a billing rule that includes a single step of the  Progress Billing  type, the                      Actual Quantity  is always zero. During the billing process, the system groups the billable amounts into invoices                 based on the following: The invoice group of the steps of the billing rules to which the project                         tasks refer The customer The customer location The  Bill Separately  setting of each project task                         defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) Project Tasks (PM302000)                         form If the project billing is performed by using the pro forma invoice workflow, the                 invoice lines that are produced by the progress billing steps are shown in the                 prepared pro forma invoice on the  Progress Billing  tab of the                       ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form. If you manually                 adjust the  Amount to Invoice  of a pro forma invoice line, the                 system automatically recalculates the  Total Completed (%) —the                 percentage of the revised budgeted amount of the revenue budget line of the project                 that has been invoiced by all the pro forma invoices of the project, including the                 current one. However, the system does not update the  Completed                     (%)  of the corresponding revenue budget line on the                      Revenue Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form accordingly. Also, the system does                 not update the  Completed (%)  of the revenue budget line if                 the related pro forma invoice with the corresponding progress billing line is                 deleted.  If a project task is billed by a billing rule that has no  Progress Billing                  step, when the value in the  Completed (%)  column is updated                 on the  Revenue Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, the system does not recalculate the                      Pending Invoice Amount  column for the revenue budget                 line, and the system ignores any pending invoice amount of these lines during the                 billing process. ]]></column>

==Story==
Suppose that the HM&rsquo;s Bakery and Cafe customer has ordered 20 hours of new-employee training on operating juicers from the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company. The SweetLife project accountant has created a project to handle the tracking and billing of the provided services; the project should be billed on demand as the services are provided. Before each invoice is sent to the customer for payment, the customer has requested that a pro forma invoice be submitted for acceptance.{br}

Then suppose that on ''1/30/2020'', a SweetLife consultant has provided five hours of the training. As the project accountant, you need to update the progress of the project and bill the customer for the provided training. You need to update the progress on the project and bill the customer.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Project Accounting'' feature has been enabled to support the project accounting functionality.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, the ''PROGRESS'' billing rule has been configured.
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form, the ''HMBAKERY'' customer has been created.
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, the ''HMBAKERY3'' project has been created. On the '''Tasks''' tab, the ''TRAINING'' project task has been added, and the ''PROGRESS'' billing rule is specified for this task. Also, on the '''Summary''' tab, the '''Create Pro Forma on Billing''' check box is selected, indicating that a pro forma invoice is created when the project is billed, and the '''Billing Period''' is set to ''On Demand''.
==Process Overview==
You will update the progress of the project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form to indicate that services have been provided partially. Then you will run project billing and review the prepared pro forma invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form. After that, you will release the pro forma invoice, which causes the corresponding accounts receivable invoice to be created. After you review and release the AR invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form, you will review the project and make sure that the project balances have been updated. 
==System Preparation==
To sign in to the system and prepare to perform the instructions of the activity, do the following:[anchor|#_6c9e4914-0e56-4fc0-9f9d-df880dcd99b6]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded; you should sign in as Pam Brawner by using the ''brawner'' username and the ''123'' password.[anchor|#_e491661b-9d08-4dd1-851e-874b2a1d2e5d]
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select ''1/30/2020'' on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.

==Step 1: To Run Project Billing==
To update the progress of project completion and bill the project in an amount corresponding to the progress, do the following:[anchor|#_07d9640b-ec86-4581-a97e-fc752f52e48f]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''HMBAKERY3'' project. 
#On the '''Revenue Budget''' tab, specify <tt>25.00</tt> as the '''Completed (%)''' in the only revenue budget line to indicate that 25 percent of the project task has been completed (5 hours of 20). The system calculates the '''Pending Invoice Amount''' as $250. Because the project has a nonzero '''Pending Invoice Amount''' in the revenue budget line, you can now bill the project.
#Save your changes to the project.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Run Project Billing'''.
#:The system creates a pro forma invoice and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form.

==Step 2: To Process a Pro Forma Invoice and the Corresponding AR Invoice==
To process the pro forma invoice that was prepared when you billed the project, do the following:[anchor|#_24a9a16d-a471-4fed-883d-10d76f7de304]
#While you are still reviewing the prepared pro forma invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form, on the '''Progress Billing''' tab, review the only line. The system has added this line based on the corresponding revenue budget line of the project of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. The '''Amount to Invoice''' in the only progress billing line and the '''Progress Billing Total''' of the invoice are $250.
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and on the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the pro forma invoice. The system closes the pro forma invoice (and assigns it the ''Closed'' status), and creates a corresponding accounts receivable invoice based on the pro forma invoice.
#On the '''Financial Details''' tab, click the link in the '''AR Ref. Nbr.''' box to open the accounts receivable invoice that has been created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form.
#In the Summary area of the form, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and on the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the accounts receivable invoice.

==Step 3: To Review the Updated Project Details==
To review how the project billing has affected the project budget, do the following:[anchor|#_a0783241-81b9-489f-bef5-c34f8f138961]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, open the ''HMBAKERY3'' project.
#On the '''Revenue Budget''' tab, review the only revenue budget line. Notice that the '''Pending Invoice Amount''' is now zero, and the '''Actual Amount''' is $250.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Project Billing: To Bill a Project by Progress The following activity will walk you through the process of billing a project by its                 progress. The following activity is             based on the  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system             settings have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the             activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100              dataset to its initial state. Story Suppose that the HM's Bakery and Cafe customer has ordered 20 hours of new-employee                 training on operating juicers from the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company.

You need to update the progress on the project                 and bill the customer. Configuration Overview For the purposes of this activity, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000)                 form, the  Project Accounting  feature has been enabled to support the project                 accounting functionality. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules (PM207000) form, the  PROGRESS  billing                 rule has been configured. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000) form, the  HMBAKERY  customer                 has been created. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, the  HMBAKERY3  project                 has been created. On the  Tasks  tab, the  TRAINING                  project task has been added, and the  PROGRESS  billing rule is specified for                 this task. Also, on the  Summary  tab, the  Create                     Pro Forma on Billing  check box is selected, indicating that a pro                 forma invoice is created when the project is billed, and the  Billing                     Period  is set to  On Demand . Process Overview You will update the progress of the project on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects                 (PM301000) form to indicate that services have been provided partially. Then you                 will run project billing and review the prepared pro forma invoice on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form. After that, you will release the pro                 forma invoice, which causes the corresponding accounts receivable invoice to be                 created. After you review and release the AR invoice on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form, you will review the project and make                 sure that the project balances have been updated.  System Preparation To sign in to the system and prepare to perform the instructions of the activity, do                 the following: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the  U100  dataset preloaded; you                     should sign in as Pam Brawner by using the  brawner  username and the                          123  password. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP             screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to  1/30/2020. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and             select  1/30/2020 on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and             process all documents in the system during this business date. Step 1: To Run Project Billing To update the progress of project completion and bill the project in an amount                 corresponding to the progress, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, open the                          HMBAKERY3  project.  On the  Revenue Budget  tab, specify                          25.00  as the  Completed (%)  in                     the only revenue budget line to indicate that 25 percent of the project task has                     been completed (5 hours of 20). The system calculates the  Pending                         Invoice Amount  as $250. Because the project has a nonzero                          Pending Invoice Amount  in the revenue budget line,                     you can now bill the project. Save your changes to the project. On the form toolbar, click  Run Project Billing . The                         system creates a pro forma invoice and opens it on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form. Step 2: To Process a Pro Forma Invoice and the Corresponding AR Invoice To process the pro forma invoice that was prepared when you billed the  project, do                 the following: While you are still reviewing the prepared pro forma invoice on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form, on the  Progress                         Billing  tab, review the only line. The system has added this                     line based on the corresponding revenue budget line of the project of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form. The  Amount to Invoice                      in the only progress billing line and the  Progress Billing                         Total  of the invoice are $250. In the Summary area, clear the  Hold  check box, and on the                     form toolbar, click  Release  to release the pro forma                     invoice. The system closes the pro forma invoice (and assigns it the                          Closed  status), and creates a corresponding accounts receivable                     invoice based on the pro forma invoice. On the  Financial Details  tab, click the link in the                          AR Ref. Nbr.  box to open the accounts receivable                     invoice that has been created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000)                     form. In the Summary area of the form, clear the  Hold  check                     box, and on the form toolbar, click  Release  to release                     the accounts receivable invoice. Step 3: To Review the Updated Project Details To review how the project billing has affected the project budget, do the                 following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, open the  HMBAKERY3                      project. On the  Revenue Budget  tab, review the only revenue budget                     line. Notice that the  Pending Invoice Amount  is now zero,                     and the  Actual Amount  is $250.

For a billing rule defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, you specify the sequence of steps in the left pane and the settings of each step in the right pane, including the billing type, which can be ''Time and Material'' or ''Progress Billing''. You specify ''Time and Material'' rules for project tasks, which are then billed for time and material.[anchor|#_918632ba-5eff-4a97-bdfe-4e8e2ab5e29e]
==The Time and Material Billing Process==
The time and material billing workflow is provided for project tasks that require to be billed based on project transactions. Time and material billing can be performed for only for project tasks of a project that is pending billing—that is, the project has at least one unbilled transaction that is ready to be billed on the invoice date. The ''Time and Material'' billing steps can be run once the project transactions that match the selection criteria have been processed. Optionally, the allocation process can be executed for these transactions before billing.{br}

To bill a project task for time and material, you need to create a billing rule on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form and configure a step or multiple steps of the ''Time and Material'' type in this rule. Multiple ''Time and Material'' steps are used in a billing rule for different account groups of transactions that should be used to determine the invoiced amounts by different formulas. You assign the configured billing rule to project tasks on the '''Tasks''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. {br}

When you run the project billing by clicking the '''Run Project Billing''' button on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the system prepares a pro forma invoice or an accounts receivable invoice, depending on the project workflow, which is defined by the state of the '''Create Pro Forma On Billing''' check box on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. {br}

The system creates an invoice based on the unbilled project transactions with amounts calculated by the billing rules of the project tasks. In the billing, the system includes the transactions with a date that is earlier than the billing date and does not include the transactions with the date that is later than the billing date. The transactions with the same date as the invoice date are billed if ''Include Trans. created on billing date'' is selected as the '''Billing Cut-off Date''' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form; if ''Exclude Trans. created on billing date'' is selected, the system skips the transactions with the same date as the invoice date.{br}

During the billing process, the system groups the billable amounts into separate invoices based on the following:[anchor|#_8d77ebe5-d9ea-47bb-9c2b-d30ade06f500]
*The invoice group of the steps of the billing rules to which the project tasks refer
*The customer
*The customer location
*The '''Bill Separately''' setting of each project task defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form
{br}

If the project billing is performed by using the pro forma invoice workflow, the invoice lines that are produced by the ''Time and Material'' billing steps are displayed on the '''Time and Material''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form.]]></column>

))){br}{TOC}
==Story==
Suppose that the HM&rsquo;s Bakery and Cafe customer has ordered a juicer from the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company, along with the services of installation and employee training on operating the juicer. SweetLife&rsquo;s project accountant has created the project to handle the tracking and billing of the juicer and the provided services. Also, the project accountant has entered a project transaction to record the delivery and installation of the juicer, and eight hours of training have been provided by SweetLife consultants. Acting as the project accountant, you need to bill the customer for the project so that the billing includes the materials used and the work time spent on the project. 
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Project Accounting'' feature has been enabled to support the project accounting functionality.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, the ''TM'' billing rule has been configured. The billing rule includes three steps, each billing a particular account group (''MATERIAL'', ''LABOR'', and ''SUBCON''); for each group, the amount to be invoiced is calculated by multiplying the project transaction amount by 1.25.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form, the ''HMBAKERY'' customer has been defined. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, the ''HMBAKERY4'' project has been created for this customer, and the ''PHASE1'' and ''PHASE2'' tasks have been added to the project. On the '''Tasks''' tab, the ''TM'' billing rule has been specified for both project tasks. Also, on the '''Summary''' tab, the '''Create Pro Forma on Billing''' check box is selected, indicating that a pro forma invoice is created when the project is billed.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) form, the ''PM00000007'' batch of project transactions related to the project has been created and released to record the services provided for the project.
==Process Overview==
You will run the project billing on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, which causes the system to create a pro forma invoice. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form, you will review this pro forma invoice and release it. Then you will review the corresponding accounts receivable invoice and release it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form, and review how this affects the project’s actual values.
==System Preparation==
To sign in to the system and prepare to perform the instructions of the activity, do the following:[anchor|#_6c9e4914-0e56-4fc0-9f9d-df880dcd99b6]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded as Pam Brawner; you should sign in by using the ''brawner'' username and the ''123'' password.[anchor|#_ffa91976-12dc-49f9-a3c6-daaa9fe472f1]
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select ''1/30/2020'' on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.

==Step 1: Billing the Project and Processing the Related Documents==
To bill the project, do the following:[anchor|#_9f696cdd-e903-4dd0-aac2-7488eef7a7e2]
#In the Selection area on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_10_00|Project Transaction Details] ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) form, select ''HMBAKERY4'' as the '''Project'''. The table lists the related project transactions: 
#*The ''JUICER15'' line in the amount of $2000
#*The ''TRAINING'' line in the amount of $320
#*Two lines with the ''INSTALL'' item: the line related to the ''PHASE1'' project task in the amount of $80, and the line related to the ''PHASE2'' project task in the amount of $240
#:Notice that in all lines, the '''Billed''' check box is cleared, indicating that the project is pending billing.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''HMBAKERY4'' project. In the Summary area, notice that the actual expenses of the project are $2,640 (which is the total of the processed project transactions), while the actual income of the project is $0 because the project has not been not billed yet.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Run Project Billing'''. The system creates a pro forma invoice and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form.
#On the '''Time and Material''' tab of the form, review the lines that the system has created based on the project transactions. The pro forma invoice includes three lines:
#*The ''JUICER15'' line with the billed amount of $2500
#*The ''TRAINING'' line with the billed amount of $400
#*The ''INSTALL'' line (which aggregates two project transactions) in the amount of $400
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and on the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the pro forma invoice. The system closes the pro forma invoice (and assigns it the ''Closed'' status) and creates a corresponding accounts receivable invoice based on the pro forma invoice.
#On the '''Financial Details''' tab, click the link in the '''AR Ref. Nbr.''' box to open the accounts receivable invoice that was created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form.
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and on the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the accounts receivable invoice.

==Step 2: Reviewing the Project Transactions and the Updated Project Balance==
To review the project transactions and project balance, do the following:[anchor|#_8249a98b-7b80-4dcd-a454-657d915d0c24]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_10_00|Project Transaction Details] ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) form, in the Selection area, select ''HMBAKERY4'' as the '''Project'''. In the table, review the project transactions that have been created based on the released accounts receivable invoice (these are the lines that have ''AR'' specified in the '''Module''' column). In the '''GL Batch Nbr.''' column, the reference number of the corresponding GL batch is shown. Also notice that the project transactions based on which you have performed time and material billing now have the '''Billed''' check box selected, indicating that these transactions have been billed.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''HMBAKERY4'' project. In the Summary area, notice that the actual income is now $3300. On the '''Revenue Budget''' tab, notice that the system has automatically created two revenue budget lines (one for each project task), and filled in the '''Actual Amount''' for the rows.
#On the '''Balances''' tab (see the following screenshot), review the project income and expenses aggregated by account groups.

Step 2: Reviewing the Project Transactions and the Updated Project                 Balance To review the project transactions and project balance, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) Project Transaction Details (PM401000) form, in the Selection area,                     select  HMBAKERY4  as the  Project . In the table,                     review the project transactions that have been created based on the released                     accounts receivable invoice (these are the lines that have  AR  specified                     in the  Module  column). In the  GL Batch                         Nbr.  column, the reference number of the corresponding GL batch                     is shown. Also notice that the project transactions based on which you have                     performed time and material billing now have the  Billed                      check box selected, indicating that these transactions have been billed. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, open the                          HMBAKERY4  project. In the Summary area, notice that the actual income                     is now $3300. On the  Revenue Budget  tab, notice that the                     system has automatically created two revenue budget lines (one for each project                     task), and filled in the  Actual Amount  for the rows.

==Story==
Suppose that the Thai Food Restaurant customer has ordered a juicer from the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company, along with installation of the juicer and training of the company&rsquo;s employees on operating the juicer. The SweetLife project accountant has created a project to handle the tracking and billing of the juicer and the provided services. Both companies have agreed that the customer will be billed in two stages. At the end of the first stage, the customer will pay for 40 percent of the services, which have a fixed price, and for the juicer (which is installed during the first stage). At the end of the second stage (after the project is completed), the customer will pay for the remainder of the project.{br}

Then suppose that on ''1/30/2020'', the juicer has been delivered and installed. Acting as the project accountant, you need to update the progress of the project, process the issue of the juicer, and bill the customer for the first stage of the project. 
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, the following features have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form:[anchor|#_4387db18-6b29-4015-8d96-56b9069f20d7]
*''Project Accounting'', which provides support for the project accounting functionality
*''Inventory and Order Management'' feature, which provides the ability to maintain stock items and create and process sales orders and purchase orders

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form, the ''TOMYUM'' customer has been defined. {br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, the ''TOMYUM2'' project has been created for this customer, and two project tasks (''PHASE1'' and ''PHASE2'') have been added. Also, on the '''Summary''' tab, the '''Create Pro Forma on Billing''' check box is selected, indicating that a pro forma invoice is created when the project is billed.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, the ''COMBINED'' billing rule has been created; it has been assigned to both project tasks of the ''TOMYUM2'' project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. 
==Process Overview==
You will issue the stock item for the project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form to record the sale of a juicer. You will update the progress of the project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form and run the project billing. You will review the created pro forma invoice and release it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form to create the corresponding accounts receivable invoice. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form, you will review the prepared accounts receivable invoice, and release the invoice. Finally, you will review the project to make that the release of the AR invoice has caused the system to correctly update the actual amounts of the project.
==System Preparation==
To sign in to the system and prepare to perform the instructions of the activity, do the following:[anchor|#_6c9e4914-0e56-4fc0-9f9d-df880dcd99b6]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded; you should sign in as Pam Brawner by using the ''brawner'' username and the ''123'' password.[anchor|#_7aabdef0-1527-49ca-a317-c2b952550e60]
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select ''1/30/2020'' on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.

==Step 1: Issuing a Stock Item for the Project==
To directly issue a stock item for the project (to record that the juicer that has been delivered to the customer) and capture the issued cost on the project, do the following:[anchor|#_9f696cdd-e903-4dd0-aac2-7488eef7a7e2]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form, create a new inventory issue, and in the Summary area, type <tt>A juicer for Thai Food Restaurant</tt> in the '''Description''' box.
#On the table toolbar of the '''Transaction Details''' tab, click '''Add Row''', and specify the following settings in the row:
#*'''Inventory ID''': ''JUICER15''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>1.00</tt>
#*'''Unit Price''': <tt>2,500</tt>
#*'''Reason Code''': ''INISSUEPROJ''
#* '''Project''': ''TOMYUM2''
#* '''Project Task''': ''PHASE1''
#:Notice that '''Unit Cost''' in the line is $2,000.
#Save the inventory issue, and release it.
#In the Summary area on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_10_00|Project Transaction Details] ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) form, specify ''TOMYUM2'' as the '''Project''' and ''JUICER15'' as the '''Inventory ID'''. 
#Review the only line in the table; this is the project transaction that has been generated on release of the inventory issue. The '''Amount''' of the transaction is $2000, and the '''Billed''' check box is cleared.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''TOMYUM2'' project.
#On the '''Cost Budget''' tab, make sure that the line with ''JUICER15'' was created based on the inventory issue you have released. The '''Actual Amount''' of the line is $2,000, which is the amount of the related project transaction.

==Step 2: Billing the Project==
To update the progress of project completion and bill the project, do the following:[anchor|#_9344a764-ce38-4b3f-9808-5a62da64a805]
#While you are still reviewing the ''TOMYUM2'' project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab, specify <tt>40.00</tt> as the '''Completed (%)''' of each revenue budget line. Notice that the system calculates the '''Pending Invoice Amount''' for each line ($112 for the ''PHASE1'' project task, and $160 for the ''PHASE2'' project task).
#Save your changes to the project, and on the form toolbar, click '''Run Project Billing'''. The system creates a pro forma invoice and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form.
#On the '''Progress Billing''' tab, review the invoice lines. The '''Amount to Invoice''' in each line is equal to the '''Pending Invoice Amount''' of the corresponding revenue budget line of the ''TOMYUM2'' project on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form.
#On the '''Time and Material''' tab, notice that the system has generated a line with the ''JUICER15'' item. 
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and on the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the pro forma invoice. The system creates the accounts receivable invoice based on the pro forma invoice and assigns the ''Closed'' status to the pro forma invoice.
#On the '''Financial Details''' tab, click the link in the '''AR Ref. Nbr.''' box to open the accounts receivable invoice that has been created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form. The AR invoice has three lines: two lines that have been generated with the progress billing step of the billing rule (in the amounts of $112 and $160), and a line generated by the time and material step in the amount of $2,500.
#In the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] form, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and on the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the accounts receivable invoice.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, open the ''TOMYUM2'' project, and on the '''Balances''' tab (see the following screenshot), review the amounts in the budget lines that have been updated as the result of the billing. '''Actual Amount''' for the ''REVENUE'' group is $2,772, which is the sum of the price of the juicer ($2,500) and 40 percent of the price of the services ($112 + $160); '''Actual Amount''' for the ''MATERIAL'' group is $2,000, which is the cost of the juicer.

)))
Each recurring billing line defines the rules the system uses to create the corresponding invoice line during the project billing. For each line, you specify the following settings:[anchor|#_1543677e-71bd-426b-a8d2-755dfd2e0ab3]
*A non-stock item that represents a service or labor of recurring billing to track employee and equipment work time.
*The flat price that is charged once each billing period.
*Optional: The number of units included in the item fee. For instance, you may have an agreement with the customer to provide 40 hours of road scraper work at a flat price, while any extra hours are charged on a per-hour basis. These 40 hours would be included in the recurring billing line and the extra hours would be billed separately.
*The option that determines the frequency of recurring billing usage. You can select one of the following options: the recurring billing is performed only once during the project lifecycle for the next project billing or it is used each time the project billing is performed.

The recurring billing is invoked on project billing and does not depend on any of the billing rule settings. However, a billing rule with at least one step, for example, a progress billing step, is required for the project task to make the system produce an invoice even with a single recurring billing line.]]></column>

You can also set up recurring billing for project template tasks on the      Recurring Billing  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM208010|PM208010]) Project Template Tasks (PM208010) form. Each recurring billing line defines the rules the system uses to create the corresponding    invoice line during the project billing. For each line, you specify the following settings: A non-stock item that represents a service or labor of recurring billing to track employee     and equipment work time. The flat price that is charged once each billing period. Optional: The number of units included in the item fee. For instance, you may have an     agreement with the customer to provide 40 hours of road scraper work at a flat price, while any     extra hours are charged on a per-hour basis. These 40 hours would be included in the recurring     billing line and the extra hours would be billed separately. The option that determines the frequency of recurring billing usage. You can select one of     the following options: the recurring billing is performed only once during the project lifecycle     for the next project billing or it is used each time the project billing is performed. The recurring billing is invoked on project billing and does not depend on any of the billing    rule settings. However, a billing rule with at least one step, for example, a progress billing    step, is required for the project task to make the system produce an invoice even with a single    recurring billing line. ]]></column>

==Story==
Suppose that the Thai Food Restaurant customer recently ordered eight hours of training on how to use a juicer it had previously bought from the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company. SweetLife&rsquo;s project accountant created a project for this training, a consultant of SweetLife provided the training, and the project accountant billed the customer. {br}

Then suppose that the project accountant has realized that the consultant provided six hours of training instead of eight, so the company overcharged the customer by $100. Acting as the project accountant, you need to correct the actual amount of the project and create a credit memo for the project.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Project Accounting'' feature has been enabled to provide support for the project accounting functionality.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, the ''TOMYUM11'' project has been created and the ''TRAINING'' project task has been created for the project. On the '''Summary''' tab ('''Billing and Allocation Settings''' section), the '''Create Pro Forma on Billing''' check box has been selected for the project.{br}

For the project, the ''000004'' pro forma invoice and the corresponding ''000075'' accounts receivable invoice have been created and released on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) forms, respectively.
==Process Overview==
In this activity, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, you will update the pending invoice amount of the project with a negative amount and initiate project billing. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form, which is brought up, you will review the pro forma invoice and release it. You will then review the credit memo that was created based on the pro forma invoice and release the credit memo on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form.
==System Preparation==
To sign in to the system and prepare to perform the instructions of the activity, do the following:[anchor|#_5e4e87f1-6fe1-4688-b21b-a3ae5c8f4117]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website and sign in as Pam Brawner using the ''brawner'' username and ''123'' password.[anchor|#_a23bd933-edc2-40f4-bafd-8bb6110c0838]
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select ''1/30/2020'' on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.

==Step 1: Creating a Credit Memo for the Project==
To create a credit memo for the extra $100 that was billed for the project, do the following:[anchor|#_9344a764-ce38-4b3f-9808-5a62da64a805]

#*In the Summary area, notice that the actual income of the project is $400.
#On the '''Revenue Budget''' tab, specify <tt>–100.00</tt> as the '''Pending Invoice Amount''' of the revenue budget line. 
#Save your changes to the project.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Run Project Billing'''.
#:The system creates a pro forma invoice and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form.

#:((({S:Hint}If the '''Invoice Total''' of a pro forma invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] form becomes negative (for example, if you have added a negative adjustment line in an amount greater than the total amount of billable lines), the system creates an accounts receivable credit memo when the pro forma invoice is released.
)))
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and on the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the pro forma invoice.
#:The system creates the credit memo based on the pro forma invoice and assigns the ''Closed'' status to the pro forma invoice.
#On the '''Financial Details''' tab, click the link in the '''AR Ref. Nbr.''' box to open the credit memo that has been created for the pro forma invoice.
#In the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form, which the system has opened in a pop-up window, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and on the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the credit memo.
#:((({S:Warn}In the next step, which is beyond the scope of this activity, an accounts receivable clerk would apply the created credit memo to the original invoice that has been corrected.
)))
#Close the pop-up window with the form.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, open the ''TOMYUM11'' project
#:In the Summary area, notice that the actual income of the project, which has been updated as a result of the billing, is $300.
#:On the '''Invoices''' tab, notice that the credit memo and the corresponding pro forma invoice have appeared in the table, as shown in the screenshot below.

On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, the  TOMYUM11          project has been created and the  TRAINING  project task has been created for the         project. On the  Summary  tab ( Billing and Allocation           Settings  section), the  Create Pro Forma on Billing          check box has been selected for the project. For the project, the  000004  pro forma invoice and the corresponding  000075          accounts receivable invoice have been created and released on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) and   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) forms, respectively. Process Overview In this activity, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, you         will update the pending invoice amount of the project with a negative amount and initiate         project billing. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form, which         is brought up, you will review the pro forma invoice and release it. You will then review         the credit memo that was created based on the pro forma invoice and release the credit memo         on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form. System Preparation To sign in to the system and prepare to perform the instructions of the activity, do the         following: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website and sign in as Pam Brawner using the  brawner  username and  123            password. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP             screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to  1/30/2020. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and             select  1/30/2020 on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and             process all documents in the system during this business date. Step 1: Creating a Credit Memo for the Project To create a credit memo for the extra $100 that was billed for the project, do the         following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, open the              TOMYUM11  project, and do the following: On the  Invoices  tab, notice that a pro forma invoice with the                  Сlosed  status that has been created for the project (indicating that it was               released) has the corresponding accounts receivable invoice with the  Open                status. In the Summary area, notice that the actual income of the project is $400. On the  Revenue Budget  tab, specify              –100.00  as the  Pending Invoice             Amount  of the revenue budget line.  Save your changes to the project. On the form toolbar, click  Run Project Billing . The system             creates a pro forma invoice and opens it on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form. In the Summary area, notice             that the  Invoice Total  is negative and equals the amount you have             specified for the revenue budget line of the project:  –100.00 . If             the  Invoice Total  of a pro forma invoice on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices form becomes negative  (for example, if you have added a             negative adjustment line in an amount greater than the total amount of billable lines),             the system creates an accounts receivable credit memo when the pro forma invoice is             released. In the Summary area, clear the  Hold  check box, and on the form           toolbar, click  Release  to release the pro forma invoice. The             system creates the credit memo based on the pro forma invoice and assigns the                Closed  status to the pro forma invoice. On the  Financial Details  tab, click the link in the  AR             Ref. Nbr.  box to open the credit memo that has been created for the pro           forma invoice. In the Summary area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form,           which the system has opened in a pop-up window, clear the  Hold            check box, and on the form toolbar, click  Release  to release the           credit memo. In the next step, which is beyond the scope of this activity, an             accounts receivable clerk would apply the created credit memo to the original invoice             that has been corrected. Close the pop-up window with the form. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, open the  TOMYUM11              project In the Summary area, notice that the actual income of the project, which has             been updated as a result of the billing, is $300. On the                Invoices  tab, notice that the credit memo and the corresponding             pro forma invoice have appeared in the table, as shown in the screenshot below. The credit memo created for the project ]]></column>

In Acumatica ERP, you can use the time reporting functionality to give employees the ability to report the time that they spend for the project. During project billing, you can bill customers for this time.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#_563146da-8465-40f9-835b-74c10a31f02a]
*Enter a billable time activity related to a project, and log the time spent for the project
*Enter a billable time card related to a project, and log the time spent for the project
*Bill a project for employees’ time spent working on it

==Applicable Scenarios==
You are an employee who needs to log work time spent on particular project.{br}

You are a project accountant, and you need to bill the customer for employee time that was spent for a particular project and logged by using time cards.[anchor|#section_n4l_212_fmb]
==Entry of Time Tracking Documents==
In Acumatica ERP, employees can report their work time by creating time cards that include separate detail records associated with different projects or project tasks. {br}

A time card, which an employee enters on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_50_00|Employee Time Card] ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]) form, is a weekly report on the time an employee has spent on each activity. In each line of a time card, the following information is specified:[anchor|#ul_tws_vgk_fmb]
*The earning type, which defines whether the reported work should be billed
*The project and project task to which the reported hours relate
*The labor item assigned to the employee who performed the work
*The time spent on each day of the week for which the time card is prepared

When the time card is released, the related project transaction is created, so that the logged employee time is tracked in the related project and can then be billed. Also, on release of the time card, for each day of the week with reported time, a separate time activity is created and released. {br}

You can review the list of time activities related to a project on the '''Activity History''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. In addition, if time tracking with time activities is configured, on this tab, you can add an individual project-related activity to the selected project by clicking '''Add Activity''' on the table toolbar and selecting the type of activity to be created. Then you enter the details of the time activity on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_10|Activity] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306010|CR306010]) form, which opens, and complete the activity to submit it. The reported data from the time activity becomes available in the employee time card; the time activity must be released within this time card.[anchor|#section_v1m_bjk_fmb]
==Workflow of a Time Card Submitting==
For a project-related time card, the processing involves the actions and generated documents shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#fig_egg_djk_fmb][anchor|#image_fgg_djk_fmb][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_Projects_Tracking_Time.png|popup|450px][anchor|#section_qld_spy_2mb]
==Billing Employee Time in Projects==
Once time tracking is configured for projects, and the system is configured to generate transactions from time activities, the working time reported by employees is tracked in the related projects and can be billed automatically during the project billing procedure.
Each line of a time card is a time activity. On release of a time card with project-related lines, the system generates project transactions for each time activity within a time card (except for the time card lines that are not associated with any project; a general ledger transaction is instead generated for these lines). This extra step between the release of the time-tracking document and the updating of balances of general ledger accounts makes it possible to define labor costs and bill customers based on these costs and the quantity of working hours reported by employees for the project. The system further processes the project transactions originating from a time card based on the allocation or billing rules assigned to the project tasks of the project to which this transactions relates. ]]></column>

You will create a project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form and add a project task to it. Then you will create and release a time card on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_40_60_00|Employee Time Cards] ([~/?ScreenId=EP406000|EP406000]) form. You will review the project transaction generated based on the time card on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]). Next, you will bill the project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, and release both the prepared pro forma invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form and the AR invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form. Finally, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, you will make sure that the project cost and revenue budget have been updated with the billed employee time.
==System Preparation==
To sign in to the system and prepare to perform the instructions of the activity, do the following:[anchor|#_5e4e87f1-6fe1-4688-b21b-a3ae5c8f4117]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded. You should sign in as Pam Brawner by using the ''brawner'' username and the ''123'' password.
#Configure the labor cost rate for the ''CONSULTSR'' labor item and ''EP00000003 – Jon Waite'' employee by following the instructions in [HelpRoot_Projects\Non_Stock_Item_Projects_Implem_Activity_LaborCostRates|Labor Items: To Define Labor Cost Rates].

==Step 1: Creating a Project==
To create a project, do the following:[anchor|#ol_hxb_32q_wbb]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, create a project, and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Project ID''': <tt>TRAINLAKE</tt>
#*'''Customer''': ''LAKECAFE - Lake Cafe''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Training project for Lake Cafe</tt>
#On the '''Summary''' tab ('''Billing and Allocation Settings''' section), select ''On Demand ''in the '''Billing Period''' box.
#On the '''Tasks''' tab, click''' Add Row''', and specify the following settings in the row:
#*'''Project Task''': ''TRAINING''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Employee training on juicer usage</tt>
#*'''Billing Rule''': ''TM''

#*'''Task ID''':''TRAINING''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''CONSULTSR''
#* '''Original Budgeted Quantity''': <tt>40.00</tt>
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and save the project (which now has the ''Active'' status).

You have created the project and the ''TRAINING'' task, and have added a cost budget line. 
==Step 2: Entering an Employee Time Card==
In this step, you will enter Jon Waite&rsquo;s working hours for the project by creating an employee time card as follows:[anchor|#_2231354b-f499-429c-83df-ce9c3cb486d2]
#Sign out of Acumatica ERP, and then sign in as Jon Waite by using the ''waite'' username and the ''123'' password.[anchor|#_b89fe87c-049c-4d4c-9a3a-4b75df281232]
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select ''1/30/2020'' on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.
#On the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_40_60_00|Employee Time Cards] ([~/?ScreenId=EP406000|EP406000]) form, click '''Add New Timecard''' to create a new time card. The system opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_50_00|Employee Time Card] ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]) form with the new time card created for the employee who is currently signed in. 
#In the Summary area, make sure that ''2020-05 (01/26 - 02/01)'' is specified in the '''Week''' box. This is the work week during which the work for the project has been performed.
#On the '''Summary''' tab, add a row, and specify the following settings:
#*'''Earning Type''': ''RG''
#* '''Project''': ''TRAINLAKE''
#* '''Project Task''': ''TRAINING''
#* '''Labor Item''': ''CONSULTSR'' (selected automatically)
#*'''Mon''': <tt>3</tt>
#*'''Tue''': <tt>5</tt>
#*'''Thu''': <tt>8</tt>
#*'''Time Spent''': ''16:00'' (calculated automatically)
#*:When you enter hours in the columns representing the days of the week for any row, the system also calculates the '''Time Spent''' in the Summary area as the sum of all these columns. 
#*'''Billable''': Selected (selected automatically based on the settings of the selected earning type)
#*'''Description''': <tt>Training provided by senior consultant</tt>
#*'''Approval Status''': ''Not Required'' (selected automatically)
#Save the time card.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Submit''' to submit the time card. The status of the time card is changed to ''Approved''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Release''' to release the time card; its status is changed to ''Released''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''View Transactions'''. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) form, the system opens the project transaction that has been generated based on the released time card. Notice that the system has created a separate project transaction line for each time activity within the time card. The total billable quantity of the transaction is 16, which is the quantity of reported hours, and the total amount is calculated based on the billable quantity and employee labor cost as follows:
#:{{16.00 * 44.00 = 704.00}}

You have created time cards and then approved and released them, which has updated the cost budget of the project. 
==Step 3: Billing the Project==
To review the cost budget of the project and bill the project on behalf of the project accountant, do the following:[anchor|#ol_tgh_3kf_zbb]
#Again sign in to Acumatica ERP as Pam Brawner (with the ''brawner'' username and the ''123'' password).
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''TRAINLAKE'' project.
#:On the '''Cost Budget''' tab, notice that the system has updated the actual quantity and amount with the data of the project transaction that was generated on release of the time card, as shown in the screenshot below.[anchor|#_06681df3-f2fd-438e-9033-b32e227290ba][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_Tracking_Process_Activity_CostBudgetUpd.png|popup|The cost budget updated based on the released time card|450px]
#On the form toolbar, click '''Run Project Billing'''. The system creates a pro forma invoice and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form.
#:On the '''Time and Material''' tab of this form, notice that based on the settings of the step of the ''TM'' billing rule that processes the project transactions associated with the ''LABOR'' account group, the invoiced amount for each line has been calculated as the amount of the related project transaction line (that is, the cost of the provided employee labor) multiplied by 1.25. The total invoiced amount is $880 ($704.00 &#42; 1.25).
#Clear the '''Hold''' check box in the Summary area, and click '''Release''' on the form toolbar to release the pro forma invoice.
#On the '''Financial Details''' tab, click the link in the '''AR Ref. Nbr.''' box to open the accounts receivable invoice that the system has created based on the pro forma invoice.
# In the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and on the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the AR invoice.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''TRAINLAKE'' project, and in the line with the ''REVENUE'' item on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab, make sure that the '''Actual Amount''' is now $880.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Employee Time Billing: Process Activity The following activity will walk you through the process of billing employee time                 spent on a particular project. The following activity is             based on the  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system             settings have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the             activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100              dataset to its initial state. Story Suppose that Lake Cafe has requested 40 hours of training on operating juicers that                 were previously purchased from and installed by the SweetLife Fruit & Jams                 compa ny.                  On                          1/30/2020,                  Jon Waite, a SweetLife senior consultant, has provided 16 hours of training (three                 hours on Monday, five hours on Tuesday, and eight hours on Thursday).  Acting as a SweetLife project accountant, Pam Brawner, you need to create a project                 to account for the provided services. Then acting as Jon Waite, you need to enter a                 time card to log the work related to the project. Finally, again acting as Pam                 Brawner, you need to bill the project and review the invoice prepared for the                 customer. You will perform the needed actions in the system, acting as the project                 accountant and the employee. Configuration Overview For the purposes of this activity, the  Project Accounting  feature has been                 enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form.

On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules (PM207000) form, the  TM  billing rule                 has been created, and a step for billing project transactions associated with the                      LABOR  account group has been added to the rule. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000) form, the  LAKECAFE - Lake                     Cafe  customer has been created. Process Overview You will create a project on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form and                 add a project task to it. Then you will create and release a time card on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP406000|EP406000]) Employee Time Cards (EP406000) form. You will review the project                 transaction generated based on the time card on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) Project Transactions                 (PM304000). Next, you will bill the project on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects                 form, and release both the prepared pro forma invoice on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form and the AR invoice on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form. Finally, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, you will make sure that the project cost and                 revenue budget have been updated with the billed employee time.

You must establish an adequate pricing model in the project you are managing to ensure that business outcomes are met, the project budget is used effectively, and project revenues and costs are properly balanced. In Acumatica ERP, you can implement virtually any pricing model by using rate tables, and use billing rates for configuring complex billing rules. {br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Create a rate table and rate type
*Define a rate sequence
*Define a rate table with particular rates
*Use billing rates for billing projects

==Applicable Scenarios==
You configure and use billing rates if you need to bill the project to take into account various combinations of factors, such as the following:[anchor|#ul_xx5_xqj_smb]
*The particular project tasks, account groups, and inventory items involved
*The employees participating
*The dates when the work has been performed

==Rate Configuration==
To support an enhanced pricing policy for projects, you configure billing rates and use them in billing or allocation rules. To refer to a particular billing rate in the formulas of billing or allocation rules, you use the ''@Rate'' parameter. You can specify this parameter as a multiplier, addend, or constant in the '''Invoice Description Formula''', '''Line Quantity Formula''', '''Line Amount Formula''', or '''Line Description Formula''' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form; you can also specify the parameter in the '''Quantity Formula''','''Billable Qty. Formula''', '''Amount Formula''', or ''' Description Formula''' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_75_00|Allocation Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207500|PM207500]) form.{br}

The process of defining a rate includes the configuration of rate tables, rate types, rate codes, and rate sequences. A rate table is a set of billing rates that the system uses in formulas of the billing rules during the billing of a project or the allocation rules during transaction allocation. A billing rate is an exact value used for calculating the amount and quantity of the invoice lines that are created by the billing rule steps of the ''Time and Material'' type. {br}

Each rate table includes the definition of rates of all the rate types defined in the system. You can create a single rate table to be used for all projects, or define multiple rate tables to easily maintain different rates for the projects based on the customer for which the project is provided (for example, you can create different rate tables if you use different pricing models for local customers and remote customers).{br}

In a rate table, for each rate type, you can define any number of rate sequences that include multiple factors that may affect the rates. These factors can include projects, project tasks, employees, account groups, or inventory items. You narrow the applicability of the rate based on the combination of factors you select. For example, you can configure a separate billing rate for particular tasks of specific projects if particular employees work on these project tasks. A billing rate could also be defined for a particular date range; a rate table may include multiple rates with different effective dates. {br}

Also, in each rate table, you can add rate codes, which represent an additional dimension in a rate table that you use to simplify the configuration of the rate table. By using rate codes, you can reduce the number of sequences that need to be configured for each pair of rate table and rate type. For example, instead of creating multiple sequences, each including the applicable rates for a particular employee, you can create only one rate sequence with the '''Employee''' check box selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_50_00|Rate Lookup Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM205000|PM205000]) form and create separate rate codes for each employee.
==Workflow of Rate Table Configuration ==
You configure a rate table with rates by performing the following general steps:[anchor|#ol_xdv_ctn_3n]
#You create an empty entity that will contain the new rate table on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_42_00|Rate Tables] ([~/?ScreenId=PM204200|PM204200]) form. Later, during project creation, a user will assign a particular rate table to each of the project tasks. 
#You create an empty entity that will contain a new rate type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_41_00|Rate Types] ([~/?ScreenId=PM204100|PM204100]) form. Before creating the rate type, you need to plan how many and which rate types you will need in billing and allocation rules. (Typically, different rates are used for billing of labor costs, revenues, and expenses.) When you configure billing or allocation rules, you will assign different rate types to different steps of these rules.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_50_00|Rate Lookup Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM205000|PM205000]) form, you create rate sequences for each combination of rate table and rate type. Each sequence defines a group of options based on which the system will select the billing rate. You can select any combination of the ''Project'', ''Project task'', ''Account group'', ''Inventory item'', and ''Employee'' options. The sequence number specified in the '''Sequence''' column in the table defines the order in which the system will search for the rate in that row (starting from the sequence with the lowest number in the table).
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_60_00|Rate Tables] ([~/?ScreenId=PM206000|PM206000]) form, for each combination of rate table, rate type, and rate code, you select a rate sequence in the '''Sequence''' box. You select an existing rate code, or you create a new rate code by entering new identifier in the '''Rate Code''' box; using rate codes helps to reduce the number of entries that need to be configured. 
#:For the selected rate sequence, in the table on the '''Rate''' tab, you enter rates with the date range during which the rates are effective. Also, on the tabs for the different types of factors that appear if they were defined in the rate sequence, you specify the factors that will define the applicability of the rates that you enter for the current rate sequence. Also, you specify the exact values of the billing rates with their date ranges in the '''Rate''' column on the '''Rate''' tab; the system will use these values as the ''@Rate'' parameter in the formulas of the billing and allocation rules.

Before creating the rate type, you need to plan how      many and which rate types you will need in billing and allocation rules. (Typically, different      rates are used for billing of labor costs, revenues, and expenses.)

On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM205000|PM205000]) Rate Lookup Rules (PM205000) form, you create rate sequences for each      combination of rate table and rate type. Each sequence defines a group of options based on      which the system will select the billing rate. You can select any combination of the        Project ,  Project task ,  Account group ,  Inventory item , and        Employee  options. The sequence number specified in the  Sequence       column in the table defines the order in which the system will search for the rate in that row      (starting from the sequence with the lowest number in the table). On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM206000|PM206000]) Rate Tables (PM206000) form, for each combination of rate table,      rate type, and rate code, you select a rate sequence in the  Sequence       box. You select an existing rate code, or you create a new rate code by entering new identifier      in the  Rate Code  box; using rate codes helps to reduce the number of      entries that need to be configured.  For the selected rate sequence, in the table on the         Rate  tab, you enter rates with the date range during which the rates       are effective. Also, on the tabs for the different types of factors that appear if they were       defined in the rate sequence, you specify the factors that will define the applicability of       the rates that you enter for the current rate sequence. Also, you specify the exact values of       the billing rates with their date ranges in the  Rate  column on the         Rate  tab; the system will use these values as the  @Rate        parameter in the formulas of the billing and allocation rules.  ]]></column>

)))
==Story==
Suppose that you are Pam Brawner, the project accountant of the SweetLife Fruit & Jams company. You need to create a billing rule to be used for billing customers for the different services provided for the project by different billing rates.[anchor|#section_oc2_jmb_vmb]
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Project Accounting'' feature has been enabled to support the project accounting functionality.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_10_00|Account Groups] ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) form, the ''MATERIAL'', ''LABOR'', and ''SUBCON'' account groups of the expense type have been configured. These account groups will aggregate the expenses posted to particular GL accounts.
==Process Overview==
You will create a billing rule on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form for billing a project by rates.
==System Preparation==
Before you start configuring a billing rule, you need to launch the Acumatica ERP website and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded. You should sign in as a project accountant by using the ''brawner'' username and the ''123'' password.
==Step 1: Configuring a Billing Rule Step with Billing Based on the Item Price==
To configure a billing rule and add the first step to it, do the following:[anchor|#ol_qvk_dvs_sbb]
#On the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, click '''Add New Record''' to create a new billing rule.
#In the Summary area, specify <tt>RATERULE</tt> as the '''Billing Rule ID''' and <tt>Billing for time and material with rates</tt> as the '''Description'''. 
#In the left pane, add a row for the billing rule step, and specify the following settings in the row:
#*'''Active''': Selected
#*'''Step ID''': <tt>10</tt>
#*'''Description''': <tt>Billing for materials (cost with markup)</tt>
#In the right pane, specify the following settings for the step selected in the left pane:
#*'''Billing Type''': ''Time and Material''
#* '''Account Group''': ''MATERIAL''
#*:This step of the billing rule will be used for processing project transactions related to the account group, which includes expenses for materials.
#*'''Rate Type''': Empty
#*:This step of billing rule does not use billing rates, so the rate type is not needed.
#*'''Invoice Description Formula''': <tt>=&rsquo;Invoice for &rsquo;+&#91;PMProject.ContractCD&#93;</tt>
#*:The system uses this formula to define the description of any invoice that is created based on the billing rule. The {{PMProject.ContractCD}} data field stores the project identifier.
#*'''Line Quantity Formula''': <tt>=&#91;PMTran.BillableQty&#93;</tt>
#*'''Line Amount Formula''': <tt>=&#91;PMTran.BillableQty&#93;&#42;@Price</tt>
#*:The invoiced amount is calculated as the amount of the project transaction multiplied by the price of the related inventory item.
#*'''Line Description Formula''': <tt>=&#91;PMTran.Description&#93;</tt>
#*'''Use Sales Account from''': ''Inventory Item''
#* '''Create Lines with Zero Amount and Quantity''': Cleared

==Step 2: Configuring a Billing Rule Step with Billing Based on the Billing Rate==
Add the second step to the billing rule as follows:
#While you are still reviewing the ''RATERULE'' billing rule on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, in the left pane, add a row for the second billing rule step, and specify the following settings in the row:
#*'''Active''': Selected
#*'''Step ID''': <tt>20</tt>
#*'''Description''': <tt>Labor from non-stock price</tt>
#In the right pane, specify the following settings for the step selected in the left pane:
#*'''Billing Type''': ''Time and Material''
#* '''Account Group''': ''LABOR''
#*:This step of the billing rule will be used for processing project transactions related to the account group, which includes employee labor expenses.
#*'''Rate Type''': ''LABOR''
#*:This step of billing rule will receive the value of the ''@Rate'' parameter based on the selected rate type.
#*'''Invoice Description Formula''': <tt>=&rsquo;Invoice for &rsquo;+&#91;PMProject.ContractCD&#93;</tt>
#*:The system uses this formula to define the description of any invoice that is created based on the billing rule. The {{PMProject.ContractCD}} data field stores the project identifier.
#*'''Line Quantity Formula''': <tt>=&#91;PMTran.BillableQty&#93;</tt>
#*'''Line Amount Formula''': <tt>=&#91;PMTran.Amount&#93;&#42;@Rate</tt>
#*:The invoiced amount is calculated as the amount of the project transaction multiplied by the rate for the labor specified in the appropriate rate table assigned to the project task being billed.
#*'''Line Description Formula''': <tt>=&#91;PMTran.Description&#93;</tt>
#*'''Use Sales Account from''': ''Inventory Item''
#* '''Create Lines with Zero Amount and Quantity''': Cleared

==Step 3: Configuring a Billing Rule Step with Fixed-Price Billing==
Add the third step to the billing rule, which is for billing expenses on services provided by subcontractors at a fixed rate, as follows:[anchor|#_10183341-fd2e-4951-b3b1-02e0a8e82953]
#While you are still reviewing the ''RATERULE'' billing rule on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, in the left pane, add a row for the third billing rule step, and specify the following settings in the row:
#*'''Active''': Selected
#*'''Step ID''': <tt>30</tt>
#*'''Description''': <tt>Re-bill subcontractors</tt>
#In the right pane, specify the following settings for the step selected in the left pane:
#*'''Billing Type''': ''Time and Material''
#* '''Account Group''': ''SUBCON''
#*:This step of the billing rule will be used for processing project transactions related to the account group, which includes services provided by subcontractors.
#*'''Rate Type''': Empty
#*:This step of billing rule does not use billing rates, so the rate type is not specified.
#*'''Invoice Description Formula''': <tt>=&rsquo;Invoice for &rsquo;+&#91;PMProject.ContractCD&#93;</tt>
#*:The system uses this formula to define the description of any invoice created based on the billing rule. The {{PMProject.ContractCD}} data field stores the project identifier.
#*'''Line Quantity Formula''': <tt>=&#91;PMTran.BillableQty&#93;</tt>
#*'''Line Amount Formula''': <tt>=&#91;PMTran.Amount&#93;&#42;1.25</tt>
#*:The invoiced amount is calculated as the amount of the project transaction multiplied by the fixed 1.25 coefficient.
#*'''Line Description Formula''': <tt>=&#91;PMTran.Description&#93;</tt>
#*'''Use Sales Account from''': ''Inventory Item''
#* '''Create Lines with Zero Amount and Quantity''': Cleared

You have configured a billing rule that can be used for billing a project by using different billing rates that apply to different provided work and services. To bill a project by using this rule, you need to assign the rule to the project tasks of the project.

==Story==
Suppose that the West BBQ Restaurant customer has ordered from the SweetLife Fruit & Jams company a training session for its employees on how to use juicers that were previously purchased. Alberto Jimenez, a SweetLife junior consultant, has provided six hours of training, and Todd Bloom, a SweetLife senior consultant, has provided two hours of training. The standard rate of the training service, which applies to junior consultants, is $40 per hour, while the rate for the training provided by senior consultants it is $50 per hour.{br}

Acting as the SweetLife project accountant, Pam Brawner, you need to configure the rate table that will provide billing rates based on the employee who performed the work.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the following tasks have been performed:[anchor|#ul_ktl_vmb_vmb]
*''Project Accounting'' feature has been enabled to provide the project accounting functionality.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_10_00|Account Groups] ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) form, the ''LABOR'' account group has been defined. 
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, the ''CONSULTJR'' and ''CONSULTSR'' non-stock item has been created.

==Process Overview==
In this activity, you will create a rate type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_41_00|Rate Types] ([~/?ScreenId=PM204100|PM204100]) form. Then on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_50_00|Rate Lookup Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM205000|PM205000]) form, you will define a rate sequence and the combination of settings that will be used for searching for the appropriate billing rate. Then you will configure the rate table on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_60_00|Rate Tables] ([~/?ScreenId=PM206000|PM206000]) form, and specify employee-specific rate values. Finally, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, you will configure a billing rule that uses the rate table with applicable billing rates.
==System Preparation==
Before you start configuring billing rates, you need to launch the Acumatica ERP website and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded. You should sign in as the project accountant by using the ''brawner'' username and the ''123'' password.
==Step 1: Creating Rate Tables and Rate Sequences==
To create a rate table and specify rate sequences with employee-specific billing rates, do the following:[anchor|#_4b95782a-1b5e-4eba-be6f-7980f471c6d3]
#To add a new rate table, do the following on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_42_00|Rate Tables] ([~/?ScreenId=PM204200|PM204200]) form:
##Click '''Add Row''' on the form toolbar, and specify the following settings in the added row:
##*'''Rate Type''': <tt>LABOR</tt>
##*'''Description''': <tt>Rate Table of Employee Labor</tt>
##Save the rate table.
#To create a rate lookup rule, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_50_00|Rate Lookup Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM205000|PM205000]) form, do the following:
##In the Summary area, specify the following settings:
##*'''Rate Table''': ''LABOR''
##* '''Rate Type''': ''LABOR''
##Click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the row:
##*'''Sequence''': <tt>1</tt>
##*'''Description''': <tt>Labor rate sequence</tt>
##*'''Inventory''': Selected
##Save the rate lookup rule.

==Step 2: Specifying Billing Rates==
To specify billing rates for different sets of settings, do the following:[anchor|#_a316a151-864a-4b71-b51c-48f0687ffdf8]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_60_00|Rate Tables] ([~/?ScreenId=PM206000|PM206000]) form, to configure a rate table for the senior consultant, do the following:
##In the Summary area, specify the following settings:
##*'''Rate Table''': ''LABOR''
##* '''Rate Type''': ''LABOR''
##*:When you select the rate type, the system automatically selects ''1'' as the '''Sequence'''.
##*'''Rate Code''': <tt>CONSULTSR</tt>
##*'''Description''': <tt>A labor cost rate for a senior consultant</tt>
##On the '''Inventory''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and in the row, select ''CONSULTSR'' as the '''Inventory ID'''.
##On the '''Rate''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the row:
##*'''Start Date''': ''1/1/2020''
##* '''Rate''': <tt>60.00</tt>
##Save the rate table.
#To configure a rate table for the junior consultant, do the following:
##On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record''', and in the Summary area, specify the following settings:
##*'''Rate Code''': <tt>CONSULTJR</tt>
##*'''Description''': <tt>A labor cost rate for a junior consultant</tt>
##On the '''Inventory''' tab, on the table toolbar, click '''Add Row''', and in the row, select ''CONSULTJR'' as the '''Inventory ID'''.
##On the '''Rate''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the row:
##*'''Start Date''': ''1/1/2020''
##* '''Rate''': <tt>50.00</tt>
##Save the rate table.

==Step 1: Creating a Billing Rule==
To create a billing rule that uses employee-specific billing rates, do the following:[anchor|#ol_j4k_scm_wmb]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, add a billing rule, and enter the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Billing Rule ID''': <tt>TMLABOR</tt>
#*'''Description''': <tt>Time and material with @Rate</tt>
#In the left pane, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the row:
#*'''Step ID''': <tt>10</tt>
#*'''Description''': <tt>Consulting</tt>
#In the right pane, specify the following settings for the step selected in the left pane (which is the step you just added):
#*'''Billing Type''': ''Time and Material ''
#* '''Account Group''': ''LABOR''
#* '''Rate Type''': ''LABOR''
#* '''If @Rate is not defined''': ''Raise Error''
#*:If no rate has been found, the corresponding project transaction will not be presented in the invoice. With the ''Raise Error'' option selected, the error is raised during billing. This prevents project costs from being omitted.
#*'''Invoice Description Formula''': <tt>=&rsquo;Invoice for &rsquo;+&#91;PMProject.ContractCD&#93;</tt>
#*'''Line Quantity Formula''': <tt>=&#91;PMTran.BillableQty&#93;</tt>
#*:The invoice line quantity will be equal to the project transaction line quantity.
#*'''Line Amount Formula''': <tt>=&#91;PMTran.BillableQty&#93;&#42;@Rate</tt>
#*:The amount of the invoice line is calculated as the billable quantity of the project transaction line multiplied by the corresponding rate value.
#*'''Line Description Formula''': <tt>=&#91;PMTran.Description&#93;</tt>
#*'''Use Sales Account from''': ''Inventory Item''
#* '''Create Lines with Zero Amount and Quantity''': Cleared
#Save the billing rule.

#*'''Billing Type''': ''Time and Material ''
#* '''Account Group''': ''LABOR''
#* '''Rate Type''': ''TASKLABOR''
#* '''If @Rate is not defined''': ''Raise Error''
#*:If no rate has been found, the corresponding project transaction will not be presented in the invoice. With the ''Raise Error'' option selected, the error is raised during billing. This prevents project costs from being omitted.
#*'''Invoice Description Formula''': <tt>=&rsquo;Invoice for &rsquo;+&#91;PMProject.ContractCD&#93;</tt>
#*'''Line Quantity Formula''': <tt>=&#91;PMTran.BillableQty&#93;</tt>
#*:The invoice line quantity will be equal to the project transaction line quantity.
#*'''Line Amount Formula''': <tt>=&#91;PMTran.BillableQty&#93;&#42;@Rate</tt>
#*:The amount of the invoice line is calculated as the billable quantity of the project transaction line multiplied by the corresponding rate value.
#*'''Line Description Formula''': <tt>=&#91;PMTran.Description&#93;</tt>
#*'''Use Sales Account from''': ''Billing Rule''
#* '''Sales Account''': ''40000 - Sales Revenue''
#* '''Create Lines with Zero Amount and Quantity''': Cleared
#Save the billing rule.

You have configured billing rates that are based on various settings and a billing rule that will use these rates for billing. To bill a project that will use these rates, perform the [HelpRoot_Projects\Billing_Rates_Process_Activity_Employee|Billing Rates: To Bill a Project with Employee-Specific Rates] activity.]]></column>
			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Billing Rates: To Configure Employee- and Item-Specific Rates  In this activity, you will learn how you can define complex billing rates with rate                 tables that define different rates for different services, and for the same services                 provided by different employees. The following activity is             based on the  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system             settings have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the             activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100              dataset to its initial state. Story Suppose that the West BBQ Restaurant customer has ordered the service of juicer                 installation from the Sweet Life Fruit & Jams company, along with the service of                 employee training on operating the juicer. The juicer has been installed. Also,                 Alberto Jimenez, a junior consultant, has provided two hours of training, and Todd                 Bloom, a senior consultant, has provided six hours of training. All of the project                 tasks must be billed at different rates. The installation work is provided at a                 price of $110 per hour; the accompanying installation work is provided at a price of                 $90 per hour. The standard rate of training, which applies to junior consultants, is                 $50 per hour, but the rate for the training provided by senior consultants, which is                 $60 per hour, must be set up. Acting as the project accountant, Pam Brawner, you need to configure the rate table                 that will provide billing rates based on a combination of various settings. Configuration Overview For the purposes of this                 activ i ty,                 the following tasks have been performed: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, the  Project                         Accounting  feature has been enabled to provide the project accounting                     functionality. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) Project Tasks (PM302000) form, the  INSTALL  and                          TRAINING  project tasks have been configured.  On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form, the  INSTALL  and                          TRAINING  non-stock items have been configured.  On the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) Employees (EP203000) form, the  EP00000002 – Todd                         Bloom  employee record has been created. Process Overview In this activity, you will create a rate type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM204100|PM204100]) Rate Types                 (PM204100) form. Then on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM205000|PM205000]) Rate Lookup Rules (PM205000) form, you                 will define a rate sequence and the combination of settings that will be used for                 searching for the                  applicable                  billing rate. Then you will configure the rate table on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM206000|PM206000]) Rate Tables (PM206000) form and specify rate values for the                 different combinations of parameters.                  Finally, on the                       ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules (PM207000) form, you will configure a billing                 rule that uses the rate table with applicable billing rates.  System Preparation Before you start configuring billing rates, you need to launch the  Acumatica ERP website and sign in to a company with the  U100  dataset preloaded. You                 should sign in as the project accountant by using the  brawner  username and                 the  123  password. Step 1: Creating Rate Table and Rate Sequences To create a rate table and specify rate sequences with item-specific and                 employee-specific billing rates, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM204100|PM204100]) Rate Types (PM204100) form, click  Add                         Row  on the form toolbar, and specify the following settings in                     the row: Rate Type :  TASKLABOR Description :  Billing rate for                                 installation and training Save the added rate type. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM205000|PM205000]) Rate Lookup Rules (PM205000) form, add a new rate sequence                     with the following settings: Rate Table :  STANDARD Rate Type :  TASKLABOR Click  Add Row  on the table toolbar, and specify the                     following settings in the added row: Sequence :  1 Description :  Installation of                                 juicers Project Task : Selected Inventory : Selected Again click  Add Row  on the table toolbar, and specify the                     following settings in the row: Sequence :  2 Description :  Other work on the                                 installation Project Task : Selected Again click  Add Row  on the table toolbar, and specify the                     following settings in the row: Sequence :  3 Description :  Training for                                 employees Project Task : Selected Inventory : Selected Employee : Selected Again click  Add Row  on the table toolbar, and specify the                     following settings in the row: Sequence :  4 Description :  Other work on                                 training Project Task : Selected The rate sequences should look as shown in the following                         screenshot. The rate lookup rule Save the rate sequences you have created. Step 2: Specifying Billing Rates To specify billing rates for different groups of settings, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM206000|PM206000]) Rate Tables (PM206000) form, to configure the labor                     rates for installation works, do the following: In the Summary area, specify the following settings: Rate Table :  STANDARD Rate Type :  TASKLABOR When you                                         select the rate type, the system automatically selects                                              1  as the                                      Sequence .

When a project transaction is billed, or allocation is run, the system finds the applicable rate (that is, the value of the ''@Rate'' parameter specified in the billing rule formulas) based on the rate type assigned to the currently performed step of a billing rule and within the rate table that is assigned to the project task to which the billed transaction corresponds.{br}

Each combination of rate table, rate type, and rate code includes one rate sequence or multiple rate sequences, each of which defines billing rates based on set of factors. The numeric identifiers of the sequences in the table define the order in which the system will look through these sequences to find the applicable rate during the project billing or allocation process. {br}

Starting with the first sequence defined in the table on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_50_00|Rate Lookup Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM205000|PM205000]) form, the system matches the corresponding settings specified in the project transaction to the factors defined by the rate sequence. If all the settings match, the system stops the search and uses the rate value it has found as the value of the''@Rate'' parameter in the formula. If any of the factors do not match, the system continues searching the applicable billing rate in the next rate sequence.{br}

If no applicable rate is found in all sequences defined in the system for the combination of rate table, rate type, and rate code, the system performs the action determined by the option selected in the '''If @Rate is not defined''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_75_00|Allocation Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207500|PM207500]) form for the step being performed. You can define a step so that the system sets the ''@Rate'' value to 0, sets the value to 1, skips billing or allocating for the current project transaction, or throws an error and stops the billing or allocation process.{br}

The following diagram shows how the system selects the value of the ''@Rate'' parameter assuming that the account group specified in the project transaction is equal to the account group of the billing rule step and the '''Line Amount Formula''' of the billing rule step uses the ''@Rate'' parameter for the calculation of the amount to invoice.[anchor|#_6e0ef15c-0af4-4182-ba02-b50e04be696a][anchor|#_10c215f0-2d65-47d0-8c4a-8063f8e67445][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_Billing_Rates.png|popup|450px]]]></column>

==Story==
Suppose that the Thai Food Restaurant customer has bought a juicer from the SweetLife Fruit & Jams company and ordered employee training from the company on how to use the juicer. SweetLife&rsquo;s project accountant, Pam Brawner, has created a project to account for the provided services. The training has taken place. {br}

Acting as the project accountant, you need to bill the customer.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Project Accounting'' feature has been enabled to provide the project accounting functionality.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_60_00|Rate Tables] ([~/?ScreenId=PM206000|PM206000]) form, the ''STANDARD'' rate table, with rates for labor and materials, has been configured.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, the ''TIMEMATERIAL'' billing rule has been created. The billing rule consists of three steps for billing project transactions related to different account groups. (For an example of billing rule configuration, see [HelpRoot_Projects\Billing_Rates_Implem_Activity|Billing Rates: To Create a Billing Rule With Rates].){br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form, the ''TOMYUM'' customer has been defined. {br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, the ''INSTALL'', ''JUICER15'', ''SITEREVIEW'' and ''TRAINING'' non-stock items have been created.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, the ''TOMYUM3'' project for the ''TOMYUM'' customer has been created. On the '''Tasks''' tab of this form, the ''PHASE1'' and ''PHASE2'' project tasks has been configured and the ''TIMEMATERIAL'' billing rule and the ''STANDARD'' rate table are assigned to these project tasks. In the project, the '''Create Pro Forma on Billing''' check box is selected to indicate that when project billing is run, pro forma invoices are generated to be sent to the customer for acceptance before the accounts receivable invoices are prepared.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) form, the ''PM00000002'' batch of project transactions related to the project has been created and released in preparation for billing.
==Process Overview==
You will bill the project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form and review the pro forma invoice amounts on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form.
==System Preparation==
Before you begin performing the steps of this activity, you need to perform the following instructions to prepare the system:[anchor|#_6c9e4914-0e56-4fc0-9f9d-df880dcd99b6]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded. You should sign in as Pam Brawner by using the ''brawner'' username and the ''123'' password.[anchor|#_a75f007a-a284-44a1-8c7f-6b0192632377]
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select ''1/30/2020'' on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.

==Step 1: Billing the Project and Processing the Related Documents==
To bill the project by using the time and material billing rule, do the following:[anchor|#_dc14ab6e-5c85-4c92-a043-6b0479a3aa32]
#In the Selection area on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_10_00|Project Transaction Details] ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) form, select ''TOMYUM3'' as the '''Project'''. The table lists the related project transactions: 
#*The line with the ''INSTALL'' item in the amount of $320
#*The line with the ''JUICER15'' item in the amount of $2000
#*The line with the ''SITEREVIEW'' item in the amount of $80
#*The line with the ''TRAINING'' item in the amount of $320
#:Notice that in all lines, the '''Billed''' check box is cleared, indicating that the project is pending billing.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''TOMYUM3'' project. Notice that the '''Actual Expenses''' box in the Summary area shows $2,720 (which is the total of the processed project transactions), while '''Actual Income''' box contains $0 because the project has not been billed yet.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Run Project Billing'''. The system creates a pro forma invoice and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form. On the '''Time and Material''' tab of this form, review the four lines of the pro forma invoice (which have been created based on unbilled transactions):
#*The ''INSTALL'' and ''TRAINING'' lines have been billed by the ''20 – Labor from non-stock price'' step, which has been configured for the ''LABOR'' account group; the billed amount for each line has been calculated based on the ''@Rate'' parameter defined in the ''STANDARD'' rate table for the ''LABOR'' rate type (which is 1.25). The calculated billing amount is $400 (320&#42;1.25) for both lines.
#*The ''JUICER15'' line has been billed by the ''10 – Material cost plus markup'' step, which has been configured for the ''MATERIAL'' account group; the billed amount has been calculated based on the billable quantity (1) and the ''@Price'' parameter (which is the sales price of the ''JUICER15'' item, $2500). The calculated billing amount is $2500.
#*The ''SITEREVIEW'' line has been billed by the ''30 – Re-invoice subcontractors'' step, which has been configured for the ''SUBCON'' account group; the billed amount has been calculated by multiplying the transaction amount by the fixed coefficient (1.25). The calculated billing amount is $100 (1.25 &#42; $80).
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and on the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the pro forma invoice. The system closes the pro forma invoice (which is now assigned the ''Closed'' status) and creates a corresponding accounts receivable invoice based on the pro forma invoice.
#On the '''Financial Details''' tab, click the link in the '''AR Ref. Nbr.''' box to open the accounts receivable invoice that was created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form.
#In the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] form, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and on the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the accounts receivable invoice.

==Step 2: Reviewing the Project Transactions and the Updated Project Balance==
To review the project transactions and project balance, do the following:[anchor|#_8249a98b-7b80-4dcd-a454-657d915d0c24]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_10_00|Project Transaction Details] ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) form, in the Summary area, select ''TOMYUM3'' as the '''Project'''. In the table, review the project transactions that have been created based on the released accounts receivable invoice (these are the lines that have ''AR'' specified in the '''Module''' column). In the '''GL Batch Nbr.''' column, the reference number of the corresponding GL batch is shown. Also notice that the project transactions based on which you have performed billing now have the check box in the '''Billed''' column selected, indicating that these transactions have been billed.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''TOMYUM3'' project. Notice that in the Summary area, the '''Actual Income''' box now shows $3,400, which is the total amount of the invoice that you have processed. On the '''Revenue Budget''' tab, notice that the system has automatically created two revenue budget lines (one for each project task) and filled in the '''Actual Amount''' for the rows.
#On the '''Balances''' tab (see the following screenshot), review the project income and expenses aggregated by account groups.

In the  GL Batch Nbr.  column, the reference number of the           corresponding GL batch is shown. Also notice that the project transactions based on which           you have performed billing now have the check box in the  Billed            column selected, indicating that these transactions have been billed. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, open the  TOMYUM3  project.           Notice that in the Summary area, the  Actual Income  box now shows           $3,400, which is the total amount of the invoice that you have processed. On the              Revenue Budget  tab, notice that the system has automatically           created two revenue budget lines (one for each project task) and filled in the              Actual Amount  for the rows.

==Story==
Suppose that the West BBQ Restaurant customer has ordered from the SweetLife Fruit & Jams company a training session for its employees on how to use juicers that were previously purchased from SweetLife as well. Alberto Jimenez, a junior consultant of SweetLife, has provided six hours of training, and Todd Bloom, a senior consultant of SweetLife, has provided two hours of training. Alberto&rsquo;s rate is $40 per hour, and Todd&rsquo;s is $50.{br}

Acting as the SweetLife project accountant, Pam Brawner, you need to create a project to account for the provided services, and configure appropriate billing rules that will establish the complex pricing model. Then you need to enter the project transaction to record the provided work, bill the customer, and verify that all services have been billed at the appropriate rates.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Billing Rates: To Bill a Project with Employee-Specific Rates In this activity, you will learn how you can define employee-specific billing rates by                 using rate tables and how to bill a project by using these billing rates. The following activity is             based on the  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system             settings have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the             activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100              dataset to its initial state. Story Suppose that the West BBQ Restaurant customer has ordered from the SweetLife Fruit                 & Jams company a training session for its employees on how to use juicers that                 were previously purchased from SweetLife as well. Alberto Jimenez, a junior                 consultant of SweetLife, has provided six hours of training, and Todd Bloom, a                 senior consultant of SweetLife, has provided two hours of training. Alberto's rate                 is $40 per hour, and Todd's is $50. Acting as the SweetLife project accountant, Pam Brawner, you need to create a project                 to account for the provided services, and configure appropriate billing rules that                 will establish the complex pricing model. Then you need to enter the project                 transaction to record the provided work, bill the customer, and verify that all                 services have been billed at the appropriate rates.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Billing Rates: To Bill a Project with Employee- and Item-Specific Rates In this activity, you will learn how you can bill a project whose billing rule uses                 employee- and item-specific billing rates. The following activity is             based on the  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system             settings have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the             activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100              dataset to its initial state. Story Suppose that the West BBQ Restaurant customer has ordered from the SweetLife Fruit                 & Jams company the services of juicer installation and employee training on                 operating the juicer. The juicer has been installed. Also, Alberto Jimenez, a junior                 consultant of SweetLife, has provided two hours of training, and Todd Bloom, a                 senior consultant of SweetLife, has provided six hours of training. The provided                 services should be billed at different rates. Acting as the SweetLife project accountant, Pam Brawner, you need to create a project                 to account for the provided services, and                 configure                  applicable  billing rules that will establish complex pricing                 model  with billing                 for the provided work which is based on the employee and item .                 Then you need to enter the project transaction to record the provided work, bill the                 customer, and verify that all services have been invoiced at the appropriate                 rates. Configuration Overview For the purposes of this activity, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000)                 form, the  Project Accounting  feature has been enabled to provide the project                 accounting functionality. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000) form, the  WESTBBQ  customer                 has been created. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) Account Groups (PM201000) form, the  LABOR  account                 group has been configured.  On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form, the  TRAINING  and                      INSTALL  non-stock item has been configured. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM206000|PM206000]) Rate Tables (PM206000) form, the  TASKLABOR  rate                 table has been configured as described in the  Billing Rates: To Bill a Project with Employee- and Item-Specific Rates. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) Employees (EP203000) form, the  EP00000002 – Todd                     Bloom  employee record has been created. Process Overview In this activity, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, you will                 create a new                 project , specify a                 billing rule and rate table for it,  and define the project tasks.                 Then you will bill the project and review the billed amount and quantities in the                 prepared pro forma invoice on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000)                 form. System Preparation Before you begin performing the steps of this activity, you need to perform the                 following instructions to prepare the system: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the  U100  dataset preloaded. You                     should sign in as Pam Brawner by using the  brawner  username and the                          123  password. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP             screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to  1/30/2020. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and             select  1/30/2020 on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and             process all documents in the system during this business date. Configure the billing rates                      and billing                     rule  as described in  Billing Rates: To Configure Employee- and Item-Specific Rates . Step 1: Creating a Project To create a project, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, add a new project with                     the following settings:  Project ID :  WESTBBQ7B Customer :  WESTBBQ Description :  Installation of a juicer                                 and training for employees On the  Summary  tab ( Billing and Allocation                         Settings  section), specify the following settings:  Billing Period :  On Demand Billing Rule :  TASKLABOR Rate Table :  STANDARD On the  Tasks  tab, add two project tasks with the                     following settings. Task ID Description Status INSTALL Juicer installation Active TRAINING Training for employees Active Notice that the  TASKLABOR  billing rule and the  STANDARD                          rate table have been specified automatically for both project                     tasks. In the Summary area, clear the  Hold  check box. Save the project. Notice that the system has assigned the project the                              Active  status. Step 2: Processing Project Transactions To enter the project transactions                  for the provided                 services , perform the following steps: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) Project Transactions (PM304000) form, click  Add New                         Record . In the Summary area, make sure  PM  as specified as                     the  Module , and specify  Installation of a                         juicer and training for WESTBBQ7B  as the                          Description . In the table, add a transaction to the batch by clicking  Add                         Row  and specifying the following settings in the row: Project :  WESTBBQ7B Project Task :  INSTALL Account Group :  LABOR Inventory ID :  INSTALL Quantity :  4 Unit Rate :  80.00 This transaction represents four hours of juicer installation. Add one more transaction to the batch by clicking  Add Row                      and specifying the following settings: Project :  WESTBBQ7B Project Task :  INSTALL Account Group :  LABOR Description :  Other work on the                                 installation Quantity :  2 Unit Rate :  70.00 This transaction represents two hours of other work on the                         installation. Add the third transaction to the batch by clicking  Add                         Row  and specifying the following settings: Project :  WESTBBQ7B Project Task :  TRAINING Account Group :  LABOR Inventory ID :  TRAINING Employee :  EP00000002 - Todd Bloom Quantity :  6 Unit Rate :  45.00 This transaction represents six hours of training provided by Todd                         Bloom. Add the last transaction to the batch by clicking  Add Row                      and specifying the following settings: Project :  WESTBBQ7B Project Task :  TRAINING Account Group :  LABOR Description :  Other work on                                 training Quantity :  2 Unit Rate :  40.00 This transaction represents two hours of other work on training. The                         entered batch of project transactions should look as shown in the following                         screenshot. Batch of project transactions Save your changes to the project transactions. On the form toolbar, click  Release  to release the batch                     of project transactions. Step 3: Billing the Project and Reviewing the Rates To bill the project, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, open the                          WESTBBQ7B  project. On the  Cost Budget  tab, notice that the system has                     updated the cost budget. Review the actual quantities and actual amounts. On the form toolbar, click  Run Project Billing . The                         system creates a pro forma invoice and opens it on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form. On the  Time and Material  tab, review the invoice lines                     that the system has created based on the transactions prepared for billing.                     These transactions have been processed by using the  TASKLABOR  billing                         rule. The line with the  INSTALL  project task and  INSTALL                          inventory item has a billed amount of $440, which has been calculated as 4                         hours of installation multiplied by $110. The line with the                              INSTALL  project task has a billed amount of $180, which has been                         calculated as 2 hours of other work on the installation multiplied by                         $90. The line with the  TRAINING  project task, the                              TRAINING  inventory item, and the  EP00000002  employee has a                         billed amount of $360, which has been calculated as 6 hours of training                         multiplied by $60. The line with the  TRAINING  project task has                         a billed amount of $100, which has been calculated as 2 hours of other work                         on training multiplied by $50. You have billed the customer and verified that the appropriate rates have been                 selected for the provided services. ]]></column>

Project accounting is integrated with other functional areas of Acumatica ERP. Project-related information from other functional areas flows to projects by means of project transactions that are used for tracking budget costs and revenue. You can also create project transactions directly without involving other documents.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to:[anchor|#ul_k5h_z41_1cb]
*Make the system create a project transaction based on a GL transaction
*Create a project transaction with posting to the general ledger
*Create a project transaction without posting to the general ledger

==Applicable Scenarios==
You enter project transactions directly in project accounting if you need to track project actual values without documents that originate from other Acumatica ERP functional areas.
==Creation of Project Transactions==
You can create a project transaction directly on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) form. When you specify the '''Debit Account''' and '''Credit Account''' for the project transaction and release the transaction, the system creates the following batch of general ledger transactions on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_30_10_00|Journal Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=GL301000|GL301000]) form, based on whether the amount of the project transaction is positive or negative:[anchor|#_aa3d429c-5cb7-4819-ab88-ae8d905d7a21]
*For a positive amount, the GL batch debits the debit account of the project transaction and credits the credit account.
*For a negative amount, the GL batch debits the credit account of the project transaction and credits the debit account.

If you specify no debit and credit accounts for a project transaction on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] form or specify only the debit account, on the release of the transaction, the system does not generate the corresponding batch of GL transactions.{br}

When a project transaction is released, the system updates the '''Actual Quantity''' and '''Actual Amount''' of the corresponding budget line of the project with the same project task, account group, and inventory item on the '''Revenue Budget''' or '''Cost Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. If the project does not have such a line, the system automatically creates a new one. The system updates the actual values of the project budget line using the following rules:[anchor|#_ed1b837c-db60-4ebb-81a6-56f290d99622]
*If the debit account of the project transaction is an asset or expense account and the amount is positive, the system updates the corresponding cost budget line with positive actual values. If the amount is negative, the system updates the cost budget line with negative actual values.
*If the debit account of the project transaction is an income or liability account and the amount is positive, the system updates the corresponding revenue budget line with negative actual values. If the amount is negative, the system updates the revenue budget line with positive actual values.
*:If an income or liability account is selected as the credit account of the project transaction and the amount is positive, the system updates the corresponding revenue budget line with positive actual values.

==Creation of GL Transactions Related to Projects==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_30_10_00|Journal Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=GL301000|GL301000]) form, you can directly create a general ledger transaction related to a specific project and project task. To associate the transaction line with a project, you specify this project in the '''Project/Contract''' column and the applicable project task in the '''Project Task''' column.{br}

If a general ledger transaction has a project and project task specified, in the '''Account''' column on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_30_10_00|Journal Transactions] form, you can select only an account that is mapped to an account group on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_10_00|Account Groups] ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) form.{br}

When a batch of GL transactions is released, for each transaction line in the batch with a project and project task specified, the system creates the corresponding project transaction on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) form with the following settings:[anchor|#_86518e62-ad0c-4093-a568-f42ef1bdf1ba]
*'''Project''': The project associated with the GL transaction
*'''Project Task''': The project task associated with the GL transaction
*'''Inventory ID''': The inventory item associated with the GL transaction
*:If no item is associated with the GL transaction, the system uses the empty item code, which is ''&lt;N/A&gt;'' by default and specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form.
*'''Debit Account''': The account of the GL transaction
*'''Account Group''': The account group to which the account of the GL transaction is mapped on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_10_00|Account Groups] form
*'''Credit Account''': Empty
*'''Amount''': The debit amount of the GL transaction, if the account of the GL transaction is debited, or the credit amount of the GL transaction with the negative sign, if the account of the GL transaction is credited
*'''GL Batch Nbr.''': The batch number of the GL transaction

When a transaction that is not entered directly is generated in another functional area of Acumatica ERP—such as accounts receivable, accounts payable, order management, or time and expenses—is posted to the general ledger, the system generates the corresponding project transaction in the same way as on the release of GL transactions.
==Creation of GL Transactions Not Related to Projects==
If you want to associate a GL transaction with no project, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_30_10_00|Journal Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=GL301000|GL301000]) form, you select the non-project code in the '''Project/Contract''' column for this GL transaction. The non-project code, which is specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form, is ''X'' by default. When the GL transaction is released, the system creates no corresponding project transaction.]]></column>
			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Processing Project Transactions: General Information Project accounting is integrated with other functional areas of  Acumatica ERP.     Project-related information from other functional areas flows to projects by means of project     transactions that are used for tracking budget costs and revenue. You can also create project     transactions directly without involving other documents. Learning Objectives In this chapter, you will learn how to: Make the system create a project transaction based on a GL transaction Create a project transaction with posting to the general ledger Create a project transaction without posting to the general ledger Applicable Scenarios You enter project transactions directly in project accounting if you need to track project     actual values without documents that originate from other  Acumatica ERP     functional areas. Creation of Project Transactions You can create a project transaction directly on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) Project Transactions     (PM304000) form. When you specify the  Debit Account  and  Credit      Account  for the project transaction and release the transaction, the system creates     the following batch of general ledger transactions on the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL301000|GL301000]) Journal Transactions     (GL301010) form, based on whether the amount of the project transaction is positive or     negative: For a positive amount, the GL batch debits the debit account of the project transaction and      credits the credit account. For a negative amount, the GL batch debits the credit account of the project transaction and      credits the debit account. If you specify no debit and credit accounts for a project transaction on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) Project Transactions form or specify only the debit account, on the release of the     transaction, the system does not generate the corresponding batch of GL transactions. When a project transaction is released, the system updates the  Actual      Quantity  and  Actual Amount  of the corresponding budget line     of the project with the same project task, account group, and inventory item on the       Revenue Budget  or  Cost Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. If the project does not have such a     line, the system automatically creates a new one. The system updates the actual values of the     project budget line using the following rules: If the debit account of the project transaction is an asset or expense account and the      amount is positive, the system updates the corresponding cost budget line with positive actual      values. If the amount is negative, the system updates the cost budget line with negative actual      values. If the debit account of the project transaction is an income or liability account and the      amount is positive, the system updates the corresponding revenue budget line with negative      actual values. If the amount is negative, the system updates the revenue budget line with      positive actual values. If an income or liability account is selected as the credit account       of the project transaction and the amount is positive, the system updates the corresponding       revenue budget line with positive actual values. Creation of GL Transactions Related to Projects On the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL301000|GL301000]) Journal Transactions (GL301010) form, you can directly create a general     ledger transaction related to a specific project and project task. To associate the transaction     line with a project, you specify this project in the  Project/Contract      column and the applicable project task in the  Project Task  column. If a general ledger transaction has a project and project task specified, in the       Account  column on the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL301000|GL301000]) Journal Transactions form, you can     select only an account that is mapped to an account group on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) Account Groups     (PM201000) form. When a batch of GL transactions is released, for each transaction line in the batch with a     project and project task specified, the system creates the corresponding project transaction on     the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) Project Transactions (PM304000) form with the following settings: Project : The project associated with the GL transaction Project Task : The project task associated with the GL      transaction Inventory ID : The inventory item associated with the GL       transaction If no item is associated with the GL transaction, the system uses the empty item       code, which is  <N/A>  by default and specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form. Debit Account : The account of the GL transaction Account Group : The account group to which the account of the GL      transaction is mapped on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) Account Groups form Credit Account : Empty Amount : The debit amount of the GL transaction, if the account of the      GL transaction is debited, or the credit amount of the GL transaction with the negative sign,      if the account of the GL transaction is credited GL Batch Nbr. : The batch number of the GL transaction When a transaction that is not entered directly is generated in another functional area of  Acumatica ERP—such as accounts receivable, accounts payable, order management, or time and     expenses—is posted to the general ledger, the system generates the corresponding project     transaction in the same way as on the release of GL transactions. Creation of GL Transactions Not Related to Projects If you want to associate a GL transaction with no project, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL301000|GL301000]) Journal Transactions (GL301010) form, you select the non-project code in the       Project/Contract  column for this GL transaction. The non-project code,     which is specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form, is       X  by default.

==Other Settings That Affect the Workflow==
You can affect the workflow of processing project transactions by specifying additional settings as follows:[anchor|#_50a95b7f-f671-4287-bf30-2454483b4280]
*To change the format of project transaction identifiers, adjust the ''PMTRAN'' numbering sequence on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_10_10|Numbering Sequences] ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) form, or create a new numbering sequence and select this sequence in the '''Transaction Numbering Sequence''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''Numbering Sequence''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form. For more information on numbering sequences, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Multiple_Numbering_Sequences|Numbering Sequence Usage].
*:((({S:Warn}Project transaction identifiers must be assigned only automatically. That is, the '''Manual Numbering''' check box must be cleared in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_10_10|Numbering Sequences] form for the numbering sequence used for project transactions.
)))
*:By default, the ''PMTRAN'' numbering sequence specifies that the project transaction identifier is an automatically generated alphanumeric string that starts with the ''PM'' prefix and is followed by eight digits, such as ''PM00000001''.
*To cause the system to post every document you enter as an individual batch to the general ledger, clear the '''Generate Consolidated Batches''' check box in the '''Posting Settings''' section of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_10_20_00|General Ledger Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=GL102000|GL102000]) form.

==Validation of Configuration==
To make sure that all configuration has been performed correctly, we recommend that in your system, you process a project transaction by performing instructions similar to those described in [HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Transactions_Process_Activity|Processing Project Transactions: Process Activity].]]></column>

))){br}{TOC}
==Story==
Suppose that the Thai Food Restaurant customer has ordered training from the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company on how to use a previously bought juicer. Based on the agreement with the customer, SweetLife’s project accountant has created a project and has created tasks with the following names (which corresponds to the phrases of training):[anchor|#_5a46031a-dfa7-4164-9297-0834ca48a40c]
*''PHASE1'': Training is going to be provided within this task and is subject to billing. Any additional expenses incurred within this task will not be billed.
*''PHASE2'': If additional training is required after the initial training in the first task, it will be provided within this task and will not be billed.

In the first phase, a consultant has provided eight hours of training and spent $50 on a taxi. Then the customer requested additional training and the consultant has provided four extra hours of training in the second phase.{br}

Acting as the project accountant, you need to enter the general ledger transactions to directly capture the costs involved with delivering the first phase of training. Travel expenses should not affect the project budget so that they will not be billed further. Then you need to enter the project transaction to capture the costs involved with delivering the second phase of training, but the costs should not affect the general ledger.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Project Accounting'' feature has been enabled to provide support for the project accounting functionality.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, the ''TOMYUM1'' project has been created and the ''PHASE1'' and ''PHASE2'' project tasks have been created for the project.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_10_00|Account Groups] ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) form, the ''LABOR'' account group has been created. The ''54100 - Project Labor Expense'' account has been mapped to the account group.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, the ''TRAINING'' non-stock item has been configured. The ''54100 - Project Labor Expense'' account has been configured as the expense account of the item.
==Process Overview==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_30_10_00|Journal Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=GL301000|GL301000]) form, you will create a batch of general ledger transactions with the project and project task specified. You will release the batch, which will generate the corresponding project transaction, which you will review on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_10_00|Project Transaction Details] ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) form. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) form, you will then create a batch of project transactions and release the batch.
==System Preparation==
To sign in to the system and prepare to perform the instructions of the activity, do the following:[anchor|#_6c9e4914-0e56-4fc0-9f9d-df880dcd99b6]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded as Pam Brawner by using the ''brawner'' username and the ''123'' password.[anchor|#_7d40ed7a-0b91-4f88-9fa1-56896b6a49bd]
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select ''1/30/2020'' on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.

==Step 1: Creating General Ledger Transactions==
To create a batch of general ledger transactions, to represent the first phase of the training (the ''PHASE1'' task), do the following:[anchor|#_de8b7925-a170-40ef-91d6-1d90afb86754]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_30_10_00|Journal Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=GL301000|GL301000]) form, create a new batch of general ledger transactions with ''GL'' selected as the '''Module''' in the Summary area.
#In the '''Description''' box, specify <tt>A training session for the TOMYUM1 project</tt>.
#Add the first row, which represents your training expenses within the first phase of the project, and specify the following settings in the row:
#*'''Account''': ''54100 - Project Labor Expense''
#* '''Project''': ''TOMYUM1''
#* '''Project Task''': ''PHASE1''
#* '''Debit Amount''': <tt>320.00</tt>
#*'''Transaction Description''': <tt>8 hours of training for the customer&rsquo;s employee</tt>
#Add the second row, which represents the non-project travel expenses, and specify the following settings in the row:
#*'''Account''': ''81000 - Other Expense''
#* '''Project''': ''X''
#* '''Debit Amount''': <tt>50.00</tt>
#*'''Credit Amount''': Cleared
#*'''Transaction Description''': <tt>Travel expenses</tt>
#Add the third row, which balances the batch of transactions, and specify the following settings in the row:
#*'''Account''': ''23015 - Accrued Expenses''
#* '''Project''': ''X''
#* '''Credit Amount''': <tt>370.00</tt>
#Clear the '''Hold''' check box in the Summary area, and click '''Release''' on the form toolbar to release the batch of transactions.
#:When you release the batch of general ledger transactions, for the general ledger transaction with the specified project and project task, the system creates the corresponding project transaction. The account of the general ledger transaction is mapped to the account group of the created project transaction.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_10_00|Project Transaction Details] ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) form, in the Summary area, select ''TOMYUM1'' as the '''Project''', and review the project transaction that has been created based on the released GL transaction that represents the training. Notice the following:
#*The system has created only one project transaction, because only one corresponding general ledger transaction has the specified project and project task. The corresponding batch of general ledger transactions is shown in the '''GL Batch Nbr.''' column.
#*The '''Debit Account Group''' of the project transaction is ''LABOR''.
#*The '''Debit Account''' is ''54100''—that is, the ''54100 - Project Labor Expense'' account.
#:The system selected the ''LABOR'' account group as the debit account group of the transaction because the ''54100 - Project Labor Expense'' account is mapped to this account group on the '''Accounts''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_10_00|Account Groups] ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) form.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''TOMYUM1'' project.
#On the '''Cost Budget''' tab, review the cost budget line, which was created based on the batch of general ledger transactions you have just released. Notice that the '''Account Group''' of the budget line is ''LABOR''.
#Click the cost budget line, and on the table toolbar, click '''View Transactions''' to review the project transaction that correspond to the selected line.
#:On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_10_00|Project Transaction Details] form, which the system opens in a pop-up window, notice that the project transaction is the transaction that you reviewed in Instruction 7.

==Step 2: Creating Project Transaction Without Posting to the General Ledger==
To create a project transaction that does not affect the general ledger, to represent the second phase of the training (the ''PHASE2'' task), do the following:[anchor|#_36531b5b-bd53-4aeb-8af4-09409c06c5c3]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) form, create a new project transaction with ''PM'' selected as the '''Module''' in the Summary area.
#In the Summary area, enter <tt>A 4-hour training session</tt> as the '''Description'''.
#In the table, add a new row, which represents your training expenses within the second phase of the project, and specify the following settings:
#*'''Project''': ''TOMYUM1''
#* '''Project Task''': ''PHASE2''
#* '''Account Group''': ''LABOR''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''TRAINING''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>4.00</tt>
#*'''Billable''': Cleared
#*:((({S:Warn}With this check box cleared, the system also will not use this transaction for billing.
)))
#*'''Amount''': <tt>160.00</tt>
#:You leave the '''Debit Account''' and '''Credit Account''' columns empty to not create the corresponding general ledger transaction.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save''' and then '''Release''' to save your changes to the project transaction and release it.
#:Notice that no corresponding general ledger transaction has been created, so the '''GL Batch Nbr.''' column is empty, as shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_4ad7563b-7bbb-4ad1-8865-cd6ce4bad453][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_Transactions.png|popup|The project transaction that produces no GL transaction|400px]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''TOMYUM1'' project.
#On the '''Cost Budget''' tab, notice that a new cost budget line with the ''PHASE2'' project task has appeared.
#Click the cost budget line, and on the table toolbar, click '''View Transactions''' to review the project transaction that corresponds to the selected line.
#:On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_10_00|Project Transaction Details] ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) form, which the system opens in a pop-up window, notice that the corresponding project transaction is the transaction that you created and released in this step.

If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and             select  1/30/2020 on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and             process all documents in the system during this business date. Step 1: Creating General Ledger Transactions To create a batch of general ledger transactions, to represent the first phase of the                 training (the  PHASE1  task),  do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL301000|GL301000]) Journal Transactions (GL301000) form, create a new batch of                     general ledger transactions with  GL  selected as the                          Module  in the Summary area. In the  Description  box, specify  A training                         session for the TOMYUM1 project . Add the first row, which represents your training expenses within the first                     phase of the project, and specify the following settings in the row: Account :  54100 - Project Labor                             Expense Project :  TOMYUM1 Project Task :  PHASE1 Debit Amount :  320.00 Transaction Description :  8 hours of                                 training for the customer's employee Add the second row, which represents the non-project travel expenses, and                     specify the following settings in the row: Account :  81000 - Other Expense Project :  X Debit Amount :  50.00 Credit Amount : Cleared Transaction Description :  Travel                                 expenses Add the third row, which balances the batch of transactions, and specify the                     following settings in the row: Account :  23015 - Accrued Expenses Project :  X Credit Amount :  370.00 Clear the  Hold  check box in the Summary area, and click                          Release  on the form toolbar to release the batch of                         transactions. When you release the batch of general ledger transactions,                         for the general ledger transaction with the specified project and project                         task, the system creates the corresponding project transaction. The account                         of the general ledger transaction is mapped to the account group of the                         created project transaction. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) Project Transaction Details (PM401000) form, in the Summary area,                     select  TOMYUM1  as the  Project , and review the                     project transaction that has been created based on the released GL transaction                     that represents the training. Notice the following: The system has created only one project transaction, because only one                             corresponding general ledger transaction has the specified project and                             project task. The corresponding batch of general ledger transactions is                             shown in the  GL Batch Nbr.  column. The  Debit Account Group  of the project                             transaction is  LABOR . The  Debit Account  is  54100 —that is, the                                  54100 - Project Labor Expense  account. The system selected the  LABOR  account group as the debit account                         group of the transaction because the  54100 - Project Labor Expense                          account is mapped to this account group on the                              Accounts  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) Account Groups (PM201000) form. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, open the  TOMYUM1                      project. On the  Cost Budget  tab, review the cost budget line,                     which was created based on the batch of general ledger transactions you have                     just released. Notice that the  Account Group  of the                     budget line is  LABOR . Click the cost budget line, and on the table toolbar, click  View                         Transactions  to review the project transaction that correspond                     to the selected line. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) Project Transaction Details form, which the                         system opens in a pop-up window, notice that the project transaction is the                         transaction that you reviewed in Instruction 7. Step 2: Creating Project Transaction Without Posting to the General                 Ledger To create a project transaction that does not affect the general ledger, to represent                 the second phase of the training (the  PHASE2  task), do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) Project Transactions (PM304000) form, create a new project                     transaction with  PM  selected as the  Module  in the                     Summary area. In the Summary area, enter  A 4-hour training session  as                     the  Description . In the table, add a new row, which represents your training expenses within the                     second phase of the project, and specify the following settings: Project :  TOMYUM1 Project Task :  PHASE2 Account Group :  LABOR Inventory ID :  TRAINING Quantity :  4.00 Billable : Cleared With this check box                                 cleared, the system also will not use this transaction for                                 billing. Amount :  160.00 You leave the  Debit Account  and  Credit                             Account  columns empty to not create the corresponding                         general ledger transaction. On the form toolbar, click  Save  and then                          Release  to save your changes to the project                     transaction and release it. Notice that no corresponding general ledger                         transaction has been created, so the  GL Batch Nbr.                          column is empty, as shown in the following screenshot. The project transaction that produces no GL transaction On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, open the  TOMYUM1                      project. On the  Cost Budget  tab, notice that a new cost budget                     line with the  PHASE2  project task has appeared. Click the cost budget line, and on the table toolbar, click  View                         Transactions  to review the project transaction that corresponds                     to the selected line. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) Project Transaction Details (PM401000) form,                         which the system opens in a pop-up window, notice that the corresponding                         project transaction is the transaction that you created and released in this                         step. ]]></column>

If you need to agree invoices prepared within a project with the customer, you can process pro forma invoices. A pro forma invoice can be printed and sent to a customer as many times as is necessary until an agreement is reached. Then you can create an accounts receivable invoice from pro forma invoice. The topics of this chapter explain how you can process pro forma invoices.
==In This Chapter==
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Pro_Forma_Invoices_GeneralInfo|Processing Pro Forma Invoices: General Information]
*:Acumatica ERP provides pro forma (draft) invoice capabilities for project billing. A pro forma invoice, which you can view on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form, is a draft document that you can edit and correct without affecting the accounts receivable. A pro forma invoice can be printed and sent to a customer as many times as is necessary until an agreement is reached.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Pro_Forma_Invoices_Implem_Checklist|Processing Pro Forma Invoices: Implementation Checklist]
*:The following sections provide details you can use to ensure that the system is configured properly for processing pro forma invoices, and to understand (and change, if needed) the settings that affect the processing workflow.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Pro_Forma_Invoices_Process_Activity|Processing Pro Forma Invoices: To Process Pro Forma Invoices]
*:In this activity, you will learn about the workflow of a pro forma invoice. You will generate a pro forma invoice, print the invoice, and send it by email. After you receive the customer's approval, the pro forma invoice will become ready for releasing and you will be able to create the accounts receivable invoice.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Pro_Forma_Invoices_Adjustments|Processing Pro Forma Invoices: Making Adjustments]
*:You may need to modify a pro forma invoice if you send this invoice to the customer for approval and if the customer requests some adjustments.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Pro_Forma_Invoices_Adj_Process_Activity|Processing Pro Forma Invoices: To Make Adjustments]
*:The following activity will walk you through the process of correcting a pro forma invoice.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Pro_Forma_Invoices_Transactions|Processing Pro Forma Invoices: Generated Transactions]
*:The release of a pro forma invoice does not generate general ledger transactions or project transactions directly. When you release the pro forma invoice, the system creates a corresponding accounts receivable invoice with all information copied from the pro forma invoice. On release of the accounts receivable invoice, the system generates the general ledger transactions and project transactions described in the following sections.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Pro_Forma_Invoices_Reports_Inquiries|Processing Pro Forma Invoices: Related Reports and Forms]
*:In the following sections, you can find details about the reports and forms you may want to review to gather information about pro forma invoices.

*:This topic explains how to process multiple pro forma invoices, and how the system generates, changes, or works with documents as a result of the mass processing.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Pro_Forma_Invoices_Limit_Validation|Processing Pro Forma Invoices: Billing Limit Validation]
*:On the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, you can define billing limit amounts for revenue budget lines of the project if the '''Use T&M Revenue Budget Limits''' check box is selected on the '''Summary''' tab of the same form. The system applies these limit amounts to the pro forma invoices of the project. During entry of a pro forma invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form, if the invoice exceeds a limit, you receive a warning or an error message, depending on the '''Validate T&M Revenue Budget Limits''' setting on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form.

 Acumatica ERP provides pro forma (draft) invoice capabilities for project billing. A pro forma invoice, which you can view on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form, is a draft document that you can edit and correct without affecting the accounts receivable. A pro forma invoice can be printed and sent to a customer as many times as is necessary until an agreement is reached.{br}

Once all the necessary changes have been applied to the pro forma invoice, it can be released. When you release the pro forma invoice, the system creates an accounts receivable invoice with all the information copied from the pro forma invoice. With this process, you minimize corrections that directly affect accounts receivable.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to:[anchor|#ul_nwj_gch_tbb]
*Configure the pro forma invoice workflow for a project
*Create a pro forma invoice
*Print the pro forma invoice
*Send the pro forma invoice as an email
*Add to the pro forma invoice an extra adjustment line that does not originate from project transactions
*Postpone the billing of a pro forma invoice line
*Write off a pro forma invoice line partially or fully
*Create an accounts receivable invoice based on a pro forma invoice

==Applicable Scenarios==
You create a pro forma invoice for a project if you need to reach agreement with the customer about the invoice. You modify the pro forma invoice as many times as it is necessary until an agreement is reached, and then you prepare the accounts receivable invoice based on this pro forma invoice.
==Creation of Pro Forma Invoices==
A pro forma invoice can be created only through the process of billing a particular project (and assigned a reference number only automatically). You cannot manually enter new pro forma invoices on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form.{br}

The system creates a pro forma invoice when you click '''Run Project Billing''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form if the '''Create Pro Forma on Billing''' check box is selected on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Billing and Allocation Settings''' section) of the form. You can enable or disable the pro forma invoice workflow for a project at any time by selecting or clearing this check box, respectively. If the pro forma invoice workflow for a project is disabled, the system creates an accounts receivable invoice when you bill the project.{br}

For a pro forma invoice created for a project, the system records billable lines on the following tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] form:[anchor|#ul_udg_pwc_pbb]
*'''Progress Billing''': The system creates these lines by using the ''Progress Billing'' steps of billing rules; the lines originate from the revenue budget of the project.
*'''Time and Material''': The system creates these lines by using the ''Time and Material'' steps of billing rules; the lines originate from the project transactions.
*:The ''Time and Material'' steps of billing rules support the aggregation of project transactions by date, employee, vendor, and inventory item. On the '''Time and Material''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] form, you can select a line and then click '''View Transaction Details''' on the table toolbar to drill down to the list of project transactions based on which the '''Billed Quantity''' and '''Billed Amount''' of the line have been calculated by using the formula of the billing rule.

A pro forma invoice with any status can be printed and emailed to the customer. To print the pro forma invoice, you click '''Reports''' > '''Print Pro Forma Invoice''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] form. To email the pro forma invoice, you click '''Actions''' > '''Email Pro Forma Invoice''' on the form toolbar of the form.
==Release of Pro Forma Invoices==
The release of a pro forma invoice does not generate project transactions or general ledger transactions directly. When you release the pro forma invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form, the system creates a corresponding accounts receivable invoice with all information copied from the pro forma invoice.{br}

The pro forma invoices of a project can be released according to the following rules:[anchor|#ul_knj_rnp_1bb]
*The pro forma invoices can be released only one by one, starting from the earliest one, on the '''Invoices''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. The only exception is when multiple pro forma invoices segregated by invoice group have been generated during a single iteration of the billing process; in this case, the pro forma invoices can be released in any order.
*A pro forma invoice can be released only after the accounts receivable invoice of the preceding pro forma invoice has been released.

The document details of an unreleased accounts receivable document that originates from a pro forma invoice are displayed in read-only mode on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form. You can edit only a salesperson in the '''Salesperson ID''' column. To make a correction to the accounts receivable document, you need to delete this document and start over from the pro forma invoice.{br}

As a result of the release of the accounts receivable invoice, the general ledger transactions are recorded, and the revenue budget of the corresponding project is changed as follows on '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form:[anchor|#ul_wcs_541_hbb]
*The '''Actual Quantity''' of the corresponding revenue budget line is increased by the line quantity of the released accounts receivable invoice if ''Task and Item'' is the '''Revenue Budget Level''' of the project; otherwise, the '''Actual Quantity''' is zero.
*The '''Actual Amount''' of the corresponding revenue budget line is increased by the line amount of the released accounts receivable invoice.
*The '''Draft Invoices Amount''' of the corresponding revenue budget line is decreased by the line amount of the released accounts receivable invoice.

|}
==Other Settings That Affect the Workflow==
You can affect the workflow of processing pro forma invoices by specifying additional settings as follows:[anchor|#_50a95b7f-f671-4287-bf30-2454483b4280]
*To change the format of pro forma invoice identifiers, adjust the ''PROFORMA'' numbering sequence on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_10_10|Numbering Sequences] ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) form, or create a new numbering sequence and select this sequence in the '''Pro Forma Numbering Sequence''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''Numbering Sequence''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form. For more information on numbering sequences, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Multiple_Numbering_Sequences|Numbering Sequence Usage].
*:((({S:Warn}Pro forma invoice identifiers must be assigned only automatically. That is, the '''Manual Numbering''' check box must be cleared in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_10_10|Numbering Sequences] form for the numbering sequence used for pro forma invoices.
)))
*:By default, the ''PROFORMA'' numbering sequence specifies that the pro forma invoice identifier is an automatically generated numeric string of six digits, such as ''000001''.
*To give accounts receivable invoices, including those created based on pro forma invoices, the ''On Hold'' status on creation, select the '''Hold Documents on Entry''' check box on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''Data Entry Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) form.
*To make sending by email accounts receivable invoices optional, including those created based on pro forma invoices that have been agreed upon with the customer, clear the '''Send Invoices by Email''' check box on the '''Billing Settings''' tab ('''Print and Email Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form for applicable customers.
*To make printing accounts receivable invoices optional, including those created based on pro forma invoices that have been agreed upon with the customer, clear the '''Print Invoices''' check box on the '''Billing Settings''' tab ('''Print and Email Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form for applicable customers.
*To cause the system to automatically post general ledger transactions generated on release of all accounts receivable invoices, select the '''Automatically Post on Release''' check box on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''Posting Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] form.
*To cause the system to post every accounts receivable document as an individual batch to the general ledger, clear the '''Generate Consolidated Batches''' check box in the '''Posting Settings''' section of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_10_20_00|General Ledger Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=GL102000|GL102000]) form.
*To cause the system to post unbilled remainders that originate from pro forma invoice lines to particular accounts, specify this accounts in the '''Unbilled Remainders''' section on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] form. If no accounts are specified in the section, the system will use the accounts of the corresponding project transactions from which unbilled remainders originate.

With these settings specified, users in your company can process pro forma invoices quickly and accurately with a minimum of manual actions.
==Validation of Configuration==
To make sure that all configuration has been performed correctly, we recommend that in your system, you process a pro forma invoice by performing instructions similar to those described in [HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Pro_Forma_Invoices_Process_Activity|Processing Pro Forma Invoices: To Process Pro Forma Invoices].]]></column>

To cause the system to post every accounts receivable document as an individual                     batch to the general ledger, clear the  Generate Consolidated                         Batches  check box in the  Posting Settings                      section of the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL102000|GL102000]) General Ledger Preferences (GL102000) form. To cause the system to post unbilled remainders that originate from pro forma                     invoice lines to particular accounts, specify this accounts in the                          Unbilled Remainders  section on the  General                         Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences form. If no                     accounts are specified in the section, the system will use the accounts of the                     corresponding project transactions from which unbilled remainders                     originate. With these settings specified, users in your company can process pro forma invoices                 quickly and accurately with a minimum of manual actions. Validation of Configuration To make sure that all configuration has been performed correctly, we recommend that                 in your system, you process a pro forma invoice by performing instructions similar                 to those described in  Processing Pro Forma Invoices: To Process Pro Forma Invoices. ]]></column>

==Story==
Suppose that the HM&rsquo;s Bakery and Cafe customer has ordered juicers from the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company, along with the following services: site review, installation, and employee training on operating the juicers. SweetLife&rsquo;s project accountant has created a project that should be billed on demand as the juicers are installed and all the services are provided. Before the invoice is sent to the customer for payment, the customer has requested a for pro forma invoice to be submitted for acceptance. The site review has taken place, the juicers have been delivered and installed, and SweetLife&rsquo;s consultant has provided the training. The project accountant has entered project transactions and updated the progress of the project.{br}

Acting as the project accountant, you will bill the customer ''1/30/2020'', print the pro forma invoice, and email the invoice to the customer for approval. You will release the pro forma invoice when the customer accepted it. You will then release the associated accounts receivable invoice.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Project Accounting'' feature has been enabled to support the project accounting functionality.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, the ''HMBAKERY5'' project has been created and the ''PHASE1'', ''PHASE2'', ''PHASE3'', ''PHASE4'', and ''PHASE5'' project tasks have been created for the project. On the '''Summary''' tab ('''Billing and Allocation Settings''' section), the '''Create Pro Forma on Billing''' check box has been selected for the project. With this setting, the system creates a pro forma invoice for the project when you run project billing.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) form, the ''PM00000008'' batch of project transactions related to the project has been created and released.
==Process Overview==
In this activity, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, you will initiate the creation of a pro forma invoice for the project. You will review the created pro forma invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form. You will then print the pro forma invoice, email the invoice, and release it on the same form. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form, you will release the accounts receivable invoice created based on the pro forma invoice.

You will                 generate a pro forma invoice, print the invoice, and send it by email. After you                 receive the customer's approval, the pro forma invoice will become ready for                 releasing and you will be able to create the accounts receivable invoice. The following activity is             based on the  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system             settings have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the             activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100              dataset to its initial state. Story Suppose that the HM's Bakery and Cafe customer has ordered juicers from the  SweetLife Fruits & Jams company, along with the following services: site review, installation, and                 employee training on operating the juicers.  SweetLife's project accountant has created a project that should be billed on demand as the                 juicers are installed and all the services are provided. Before the invoice is sent                 to the customer for payment, the customer has requested a for pro forma invoice to                 be submitted for acceptance. The site review has taken place, the juicers have been                 delivered and installed, and  SweetLife's consultant has provided the training. The project accountant has entered                 project transactions and updated the progress of the project. Acting as the project accountant, you will bill the customer  1/30/2020, print the pro forma invoice, and email the invoice to the customer for                 approval. You will release the pro forma invoice when the customer accepted it. You                 will then release the associated accounts receivable invoice.

The sections below describe how you can adjust the pro forma invoice.{br}{TOC}
==Adjusting of Progress Billing Information==
On the '''Progress Billing''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form, you can make the following adjustments to a pro forma invoice:[anchor|#_8f970c21-7fa3-4a39-be66-89affba184a0]
*Deleting a line of the pro forma invoice to bill it later in the full amount.
*Modifying the '''Amount to Invoice''' of any invoice line to bill the pro forma invoice in a greater or smaller amount. The '''Amount to Invoice''' is added to the accounts receivable invoice when the pro forma invoice is released.
*Rearranging lines within the table by dragging them to the appropriate positions.

==Adjusting of Time and Material Information==
On the '''Time and Material''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form, you can make the following adjustments to a pro forma invoice:
*Deleting a line of the pro forma invoice to bill it later in the full amount.
*Modifying the '''Amount to Invoice''' of any invoice line to bill the pro forma invoice in a greater or smaller amount. The '''Amount to Invoice''' is added to the accounts receivable invoice when the pro forma invoice is released.
*:If a manually edited '''Amount to Invoice''' is less than the '''Billed Amount''', you can direct the system about what to do with the difference between the calculated '''Billed Amount''' and the adjusted '''Amount to Invoice''' by selecting the needed option in the '''Status''' column of the invoice line. The difference can be postponed until the next billing (''Hold Remainder''), which in this case is called the ''unbilled remainder'', or written off by this invoice (''Write off Remainder''). The whole amount of the pro forma invoice line can also be written off (''Write off''); the amount will no longer show up in future invoices.
*:((({S:Warn}For an unbilled remainder to be billed, the corresponding AR invoice (which contains the line from which this postponed amount originates) must be released.
)))
*Selecting a line and then clicking '''View Transaction Details''' on the table toolbar to drill down to the list of project transactions for which the '''Billed Quantity''' and '''Billed Amount''' have been calculated by using the formula of the billing rule. These values are totaled to obtain the '''Billed Quantity''' and '''Billed Amount''', respectively, of the line of the pro forma invoice. You can remove particular transactions from this list, which reduces the billed quantity and amount of the corresponding invoice line, and these transactions will appear in the next invoice.
*Clicking '''Upload Unbilled Transactions''' on the table toolbar to add to the invoice an unbilled transaction that has not been billed yet, which creates a new invoice line. You can also add to a pro forma invoice an adjustment line that does not originate from the project transactions.
*Rearranging lines within the table by dragging them to the appropriate positions.

==Story==
Suppose that the Thai Food Restaurant customer has ordered a juicer, along with the services of installation and employee training on operating the juicer from the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company. SweetLife&rsquo;s project accountant has created a project. The juicer has been delivered and installed, and a consultant has provided the training. The project accountant has billed the customer and sent the created pro forma invoice for approval.{br}

 SweetLife and the customer have agreed on the following adjustments to the pro forma invoice:[anchor|#_9ffe795f-aab0-4c8b-b023-b20959c83762]
*The customer will pay $2,000 of the cost of the juicer with the first invoice (the accounts receivable invoice corresponding to this pro forma invoice) and the rest of the juicer&rsquo;s cost with the second invoice next month.
*The cost of the site review should be written off of the invoice, because the project manager agreed to provide the customer a free site review.
*A 50% discount will be applied to the cost of the training.
*The customer will pay $100 for an additional training session in Phase 1 of the project.

Acting as the project accountant, you will make the needed corrections to the pro forma invoice and bill the customer. You will then bill the customer for the second time with the amount postponed in the first invoice.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Project Accounting'' feature has been enabled to provide support for the project accounting functionality.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, the ''TOMYUM4'' project has been created and the ''PHASE1'' and ''PHASE2'' project tasks have been created for the project.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) form, the ''PM00000001'' batch of project transactions related to the project has been created and released.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form, the ''000003'' pro forma invoice has been created for the ''TOMYUM4''project.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, the ''JUICER15'' stock item has been configured.{br}

==Process Overview==
In this activity, you will make the corrections to the pro forma invoice and release the invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form, you will review the accounts receivable invoice that was created based on the pro forma invoice; you will then release the accounts receivable invoice. You will then create one more pro forma invoice for the customer with the amount postponed in the first pro forma invoice.
==System Preparation==
Before you begin performing the steps of this activity, perform the following instructions to prepare the system:[anchor|#_6c9e4914-0e56-4fc0-9f9d-df880dcd99b6]

##In the line with the ''PHASE1'' project task and the ''JUICER15'' inventory item, do the following:
###Enter <tt>2000.00</tt> as the '''Amount to Invoice'''.
###:When you enter an '''Amount to Invoice''' that is less than the '''Billed Amount''', the system clears the '''Status''' of the line.
###Select ''Hold Remainder'' as the '''Status''' to bill the difference between the '''Billed Amount''' and the '''Amount to Invoice''' later.
##In the line with the ''PHASE1'' project task and the ''SITEREVIEW'' inventory item, select ''Write Off'' as the '''Status''' to write off the full amount of the line and exclude it from billing.
##In the line with the ''PHASE2'' project task and the ''TRAINING'' inventory item, do the following: 
###Enter <tt>200.00</tt> as the '''Amount to Invoice'''.
###Select ''Write Off Remainder'' as the '''Status''' to write off the difference between the '''Billed Amount''' and the '''Amount to Invoice''' and exclude this difference from billing.

#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_10_00|Project Transaction Details] ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) form, which the system opens in a pop-up window, review the list of project transactions that correspond to the selected line (see the following screenshot).
#:The transaction with the ''Unbilled Remainder'' original document type (see the second line in the following screenshot) has been created on release of the AR invoice that corresponds to the pro forma invoice from which the unbilled remainder originates. The identifier of the AR invoice is shown in the '''Orig. Doc. Nbr.''' column of the line. The transaction has the '''Billable''' check box selected and the '''Billed''' check box cleared, which means the transaction can be used as the provisioning for billing.[anchor|#_79642e93-bc4b-4e55-9c0e-50417fe91cfc][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_ProFormaAdjustment2.png|popup|The transaction with the unbilled remainder|400px]
#Close the pop-up window.

#:The system creates a pro forma invoice and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form.
#On the '''Time and Material''' tab, review the invoice line that the system has created based on the unbilled remainder transaction.
#:Notice that the system has not added to the invoice the line with the ''PHASE1'' project task and the ''SITEREVIEW'' inventory item, which you have written off in the full amount. Also, notice that the system has not added to the invoice the line with the ''PHASE2'' project task and the ''TRAINING'' inventory item, which you have written off partially.

SweetLife and the customer have agreed on the following adjustments to the pro forma                 invoice: The customer will pay $2,000 of the cost of the juicer with the first invoice                     (the accounts receivable invoice corresponding to this pro forma invoice) and                     the rest of the juicer's cost with the second invoice next month. The cost of the site review should be written off of the invoice, because the                     project manager agreed to provide the customer a free site review. A 50% discount will be applied to the cost of the training. The customer will pay $100 for an additional training session in Phase 1 of the                     project. Acting as the project accountant, you will make the needed corrections to the pro                 forma invoice and bill the customer. You will then bill the customer for the second                 time with the amount postponed in the first invoice. Configuration Overview For the purposes of this activity, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000)                 form, the  Project Accounting  feature has been enabled to provide support for                 the project accounting functionality. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, the  TOMYUM4  project                 has been created and the  PHASE1  and  PHASE2  project tasks have been                 created for the project. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) Project Transactions (PM304000) form, the  PM00000001  batch                 of project transactions related to the project has been created and released. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form, the  000003  pro forma                 invoice has been created for the  TOMYUM4 project. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form, the  JUICER15  stock                 item has been configured. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form, the  SITEREVIEW ,                      INSTALL , and  TRAINING  non-stock items have been configured. Process Overview In this activity, you will make the corrections to the pro forma invoice and release                 the invoice on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form, you will review the accounts                 receivable invoice that was created based on the pro forma invoice; you will then                 release the accounts receivable invoice. You will then create one more pro forma                 invoice for the customer with the amount postponed in the first pro forma                 invoice. System Preparation Before you begin performing the steps of this activity, perform the following                 instructions to prepare the system: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the U100 dataset preloaded as Pam                     Brawner by using the  brawner  username and the  123  password. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP             screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to  1/30/2020. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and             select  1/30/2020 on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and             process all documents in the system during this business date. Step 1: Adjusting the Pro Forma Invoice Perform the following instructions to adjust the pro forma invoice according to the                 agreements that have been reached with the customer: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, open the  TOMYUM4                      project, and on the  Cost Budget  tab, review the cost                     budget of the project. On the  Invoices  tab, click the link in the  Pro                         Forma Reference Nbr.  column to open the pro forma invoice. On the  Time and Material  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form, which the system has opened in a                     pop-up window, adjust the invoice lines as follows (see the adjustments in the                     screenshot below): In the line with the  PHASE1  project task and the  JUICER15                              inventory item, do the following: Enter  2000.00  as the  Amount to                                         Invoice . When you enter an  Amount                                             to Invoice  that is less than the                                              Billed Amount , the system clears                                         the  Status  of the line. Select  Hold Remainder  as the                                          Status  to bill the difference between                                     the  Billed Amount  and the                                          Amount to Invoice  later. In the line with the  PHASE1  project task and the                                  SITEREVIEW  inventory item, select  Write Off  as the                                  Status  to write off the full amount of the                             line and exclude it from billing. In the line with the  PHASE2  project task and the  TRAINING                              inventory item, do the following:  Enter  200.00  as the  Amount to                                         Invoice . Select  Write Off Remainder  as the                                          Status  to write off the difference                                     between the  Billed Amount  and the                                          Amount to Invoice  and exclude this                                     difference from billing. Add a new line with the following settings (also shown in the following                         screenshot): Project Task :  PHASE1 Inventory ID :  TRAINING Description :  An additional training                                 session within Phase 1 Amount to Invoice :                              100.00 The adjustments to the pro forma invoice Save your changes to the pro forma invoice. In the Summary area, clear the  Hold  check box, and on the                     form toolbar, click  Release  to release the pro forma                         invoice. The system creates the accounts receivable invoice based on the                         pro forma invoice and assigns the  Closed  status to the pro forma                         invoice. On the  Financial Details  tab, click the link in the                          AR Ref. Nbr.  box to open the accounts receivable                     invoice that was created. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form, which the system opens                     in a pop-up window, in the Summary area, clear the  Hold                      check box, and on the form toolbar, click  Release  to                     release the accounts receivable invoice. Close the windows with the pop-up forms. Step 2: Billing the Project with the Remainder In Step 1, you have postponed the billing $500 of the juicer cost. To bill the                 customer the postponed amount, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, open the  TOMYUM4                      project, and on the  Cost Budget  tab, review the updated                     cost budget of the project. Click the cost budget line with the  PHASE1  project task and the                          JUICER15  inventory item, and on the table toolbar, click                          View Transactions . On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) Project Transaction Details (PM401000) form, which the system opens                     in a pop-up window, review the list of project transactions that correspond to                     the selected line (see the following screenshot). The transaction with the                              Unbilled Remainder  original document type (see the second line in                         the following screenshot) has been created on release of the AR invoice that                         corresponds to the pro forma invoice from which the unbilled remainder                         originates. The identifier of the AR invoice is shown in the                              Orig. Doc. Nbr.  column of the line. The                         transaction has the  Billable  check box selected and                         the  Billed  check box cleared, which means the                         transaction can be used as the provisioning for billing. The transaction with the unbilled remainder Close the pop-up window. On the toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, click  Run                         Project Billing . The system creates a pro forma invoice and                         opens it on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form. On the  Time and Material  tab, review the invoice line                     that the system has created based on the unbilled remainder                         transaction. Notice that the system has not added to the invoice the line                         with the  PHASE1  project task and the  SITEREVIEW  inventory                         item, which you have written off in the full amount. Also, notice that the                         system has not added to the invoice the line with the  PHASE2  project                         task and the  TRAINING  inventory item, which you have written off                         partially. ]]></column>

This chapter describes how to populate and track the project budget that is used to provide both a financial plan and cost constraints for a project.
==In This Chapter==
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Budget_GeneralInfo|Managing Project Budget: General Information]
*:Project budget is used to provide both a financial plan and cost constraints for a project. That is, you define the amount of money and resources to be spent on the project. Then you can control the actual project costs against the costs in the original and revised budgets. As a project progresses, you can continuously track budget execution and either adjust expenditures or revise the budget.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Budget_Implem_Checklist|Managing Project Budget: Implementation Checklist]
*:The following sections provide details you can use to ensure that the system is configured properly for managing project budgets, and to understand (and change, if needed) the settings that affect the processing workflow.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Budget_Process_Activity|Managing Project Budget: To Configure and Update the Budget]
*:In this activity, you will learn how to configure the project budget, updated actual values of the project budget, and review project performance.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Budget_Reports_Process_Activity|Managing Project Budget: To Review Project Balances]
*:In this activity, you will review project balances by using Acumatica ERP reports and forms.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Budget_Control|Managing Project Budget: Budget Control on Document Entry]
*:The project budget can be exceeded as users enter documents. If the system is configured to control the budget on document entry, it check whether an entered document is within the cost budget of the project, taking into consideration the portion of the budget that has already been consumed. That helps you to control the documents you are creating and can be useful for a person who approves these documents.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Budget_Control_Process_Activity|Managing Project Budget: To Control Budget During Document Entry]
*:The following activity will walk you through the process of checking whether a newly entered document fits the existing project budget.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Budget_Lock|Managing Project Budget: Locking of the Budget]
*:After the project budget has been agreed upon, you can lock the original figures from further editing. After the original values are locked, you can still update the revised budget figures. This gives you the ability to control how accurately the budget was estimated.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Budget_Lock_Process_Activity|Managing Project Budget: To Lock Project Budget]
*:In this activity, you will learn how to prevent the original budget values of the project from being edited.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Budget_Reports_Inquiries|Managing Project Budget: Related Reports and Inquiries]
*:In the following sections, you can find details about the reports and inquiry forms you may want to review to gather information about the project budget.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Budget_MassProcessing|Managing Project Budget: Mass Processing of Documents]
*:This topic explains how to perform mass-processing operations related to project budgets, and how the system generates, changes, or works with documents as a result of the mass processing.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Budget_Unit_Rate|Managing Project Budget: Retrieving the Unit Rate]
*:When you select an inventory item in a project budget line, the system automatically populates the unit rate of the line. The mechanism of retrieving the unit rate depends on the budget line type and is supported on the following forms: [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_00|Project Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_85_00|Change Requests] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308500|PM308500]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]), and [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_90_00|Project Budget] ([~/?ScreenId=PM309000|PM309000]).

==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to:[anchor|#ul_nwj_gch_tbb]
*Configure the revenue budget and the cost budget depending on the detail level of the budget
*Update actual values of the project budget depending on the level of the budget update
*Lock the project budget and make changes to the locked budget
*Control whether AP bills, purchase orders, and change orders created for a project exceed the project budget

==Applicable Scenarios==
You populate the project budget in the following cases:[anchor|#_7165d0ed-fbf9-4bca-b563-a0155c7a9310]
*If you need to plan and track the revenue of a project
*If you need to control the amount of money and resources spent on the project
{br}{TOC}
==Budget Planning==
You plan a project budget during the estimation stage of the project, before any project transaction occurs. To estimate the project income, you populate the revenue budget of the project. To estimate the resources to be spent on the project, you populate the cost budget. During the execution stage of the project, when you process project transaction and bill the project, actual values of the project budget are updated so you can control the project execution and compare the actual values against the budget ones.
On the '''Revenue Budget''' and '''Cost Budget''' tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, you can add, revise, and delete budget lines. Each budget line is defined by the combination of the following settings that are unique within the project:[anchor|#ul_hpn_njy_mv]
*A project task, which identifies a step or activity within the project.
*An account group, which determines the category of the revenue or expenses that you expect to incur during the project execution.
*A particular inventory item (that is, a resource) needed to complete the task. If you do not need to associate the budget line with a particular item but the budget level is configured to include the item, you can select the empty item code (''N/A'') as the inventory item.

The level of details of revenue budget lines and cost budget lines—that is, whether you need to specify the inventory item or not, depends on the option selected in the '''Revenue Budget Level''' and '''Cost Budget Level''' boxes on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Project Properties''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, respectively.
Other information that you can specify in a budget line includes the original budgeted quantity of the selected inventory item, the unit rate, and the original budgeted amount, which is calculated automatically as the original budgeted quantity multiplied by unit rate if you have not specified a value manually.
The revised budgeted quantity and amount are initially equal to the original budgeted values. If during the estimation, acceptance, or execution stages of the project you need to revise the budget and want to keep the original budgeted amounts and quantities unchanged so that you can later analyze the accuracy of your original estimates, you can adjust the revised budgeted quantities and amounts, which are initially equal to the original budgeted values.
==Budget Tracking==
As a project is being processed, you create project-related documents such as AP bills, purchase orders, or AR invoices. This causes the creation of project transactions. On the release of these transactions, the system updates the '''Actual Quantity''' and '''Actual Amount''' on the '''Revenue Budget''' and '''Cost Budget''' tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form.
The system uses the combination of the project, project task, account group, and inventory item to match a transaction with a project budget line. If the budget line with the same combination exists, the system updates actual values of the existed line. For a new combination that does not exist in the project budget, the system creates a new budget line.{br}

For the revenue budget, the system creates a revenue budget line with the same inventory item as the inventory item of the transaction if the ''Detailed'' option is selected in the '''Revenue Budget Update''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''General Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form. With the ''Summary'' option selected, the system creates a revenue budget line with the empty item code (''N/A'') instead of the inventory item of the transaction. Similarly, the system creates cost budget lines based on the option selected in the '''Cost Budget Update''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''General Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] form. For details, see the diagram below.
You track the '''Actual Amount''' of project budget lines and compare this amount with the '''Revised Budgeted Amount''' when reviewing the budget. In the '''Performance (%)''' column, the system estimates the percentage of the actual amount to the revised budgeted amount. For a revenue budget line, this percent shows the progress of completion of your financial plan. The fully performed budget line has the performance of 100%. For a cost budget line, the percent shows how much expenses you have incurred against the planned amount. You use this column to track the performance by the following budget:[anchor|#_50a59e28-0c40-443d-85cd-1a79341da35c]
*A project budget line on the '''Revenue Budget''' and '''Cost Budget''' tabs
*A project task on the '''Revenue Budget''' and '''Cost Budget''' tabs if the '''Group by Task''' check box is selected on the table toolbar
*An account group on the '''Balances''' tab

Similarly as the actual amount, you can compare the actual quantity of project budget lines with the revised {br}

Similarly to the actual amount, you can compare the actual quantity of project budget lines with the revised budgeted quantity to control how the project execution fits the planned quantity. The actual quantity is updated only if the UOM is specified in the budget line and if the system can convert the UOM of the corresponding project transaction to the UOM of the budget line by using the list of unit conversions defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) form.[anchor|#section_i3l_d4p_mcb]
==Update of the Project Budget by Released Transactions==
The following diagram illustrates how the system updates the project budget on the release of a project transaction depending on the settings of the budget level and the budget update.[anchor|#fig_fhq_2nv_q2b][anchor|#image_ghq_2nv_q2b][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_Project_Budget_Update.png|popup|350px]

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Managing Project Budget: General Information Project budget is used to provide both a financial plan and cost constraints for a project.         That is, you define the amount of money and resources to be spent on the project. Then you         can control the actual project costs against the costs in the original and revised budgets.         As a project progresses, you can continuously track budget execution and either adjust         expenditures or revise the budget. Learning Objectives In this chapter,          you will learn how         t o: Configure the revenue budget and the cost           budget  depending on           the detail level of the budget Update actual           values of the project budget depending on the level of the budget           update Lock the project budget and make changes to the locked budget Control            whether            AP bills, purchase orders, and change           orders  created for a           project exceed the project budget Applicable Scenarios You populate the project budget in the following cases: If you need to plan and track the revenue of a project If you need to control the amount of money and resources spent on the project Budget Planning You plan a project budget during          the          estimation          stage of t he project, before any project transaction         occurs.  To estimate         the project income, you populate the revenue budget of the project. To estimate the         resources to be spent on the project, you populate the cost budget. During the execution         stage of the project, when you process project transaction and bill the project, actual         values of the project budget are updated so you can control the project execution and         compare the actual values against the budget         ones. On         th e  Revenue Budget  and  Cost           Budget  tabs of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM302000) form, you can         add, revise, and delete budget lines. Each budget line is defined by the combination of the         following settings that are unique within the project: A project task, which identifies a step or activity within the project. An account group, which determines the category of the revenue or expenses that you           expect to incur during the project execution. A particular inventory item (that is, a resource) needed to complete the           task .            If you do not need to associate the budget line with a particular item but the budget           level is configured to include the item, you can select the empty item code ( N/A )           as the inventory item. The         level of details of revenue budget lines and cost budget lines—that is, whether you need to         specify the inventory item or not, depends on the option selected in the  Revenue           Budget Level  and  Cost Budget Level  boxes on the            Summary  tab ( Project Properties  section) of         the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, respectively. Other information that you can specify in a budget line includes the original budgeted         quantity of the selected inventory item, the unit rate, and the original budgeted amount,         which is calculated automatically as the original budgeted quantity multiplied by unit rate         if you have not specified a value manually. The revised budgeted         quantity and amount are initially equal to the original budgeted values. If          during         the estimation, acceptance, or execution stages of the project  you need to         revise the budget and want to keep the original budgeted amounts and quantities unchanged so         that you can later analyze the accuracy of your original estimates, you can adjust the         revised budgeted quantities and amounts, which are initially equal to the original budgeted         values. Budget Tracking As a project  is being         processed, you create project-related documents such as AP bills, purchase orders, or AR         invoices. This causes the creation of project transactions.          On         the release of these transactions , the system updates         the  Actual Quantity  and  Actual Amount  on the            Revenue Budget  and  Cost Budget  tabs of the             ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM302000) form. The system uses the combination of the project, project task, account group, and inventory         item to match a transaction with a project budget line. If the budget line with the same         combination exists, the system updates actual values of the existed line. For a new         combination that does not exist in the project budget, the system creates a new budget         line. For the revenue budget, the system creates a revenue budget line with the same inventory         item as the inventory item of the transaction if the  Detailed  option is selected in         the  Revenue Budget Update  box on the  General           Settings  tab ( General Settings  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form. With the  Summary  option selected, the         system creates a revenue budget line with the empty item code ( N/A ) instead of the         inventory item of the transaction. Similarly, the system creates cost budget lines based on         the option selected in the  Cost Budget Update  box on the            General Settings  tab ( General Settings          section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences form. For details, see the diagram         below. You track the            Actual           Amount  of project budget lines and compare this amount with         the  Revised           Budgeted Amount  when reviewing the budget. In the            Performance (%)  column, the system estimates the percentage of         the          actual amount to the revised budgeted          am ount.          For         a revenue budget line, this percent shows the progress of completion of your financial plan.         The fully performed budget line has the performance of 100%. For a cost budget line, the         percent shows how much expenses you have incurred against the planned amount. You use this         column to track the performance by the following budget : A project budget line on the  Revenue Budget  and  Cost             Budget  tabs A project task on the  Revenue Budget  and  Cost             Budget  tabs if the  Group by Task  check box is           selected on the table toolbar An account group on the  Balances  tab Similarly as the actual amount, you can compare the actual quantity of project budget lines         with the revised  Similarly to the         actual amount,  you can          compare the actual         quantity of project budget lines with the revised  budgeted         qua ntity          to control how the project execution fits the planned quantity .         The          actual quantity is updated only if the UOM is specified in the budget line and if the system         can convert the UOM of the corresponding project transaction to the UOM of the budget line         by using the list of unit conversions defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) Units of Measure         (CS203100) form.

==Other Settings That Affect the Workflow==
You can affect the workflow of managing the project budget by specifying additional settings as follows:[anchor|#_50a95b7f-f671-4287-bf30-2454483b4280]
*To cause the system to control whether an entered document is within the cost budget of a project, select ''Show a Warning'' in the '''Budget Control''' box on the '''General Settings''' ('''General Settings''' section) tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences].
*To rename the default empty item code (''&lt;N/A&gt;''), which is selected in a project budget line to indicate that no specific item is associated with the line, specify the needed value in the '''Empty Item Code''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''General Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form.

With these settings and entities specified, users in your company can manage the project budget quickly and accurately with a minimum of manual actions.
==Validation of Configuration==
To make sure that all configuration has been performed correctly, we recommend that in your system, you manage the project budget by performing instructions similar to those described in [HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Budget_Process_Activity|Managing Project Budget: To Configure and Update the Budget].]]></column>

==System Preparation==
Before you begin performing the steps of this activity, perform the following instructions to prepare the system:[anchor|#_6c9e4914-0e56-4fc0-9f9d-df880dcd99b6]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the U100 dataset preloaded as Pam Brawner by using the ''brawner'' username and the ''123'' password.[anchor|#_eb6bc80e-05aa-44df-9c81-6ef45f682bdf]
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select ''1/30/2020'' on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form, specify the following settings on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''General Settings''' section):
#*'''Revenue Budget Update''': ''Summary''
#* '''Cost Budget Update''': ''Detailed''
#:((({S:Warn}If proper options are already selected in the '''Revenue Budget Update''' and '''Cost Budget Update''' boxes, make no changes to the project accounting preferences.
)))
#Save your changes to the project accounting preferences.

==Step 1: Configuring the Project Budget==
To specify the revenue and cost budgets for the project, do the following:[anchor|#_9344a764-ce38-4b3f-9808-5a62da64a805]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''TOMYUM5'' project, and on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Project Properties''' section), notice that the '''Revenue Budget Level''' of the project is ''Task'' and the '''Cost Budget Level''' of the project is ''Task and Item''.
#On the '''Revenue Budget''' tab, add a row, and specify the following settings:
#*'''Project Task''': ''INSTALL''
#* '''Account Group''': ''REVENUE''
#* '''Original Budgeted Amount''': <tt>3,000.00</tt>
#:The added line represents the price of the juicer and the site review and installation services.
#:Notice that because of the selected revenue budget level, the revenue budget does not include inventory items. Also, notice that you cannot add another line with the same project task and account group to the revenue budget.
#On the '''Cost Budget''' tab, specify the settings shown in the following table in the three cost budget lines you add.
#:{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="33%" ! '''Inventory ID'''
!width="33%" !  '''Original Budgeted Quantity'''
!width="33%" !  '''Unit Rate'''
|- 
|  ''JUICER15''
| <tt>1.00</tt>
| <tt>2000.00</tt>
|- 
| ''SITEREVIEW''
| <tt>2.00</tt>
| <tt>40.00</tt>
|- 
| ''INSTALL''
| <tt>4.00</tt>
| <tt>80.00</tt>
|}
#:When you select an inventory item in a budget line, the system automatically selects an account group for the line based on the expense account of the non-stock item or the COGS account of the stock item that is mapped to the account group.
#:Notice that because of the selected cost budget level you must specify an inventory item in a cost budget line. Also notice that you cannot add another line with the same project task, inventory item, and account group to the cost budget.
#In the table selection area, select the '''Group by Task''' check box. In the table, review how the system groups budget lines. The '''Original Budgeted Amount''' of the line with the ''INSTALL'' project task should be equal to ''4,600.00''.
#Save your changes to the project.

==Step 2: Updating Actual Values of the Project Budget==
To process the transactions to update actual values of the cost budget of the project, do the following:[anchor|#_aae7eb57-9fae-4f8a-9a1a-c76b6b817ea3]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) form, create a new transaction with ''PM'' selected as the '''Module''' in the Summary area. 
#In the '''Description''' box, specify <tt>The juicer with the installation for the TOMYUM5 project</tt>.
#On the table toolbar, click '''Load Records from File''' ([image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_LoadRecordsfromFile.png]), and upload the transactions from the [{up}UserGuide/Files/TOMYUM5_Project_Transactions.xlsx|<tt>TOMYUM5&#95;Project&#95;Transactions.xlsx</tt>] file. While you are uploading the lines, leave the default column mapping.
#Make sure that the '''Total Amount''' in the Summary area is ''2,360.00''.
#:Notice that the quantity of the provided services is less than you have budgeted—that is, an hour of the site review instead of two hours and three hours of the installation instead of four hours. Also notice that two hours of training, which have not been budgeted, have been provided.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save''' to save the batch of project transactions, and then click '''Release''' to release it.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''TOMYUM5'' project, and in the Summary area, notice that the '''Actual Expenses''' box shows ''2,360.00'', which is the total amount of the released transactions.
#On the '''Cost Budget''' tab, review the cost budget of the project. Notice that the system has created a new budget line with the ''TRAINING'' item based on the ''Detailed'' level of the cost budget updated specified in the project accounting preferences. The system has also updated the '''Actual Quantity''' and '''Actual Amount''' of the budget lines based on the released transactions (see the following screenshot). You can compare revised budgeted values with actual ones and track the performance by budget line in the '''Performance (%)''' column.[anchor|#_4ad7563b-7bbb-4ad1-8865-cd6ce4bad453][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Project_Budget.png|popup|The cost budget of the project updated by released transactions|400px]
#While remaining on the '''Cost Budget''' tab, in the table selection area, select the '''Group by Task''' check box and review totals by project task. You can compare the '''Revised Budgeted Amount''' with the '''Actual Amount''' and track the performance by project task in the '''Performance (%)''' column.

==Step 3: Billing the Project==
To bill a project and process the invoice, do the following:[anchor|#_9f696cdd-e903-4dd0-aac2-7488eef7a7e2]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''TOMYUM5'' project, and do the following:
#On the form toolbar, click '''Run Project Billing'''.
#:The system creates an accounts receivable invoice and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form.
#:Notice that the '''Amount''' in the Summary area is ''2,950.00''.
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and on the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the accounts receivable invoice.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, open the ''TOMYUM5'' project, and in the Summary area, notice that the '''Actual Income''' box shows ''2,950.00'', which is the total amount of the released invoice. The system also calculates the project '''Margin''' as the difference of actual income and expenses.
#On the '''Revenue Budget''' tab, review the revenue budget of the project. Notice that the system has updated the '''Actual Quantity''' and '''Actual Amount''' of the revenue budget line based on the released invoice. You can compare the '''Revised Budgeted Amount''' with the '''Actual Amount''' and track the performance by budget line in the '''Performance (%)''' column.
#On the '''Balances''' tab, review the project budget by account group. You can track the performance by account group as well as by income and expense totals in the '''Performance (%)''' column.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Managing Project Budget: To Configure and Update the Budget In this activity, you will learn how to configure the project budget, updated actual values         of the project budget, and review project performance. The following activity is             based on the  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system             settings have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the             activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100              dataset to its initial state. Story Suppose that the Thai Food Restaurant customer has ordered a juicer along with the site         review and installation services from the  SweetLife Fruits & Jams company.  SweetLife's project accountant has         created a project to account for the provided material and work and bill the customer. Acting as the project accountant, you will configure the revenue and cost budgets of the         project. Then, when the juicer is delivered and installed, you will update actual values of         the cost budget and bill the project. Configuration Overview For the purposes of this activity, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features         (CS100000) form, the  Project Accounting  feature has been enabled to provide support         for the project accounting functionality.

Also,  Task  is selected as the            Revenue Budget Level  of the project and  Task and Item  is         selected as the  Cost Budget Level  of the project. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) Account Groups (PM201000) form, the  REVENUE ,  SUBCON ,            LABOR , and  MATERIAL  account groups have been created. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form, the  SITEREVIEW ,            INSTALL  and  TRAINING  non-stock items have been configured. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form, the   JUICER15  stock item has         been configured. Process Overview In this activity, you will configure the project budget with on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. You will then and release project         transactions on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) Project Transactions (PM304000) form that will         update the actual values of the project budget. You will then bill the project on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form and release the created accounts         receivable invoice on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form. System Preparation Before you begin performing the steps of this activity, perform the following instructions         to prepare the system: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the U100 dataset preloaded as Pam Brawner by           using the  brawner  username and the  123  password. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP             screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to  1/30/2020. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and             select  1/30/2020 on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and             process all documents in the system during this business date. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form, specify the           following settings on the  General Settings  tab ( General             Settings  section): Revenue Budget Update :  Summary Cost Budget Update :  Detailed If proper options are already selected in the  Revenue Budget               Update  and  Cost Budget Update   boxes, make no             changes to the project accounting preferences. Save your changes to the project accounting preferences. Step 1: Configuring the Project Budget To specify the revenue and cost budgets for the project, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, open the              TOMYUM5  project, and on the  Summary  tab             ( Project Properties  section), notice that the  Revenue             Budget Level  of the project is  Task  and the  Cost Budget             Level  of the project is  Task and Item . On the  Revenue Budget  tab, add a row, and specify the following             settings: Project Task :  INSTALL Account Group :  REVENUE Original Budgeted Amount :                3,000.00 The added line represents the price of the juicer and the site review and             installation services. Notice that because of the selected revenue budget level,             the revenue budget does not include inventory items. Also, notice that you cannot add             another line with the same project task and account group to the revenue           budget. On the  Cost Budget  tab, specify the settings shown in the           following table in the three cost budget lines you add. Inventory ID Original Budgeted Quantity Unit Rate JUICER15 1.00 2000.00 SITEREVIEW 2.00 40.00 INSTALL 4.00 80.00 When you select an inventory item in a budget line, the system automatically             selects an account group for the line based on the expense account of the non-stock item             or the COGS account of the stock item that is mapped to the account group. Notice             that because of the selected cost budget level you must specify an inventory item in a             cost budget line. Also notice that you cannot add another line with the same project             task, inventory item, and account group to the cost budget. In the table selection area, select the  Group by Task  check box.           In the table, review how the system groups budget lines. The  Original Budgeted             Amount  of the line with the  INSTALL  project task should be equal to              4,600.00 . Save your changes to the project. Step 2: Updating Actual Values of the Project Budget To process the transactions to update actual values of the cost budget of the project, do         the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) Project Transactions (PM304000) form, create a new transaction with              PM  selected as the  Module  in the Summary area.

On the table toolbar, click  Load Records from File  ( ), and upload the transactions from the  TOMYUM5_Project_Transactions.xlsx <tt>TOMYUM5&#95;Project&#95;Transactions.xlsx</tt> file. While you are           uploading the lines, leave the default column mapping. Make sure that the  Total Amount  in the Summary area is              2,360.00 . Notice that the quantity of the provided services is less than you             have budgeted—that is, an hour of the site review instead of two hours and three hours             of the installation instead of four hours. Also notice that two hours of training, which             have not been budgeted, have been provided. On the form toolbar, click  Save  to save the batch of project           transactions, and then click  Release  to release it. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, open the              TOMYUM5  project, and in the Summary area, notice that the  Actual             Expenses  box shows  2,360.00 , which is the total amount of the           released transactions. On the  Cost Budget  tab, review the cost budget of the project.           Notice that the system has created a new budget line with the  TRAINING  item based           on the  Detailed  level of the cost budget updated specified in the project           accounting preferences. The system has also updated the  Actual             Quantity  and  Actual Amount  of the budget lines based           on the released transactions (see the following screenshot). You can compare revised           budgeted values with actual ones and track the performance by budget line in the              Performance (%)  column. The cost budget of the project updated by released transactions While remaining on the  Cost Budget  tab, in the table selection           area, select the  Group by Task  check box and review totals by           project task. You can compare the  Revised Budgeted Amount  with the              Actual Amount  and track the performance by project task in the              Performance (%)  column. Step 3: Billing the Project To bill a project and process the invoice, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, open the  TOMYUM5  project,           and do the following: On the form toolbar, click  Run Project Billing . The system             creates an accounts receivable invoice and opens it on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form. Notice that the  Amount  in the Summary             area is  2,950.00 .

On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, open the  TOMYUM5            project, and in the Summary area, notice that the  Actual Income  box           shows  2,950.00 , which is the total amount of the released invoice. The system also           calculates the project  Margin  as the difference of actual income           and expenses. On the  Revenue Budget  tab, review the revenue budget of the           project. Notice that the system has updated the  Actual Quantity  and              Actual Amount  of the revenue budget line based on the released           invoice. You can compare the  Revised Budgeted Amount  with the              Actual Amount  and track the performance by budget line in the              Performance (%)  column. On the  Balances  tab, review the project budget by account group.           You can track the performance by account group as well as by income and expense totals in           the  Performance (%)  column. ]]></column>

==Story==
Suppose that the HM&rsquo;s Bakery and Cafe customer has ordered juicers, along with the following services: site review, installation, and employee training on operating the juicers from the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company. SweetLife&rsquo;s project accountant has created a cost-plus project to be billed based on the costs. The juicers have been delivered. The installation has been performed by Squeezo Inc. Then, SweetLife&rsquo;s consultant has provided the training. The project accountant of SweetLife has created purchase orders, entered project transactions, and partially billed the customer. When the project accountant has got a sick leave, another SweetLife&rsquo;s project accountant becomes responsible for the project. The first accountant has no possibility to hand over the project to the new accountant.{br}

Acting as the new project accountant of the project, you need to review the project balances to become familiar with the project and gather all the information about performed work.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Project Accounting'' feature has been enabled to support the project accounting functionality.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, the ''HMBAKERY6'' project has been created and the ''PHASE1'', ''PHASE2'', ''PHASE3'', and ''PHASE4'' project tasks have been created for the project.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, the ''000020'' and ''000021'' purchase orders (which are related to the project) have been created and billed.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) form, the ''PM00000009'', ''PM00000010'', and ''PM00000011'' batches of project transactions related to the project have been created and released.{br}

Project transactions related to the ''PHASE1'', ''PHASE2'', and ''PHASE4'' tasks of the project have been billed—that is, a pro forma invoice and the corresponding accounts receivable invoice have been created and released on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form and the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form, respectively. Also, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] form, a pro forma invoice for project transactions related to the ''PHASE3'' task has been created.
==Process Overview==
You will review project budgets and balances on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, from which you navigate to the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\PM_62_10_00|Project Balance] ([~/?ScreenId=PM621000|PM621000]) report to view the project balances in a ready-to-print format. You will review project transactions on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_10_00|Project Transaction Details] ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) form and project commitments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_60_00|Commitments] ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) form. You will then review project balances broken down by account group on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_PV_00_10|Budget Summary by Account Group] (PMPV0010) form.
==System Preparation==

This exposes the committed values of the budget, which you will need during the process of the budget review.

==Step 1: Reviewing the Project Balances==
To review project reports, do the following:[anchor|#_4557bd7a-f6e8-429a-8de0-d8aa89226c02]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''HMBAKERY6'' project.
#On the '''Revenue Budget''' tab, review revenue budget lines. Pay attention to the '''Actual Amount''' and '''Draft Invoices Amount''' columns.
#:The actual amount reflects the amount that has been already billed, The total actual amount of the revenue budget is shown in the Summary area in the '''Actual Income''' box.
#:To review the list of project transactions that correspond to a revenue budget line with a nonzero actual amount, you click the line, and on the table toolbar, click '''View Transactions'''. The system shows the transactions on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_10_00|Project Transaction Details] ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) form.
#:For the ''PHASE3'' task with a nonzero draft invoice amount, a pro forma invoice has been already prepared but the corresponding AR invoice has not been created or has not been released yet.
#On the '''Cost Budget''' tab, review cost budget lines and the values in the '''Revised Committed Amount''' and '''Actual Amount''' columns.
#:The lines with the ''INSTALL'' inventory item have nonzero committed values, which means these lines have related purchase orders. The '''Revised Committed Amount''' shows the amount of the purchase, The '''Committed Invoiced Amount''' amount shows the amount on purchase orders that has been already billed.
#:The actual amount reflects the expenses that have been already incurred, The total actual amount of the cost budget is shown in the Summary area in the '''Actual Expenses''' box.
#To review the list of project transactions that correspond to the line with the ''PHASE4'' project task and the ''TRAINING'' inventory item, do the following:
##Click the line.
##On the table toolbar, click '''View Transactions'''.
##Review the list of corresponding project transactions on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_10_00|Project Transaction Details] form, which the system opens in a pop-up window. Notice that multiple project transactions correspond to the cost budget line,
##Close the pop-up window form.
#To review the list of commitments that correspond to the line with the ''PHASE2'' project task and the ''INSTALL'' inventory item, do the following:
##Click the line.
##On the table toolbar, click '''View Commitment Details'''.
##Review the list of corresponding commitments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_60_00|Commitments] ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) form, which the system opens in a pop-up window. Notice that two commitments correspond to the cost budget line.
##Close the pop-up window with the form.
#In the table selection area, select the ''PHASE1'' project task in the '''Project Task''' box. In the table, to review the cost budget lines related to the selected task.
#:((({S:Warn}If you were to click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar when a project task is selected in the '''Project Task''' box in the table selection area, the system would automatically fill in the project task of the newly created line with the selected task.
)))
#In the table selection area, select the '''Group by Task''' check box. The system clears the '''Project Task''' box in the table selection area, and in the table, groups the cost budget lines by task. You can review the total budgeted values by task. Notice that the ''PHASE4'' has the performance of 75%, which means not all the budgeted expenses have been incurred within the task.
#On the '''Balances''' tab, do the following to review the project budget broken down by account groups:
#:For an account group with a nonzero actual values, you can click the line, and on the table toolbar, click '''View Transactions'''. The system opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_10_00|Project Transaction Details] form and displays the list of corresponding project transactions.
#:For an account group with a nonzero committed values, you can click the line, and on the table toolbar, click '''View Commitment Details'''. The system opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_60_00|Commitments] form and displays the list of corresponding project commitments.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Reports''' > '''Print Project Balance'''.
#:The system navigates to the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\PM_62_10_00|Project Balance] ([~/?ScreenId=PM621000|PM621000]) report, which is a ready-to-print version of the project balances. The printed form lists the project budget broken down by project tasks and account groups.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_10_00|Project Transaction Details] form, in the Selection area, select ''HMBAKERY6'' as the '''Project''' and review the project transaction related to the project.Notice that you can also filter the transactions by account group, project task, inventory item, the range of dates, employee, account, related accounts receivable document, and transaction identifier.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Managing Project Budget: To Review Project      Balances In this activity, you will review project balances by using  Acumatica ERP reports and forms. The following activity is             based on the  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system             settings have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the             activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100              dataset to its initial state. Story Suppose that the HM's Bakery and Cafe customer has ordered juicers, along with the         following services: site review, installation, and employee training on operating the         juicers from the  SweetLife Fruits & Jams         company.  SweetLife's project         accountant has created a cost-plus project to be billed based on the costs. The juicers have         been delivered. The installation has been performed by Squeezo Inc. Then,  SweetLife's consultant has provided the         training. The project accountant of  SweetLife has created purchase orders,         entered project transactions, and partially billed the customer.          When the project         accountant has got a sick leave, another  SweetLife's project accountant becomes         responsible for the project. The first accountant has no possibility to hand over the         project to the new accountant. Acting as the new project accountant of the project, you need to review the project         balances  to become         familiar with the project and gather all the information about performed         work . Configuration Overview For the purposes of this activity, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form,         the  Project Accounting  feature has been enabled to support the project accounting         functionality. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, the  HMBAKERY6  project has         been         cre ated          and the  PHASE1 ,  PHASE2 ,  PHASE3 , and  PHASE4  project tasks have         been created for the project . On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form, the  000020  and  000021          purchase orders (which are related to the project) have been created and billed. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) Project Transactions (PM304000) form, the  PM00000009 ,            PM00000010 , and  PM00000011  batches of project transactions related to the         project have been created and released. Project transactions related to the  PHASE1 ,  PHASE2 , and  PHASE4  tasks         of the project have been billed—that is, a pro forma invoice and the corresponding accounts         receivable invoice have been created and released on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices         (PM307000) form and the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form, respectively. Also,         on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices form, a pro forma invoice for project transactions         related to the  PHASE3  task has been created. Process Overview You will review project budgets and balances on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects         (PM301000) form,         f rom         which you navigate to  the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM621000|PM621000]) Project Balance (PM621000)         report to view the project balances in a ready-to-print format. You will review project         transactions on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) Project Transaction Details (PM401000)         form          and project commitments on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) Commitments (PM306000) form.          You will then review project balances broken         down by account group on the  Budget Summary by Account Group (PMPV0010) form. System Preparation To sign in to the system and prepare to perform the instructions of the activity, do the         following: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the U100 dataset preloaded as Pam Brawner by           using the  brawner  username and the  123  password. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP             screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to  1/30/2020. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and             select  1/30/2020 on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and             process all documents in the system during this business date. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form, on the  General             Settings  tab ( General Settings  section), select the              Internal Cost Commitment Tracking  check box, and save your           changes to the project accounting preferences. This exposes the committed values of the           budget, which you will need during the process of the budget         review. Step 1: Reviewing the Project Balances To review project reports, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, open the  HMBAKERY6            project. On the  Revenue Budget  tab, review revenue budget lines.            Pay           attention to the  Actual Amount  and  Draft Invoices             Amount              columns. The             actual amount reflects the amount that has been already billed, The total actual amount             of the revenue budget is shown in the Summary area in the  Actual               Income  box. To review the list of project transactions that             correspond to a revenue budget line with a nonzero actual amount, you click the line,             and on the table toolbar, click  View Transactions . The system             shows the transactions on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) Project Transaction Details (PM401000) form. For             the  PHASE3  task with a nonzero draft invoice amount, a pro forma invoice has been             already prepared but the corresponding AR invoice has not been created or has not been             released yet. On the  Cost Budget  tab,           re view           cost budget lines and the values in the  Revised Committed Amount            and  Actual Amount              columns. The             lines with the  INSTALL  inventory item have nonzero committed values, which means             these lines have related purchase orders. The  Revised Committed               Amount  shows the amount of the purchase, The  Committed Invoiced               Amount  amount shows the amount on purchase orders that has been already             billed. The actual amount reflects the expenses that have been already incurred,              The             total actual amount of the cost budget is shown in the Summary area in the                Actual Expenses              box. To review the list of project transactions that correspond to the           line  with the              PHASE4  project task and the  TRAINING  inventory item, do the             following : Click the line. On the table toolbar, click  View Transactions . Review the list of corresponding project transactions on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) Project Transaction Details form, which the system opens in a pop-up               window.  Notice               that multiple project transactions correspond to the cost budget               line, Close the pop-up window form. To            review           the list of  commitments that correspond to the           line  with the              PHASE2  project task and the  INSTALL  inventory item, do the             following : Click the line. On the table toolbar, click  View Commitment Details . Review the list of corresponding commitments on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) Commitments               (PM306000) form, which the system opens in a pop-up               window.  Notice               that two commitments correspond to the cost budget line. Close the pop-up window with the form. In the table selection area, select the  PHASE1  project task in the              Project Task  box. In the table, to review the cost budget lines           related to the selected task. If you were to click  Add Row  on             the table toolbar when a project task is selected in the  Project               Task  box in the table selection area, the system would automatically fill             in the project task of the newly created line with the selected task. In the table selection area, select the  Group by Task  check box.           The system clears the  Project Task  box in the table selection area,           and in the table, groups the cost budget lines by           ta sk.           You can review the total budgeted values            by task. Notice that           the  PHASE4  has the performance of 75%, which means not all the budgeted expenses           have been incurred within the task. On the  Balances  tab, do the following to review the project           budget broken down by account             groups: For an             account group with a nonzero actual values, you              can              click the line, and on the table toolbar, click  View             Transactions . The system opens the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) Project Transaction Details form and             displays the list of corresponding project transactions. For an account group with             a nonzero committed values, you can click the line, and on the table toolbar, click                View Commitment Details .

The project budget can be exceeded as users enter documents. If the system is configured to control the budget on document entry, it check whether an entered document is within the cost budget of the project, taking into consideration the portion of the budget that has already been consumed. That helps you to control the documents you are creating and can be useful for a person who approves these documents.
When you enter or process one of the following documents related to a project, and the amount of a document line exceeds the cost budget of the corresponding project budget line (even if the project budget has no corresponding budget line), you will see a warning:[anchor|#_77315587-7956-4d65-8d43-e34405727c58]

==Story==
Suppose that the West BBQ Restaurant customer has ordered a juicer from the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company, along with the installation and training on operating the juicer. The SweetLife company contracted the Squeezo Inc. vendor for all the services.  SweetLife&rsquo;s project accountant has created the project. The vendor has delivered and installed the juicer, and Squeezo&rsquo;s consultant has provided the training. Then suppose that project accountant noticed that the juicer has cost an extra $200 beyond the budgeted amount, and the installation and the training have taken two hours more than the number of hours budgeted. Acting as  SweetLife&rsquo;s project accountant, you will enter a change order to adjust the cost of the juicer, an accounts payable bill for the provided training, and a purchase order for the installation service, checking whether the costs are within the project budget.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, the following features have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form:[anchor|#_85ada628-bc34-4eed-817e-0247a845166b]
*''Project Accounting'', which provides support for the project accounting functionality
*''Inventory and Order Management'', which provides the ability to maintain stock items and to create and process purchasing documents that include stock items

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, the ''WESTBBQ2'' project has been created and the ''PHASE1'' and ''PHASE2'' project tasks have been created for the project. The change order workflow has been enabled for the project. Also, the following cost budget lines have been added to the project:[anchor|#_b85785d3-3380-49ad-be3a-09685379bdf7]
*One juicer in the amount of $2,000
*Four hours of installation in the amount of $320
*Eight hours of training in the amount of $320

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, the ''INSTALL'' and ''TRAINING'' non-stock item has been configured.{br}

==Story==
Suppose that the HM&rsquo;s Bakery and Cafe customer has ordered a juicer, along with the services of installation and training for its employees on operating the juicer from the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company. SweetLife&rsquo;s project accountant has created a project. Before the work on the project has begun, the customer has requested 12 hours of training instead of initially ordered eight hours.{br}

Acting as the project accountant, you will change the original budgeted values of the project before proceeding to the execution stage and lock the budget to prevent the original budgeted values from further editing.The training will take 16 hours instead of 12 and you will adjust revised budgeted values to bill the customer for all the provided services.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Project Accounting'' feature has been enabled to support the project accounting functionality.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, the ''HMBAKERY11'' project has been created and the ''PHASE1'' and ''PHASE2'' project tasks have been created for the project.
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, the ''INSTALL'' and ''TRAINING'' non-stock items have been configured.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, the ''JUICER15'' stock item has been configured.
==Process Overview==
In this activity, you will change the project budget on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form and then lock the budget to prevent the original budget values of the project from being edited. You will then adjust the revised budgeted values.
==System Preparation==

When you select an inventory item in a project budget line, the system automatically populates the unit rate of the line. The mechanism of retrieving the unit rate depends on the budget line type and is supported on the following forms: [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_00|Project Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_85_00|Change Requests] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308500|PM308500]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]), and [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_90_00|Project Budget] ([~/?ScreenId=PM309000|PM309000]).
==Retrieving the Unit Rate for a Revenue Budget Line==
When you select an inventory item in a revenue budget line—that is, a line with the account group of the income type, the system automatically fills in the unit rate of the line with the item price. The system searches for an applicable price of the inventory item that is effective on the start date of the project or the document date among the sales prices existing in the system. For more details on how the system searches the price, see [HelpRoot_PricesAndDiscounts\PriceDiscount_Sales_Price_Selection_GeneralInfo|Automatic Price Selection: Rules of Price Selection].
==Retrieving the Unit Rate for a Cost Budget Line==
When you select an inventory item in a cost budget line—that is, a line with the account group of the expense type, the system automatically fills in the unit rate of the line with the item cost.{br}

If the type of the selected inventory item of the budget line is labor—that is, the ''Labor'' option is selected for the item in the '''Type''' box in the '''Item Defaults''' section on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_99_00|Labor Cost Rates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209900|PM209900]) form, the system retrieves the labor cost rate of the ''Labor Item'' type that is associated with the same inventory item and that has an effective date that satisfies the start date of project or the document date.{br}

If no labor cost rate is found or the type of the selected inventory item of the budget line is not ''Labor'', the system retrieves the following costs depending on the type of the inventory item:[anchor|#ul_plz_xvn_x2b]
*For a stock item: The '''Average Cost''' of the item from the '''Price/Cost Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form
*For a non-stock item: The '''Current Cost''' of the item from the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form

The following diagram illustrates the logic the system uses to select the cost for an inventory item.[anchor|#_3a903e16-5b56-4d12-ae1d-be7c6d910794][anchor|#_f471f8e3-fc92-4c91-b110-552f948033ec][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_Projects_Unit_Rate.png|popup|450px]]]></column>

For more details on how the system searches the price, see  Automatic Price Selection: Rules of Price Selection. Retrieving the Unit Rate for a Cost Budget Line When you select an inventory item in a cost budget line—that is, a line with the account         group of the expense type, the system automatically fills in the unit rate of the line with         the item cost. If the type of the selected inventory item of the budget line is labor—that is, the            Labor  option is selected for the item in the  Type  box in the            Item Defaults  section on the  General           Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form, on the             ([~/?ScreenId=PM209900|PM209900]) Labor Cost Rates (PM209900) form, the system retrieves the labor cost rate         of the  Labor Item  type that is associated with the same inventory item and that has         an effective date that satisfies the start date of project or the document date. If no labor cost rate is found or the type of the selected inventory item of the budget         line is not  Labor , the system retrieves the following costs depending on the type of         the inventory item: For a stock item: The  Average Cost  of the item from the              Price/Cost Info  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items           (IN202500) form For a non-stock item: The  Current Cost  of the item from the              Price/Cost Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items           (IN202000) form The following diagram illustrates the logic the system uses to select the cost for an         inventory item. ]]></column>

 Acumatica ERP supports project quotes, which you can enter and modify on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) form. A project quote is used to estimate a potential project and to send a proposal to the customer; you use the quote before you create a project in the system and begin billing and accounting for revenues and costs. Each modification of a project quote can be printed and sent to the customer for review, and you can modify the quote as many times as is necessary until an agreement is reached. After the customer agrees to the terms of the quote, you can convert the winning quote to a project.
==Learning Objectives==
You will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_nwj_gch_tbb]
*Create a project quote
*Specify the settings of the quote by using a project template
*Specify the estimation lines of the project quote
*Create a project based on the project quote
*Review the interaction between project quotes and opportunities

==Applicable Scenarios==
If you want to send a proposal to the customer before you create a project, or if you need to agree with the customer about the terms of a potential project before creating the project, you can use the functionality of project quotes.[anchor|#section_fdf_x42_p2b]
==Creation of Project Quotes==
You create a project quote on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) form.{br}

For a new project quote, you specify the following settings:[anchor|#ul_fsf_yfs_p2b]
*The description of the project quote.
*The project template, which the system uses to populate the project tasks, attributes, and project manager of the project quote. You can change these default settings, if needed.
*:If you first specify the tasks, attributes, and project manager of the project quote, and then select the project template, you can either replace your specified settings with the settings of the project template or leave your specified settings.
*The business account associated with the project quote.
*:Based on the settings specified for the selected business account, on the '''Billing Information''' tab, the system inserts the contact information and the financial details. You can override these settings, if needed.
*Optional: The project tasks on the '''Project Tasks''' tab.
*The estimated labor and material costs and prices on the '''Estimation''' tab. If you convert the project quote to a project, the system populates the revenue and cost budget of the project based on the settings specified on this tab.

When you click '''Save''' on the form toolbar, the system creates a project quote with the ''Draft'' status. When you have specified all the needed settings and have finished modify the project quote, you submit the quote by clicking '''Submit Quote''' on the form toolbar. A submitted project quote is assigned the ''Prepared'' status and you cannot modify it until it is assigned the ''Draft'' status back.{br}

You can email a submitted project quote to the customer by invoking the '''Send Quote''' action on the form toolbar. Once the project quote is sent, the system performs the following actions:[anchor|#ul_l3h_xkk_nlb]
*Creates and lists the corresponding email activity on the '''Activities''' tab of the form
*Attaches the quote to the email activity (in the form of a report) and sends it to the recipient
*Changes the status of the quote to ''Sent''
{br}

If you need to modify a project quote, you click '''Edit Quote''' on the form toolbar. The quote is assigned the ''Draft'' status and can be modified.((({S:Warn}If you need to modify an existing project quote but also want to leave its original version intact (for example, for historical purposes), you can create a copy of the project quote by invoking the '''Copy Quote''' action; you then modify the copy.
)))
==Estimation Lines of a Project Quotes==
The lines on the '''Estimation''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) form represent the estimated revenue and costs of a project quote, which the system converts to lines of the revenue and cost budgets when you create a project based on the project quote.{br}

An estimation line with an account group specified in the '''Revenue Account Group''' column establishes revenue; the '''Ext. Price''' of the line is the estimated revenue amount. An estimation line with an account group specified in the '''Cost Account Group''' column establishes costs; the '''Ext. Cost''' of the line is the estimated cost amount. Estimation lines with both the '''Revenue Account Group''' and the '''Cost Account Group''' specified establish revenue and costs at the same time.[anchor|#section_kcj_x42_p2b]
==Creation of a Project Based on a Project Quote==
You can convert a project quote to a project if the project quote has the ''Prepared'' or ''Sent'' status—that is, if the project quote has been submitted or emailed. Before you convert the project quote, the following settings must be specified for it in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) form:[anchor|#ul_ejx_dpv_q2b]
*'''Project Template''': The template to be used for the creation of the project
*'''Business Account''': The customer of the project
*'''New Project ID''': The identifier of the project

For a project quote that satisfies the basic requirements listed above, on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] form, you click '''Convert to Project''' to convert the project quote to a project. In the '''Convert to Project''' dialog box, which opens, you define the settings to be used for the created project and click '''OK'''.{br}

Once a project is created based on a project quote, the quote is assigned the ''Closed'' status. If you delete the project, the system assigns the ''Prepared'' status to the project quote. You can assign the ''Draft'' status to the project quote and edit it, if needed, and create a project based on the project quote again.{br}

In a project created based on a project quote, a link to the project quote is displayed in the '''Quote Ref. Nbr.''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Quote''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form.[anchor|#section_i3l_d4p_mcb]
==Workflow of Project Quotes==
The following diagram illustrates the workflow of processing a project quote.[anchor|#fig_fhq_2nv_q2b][anchor|#image_ghq_2nv_q2b][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_Project_Quotes_Workflow.png|popup|350px]]]></column>

This topic describes how opportunities are integrated with project quotes.[anchor|#section_fdf_x42_p2b]
==Creation of Project Quotes Based on an Opportunity==
While you are viewing an opportunity on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) form, you can begin the process of creating a quote based on the opportunity by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Create Quote''' on the form toolbar. The system opens the '''Create New Quote''' dialog box, where you specify basic settings and initiate the creation of the quote.{br}

The system creates the project quote based on the opportunity and opens the project quote on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) form. In the Summary area, the system inserts the identifier of the opportunity in the '''Opportunity ID''' box and copies the following settings from the opportunity:[anchor|#ul_fsf_yfs_p2b]
*The business account
*The description (in the '''Subject''' box)
*The owner

Once you save the project quote associated with the opportunity, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] form, the project quote is listed on the '''Quotes''' tab along with the other project and sales quotes linked to the opportunity.
==The Primary Project Quote of an Opportunity==
The first quote created for an opportunity is always the primary quote. That is, on the '''Quotes''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) form, the primary quote has the check box in the '''Primary''' column selected. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) form, the '''Primary''' check box is selected for this quote in the Summary area.{br}

The primary project quote of an opportunity reflects the opportunity value in sales reports. However, the details of the project quote and the actions applicable to the quote are not reflected in the opportunity.{br}

Starting from the second quote, you can create either a primary quote or a non-primary quote for an opportunity. Also, you can make an existing quote the primary quote for the opportunity. (This causes the previous primary quote to become non-primary, because each opportunity can have only one primary quote.)
==Creation of a Project Based on a Project Quote==
If a project quote has been created based on an opportunity, you can create a project based on the project quote only if the project quote is the primary quote of the opportunity.{br}

If the project has been created based on the primary project quote of an opportunity, on the '''Quotes''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) form, the identifier of the created project is shown in the '''Project ID''' column of the project quote.{br}

The project specified in the '''Project''' box on the '''Details''' tab ('''Additional Details''' section) is used for the creation of sales orders, invoices, and service orders for the opportunity. This project is not used for the creation of project quotes based on the opportunity. Also, the project in this box does not reflect the connection with the project created based on the primary project quote of the opportunity.]]></column>

==Other Settings That Affect the Workflow==
You can affect the workflow of processing project quotes by specifying additional settings as follows:[anchor|#_52406023-d3e0-4063-a060-735d623b3e9d]
*To change the format of project quote identifiers, adjust the ''PMQUOTE'' numbering sequence on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_10_10|Numbering Sequences] ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) form or create a new numbering sequence and select this sequence in the '''Quote Numbering Sequence''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''Numbering Sequence''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form. Project quote identifiers must be assigned only automatically. For more information on numbering sequences, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Multiple_Numbering_Sequences|Numbering Sequence Usage].
*:By default, the ''PMQUOTE'' numbering sequence specifies that the project quote identifier is an automatically generated alphanumeric string that starts with the ''PQ'' prefix and followed by six digits, such as ''PQ000001''.
*To cause the system to automatically select a project template on creation of project quotes, select the project template in the '''Default Quote Template''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''General Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] form.
*To cause the system to automatically select the revenue account group for new estimation lines of a project quote if there are multiple income account groups defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_10_00|Account Groups] ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) form, specify the '''Default Revenue Account Group''' for expense account groups in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_10_00|Account Groups] form. For more information on account groups, see [HelpRoot_Projects\Account_Groups_GeneralInfo|Account Groups: General Information].

==Story==
Suppose that the HM&rsquo;s Bakery and Cafe customer has ordered a juicer for one of its restaurants, along with the installation and training services. The sales manager has created an opportunity for the provision of the juicer and the services. Acting as an estimator, you will create a project quote for this opportunity, confirm the quote with the customer, and convert the quote to the project.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, the following features have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form:[anchor|#_4387db18-6b29-4015-8d96-56b9069f20d7]
*''Project Accounting'', which provides support for the project accounting functionality
*''Project Quotes'', which provides the ability to create project quotes
*''Customer Management'', which provides the customer relation management (CRM) functionality, including management of opportunities

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) form, the ''000001'' opportunity has been created. A note and a file have been attached to the opportunity.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_00|Project Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) form, the ''PROGRESS'' project template has been configured.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_10|Project Template Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208010|PM208010]) form, the ''PHASE1'' and ''PHASE2'' project template tasks have been created for the ''PROGRESS'' project template.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_10_00|Account Groups] ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) form, the ''REVENUE'', ''MATERIAL'', ''SUBCON'', and ''LABOR'' account groups have been created.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, the ''INSTALL'' and ''TRAINING'' non-stock items have been configured.
==Process Overview==
In this activity, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) form, you will initiate the creation of a project quote for the opportunity created for the customer. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) form, you will then configure the project quote, including the creation of estimation lines. You will also print the project quote and email it to the customer for review. Then you will convert the quote to a project.
==System Preparation==
Before you begin performing the steps of this activity, perform the following instructions to prepare the system:[anchor|#_6c9e4914-0e56-4fc0-9f9d-df880dcd99b6][anchor|#_7a838202-b409-4977-bbaa-4161556a51a9]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded as Pam Brawner by using the ''brawner'' username and the ''123'' password.[anchor|#_bdd48b64-4b3a-431d-b3c7-f6f6983dc8b4]
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select ''1/30/2020'' on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.

==Step 1: Creating a Project Quote==
To create a project quote for an opportunity, do the following:[anchor|#_de8b7925-a170-40ef-91d6-1d90afb86754]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) form, open the ''000001'' opportunity, and in the Summary area, notice that the amount in the '''Amount''' box is equal to ''3,500.00''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Create Quote'''.
#In the '''Create New Quote''' dialog box, which opens, do the following:
##Select ''Project Quote'' as the '''Quote Type'''.
##:Notice that the '''Make New Quote Primary''' check box is selected.
##Click '''Create and Review'''.
#:The system creates a project quote based on the opportunity and opens the project quote on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) form.
#On this form, review the created project quote, and notice the following:
#*In the Summary area, the '''Primary''' check box is selected, which means that the project is the primary quote of the opportunity, whose identifier is shown in the '''Opportunity ID''' box.
#*On the form title bar, the icon left of '''Notes''' is shaded in yellow, and ''(1)'' is shown after '''Files''', indicating that the project quote has a note and an attached file, which have been copied from the opportunity.
#In the Summary area, specify the following settings:
#*'''Project Template''': ''PROGRESS''
#* '''New Project ID''': <tt>HMBAKERY1</tt>
#:When you select the project template, the system fills in the relevant elements of the project quote with the settings specified for the template.
#On the '''Project Tasks''' tab, review the tasks that have been copied from the selected project template. Notice that the '''Default''' check box is selected for the ''PHASE1'' task. The project task is specified as the default task of the project quote because this task is the default task of the selected project template.
#On the '''Estimation''' tab, add three lines with the settings from the following table (clearing the default settings in the specified columns); these settings establish cost by task and inventory item.
#:{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="16%" ! '''Inventory ID'''
!width="16%" !  '''Quantity'''
!width="16%" !  '''Ext. Price'''
!width="16%" !  '''Project Task'''
!width="16%" !  '''Cost Account Group'''
!width="16%" !  '''Revenue Account Group'''
|- 
|  ''JUICER15''
| <tt>1.00</tt>
| Cleared
| ''PHASE1''
|  ''MATERIAL''
| Cleared
|- 
| ''INSTALL''
| <tt>4.00</tt>
| Cleared
| ''PHASE1''
|  ''SUBCON''
| Cleared
|- 
| ''TRAINING''
| <tt>8.00</tt>
| Cleared
| ''PHASE2''
|  ''LABOR''
| Cleared
|}
#:Notice that the system automatically selects ''PHASE1'' as the project task in a new estimation line because this task is selected as the default for the project quote.
#:You have cleared the '''Ext. Price''' and '''Revenue Account Group''' columns so that when this quote is converted to a project, the system will not convert these lines, which have no price and no revenue account group, to revenue budget lines of the project.
#Add two more estimation lines with the settings from the following table; these settings establish revenue by task.
#:{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="37%" ! '''Description'''
!width="18%" !  '''Ext. Price'''
!width="18%" !  '''Project Task'''
!width="25%" !  '''Revenue Account Group'''
|- 
| <tt>The juicer with installation</tt>
| <tt>2900.00</tt>
| ''PHASE1''
|  ''REVENUE''
|- 
| <tt>Training of employees</tt>
| <tt>400.00</tt>
| ''PHASE2''
|  ''REVENUE''
|}
#:Notice that for each of the added lines the '''Ext. Cost''' and '''Cost Account Group''' columns are empty. When this quote is converted to a project, the system will not convert these lines, which have no cost and cost account group, to cost budget lines of the project.
#Save your changes to the project quote.
#:In the Summary area, notice that the amount in the '''Total Sales''' box is ''3,300.00'', which is the total of the values in the '''Ext. Price''' column on the '''Estimation''' tab.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] form, again open the ''000001'' opportunity, and notice the following:
#*In the Summary area, the '''Amount''' of the opportunity has been changed to the total sales of the created project quote (''3,300.00'').
#*On the '''Quotes''' tab, where the project quote you created is listed in the table, the total sales of the quote is shown in the '''Amount''' column (''3,300.00''). Also, the check box in the '''Primary''' column is selected, which means that this is the primary project quote of the opportunity.

==Step 2: Sending the Project Quote for Confirmation==
To email and print the project quote, do the following:
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) form, open the project quote that you have just created.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Submit Quote'''. The system changes the status of the quote to ''Prepared''.
#:Notice that now you cannot edit the project quote.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Send Quote''' to send the project quote to the customer.
#:The system generates the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\PM_60_45_00|Project Quote] ([~/?ScreenId=PM604500|PM604500]) report, which is a ready-to-print version of the quote. It then attaches the quote to the email, and sends the email to the customer's email address, which is specified on the '''Billing Information''' tab of this form. The system also changes the status of the project quote to ''Sent''.
#Open the '''Activities''' tab, and notice that an activity related to the sent email is listed in the table.
#:The '''Summary''' column contains the link to the email. If you clicked the link, the system would open the email on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_15|Email Activity] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306015|CR306015]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Print Quote''' to print the project quote.
#:The system navigates to the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\PM_60_45_00|Project Quote] report, which is a ready-to-print version of the quote.

==Step 3: Creating a Project Based on the Project Quote==
To create a project based on the project quote, do the following:[anchor|#_4557bd7a-f6e8-429a-8de0-d8aa89226c02]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) form, open the project quote that you have created, and in the Summary area, notice that the amount in the '''Total Sales''' and '''Total Cost''' boxes are equal to ''3,300.00'' and ''2,640.00'', respectively.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Convert to Project''' to convert the quote to a project.
#In the '''Convert to Project''' dialog box, which opens, select the following check boxes:
#*'''Copy Notes to Project'''
#* '''Copy Files to Project'''
#:((({S:Warn}The '''Link Activities to Project''' check box in the dialog box is cleared by default. If you were to select this check box, the system would automatically select ''PHASE1'' as the project task to which the activities copied from the project quote would be linked in the created project. This is because ''PHASE1'' is the default task of the ''PROGRESS'' project template.
)))
#Click '''OK'''.
#:The system closes the dialog box, changes the status of the project quote to ''Closed'', creates a project based on the project quote, and opens the project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form.
#:On the form title bar, notice that the icon left of '''Notes''' is shaded in yellow, and'' (1)'' is shown after '''Files''', indicating that the project has a note and an attached file, which have been copied from the project quote (and were previously copied from the opportunity).
#On the '''Summary''' tab, in the '''Quote''' section, make sure that the number of the corresponding project quote is shown in the '''Quote Ref. Nbr.''' box.
#On the '''Tasks''' tab, review the project tasks that have been copied from the project quote. Notice that the check box in the '''Default''' column is selected for the ''PHASE1'' task, indicating that it is the default task of the created project. 
#On the '''Revenue Budget''' tab, review the revenue budget lines of the project, and notice that they have been created based on the estimation lines of the project quote with the specified revenue account group.
#On the '''Cost Budget''' tab, review the cost budget lines of the project, and notice that they have been created based on the estimation lines of the project quote with the specified cost account group.
#On the '''Balances''' tab (see the following screenshot), verify the totals: The '''Income Totals''' of the project balance should match the '''Total Sales''' of the project quote, and the '''Expense Totals''' of the project balance should match the '''Total Cost''' of the project quote.[anchor|#_4ad7563b-7bbb-4ad1-8865-cd6ce4bad453][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_Project_Quote.png|popup|The balances of the project created based on the project quote|400px]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) form, open the ''000001'' opportunity, and review the opportunity as follows:
#*On the '''Activities''' tab, notice that the email created for the project quote is also listed in the table for the opportunity.
#*On the '''Quotes''' tab, in the '''Project ID''' column, find the identifier of the project created based on the project quote.

On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM208010|PM208010]) Project Template Tasks (PM208010) form, the  PHASE1  and  PHASE2          project template tasks have been created for the  PROGRESS  project template. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) Account Groups (PM201000) form, the  REVENUE ,          MATERIAL ,  SUBCON , and  LABOR  account groups have been created. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form, the  JUICER15  stock item has         been configured. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form, the  INSTALL  and            TRAINING  non-stock items have been configured. Process Overview In this activity, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) Opportunities (CR304000) form, you will initiate         the creation of a project quote for the opportunity created for the customer. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes (PM304500) form, you will then configure the project quote,         including the creation of estimation lines. You will also print the project quote and email         it to the customer for review. Then you will convert the quote to a project. System Preparation Before you begin performing the steps of this activity, perform the following instructions         to prepare the system: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the  U100  dataset preloaded as Pam Brawner           by using the  brawner  username and the  123  password. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP             screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to  1/30/2020. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and             select  1/30/2020 on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and             process all documents in the system during this business date. Step 1: Creating a Project Quote To create a project quote for an opportunity, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) Opportunities (CR304000) form, open the  000001            opportunity, and in the Summary area, notice that the amount in the              Amount  box is equal to  3,500.00 . On the form toolbar, click  Create Quote . In the  Create New Quote  dialog box, which opens, do the             following: Select  Project Quote  as the  Quote Type . Notice that                 the  Make New Quote Primary  check box is selected. Click  Create and Review . The system creates a project quote based on the opportunity and opens the project             quote on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes (PM304500) form. On this form, review the created project quote, and notice the following: In the Summary area, the  Primary  check box is selected, which               means that the project is the primary quote of the opportunity, whose identifier is               shown in the  Opportunity ID  box. On the form title bar, the icon left of  Notes  is shaded in               yellow, and  (1)  is shown after  Files , indicating that               the project quote has a note and an attached file, which have been copied from the               opportunity. In the Summary area, specify the following settings: Project Template :  PROGRESS New Project ID :  HMBAKERY1 When you select the project template, the system fills in the relevant elements of             the project quote with the settings specified for the template. On the  Project Tasks  tab, review the tasks that have been copied           from the selected project template. Notice that the  Default  check           box is selected for the  PHASE1  task. The project task is specified as the default           task of the project quote because this task is the default task of the selected project           template. On the  Estimation  tab, add three lines with the settings from the           following table (clearing the default settings in the specified columns); these settings           establish cost by task and inventory item. Inventory ID Quantity Ext. Price Project Task Cost Account Group Revenue Account Group JUICER15 1.00 Cleared PHASE1 MATERIAL Cleared INSTALL 4.00 Cleared PHASE1 SUBCON Cleared TRAINING 8.00 Cleared PHASE2 LABOR Cleared Notice that the system automatically selects  PHASE1  as the project task             in a new estimation line because this task is selected as the default for the project             quote. You have cleared the  Ext. Price  and                Revenue Account Group  columns so that when this quote is             converted to a project, the system will not convert these lines, which have no price and             no revenue account group, to revenue budget lines of the project. Add two more estimation lines with the settings from the following table; these settings           establish revenue by task. Description Ext. Price Project Task Revenue Account Group The juicer with installation 2900.00 PHASE1 REVENUE Training of employees 400.00 PHASE2 REVENUE Notice that for each of the added lines the  Ext. Cost              and  Cost Account Group  columns are empty. When this quote is             converted to a project, the system will not convert these lines, which have no cost and             cost account group, to cost budget lines of the project. Save your changes to the project quote. In the Summary area, notice that the amount in             the  Total Sales  box is  3,300.00 , which is the total of the             values in the  Ext. Price  column on the                Estimation  tab. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) Opportunities form, again open the  000001  opportunity,           and notice the following: In the Summary area, the  Amount  of the opportunity has been               changed to the total sales of the created project quote ( 3,300.00 ). On the  Quotes  tab, where the project quote you created is               listed in the table, the total sales of the quote is shown in the                  Amount  column ( 3,300.00 ). Also, the check box in the                  Primary  column is selected, which means that this is the               primary project quote of the opportunity. Step 2: Sending the Project Quote for Confirmation To email and print the project quote, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes (PM304500) form, open the project quote that you           have just created. On the form toolbar, click  Submit Quote . The system changes the           status of the quote to  Prepared . Notice that now you cannot edit the project             quote. On the form toolbar, click  Actions Send Quote  to send the project quote to the customer. The system generates the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM604500|PM604500]) Project Quote (PM604500) report, which is a ready-to-print version of the             quote. It then attaches the quote to the email, and sends the email to the customer's             email address, which is specified on the  Billing Information  tab             of this form. The system also changes the status of the project quote to              Sent . Open the  Activities  tab, and notice that an activity related to           the sent email is listed in the table. The  Summary  column             contains the link to the email. If you clicked the link, the system would open the email             on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR306015|CR306015]) Email Activity (CR306015) form. On the form toolbar, click  Actions Print Quote  to print the project quote. The system navigates to the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM604500|PM604500]) Project Quote report, which is a ready-to-print version of the           quote. Step 3: Creating a Project Based on the Project Quote To create a project based on the project quote, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes (PM304500) form, open the project quote that you           have created, and in the Summary area, notice that the amount in the  Total             Sales  and  Total Cost  boxes are equal to              3,300.00  and  2,640.00 , respectively. On the form toolbar, click  Convert to Project  to convert the           quote to a project. In the  Convert to Project  dialog box, which opens, select the           following check boxes: Copy Notes to Project Copy Files to Project The                Link Activities to Project  check box in the dialog box is             cleared by default. If you were to select this check box, the system would automatically             select  PHASE1  as the project task to which the activities copied from the project             quote would be linked in the created project. This is because  PHASE1  is the             default task of the  PROGRESS  project template. Click  OK . The system closes the dialog box, changes the status             of the project quote to  Closed , creates a project based on the project quote, and             opens the project on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. On the             form title bar, notice that the icon left of  Notes  is shaded in             yellow, and  (1)  is shown after  Files , indicating that the             project has a note and an attached file, which have been copied from the project quote             (and were previously copied from the opportunity). On the  Summary  tab, in the  Quote  section,           make sure that the number of the corresponding project quote is shown in the              Quote Ref. Nbr.  box. On the  Tasks  tab, review the project tasks that have been copied           from the project quote. Notice that the check box in the  Default            column is selected for the  PHASE1  task, indicating that it is the default task of           the created project.  On the  Revenue Budget  tab, review the revenue budget lines of the           project, and notice that they have been created based on the estimation lines of the           project quote with the specified revenue account group. On the  Cost Budget  tab, review the cost budget lines of the           project, and notice that they have been created based on the estimation lines of the           project quote with the specified cost account group. On the  Balances  tab (see the following screenshot), verify the           totals: The  Income Totals  of the project balance should match the              Total Sales  of the project quote, and the  Expense             Totals  of the project balance should match the  Total             Cost  of the project quote. The balances of the project created based on the project quote On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) Opportunities (CR304000) form, open the  000001            opportunity, and review the opportunity as follows: On the  Activities  tab, notice that the email created for the               project quote is also listed in the table for the opportunity. On the  Quotes  tab, in the  Project ID                column, find the identifier of the project created based on the project quote. ]]></column>

{br}

The following sections describe the rules that the system uses during creation of a project based on the project quote, as well as some specific settings that the system inserts.{br}{TOC}
==Summary Information==
When the system creates a project based on the project quote, in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, some settings of the created project are populated as follows:[anchor|#ul_n35_h4k_y2b]
*'''Project ID''': If auto-numbering has been configured for projects, the project identifier is assigned automatically. If auto-numbering has not been configured, the system fills this box with the '''New Project ID''' value that was specified for the project quote on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) form. 
*'''Template''': This box is left empty. The reference number of the project template is not copied from the project quote to the project. This helps users to avoid confusion, because a project that is created based on a project quote with a project template specified can have a different structure of project tasks and the project budget than a project that is created directly on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form and based on the same project template.
*'''Status''': The status of the new project is ''Active'' if the '''Activate Project''' check box was selected in the '''Convert to Project''' dialog box that was used when the project task was converted to a project. If the check box was cleared, the status is ''In Planning''.

==Project Tasks==
When the system creates a project based on the project quote, it populates the tasks on the '''Tasks''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form using the following rules:[anchor|#ul_xgw_1vk_y2b]
*If the project quote has two or more tasks, these tasks are copied to the project. In this case, if the project quote does not have a default task, and the created project does not have the default task either.
*If the project quote has only one task, this task is copied to the project. It is also marked as the default task of the project even if the task has not been marked as the default task of the project quote.
*If the project quote has no tasks, the system creates a default project task for the project—that is, a task with an identifier of ''0'' and a description of ''Default''.
*The status of the created project tasks is ''Active'' if the '''Activate Tasks''' check box was selected in the '''Convert to Project''' dialog box during the conversion process. If the check box was cleared, the status is ''In Planning''.
*The location of the created tasks is the location of the project quote from the '''Billing Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) form.
*If the project quote has only one task or does not have any tasks and if some or all the estimation lines of the project quote have no project task assigned, the system assigns the default task of the project to the cost budget and revenue budget lines of the project that it creates based on these estimation lines.

==The Revenue Budget==
When the system creates a project based on the project quote, to populate the revenue budget, the system groups the estimation lines of the project quote depending on the revenue budget level (''Task'', ''Task and Item'', or ''Task and Cost Code'') of the project template specified for the project quote, as specified on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Project Properties''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_00|Project Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) form. For each group of estimation lines, on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, the system creates a revenue budget line with the following settings:[anchor|#ul_ckd_5qv_q2b]
*'''Project Task''': The system uses the project task of the aggregated estimation lines.
*'''Inventory ID''': The system uses the inventory ID of the aggregated estimation lines. Estimation lines without an inventory item specified are aggregated into a cost budget line with this column populated with the empty item code, which is defined in the '''Empty Item Code''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form.
*'''Account Group''': The system uses the revenue account group of the aggregated estimation lines.
*'''Description''': Depending on the number of aggregated estimation lines in a group, the system assigns the following description to the revenue budget line:
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of one line, the description of this line is copied to the cost budget line.
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines, the description of the cost budget line is {{Aggregated: [Account Group Description]}}, where {{Account Group Description}} is the description of the account group by which the group of estimation lines has been aggregated.
*'''Original Budgeted Quantity''': The system inserts the total quantity of the aggregated lines if each of the lines has the same UOM. Otherwise, the quantity is zero.
*'''UOM''': The system uses the UOM of the aggregated estimation lines if each of the lines has the same UOM. Otherwise, the UOM is empty.
*'''Unit Rate''': The calculation of the unit rate of the revenue budget line depends on the number of aggregated estimation lines in a group as follows:
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of one line, the unit price of this line is copied to the revenue budget line.
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and each of these lines has the same UOM, the system calculates the unit rate as the total '''Amount''' of the lines divided by the total quantity of the lines.
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and the lines have different UOM values, the unit rate of the revenue budget line is zero.
*'''Original Budgeted Amount''': The system inserts the total amount of the aggregated lines.
*'''Tax Category''': The tax category of the revenue budget line depends on the tax category of aggregated estimation lines in the group as follows:
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of one line, the tax category of this line is copied to the revenue budget line.
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and all the lines have the same tax category, this tax category is copied to the revenue budget line.
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and the lines have either the same tax category or an empty tax category, the specified tax category is copied to the revenue budget line.
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and the lines have at least two different tax categories, the tax category of the revenue budget line is empty.

==The Cost Budget==
When the system creates a project based on the project quote, to populate the cost budget, the system groups the estimation lines of the project quote depending on the cost budget level (''Task'', ''Task and Item'', or ''Task and Cost Code'') of the project template specified for the project quote, as specified on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Project Properties''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_00|Project Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) form. For each group of estimation lines, on the '''Cost Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, the system creates a cost budget line with the following settings:[anchor|#ul_cxz_hqv_q2b]
*'''Project Task''': The system inserts the project task of the aggregated estimation lines.
*'''Inventory ID''': The system uses the inventory ID of the aggregated estimation lines. Estimation lines without an inventory item specified are aggregated into a cost budget line with this column populated with the empty item code, which is defined in the '''Empty Item Code''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form.
*'''Account Group''': The system inserts the cost account group of the aggregated estimation lines.
*'''Description''': Depending on the number of aggregated estimation lines in a group, the system assigns the following description to the cost budget line:
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of one line, the description of this line is copied to the cost budget line.
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines, the description of the cost budget line is {{Aggregated: [Account Group Description]}}, where {{Account Group Description}} is the description of the account group by which the group of estimation lines has been aggregated.
*'''Original Budgeted Quantity''': The system inserts the total quantity of the aggregated lines if each of the lines has the same UOM. Otherwise, the quantity is zero.
*'''UOM''': The system uses the UOM of the aggregated estimation lines if each of the lines has the same UOM. Otherwise, the UOM is empty.
*'''Unit Rate''': The calculation of the unit rate of the cost budget line depends on the number of aggregated estimation lines in the group as follows:
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of one line, the unit rate of this line is copied to the cost budget line.
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines, the system calculates the unit rate as the sum of the '''Ext. Cost''' values of lines that have a nonzero quantity, divided by the total quantity of these lines. The lines of the group with a quantity or '''Ext. Cost''' of zero are ignored in the calculation.
*'''Original Budgeted Amount''': The system calculates this amount as the total extended cost of the aggregated lines.
*'''Unit Price''': The calculation of the unit price of the cost budget line depends on the number of aggregated estimation lines in the group as follows:
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of one line, the unit price of this line is copied to the cost budget line.
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and each of these lines has the same UOM, the system calculates the unit price as the sum of the '''Amount''' values of the lines divided by the total quantity of the lines.
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and the lines have different UOM values, the unit price of the cost budget line is zero.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Processing Project Quotes: Project Creation Rules When the system creates a project based on a project quote, the settings of the created         project on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form are populated as         follows:  The  Customer  and  Description  in the             Summary area: With the corresponding settings of the project quote from the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes (PM304500) form  The general information on the  Summary  tab: With the             corresponding settings of the project template on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) Project Templates             (PM208000) form The following sections describe the rules that the system uses during creation of a project         based on the project quote, as well as some specific settings that the system inserts. Summary Information When the system creates a project based on the project quote, in the Summary area of the             ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, some settings of the created         project are populated as follows: Project ID : If auto-numbering has been configured for projects,           the project identifier is assigned automatically. If auto-numbering has not been           configured, the system fills this box with the  New Project ID  value           that was specified for the project quote on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes (PM304500)           form.  Template : This box is left empty. The reference number of the           project template is not copied from the project quote to the project. This helps users to           avoid confusion, because a project that is created based on a project quote with a project           template specified can have a different structure of project tasks and the project budget           than a project that is created directly on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form and based on the same project template. Status : The status of the new project is  Active  if the              Activate Project  check box was selected in the  Convert             to Project  dialog box that was used when the project task was converted to a           project. If the check box was cleared, the status is  In Planning . Project Tasks When the system creates a project based on the project quote, it populates the tasks on the            Tasks  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects         (PM301000) form using the following rules: If the project quote has two or more tasks, these tasks are copied to the project. In           this case, if the project quote does not have a default task, and the created project does           not have the default task either. If the project quote has only one task, this task is copied to the project. It is also           marked as the default task of the project even if the task has not been marked as the           default task of the project quote. If the project quote has no tasks, the system creates a default project task for the           project—that is, a task with an identifier of  0  and a description of            Default . The status of the created project tasks is  Active  if the  Activate             Tasks  check box was selected in the  Convert to             Project  dialog box during the conversion process. If the check box was           cleared, the status is  In Planning . The location of the created tasks is the location of the project quote from the              Billing Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes           (PM304500) form. If the project quote has only one task or does not have any tasks and if some or all the           estimation lines of the project quote have no project task assigned, the system assigns           the default task of the project to the cost budget and revenue budget lines of the project           that it creates based on these estimation lines. The Revenue Budget When the system creates a project based on the project quote, to populate the revenue         budget, the system groups the estimation lines of the project quote depending on the revenue         budget level ( Task ,  Task and Item , or  Task and Cost Code ) of the         project template specified for the project quote, as specified on the            Summary  tab ( Project Properties  section) of         the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) Project Templates (PM208000) form. For each group of estimation lines, on         the  Revenue Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, the system creates a revenue         budget line with the following settings: Project Task : The system uses the project task of the aggregated           estimation lines. Inventory ID : The system uses the inventory ID of the aggregated           estimation lines. Estimation lines without an inventory item specified are aggregated into           a cost budget line with this column populated with the empty item code, which is defined           in the  Empty Item Code  box on the  General             Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000)           form. Account Group : The system uses the revenue account group of the           aggregated estimation lines. Description : Depending on the number of aggregated estimation           lines in a group, the system assigns the following description to the revenue budget             line: If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of one line, the description of               this line is copied to the cost budget line. If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines, the               description of the cost budget line is  Aggregated: [Account Group                 Description] , where  Account Group Description  is the               description of the account group by which the group of estimation lines has been               aggregated. Original Budgeted Quantity : The system inserts the total quantity           of the aggregated lines if each of the lines has the same UOM. Otherwise, the quantity is           zero. UOM : The system uses the UOM of the aggregated estimation lines           if each of the lines has the same UOM. Otherwise, the UOM is empty. Unit Rate : The calculation of the unit rate of the revenue budget           line depends on the number of aggregated estimation lines in a group as follows: If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of one line, the unit price of               this line is copied to the revenue budget line. If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and each               of these lines has the same UOM, the system calculates the unit rate as the total                  Amount  of the lines divided by the total quantity of the               lines. If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and the               lines have different UOM values, the unit rate of the revenue budget line is               zero. Original Budgeted Amount : The system inserts the total amount of           the aggregated lines. Tax Category : The tax category of the revenue budget line depends           on the tax category of aggregated estimation lines in the group as follows: If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of one line, the tax category               of this line is copied to the revenue budget line. If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and all               the lines have the same tax category, this tax category is copied to the revenue               budget line. If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and the               lines have either the same tax category or an empty tax category, the specified tax               category is copied to the revenue budget line. If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and the               lines have at least two different tax categories, the tax category of the revenue               budget line is empty. The Cost Budget When the system creates a project based on the project quote, to populate the cost budget,         the system groups the estimation lines of the project quote depending on the cost budget         level ( Task ,  Task and Item , or  Task and Cost Code ) of the project         template specified for the project quote, as specified on the  Summary          tab ( Project Properties  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) Project Templates (PM208000) form. For each group of estimation lines, on the  Cost           Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000)         form, the system creates a cost budget line with the following settings: Project Task : The system inserts the project task of the           aggregated estimation lines. Inventory ID : The system uses the inventory ID of the aggregated           estimation lines. Estimation lines without an inventory item specified are aggregated into           a cost budget line with this column populated with the empty item code, which is defined           in the  Empty Item Code  box on the  General             Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000)           form. Account Group : The system inserts the cost account group of the           aggregated estimation lines. Description : Depending on the number of aggregated estimation           lines in a group, the system assigns the following description to the cost budget line: If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of one line, the description of               this line is copied to the cost budget line. If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines, the               description of the cost budget line is  Aggregated: [Account Group                 Description] , where  Account Group Description  is the               description of the account group by which the group of estimation lines has been               aggregated. Original Budgeted Quantity : The system inserts the total quantity           of the aggregated lines if each of the lines has the same UOM. Otherwise, the quantity is           zero. UOM : The system uses the UOM of the aggregated estimation lines           if each of the lines has the same UOM. Otherwise, the UOM is empty. Unit Rate : The calculation of the unit rate of the cost budget           line depends on the number of aggregated estimation lines in the group as follows: If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of one line, the unit rate of               this line is copied to the cost budget line. If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines, the               system calculates the unit rate as the sum of the  Ext. Cost                values of lines that have a nonzero quantity, divided by the total quantity of these               lines. The lines of the group with a quantity or  Ext. Cost  of               zero are ignored in the calculation. Original Budgeted Amount : The system calculates this amount as           the total extended cost of the aggregated lines. Unit Price : The calculation of the unit price of the cost budget           line depends on the number of aggregated estimation lines in the group as follows: If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of one line, the unit price of               this line is copied to the cost budget line. If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and each               of these lines has the same UOM, the system calculates the unit price as the sum of               the  Amount  values of the lines divided by the total quantity of               the lines. If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and the               lines have different UOM values, the unit price of the cost budget line is zero. Other Project Settings The project settings on the following tabs of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form are copied from the listed         sources: Activity History : The project quote if the  Link             Activities to Project  check box was selected in the  Convert to             Project  dialog box during conversion Equipment ,  Settings , and              Mailing Settings : The project template specified for the project           quote Attributes : The project quote ]]></column>

In Acumatica ERP, you can purchase materials and services on projects using purchase orders and accounts payable bills so that these purchases affect the cost budget of the projects.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
You will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_nwj_gch_tbb]
*Purchase materials and services for a project using a purchase order
*Receive materials purchased for a project to a warehouse
*Purchase services for a project using an accounts payable bill

==Applicable Scenarios==
You create a purchase order for a project if you want to purchase materials and services so that the purchase affect the cost budget of the project. You create an accounts payable bill for the same reasons if your purchase includes only services that do not require receiving to a warehouse.
==Configuring of Inventory for Processing Purchases on Projects==
To be able to purchase the following inventory items for projects, the corresponding accounts of the items must be mapped to an account group:[anchor|#_43fba96b-a55f-4a55-bae0-903fe80d497f]
*Stock items: The inventory account of the corresponding posting class specified in the '''Inventory/Accrual Account''' box on the '''GL Accounts''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) form
*Non-stock items that do not require receipt—that is, the '''Require Receipt''' check box is cleared on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''Item Defaults''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form: The expense account of the item specified in the '''Expense Account''' box on the '''GL Accounts''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form
*Non-stock items that require receipt—that is, the '''Require Receipt''' check box is selected on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''Item Defaults''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form: The expense account of the corresponding posting class specified in the '''COGS/Expense Account''' box on the '''GL Accounts''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] form

To be able to receive purchased stock items and non-stock items that require receipt to a warehouse, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form, you need to create a separate location for each project task for which you are going to receive purchased inventory items to a warehouse.
==Processing of Purchase Orders for Projects==
You can purchase materials and services for projects using purchase orders of the ''Normal'' type. On the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, to associate a purchase order line with a project, you specify the project and a project task.((({S:Hint}
If you do not want to associate a purchase order line with any project, you select the non-project code (''X'').{br}

You can process purchases for several projects with a single purchase order.
)))
If you select a sock item in a purchase order line, the line is assigned the ''Goods for IN'' type. When you select in a purchase order line a non-stock item that requires receipt—that is, the '''Require Receipt''' check box is selected for the non-stock item on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''Item Defaults''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form—the line is assigned the ''Non-Stock'' type. When you select in a purchase order line a non-stock item that does not require receipt, the line is assigned the ''Service'' type.((({S:Hint}If you purchase some material from a vendor directly to a customer and do not need to receive the material to your warehouse, you can create non-stock items that do not require receipt to represent these materials in the system. When you purchase such materials with a purchase order, you do not need to create a purchase receipt for them.
)))
You create a purchase receipt for the purchase order lines of the ''Goods for IN'' and ''Non-Stock'' types to receive the inventory items to the warehouse. On the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, you click '''Actions''' > '''Enter PO Receipt''' to create a purchase receipt. When you release the created purchase receipt on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form and the corresponding inventory receipt is released on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) form, the system updates the corresponding budget lines of the project with the same project task, account group (by the inventory or expense account), and inventory item on the '''Cost Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. The system updates the '''Actual Quantity''' and '''Actual Amount''' of these cost budget lines with the received quantity and amount.{br}

When you create an accounts payable bill for the purchase order lines of the ''Service'' type and release the bill on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form, the system updates the budget lines of the project with the same project task, account group (by the expense account), and inventory item on the '''Cost Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. The system updates the '''Actual Quantity''' and '''Actual Amount''' of these cost budget lines with the billed quantity and amount.{br}

==Workflow of Purchasing on Projects with Purchase Orders==
The following diagram illustrates the workflow of purchasing on projects using purchase orders.[anchor|#fig_fhq_2nv_q2b][anchor|#image_ghq_2nv_q2b][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_Projects_Purchases_PO.png|popup|400px]
==Processing of Account Payable Bills for Projects==
You can purchase services for projects using accounts payable bills. A service is a non-stock item that does not require receipt—that is, the '''Require Receipt''' check box is cleared for the non-stock item on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''Item Defaults''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form.{br}

On the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form, to associate a bill line with a non-stock item with a project, you specify the project and a project task.((({S:Hint}
If you do not want to associate a bill line with any project, you select the non-project code (''X'').{br}

You can purchase services for several projects with a single AP bill.
)))
When you release the account payable bill with lines related to a project, the system updates the budget lines of the project with the same project task, account group (by the expense account), and inventory item on the '''Cost Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. The system updates the '''Actual Quantity''' and '''Actual Amount''' of these cost budget lines with the billed quantity and amount.{br}

Configuring of Inventory for Processing Purchases on Projects To be able to purchase the following inventory items for projects, the corresponding         accounts of the items must be mapped to an account group: Stock items: The inventory account of the corresponding posting class specified in the              Inventory/Accrual Account  box on the  GL             Accounts  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) Posting Classes (IN206000) form Non-stock items that do not require receipt—that is, the  Require             Receipt  check box is cleared on the  General Settings            tab ( Item Defaults  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items           (IN202000) form: The expense account of the item specified in the  Expense             Account  box on the  GL Accounts  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items form Non-stock items that require receipt—that is, the  Require Receipt            check box is selected on the  General Settings  tab ( Item             Defaults  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items form: The expense           account of the corresponding posting class specified in the  COGS/Expense             Account  box on the  GL Accounts  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) Posting Classes form To be able to receive purchased stock items and non-stock items that require receipt to a         warehouse, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses (IN204000) form, you need to create a         separate location for each project task for which you are going to receive purchased         inventory items to a warehouse. Processing of Purchase Orders for Projects You can purchase materials and services for projects using purchase orders of the            Normal  type. On the  Document Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form, to associate a purchase order line with a         project, you specify the project and a project task. If you do not want to associate a purchase order line with any project, you select the           non-project code ( X ). You can process purchases for several projects with a single purchase order. If you select a sock item in a purchase order line, the line is assigned the  Goods for           IN  type. When you select in a purchase order line a non-stock item that requires         receipt—that is, the  Require Receipt  check box is selected for the         non-stock item on the  General Settings  tab ( Item           Defaults  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form—the         line is assigned the  Non-Stock  type. When you select in a purchase order line a         non-stock item that does not require receipt, the line is assigned the  Service          type. If you purchase some material from a vendor directly to a customer and do not         need to receive the material to your warehouse, you can create non-stock items that do not         require receipt to represent these materials in the system. When you purchase such materials         with a purchase order, you do not need to create a purchase receipt for them. You create a purchase receipt for the purchase order lines of the  Goods for IN  and            Non-Stock  types to receive the inventory items to the warehouse. On the form         toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form, you click  Actions Enter PO Receipt  to create a purchase receipt. When you release the created purchase receipt         on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form and the corresponding inventory         receipt is released on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) Receipts (IN301000) form, the system         updates the corresponding budget lines of the project with the same project task, account         group (by the inventory or expense account), and inventory item on the  Cost           Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. The system         updates the  Actual Quantity  and  Actual Amount          of these cost budget lines with the received quantity and amount. When you create an accounts payable bill for the purchase order lines of the  Service          type and release the bill on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form, the system         updates the budget lines of the project with the same project task, account group (by the         expense account), and inventory item on the  Cost Budget  tab of the             ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. The system updates the  Actual           Quantity  and  Actual Amount  of these cost budget lines         with the billed quantity and amount. For more information on processing purchase order, see  Standard Inventory Purchases: General Information. Workflow of Purchasing on Projects with Purchase Orders The following diagram illustrates the workflow of purchasing on projects using purchase         orders. Processing of Account Payable Bills for Projects You can purchase services for projects using accounts payable bills. A service is a         non-stock item that does not require receipt—that is, the  Require           Receipt  check box is cleared for the non-stock item on the  General           Settings  tab ( Item Defaults  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form. On the  Document Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments         (AP301000) form, to associate a bill line with a non-stock item with a project, you specify         the project and a project task. If you do not want to associate a bill line with any project, you select the non-project           code ( X ). You can purchase services for several projects with a single AP bill. When you release the account payable bill with lines related to a project, the system         updates the budget lines of the project with the same project task, account group (by the         expense account), and inventory item on the  Cost Budget  tab of the             ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. The system updates the  Actual           Quantity  and  Actual Amount  of these cost budget lines         with the billed quantity and amount.

==Other Settings That Affect the Workflow==
You can affect the workflow of processing purchases on projects by specifying additional settings as follows:[anchor|#_50a95b7f-f671-4287-bf30-2454483b4280]
*To cause the system to automatically select a project task when a particular project is selected during the creation of a purchase order, select the '''Default''' check box on the '''Tasks''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form for one of the tasks of the project.
*To avoid obligatory printing of created purchase orders, clear the '''Print Orders''' check box on the '''Purchase Settings''' tab ('''Default Location Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form for all applicable vendors. (A user can still print any purchase order of the vendor, if needed.)
*To avoid obligatory emailing of created purchase orders, clear the '''Send Orders by Email''' check box on the '''Purchase Settings''' tab ('''Default Location Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] form for all applicable vendors. (A user can still email any purchase order of the vendor, if needed.)
*To cause the system to not copy non-stock lines of the ''Service'' type in purchase orders of the ''Normal'' type to purchase receipts and bill such lines directly from purchase orders, clear the '''Process Service Lines from Normal Purchase Orders via Purchase Receipt''' check box on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''Other''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form.
*To cause the system to create purchase receipts with the ''Balanced'' status, clear the '''Hold Receipts on Entry''' check box on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''Other''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] form.
*To cause the system to automatically release inventory receipts created on release of purchase receipts, select the '''Release IN Documents Automatically''' check box on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''Other''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] form.
*To cause an accounts payable bill to be created automatically on release of a purchase receipt by default, select the '''Create Bill on Receipt Release''' check box on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''Other''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] form. In this case, when a user creates a purchase receipt on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, the system automatically selects the '''Create Bill''' check box. (The user can clear this check box for a particular bill.)
*To cause the system to automatically release accounts payable bills generated on release of purchase receipts, select the '''Release AP Documents Automatically''' check box on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''Other''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] form.
*To cause the system to create accounts payable bills with the ''Balanced'' status, clear the '''Hold Documents on Entry''' check box on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''Data Entry Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_10_10_00|Accounts Payable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AP101000|AP101000]) form.
*To cause the system to automatically post general ledger batches generated during processing purchase and account payable documents, select the '''Automatically Post on Release''' check box in the '''Posting Settings''' section on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_10_20_00|General Ledger Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=GL102000|GL102000]) form.

With these settings specified, users in your company can process purchases on projects quickly and accurately with a minimum of manual actions.
==Validation of Configuration==
To make sure that all configuration has been performed correctly, we recommend that you perform instructions similar to those described in [HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Project_Purchases_Process_Activity_PO|Processing Purchases on Projects: To Purchase Materials and Services for a Project] and [HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Project_Purchases_Process_Activity_AP_Bill|Processing Purchases on Projects: To Purchase Services for a Project].]]></column>

==Story==
Suppose that the HM&rsquo;s Bakery and Cafe customer has ordered two juicers, along with the four hours of the installation service from the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company. The SweetLife company contracted the Squeezo Inc. vendor to provide the juicers and perform the installation. SweetLife&rsquo;s project manager has created the project. Acting as SweetLife&rsquo;s project accountant, you need to purchase the materials and services from the vendor. When the vendor delivers the juicers to company&rsquo;s warehouse, you will process a purchase receipt for the juicers. When the vendor provides the installation service, you will process an account payable bill from the vendor for the delivered juicers and provided service.

==Story==
Suppose that the HM&rsquo;s Bakery and Cafe customer has ordered the installation service for previously bought juicers from the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company. The SweetLife company has contracted the Squeezo Inc. vendor to provide six hours of the installation. SweetLife&rsquo;s project manager has created the project. Acting as SweetLife&rsquo;s project accountant, you need to purchase the service from the vendor. Because SweetLife uses Acumatica ERP without the ''Inventory and Order Management'' feature, you will process the purchase with an accounts payable bill instead of purchase orders.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Project Accounting'' feature has been enabled to support the project accounting functionality.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, the ''HMBAKERY14'' project has been created and the ''INSTALL'' project task has been created for the project. This task is the default project task.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, the ''INSTALL'' non-stock item of the ''Service'' type has been configured. On the '''General Settings''' tab ('''Item Defaults''' section), the '''Require Receipt''' check box has been cleared. On the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab ('''Standard Cost''' section), the '''Current Cost''' of the item has been set to ''80.00''. On the '''GL Accounts''' tab, the ''54200 - Project Subcontract Expense'' account has been selected in the '''Expense Account''' box.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_10_00|Account Groups] ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) form, the ''SUBCON'' account group has been created and the ''54200 - Project Subcontract Expense'' account has been mapped to the account group.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form, the ''SQUEEZO'' vendor has been created.
==Process Overview==
In this activity, you will create a bill on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form, specifying the project and project task in the bill; you will then release the bill.

When the commitments are created, the system uses them to populate the cost budget for the corresponding project, project task, inventory item, and account group.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_e23_hhs_3cb]
*Create commitments by processing a purchase order
*Review the created commitments and the way they affect the project
*Bill the purchase order and review how the commitments have been affected
*Review the committed and actual values of the project budget

==Applicable Scenarios==
If you want to distinguish purchases within the cost budget of a project, you use commitments, which you create by processing purchase orders with detail lines related to the project. The commitments update the cost budget of a project with purchased services and materials.[anchor|#section_akq_jg5_v1b]
==Tracking of Committed Costs for Projects==
If the '''Internal Cost Commitment Tracking''' check box is selected on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''General Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form, the system exposes commitments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_60_00|Commitments] ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) form, as well as the following committed values of the project budget on the '''Cost Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form:[anchor|#_38277968-084b-4271-bb38-4760c9294329]
*'''Original Committed Quantity'''
* '''Original Committed Amount'''
* '''Revised Committed Quantity'''
* '''Revised Committed Amount'''
* '''Committed Open Quantity'''
* '''Committed Open Amount'''
* '''Committed Received Quantity'''
* '''Committed Invoiced Quantity'''
* '''Committed Invoiced Amount'''

The system creates a commitment for a purchase order line in the amount of the '''Ext. Cost''' of the line and updates the committed values of the corresponding budget line of a project on the '''Cost Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form if all of the following conditions are met on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form:[anchor|#_4e52f428-9748-49b9-8707-fca238501c14]
*The type of the purchase order is ''Normal'' or ''Drop-Ship''.
*The status of the purchase order is ''Pending Printing'', ''Pending Email'', or ''Open''.
*The purchase order line specifies the project (and the applicable project task).

These commitments have the ''Internal'' type because they originate from documents created in the system, unlike commitments of the ''External'' type that can be imported into Acumatica ERP.{br}

On the '''Cost Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, for each budget line, the system displays the total values of all the commitments that are associated with the same project, project task, account group, and inventory item.{br}

The initial commitment amount is displayed in the '''Original Committed Amount''' column and the '''Revised Committed Amount''' column. The '''Committed Open Amount''' of a new commitment is equal to the '''Revised Committed Amount'''.{br}

When you release an accounts payable bill with the purchase order lines of the ''Service'' type, the '''Committed Invoiced Quantity''' and '''Committed Invoiced Amount''' of the corresponding commitments are updated with the '''Quantity''' and '''Ext. Cost''' values of the bill lines, respectively. The '''Committed Invoiced Quantity''' and '''Committed Invoiced Amount''' are subtracted from the '''Committed Open Quantity''' and '''Committed Open Amount''' and added to the '''Actual Quantity''' and '''Actual Amount''', respectively.{br}

When an inventory receipt that corresponds to the purchase receipt with the purchase order lines of the ''Goods for IN'' or ''Non-Stock'' type is released, the '''Committed Received Quantity''' of the corresponding commitments is updated with the received quantity. The received quantity and the amount of the '''Ext. Cost''' of the related purchase order lines that correspond to the received quantity are subtracted from the '''Committed Open Quantity''' and '''Committed Open Amount''' and added to the '''Actual Quantity''' and '''Actual Amount''', respectively. When the purchase order lines of the ''Goods for IN'' or ''Non-Stock'' type are billed, the '''Committed Invoiced Quantity''' and '''Committed Invoiced Amount''' of the corresponding commitments are updated with the '''Quantity''' and '''Ext. Cost''' values of the bill lines, respectively.{br}

After a purchase order is received and billed fully, the '''Committed Open Quantity''' and '''Committed Open Amount''' of the corresponding commitment lines becomes zero. If a purchase order has been canceled, the incomplete amounts are subtracted from the '''Committed Open Amount'''. For more information about processing purchase orders for projects, see [HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Project_Purchases_GeneralInfo|Processing Purchases on Projects: General Information].[anchor|#section_i3l_d4p_mcb]
==Workflow of Commitments==
The following diagram illustrates the workflow of processing a commitment and the ways the commitment affects the project budget.[anchor|#fig_fhq_2nv_q2b][anchor|#image_ghq_2nv_q2b][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_Projects_Commitments_Workflow.png|popup|450px]
==Updating of Documents from Which Commitments Originate==
You can update a purchase order from which a commitments originates. When you update the '''Ext. Cost''' of the purchase order line that refers to the project on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form and save the purchase order with the ''Pending Printing'', ''Pending Email'', or ''Open'' status, the system updates the '''Original Committed Amount''' and the '''Revised Committed Amount''' of the corresponding commitment.
==Recreating of Commitments==
Although you usually do not need to recreate commitments, in rare cases, the committed values of the project budget may not match the underlying commitments. In such a case, you need to recreate commitments for a project. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_50_40_00|Validate Project Balances] ([~/?ScreenId=PM504000|PM504000]) form, you select the '''Rebuild Commitments''' check box in the Summary area, select the check box in the unlabeled column in the table for the project, and click '''Validate''' on the form toolbar.

==Other Settings That Affect the Workflow==
You can affect the workflow of processing commitments by specifying additional settings as follows:[anchor|#_50a95b7f-f671-4287-bf30-2454483b4280]
*To cause the system to automatically select a project task when a particular project is selected during the creation of a purchase order, select the '''Default''' check box on the '''Tasks''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form for one of the tasks of the project.
*To avoid obligatory printing of created purchase orders, clear the '''Print Orders''' check box on the '''Purchase Settings''' tab ('''Default Location Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form for all applicable vendors. (A user can still print any purchase order of the vendor, if needed.)
*To avoid obligatory emailing of created purchase orders, clear the '''Send Orders by Email''' check box on the '''Purchase Settings''' tab ('''Default Location Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] form for all applicable vendors. (A user can still email any purchase order of the vendor, if needed.)
*To cause the system to automatically release inventory receipts created on release of purchase receipts, select the '''Release IN Documents Automatically''' check box on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''Other''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] PO101000 form.
*To cause the system to create purchase receipts with the ''Balanced'' status, clear the '''Hold Receipts On Entry''' check box on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''Other''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] form.
*To cause the system to not copy non-stock lines of the ''Service'' type in purchase orders of the ''Normal'' type to purchase receipts and bill such lines directly from purchase orders, clear the '''Process Service Lines from Normal Purchase Orders via Purchase Receipt''' check box on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''Other''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] form.
*To cause the system to not copy non-stock lines of the ''Service'' type in purchase orders of the ''Drop-Ship'' type to purchase receipts and bill such lines directly from purchase orders, clear the '''Process Service Lines from Drop-Ship Purchase Orders via Purchase Receipt''' check box on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''Other''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] form.

With these settings specified, users in your company can process commitments quickly and accurately with a minimum of manual actions.
==Validation of Configuration==
To make sure that all configuration has been performed correctly, we recommend that you perform instructions similar to those described in [HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Commitments_Process_Activity|Processing Commitments: Process Activity].]]></column>

==Story==
Suppose that the HM&rsquo;s Bakery and Cafe customer has ordered the installation of three juicers it previously purchased from the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company. Acting as SweetLife&rsquo;s project accountant, you have created a project related to the planned installation work. The installation, which is performed by the vendor of the juicers, has been provided for each juicer. Based on the agreement with the vendor, your company will be billed in two parts—that is, first for the installation of the first two juicers and then for the installation of the third juicer. Acting as the project accountant, you need to capture the installation cost on the project.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, the following features have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form:[anchor|#_85ada628-bc34-4eed-817e-0247a845166b]
*''Project Accounting'', which provides support for the project accounting functionality
*''Inventory and Order Management'', which provides the purchase order functionality

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, the ''HMBAKERY8'' project has been created and the ''INSTALL'' project task has been created for the project. This task is the default project task.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, the ''INSTALL'' non-stock item has been configured. On the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab ('''Standard Cost''' section), the '''Current Cost''' of the item has been set to ''80.00''. On the '''GL Accounts''' tab, the ''54200 - Project Subcontract Expense'' account has been specified as the '''Expense Account'''.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_10_00|Account Groups] ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) form, the ''SUBCON'' account group has been created. The ''54200 - Project Subcontract Expense'' account has been mapped to the account group.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form, the ''SQUEEZO'' vendor has been created.
==Process Overview==
In this activity, you will create a purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form with lines related to the project. You will then create a partial bill for the purchase order and release the bill on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form. {br}

Finally, you will review how the processed commitments affect the project budget on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form.
==System Preparation==
To sign in to the system and prepare to perform the instructions of the activity, do the following:[anchor|#_5e4e87f1-6fe1-4688-b21b-a3ae5c8f4117]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website and sign in as Pam Brawner using the ''brawner'' username and ''123'' password.[anchor|#_8e5b3975-b500-4963-ab67-2c51c0ac5c2f]
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select ''1/30/2020'' on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.
#On the '''General Settings''' tab ('''General Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form, select the '''Internal Cost Commitment Tracking''' check box to expose commitments and committed values in the project budget, and save your changes to the project accounting preferences.

==Step 1: Creating Commitments for the Project==
To process a purchase order for the project that updates the project budget with committed values, do the following:[anchor|#_a7fc6e3b-d40e-45c3-8b1a-031a0a172a9b]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''HMBAKERY8'' project, and on the '''Cost Budget''' tab, review the cost budget of the project. Notice the committed and actual values of the cost budget line, which are both zero.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, create a purchase order, and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Vendor''': ''SQUEEZO''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Purchase for HM&rsquo;s Bakery & Cafe</tt>
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, add three purchase order lines, and specify the settings shown in the following table in the lines you add.
#:{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="20%" ! '''Inventory ID'''
!width="40%" !  '''Line Description'''
!width="20%" !  '''Order Qty.'''
!width="20%" !  '''Project'''
|- 
|  ''INSTALL''
| <tt>Installation of the first juicer</tt>
| <tt>3.00</tt>
| ''HMBAKERY8''
|- 
|  ''INSTALL''
| <tt>Installation of the second juicer</tt>
| <tt>4.00</tt>
| ''HMBAKERY8''
|- 
|  ''INSTALL''
| <tt>Installation of the third juicer</tt>
| <tt>5.00</tt>
| ''HMBAKERY8''
|}
#:The system automatically selects the ''INSTALL'' project task when you select the project of the line because this task is the default task of the ''HMBAKERY8'' project.
#Review the '''Ext. Cost''' of each added line, which will be the cost committed to the project.
#:In the Summary area, notice that the '''Order Total''' values, which is the sum of the '''Ext. Cost''' of three lines (''240.00'', ''320.00'', and ''400.00''), is ''960.00''.
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box.
#Save the purchase order, which now has the ''Open'' status.
#:When the ''Open'' status is assigned to the purchase order, the system creates the commitments for the project.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, open the ''HMBAKERY8'' project, and on the '''Cost Budget''' tab, review the updated cost budget, which consists of a single line.
#: Notice that the committed quantities and amounts of the cost budget line have been updated and the '''Original Committed Amount''', '''Revised Committed Amount''', and '''Committed Open Amount''' columns contain the purchase order total (''960.00'').
#To review the commitments that correspond to the cost budget line, do the following:
##In the table, click the cost budget line.
##On the table toolbar, click '''View Commitment Details'''.
##Review the commitments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_60_00|Commitments] ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) form, which the system opens in a pop-up window. Notice that the system has created a commitment for each purchase order line and that all the commitments correspond to one cost budget line.
##Close the pop-up window with the form.
#On the '''Commitments''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form (to which you return), which contains a list of all purchase orders related to the project, click the link in the '''Order Nbr.''' column to open the purchase order that you have created earlier in this activity.
#On the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form, which the system opens, click '''Actions''' > '''Enter AP Bill''' to create a bill for the purchase order.
#:The system creates an accounts payable bill and opens the bill on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form.
#On the '''Document Details''' tab of this form, delete the line with a '''Quantity''' of ''5.00'' to bill the purchase order partially, as your company agreed on with the vendor.
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and on the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the bill.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, open the ''HMBAKERY8'' project, and review the updated cost budget on the '''Cost Budget''' tab.
#:Notice that the billed quantity and amount (''7.00'' and ''560.00'', respectively) of the purchase order have been subtracted from the committed open quantity and amount, which is now equal to ''5.00'' and ''400.00'', respectively. The billed quantity and amount have been added to the committed invoiced quantity and amount, to the actual quantity and amount, and to the received committed quantity, as shown in the following screenshot.

If you need to track changes to the project revenue budget, commitments, and budgeted costs and control the profitability of every change initiated by a customer, you can use the functionality of change orders.
==In This Chapter==
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_CO_GeneralInfo|Managing Changes in Projects: General Information]
*:Acumatica ERP provides change order functionality, which you can use to track changes to project's budgeted and committed values and to control the profitability of every change initiated by a customer. A change order is a document for profitability analysis and an audit of changes to the project revenue budget, commitments, and budgeted costs. Change orders do not alter the original figures of a project directly; they are tracked separately.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_CO_Implem_Checklist|Managing Changes in Projects: Implementation Checklist]
*:The following sections provide details you can use to ensure that the system is configured properly for the processing of change orders, and to understand (and change, if needed) the settings that affect the processing workflow.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_CO_to_Budget_Process_Activity|Managing Changes in Projects: To Track Changes in the Budget]
*:In this activity, you will learn how you can turn on the change order workflow for a project and manage changes to the project’s budgeted values by creating change orders.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_CO_Commitments|Managing Changes in Projects: Tracking Changes in Commitments]
*:By using the change order functionality in Acumatica ERP, you can manage changes to a project's committed values if the commitment functionality is configured for project accounting. For more information on commitments, see [HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Commitments_GeneralInfo|Processing Commitments: General Information].
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_CO_PO_Workflow|Managing Changes in Projects: Purchase Order Workflow]
*:If the change order workflow is not turned on for a project, you need to update a purchase order related to the project directly on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. If the change order workflow is turned on for the project, the standard workflow of a purchase order related to the project is affected as follows:
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_CO_Classes_Implem_Activity|Managing Changes in Projects: Implementation Activity]
*:The following activity will walk you through the process of configuring a change order class.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_CO_to_Commitments_Process_Activity|Managing Changes in Projects: To Track Changes in Commitments]
*:In this activity, you will learn how you can track changes to project commitments with change orders. Before you start completing the activity, perform the instructions of [HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_CO_Classes_Implem_Activity|Managing Changes in Projects: Implementation Activity] to create the change order class that is used in this activity.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_CO_Lock_Commitments|Managing Changes in Projects: Locking Commitments]
*:If internal cost commitment tracking is configured in the system and the change order workflow is configured for a particular project, after the purchases on the project have been agreed on with vendors and entered into the system, you can lock the commitments for the project. After that, users can track all amendments to the committed values as project changes by using change orders.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_CO_Lock_Commitments_Process_Activity|Managing Changes in Projects: To Prevent Direct Changes to Commitments]
*:If you want to manage changes to a project's committed values, you can prevent the creation of purchase orders for the project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form and create new commitments by using change orders.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_CO_RevenueChangeNbr|Managing Changes in Projects: Revenue Change Number]
*:Each project has its own numbering sequence for the change orders that can affect the revenue of the project. By default, the '''Revenue Change Nbr.''' of a change order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) form is an integer that the system assigns sequentially: 0001 for the first change order for the project, 0002 for the second, 0003 for the third, and so on. The last assigned number for the project is shown in the '''Last Revenue Change Nbr.''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Project Properties''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]).

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
 Acumatica ERP provides change order functionality, which you can use to track changes to project&rsquo;s budgeted and committed values and to control the profitability of every change initiated by a customer. A change order is a document for profitability analysis and an audit of changes to the project revenue budget, commitments, and budgeted costs. Change orders do not alter the original figures of a project directly; they are tracked separately.
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Configure a change order class
*Turn on the change order workflow for a project
*Create a change order to update the budgeted values of the project
*Create a change order to update the committed values of the project
*Add a new line to an existing purchase order with a change order
*Create a new purchase order by means of change orders
*Prepare a printable version of the change order

==Applicable Scenarios==
You turn on the change order workflow for a project to be able to track changes to the budgeted and committed values of the project. To make the changes to the project budget, you create change orders that do not alter the original budgeted values of the project.[anchor|#section_qkr_hkx_mcb]
==Change Order Classes==
A change order class defines which project data—the revenue budget, the cost budget, or commitments—can be adjusted with a change order of this class. You must specify a change order class for each change order you create, so you first need to configure change order classes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_30_00|Change Order Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM203000|PM203000]) form.{br}

To allow users to make changes to the project budget by using a change order of a particular class, on the '''Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_30_00|Change Order Classes] form, you select any combination of the following check boxes for the change order class:[anchor|#_f0bbaf83-21d6-4e5a-a787-499e208fe85f]
*'''Revenue Budget''': To allow changes to the revenue budget
*'''Cost Budget''': To allow changes to the cost budget
*'''Commitments''': To allow changes to committed values

You can grant access rights to particular change order classes for particular users. For example, you can configure access rights so that an employee responsible for purchases can use a change order class with only the '''Commitments''' check box selected on the '''Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_30_00|Change Order Classes] form. This class of change orders will have only the '''Commitments''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) form, and the employee will not be able to adjust the revenue or cost budget of a project by using change orders.{br}

Change order classes also make it possible to group change orders by their impact on projects. For example, you can segregate changes by class in reports to analyze which types of changes have the greatest impact on project profitability.{br}

You can specify a default change order class in the '''Default Change Order Class''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''General Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form. The default change order class is then automatically assigned to each newly created document on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] form.[anchor|#section_pbd_zbq_mcb]
==Change Order Workflow==
To make it possible for users to track changes for a project by using change orders, you select the '''Change Order Workflow''' check box on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form for the project. You need to select this check box for each project for which you want to turn on the change order workflow.{br}

Once you have selected this check box for a project, you can create a change order for the project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form by clicking '''Create Change Order''' on the form toolbar or clicking '''Create Change Order''' on the table toolbar of the '''Change Orders''' tab. The system creates a change order of the default class with the ''On Hold'' status and the project selected and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) form. If no default change order class is specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form, you must select the change order class manually. You can override the default change order class, if needed.((({S:Warn}In addition to creating a change order from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form for the selected project, you can create a new change order directly on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] form and select the needed project.
)))
In a change order with the ''On Hold'' status, on the '''Revenue Budget''' and '''Cost Budget''' tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] form, you can increase and decrease values in existing project budget lines as well as create new budget lines. When you edit a change order line, you can see the following values: the original budgeted amount in the '''Original Budgeted Amount''' column; the released and draft change order amounts in the '''Previously Approved CO Amount''' and '''Other Draft CO Amount''' columns, respectively; and the revised budgeted amount in the '''Revised Budgeted Amount''' column.{br}

While a change order has the ''On Hold'' status, the '''Quantity''' and '''Amount''' values of a revenue budget line or cost budget line of the change order increase the '''Potential CO Quantity''' and '''Potential CO Amount''' of the corresponding revenue budget line or cost budget line of the project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form.{br}

When a change order is released, the '''Potential CO Quantity''' and '''Potential CO Amount''' of the corresponding budget lines are decreased and the '''Budgeted CO Quantity''' and '''Budgeted CO Amount''' are increased on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form.{br}

A change order with any status can be printed and emailed to the customer. To print the change order, on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] form, you click '''Reports''' > '''Print Change Order'''. To email the change order, on the form toolbar of the same form you click '''Actions''' > '''Email Change Order'''.[anchor|#section_i2l_d4p_mcb]
==Workflow of Managing Changes to the Project Budget==
The following diagram illustrates the workflow of managing changes to the project budget.[anchor|#fig_fhq_2nv_q2b][anchor|#image_ghq_2nv_q2b][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_Projects_CO_Budget.png|popup|450px][anchor|#section_py4_wtw_mcb]
==Update of the Project Budget when a Change Order Is Released==
When a change order is released, the budgeted values of the corresponding project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form are updated as follows:[anchor|#_025830d7-ba7d-4735-9884-1ddf203522b7]
*If the project has a revenue budget line with the same project task, account group, and inventory item as a revenue budget line of the change order, the system updates the following columns of the revenue budget line of the project on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab, with the column values computed as noted:
**'''Budgeted CO Quantity''' = The total quantity of released change orders
**'''Budgeted CO Amount''' = The total amount of released change orders
**'''Revised Budgeted Quantity''' = '''Original Budgeted Quantity''' + '''Budgeted CO Quantity'''
** '''Revised Budgeted Amount''' = '''Original Budgeted Amount''' + '''Budgeted CO Amount'''
** '''Pending Invoice Amount''' = '''Revised Budgeted Amount''' &#42; '''Completed (%)''' / 100 – '''Actual Amount''' – '''Draft Invoices Amount'''
**:((({S:Warn}As the result of the update of the '''Pending Invoice Amount''', the amount can be a rational value, including a negative one.
)))
*If the project has a cost budget line with the same project task, account group, and inventory item as a cost budget line of the change order, the system updates the following columns of the cost budget line of the project on the '''Cost Budget''' tab, with the column values computed as noted:
**'''Budgeted CO Quantity''' = The total quantity of released change orders
**'''Budgeted CO Amount''' = The total amount of released change orders
**'''Revised Budgeted Quantity''' = '''Original Budgeted Quantity''' + '''Budgeted CO Quantity'''
** '''Revised Budgeted Amount''' = '''Original Budgeted Amount''' + '''Budgeted CO Amount'''
*If the project does not have a revenue or cost budget line with the same project task, account group, and inventory item as a revenue or cost budget line of the change order, the system creates a new revenue or cost budget line for the project based on the revenue or cost budget line of the change order.

==Inventory and Order Management Settings Checklist==
If you want to use the functionality of change orders to manage changes in commitments, make sure that all the needed features have been enabled and settings have been specified, as described in [HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Commitments_Implem_Checklist|Processing Commitments: Implementation Checklist].
==Other Settings That Affect the Workflow==
You can affect the workflow of managing changes in projects by specifying additional settings as follows:[anchor|#_52406023-d3e0-4063-a060-735d623b3e9d]
*To change the format of change order identifiers, adjust the ''CHANGEORD'' numbering sequence on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_10_10|Numbering Sequences] ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) form or create a new numbering sequence and select this sequence in the '''Change Order Numbering Sequence''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''Numbering Sequence''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form. For more information on numbering sequences, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Multiple_Numbering_Sequences|Numbering Sequence Usage].
*:((({S:Warn}Change order identifiers can be assigned only automatically. That is, the '''Manual Numbering''' check box must be cleared in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_10_10|Numbering Sequences] form for the numbering sequence used for change orders.
)))
*:By default, the ''CHANGEORD'' numbering sequence specifies that the change order identifier is an automatically generated numeric string of six digits, such as ''000001''.
*To cause the system to automatically select a change order class on creation of change orders, select the change order class in the '''Default Change Order Class''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''General Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] form.
*To cause the system to automatically select a revenue account group for new change order lines if there are multiple account groups of the ''Income'' type defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_10_00|Account Groups] ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) form, specify the '''Default Revenue Account Group''' for account groups of the ''Expense'' type in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_10_00|Account Groups] form. For more information on account groups, see [HelpRoot_Projects\Account_Groups_GeneralInfo|Account Groups: General Information]

With these settings specified, users in your company can process change orders quickly and accurately with a minimum of manual actions.
==Validation of Configuration==
To make sure that all configuration has been performed correctly, we recommend that you process a change order by performing instructions similar to those described in [HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_CO_to_Budget_Process_Activity|Managing Changes in Projects: To Track Changes in the Budget] and [HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_CO_to_Commitments_Process_Activity|Managing Changes in Projects: To Track Changes in Commitments].]]></column>

If the  Internal Cost Commitment Tracking  check box is                 selected on the  General Settings  tab ( General                   Settings  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000)                 form, and a project has related purchase orders, you can select the                    Change Order Workflow  check box for the project if the                 project has no open related purchase order lines. That is, the status of the related                 purchase order lines of the project is only  Completed ,  Closed , or                    Canceled . Inventory and Order Management Settings Checklist If you want to use the functionality of change orders to manage changes in commitments,         make sure that all the needed features have been enabled and settings have been specified,         as described in  Processing Commitments: Implementation Checklist. Other Settings That Affect the Workflow You can affect the workflow of managing changes in projects by specifying additional         settings as follows: To change the format of change order identifiers, adjust the  CHANGEORD  numbering           sequence on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) Numbering Sequences (CS201010) form or create a new numbering           sequence and select this sequence in the  Change Order Numbering             Sequence  box on the  General Settings  tab             ( Numbering Sequence  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form. For more information on numbering sequences, see  Numbering Sequence Usage. Change order identifiers can be             assigned only automatically. That is, the  Manual Numbering  check             box must be cleared in the Summary area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) Numbering Sequences form for             the numbering sequence used for change orders. By default, the  CHANGEORD              numbering sequence specifies that the change order identifier is an automatically             generated numeric string of six digits, such as  000001 . To cause the system to automatically select a change order class on creation of change           orders, select the change order class in the  Default Change Order             Class  box on the  General Settings  tab             ( General Settings  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences           form. To cause the system to automatically select a revenue account group for new change order           lines if there are multiple account groups of the  Income  type defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) Account Groups (PM201000) form, specify the  Default Revenue             Account Group  for account groups of the  Expense  type in the Summary           area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) Account Groups form. For more information on account groups,           see  Account Groups: General InformationWith these settings specified, users in your company can process change orders quickly and         accurately with a minimum of manual actions. Validation of Configuration To make sure that all configuration has been performed correctly, we recommend that you         process a change order by performing instructions similar to those described in  Managing Changes in Projects: To Track Changes in the Budget and  Managing Changes in Projects: To Track Changes in Commitments. ]]></column>

==Story==
Suppose that the Thai Food Restaurant customer has ordered two juicers, along with installation of the juicers and employee training on operating the juicers from the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company. SweetLife&rsquo;s project accountant has created a project. Then the customer has decided to order one more juicer, along with the same services, as a part of the same project.{br}

Acting as the project accountant, you will turn on the change order workflow and update the budgeted values of the project.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, the following features have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form:[anchor|#_4387db18-6b29-4015-8d96-56b9069f20d7]
*''Project Accounting'', which provides support for the project accounting functionality
*''Change Orders'', which gives you the ability to manage changes to the project’s budgeted and committed values

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, the ''TOMYUM6'' project has been created and the ''PHASE1'' and ''PHASE2'' project tasks have been created for the project.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_30_00|Change Order Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM203000|PM203000]) form, the ''DEFAULT'' change order class has been created.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form, the ''DEFAULT'' change order class has been selected in the '''Default Change Order Class''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''General Settings''' section).
==Process Overview==
In this activity, you will turn on the change order workflow for the project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. On the same form, you will create a new change order. You will then modify and process the created change order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) form.
==System Preparation==
To sign in to the system and prepare to perform the instructions of the activity, do the following:[anchor|#_5e4e87f1-6fe1-4688-b21b-a3ae5c8f4117]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website and sign in as Pam Brawner using the ''brawner'' username and ''123'' password.[anchor|#_4787ecb8-9f8d-4937-ae4c-3d1354409fbd]

If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select ''1/30/2020'' on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.

==Step 1: Turning on the Change Order Workflow==
To turn on the change order workflow for the project to make it possible to create change orders for the project, do the following:[anchor|#_2c8ae0a9-2776-4c26-b799-a3a826682a9b]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''TOMYUM6'' project, and on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Project Properties''' section), notice that the '''Change Order Workflow''' check box is cleared.
#:On the '''Revenue Budget''' tab, notice that the '''Revised Budgeted Quantity''' and '''Revised Budgeted Amount''' columns are available for editing.
#On the '''Summary''' tab, select the '''Change Order Workflow''' check box to turn on the change order workflow for the project.
#Save your changes to the project.
#:On the '''Revenue Budget''' tab, notice that the '''Revised Budgeted Quantity''' and '''Revised Budgeted Amount''' columns are now unavailable for editing.

==Step 2: Creating a Change Order for the Project==
To make changes to the project budget by creating a change order, do the following:[anchor|#_99966b05-1345-4632-8cab-e866b311df9c]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''TOMYUM6'' project.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Create Change Order''' to create a change order for the project. The system creates this change order and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) form.
#In the Summary area of this form, in the '''Description''' box, enter <tt>One more juicer and the respective services requested by the customer</tt>.
#:Notice that the system has automatically selected the ''DEFAULT'' change order class for the change order because this class is the default change order class specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form.
#On the '''Revenue Budget''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar and specify the following settings in the row:
#*'''Project Task''': ''PHASE1''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>4.00</tt>
#:When you select the project task, the system automatically fills in the settings of the line based on the revenue budget line of the project with the same task, because the revenue budget level of the project is ''Task''.
#:When you update the '''Quantity''' of the line, the system automatically recalculates the '''Amount''' based on the '''Unit Rate''' of the line. In the line, the system also calculates the '''Revised Budgeted Quantity''' as the sum of the '''Original Budgeted Quantity''' and the '''Quantity''', and it calculates the '''Revised Budgeted Amount''' as the sum of the '''Original Budgeted Amount''' and the '''Amount'''.
#Add one more revenue budget line and specify the following settings for it:
#*'''Project Task''': ''PHASE2''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>8.00</tt>
#On the table toolbar of the '''Cost Budget''' tab, click '''Select Budget Lines'''.
#In the '''Select Budget Line''' dialog box, which the system has opened in a pop-up window, select the only cost budget line by selecting the check box in the unlabeled column, and click '''Add Lines & Close'''.
#:The system closes the dialog box and adds the selected line to the change order.
#In the added line, enter <tt>1.00</tt> in the '''Quantity''' column.
#:When you update the quantity, the system automatically recalculates the '''Revised Budgeted Quantity''' as the sum of the '''Original Budgeted Quantity''' and '''Quantity''' values, and it recalculates the '''Revised Budgeted Amount''' as the sum of the '''Original Budgeted Amount''' and '''Amount''' values.
#:Until you release the change order, these changes will not affect the project budget.
#Save your changes to the change order.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Reports''' > '''Print Change Order''' to print the change order.
#:The system navigates to the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\PM_64_30_00|Change Order] ([~/?ScreenId=PM643000|PM643000]) report, which is a ready-to-print version of the change order. The printed form lists the revenue budget lines of the change order, which the customer might need to review and agree to.
#Go back to the change order, and in the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box; release the change order.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, open the ''TOMYUM6'' project, and review the revenue and cost budgets of the project (on the '''Revenue Budget''' and '''Cost Budget''' tabs, respectively), which have been updated by the change order you have just released.
#:The system has calculated the '''Revised Budgeted Quantity''' as the sum of the '''Original Budgeted Quantity''' and the '''Budgeted CO Quantity''', and it has calculated the '''Revised Budgeted Amount''' as the sum of the '''Original Budgeted Amount''' and the '''Budgeted CO Amount'''. The '''Budgeted CO Quantity''' and '''Budgeted CO Amount''' are the quantity and amount provided by the change order.
#On the '''Change Orders''' tab, where the system lists all the change orders related to the project, review the change order line related to the change order that you have created.

By using the change order functionality in Acumatica ERP, you can manage changes to a project&rsquo;s committed values if the commitment functionality is configured for project accounting. For more information on commitments, see [HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Commitments_GeneralInfo|Processing Commitments: General Information].[anchor|#section_pbd_zbq_mcb]
==Change Order Workflow==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) form, in a change order with the ''On Hold'' status, you can process the following changes to a project&rsquo;s committed values that have been created based on purchase orders of the ''Normal'' type:[anchor|#_8f77a884-15f3-438c-b2cf-d4a8bb9be86b]
*Creating a new purchase order for a project
*Add a new line to an existing purchase order
*Make an addition to an existing purchase order line
*Make a deduction from an existing purchase order line
*:A deduction from the amount and quantity of a purchase order line can be no greater than the '''Received Qty.''' and '''Received Amount''' of the line on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form.

When you release the change order, based on the '''Quantity''' and '''Amount''' of a commitment line on the '''Commitments''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] form, the system updates the related purchase order or creates a new one, depending on the type of the commitment line, and increases the '''Committed CO Quantity''' and '''Committed CO Amount''' of the corresponding cost budget line of the project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form.
==Workflow of Managing Changes to Commitments==
The following diagram illustrates the workflow of managing changes to commitments.[anchor|#_62136b6c-4891-407a-9391-8b94264035d7][anchor|#_e253c6bd-2c98-46c9-8a73-f3ac1b073b94][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_Projects_CO_Commitments.png|popup|450px][anchor|#section_py4_wtw_mcb]
==Update of a Purchase Order on the Release of a Change Order==
When a change order is released, the system updates or creates purchase order or orders on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form based on the commitment lines of the change order—that is, the lines on the '''Commitments''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) form—as follows:[anchor|#_025830d7-ba7d-4735-9884-1ddf203522b7]
*If a commitment line of the change order has the ''Update'' or ''Reopen'' status, the system updates the following columns of the corresponding purchase order line on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form, with the column values computed as noted:
**'''Order Qty.''' = Original '''Order Qty.''' of the purchase order line + '''Quantity''' of the corresponding commitment line of the change order
**'''Ext. Cost''' = Original '''Ext. Cost''' of the purchase order line + '''Amount''' of the corresponding commitment line of the change order
**'''Requested''' = '''Order Date''' of the corresponding commitment line of the change order
**'''Completed''', '''Canceled''', and '''Closed''' check boxes = Cleared
*If a commitment line of the change order has the ''New Line'' status, the system adds a new line with the following column values to the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form of the corresponding purchase order:

==Update of the Project Budget on the Release of a Change Order==
For each purchase order line on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form updated by a change order, the system updates the corresponding project commitment. For each purchase order line created from a change order, the system creates a new project commitment. If the project has a cost budget line with the same project task, account group, and inventory item on the '''Cost Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form as an updated or newly created purchase order line, the system updates the cost budget line of the project. Otherwise, the system creates a new cost budget line for the project based on the commitment. The '''Original Committed Quantity''' and '''Original Committed Amount''' of the updated cost budget line remain the same, whereas other columns on the '''Cost Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form are updated with the column values computed as noted:[anchor|#_40a11a9f-cd34-45d9-bbfb-ec1ae2e6231b]
*'''Revised Committed Quantity''' = '''Order Qty.''' of the purchase order line
*'''Revised Committed Amount''' = '''Ext. Cost''' of the purchase order line
*'''Committed CO Quantity''' = '''Revised Committed Quantity''' – '''Original Committed Quantity'''
* '''Committed CO Amount''' = '''Revised Committed Amount''' – '''Original Committed Amount'''
* '''Committed Open Amount''' = '''Open Amount''' of the purchase order line

==Story==
Suppose that you, as the project accountant of the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company, need to configure a change order class to be used by a purchase manager for creating change orders for project commitments. The change order class must prevent users from changing the revenue and cost budgets of a project.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, the following features have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form:[anchor|#_49f77e97-740c-43e0-9488-5479723cc7e0]
*''Project Accounting'', which provides support for the project accounting functionality
*''Change Orders'', which gives you the ability to create change order classes and change orders

==Process Overview==
You will configure a change order class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_30_00|Change Order Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM203000|PM203000]) form.
==System Preparation==
Before you start configuring a change order class, you need to launch the Acumatica ERP website and sign in as Pam Brawner using the ''brawner'' username and ''123'' password.
==Step: Configuring a Change Order Class==
To configure a change order class that will be used for creating change orders for project commitments, perform the following instructions:[anchor|#ol_qvk_dvs_sbb]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_30_00|Change Order Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM203000|PM203000]) form, add a new record, and specify ''INTERNAL'' as the '''Class ID''' and <tt>Change order to commitments</tt> as the '''Description'''.
#:Notice that the '''Active''' check box is selected by default.
#On the '''Details''' tab, where all the check boxes are selected, clear the '''Cost Budget''' and '''Revenue Budget''' check boxes. With these settings, for the change orders with this class selected, users can make changes to only commitments without the cost and revenue budgets being affected.
#Save the change order class you have created.

==Story==
Suppose that the HM&rsquo;s Bakery and Cafe customer has ordered the services of installation and employee training on operating the previously bought juicer from the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company. The project accountant of SweetLife has created the project in Acumatica ERP and ordered the following services from the Squeezo Inc. vendor:[anchor|#_70d1f07c-48a1-49f4-b6c3-74583a9282d3]
*Three hours of juicer installation
*Eight hours of training on operating the juicer

The vendor has provided the services. Acting as the project accountant, you will create a purchase order with both of the provided services in the appropriate quantities. You will then receive the invoice from the vendor and realize that the quantity of the provided services differs from the quantity of the ordered services as follows:[anchor|#_f61f7177-7590-43ee-8891-829592058e97]
*An hour of an additional service, the site review, was provided.
*The vendor also provided and installed a feeder basket for the juicer.
*The installation took one hour more than the ordered quantity.
*The training took two hours less than the ordered number of hours.

Per the agreement with the vendor, you will adjust the provided services within the created purchase order and create a new purchase order for the feeder basket.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, the following features have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form:[anchor|#_4387db18-6b29-4015-8d96-56b9069f20d7]

In this activity, you will create a purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form related to the ''HMBAKERY12'' project. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_60_00|Commitments] ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) form, you will review the commitments that the system has created based on the purchase order. You will also review the corresponding committed values of the project budget on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. From the same form, you will create a change order to adjust the created commitments. You will then modify and process the created change order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) form.
==System Preparation==
To sign in to the system and prepare to perform the instructions of the activity, do the following:[anchor|#_5e4e87f1-6fe1-4688-b21b-a3ae5c8f4117]

If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select ''1/30/2020'' on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form, and on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''General Settings''' section), select the '''Internal Cost Commitment Tracking''' check box to expose commitments and committed values in the project budget, and save your changes to the project accounting preferences.

==Step 1: Creating Commitments for the Project==
To create a purchase order for the project, which entails the creation of commitments, do the following:[anchor|#_d4775eab-bd1b-4710-b11b-f371c13d45f5]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, create a purchase order, and specify the following settings in the Summary area: 
#*'''Vendor''': ''SQUEEZO''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Purchase for HM&rsquo;s Bakery and Cafe</tt>
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, add two purchase order lines, and specify the settings shown in the following table in the lines you add.
#:{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="33%" ! '''Inventory ID'''

#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''HMBAKERY12'' project.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Create Change Order'''. The system creates a change order and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) form.
#In the Summary area, specify the following settings:
#*'''Class''': ''INTERNAL''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Adjustment to the purchase orders from Squeezo Inc.</tt>
#On the '''Commitments''' tab, to increase the quantity and amount of an existing line of the purchase order, do the following:
##On the table toolbar, click '''Select Commitments'''.
##In the '''Select Commitments''' dialog box, which opens, select the commitment with the ''INSTALL'' inventory item by selecting the check box in the unlabeled column, and click '''Add Lines & Close'''.
##:The system closes the dialog box and adds the selected purchase order line to the change order and closes the dialog box. Notice that the status of the added line is ''Update''.
##In the added line, enter <tt>1.00</tt> in the '''Quantity''' column.
##:When you update the '''Quantity''' value, the system automatically recalculates the '''Amount''' value based on the '''Unit Rate''' of the line.
##:The system also calculates the '''Potentially Revised Quantity''' value as the sum of the '''Order Qty.''' and '''Quantity''' values, and calculates the '''Potentially Revised Amount''' value as the sum of the '''Ext. Cost''' and '''Amount''' values.
#On the '''Commitments''' tab, to decrease the quantity and amount of an existing line of the purchase order, do the following:
##On the table toolbar, click '''Select Commitments'''.
##In the '''Select Commitments''' dialog box, select the commitment with the ''TRAINING'' inventory item by selecting the check box in the unlabeled column, and click '''Add Lines & Close'''.
##:The system closes the dialog box and adds the selected purchase order line to the change order. Notice that the status of the added line is ''Update''.
##In the added line, enter <tt>-2.00</tt> in the '''Quantity''' column.
##:When you update the '''Quantity''' value, the system automatically recalculates the '''Amount''', '''Potentially Revised Quantity''', and '''Potentially Revised Amount''' values.
#To add a new line to the existing purchase order, add a commitment line and specify the following settings for it (see the screenshot below):
#*'''Inventory ID''': ''SITEREVIEW''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>1.00</tt>
#*'''Unit Cost''': <tt>40.00</tt>
#*'''PO Nbr.''': The purchase order you have created, which is the only purchase order that has been created for the project
#:Notice that the status of the added line is ''New Line''.
#To add a new purchase order for the project, add a commitment line, and specify the following settings for it:
#*'''Inventory ID''': ''BASKET''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>1.00</tt>
#*'''Unit Cost''': <tt>250.00</tt>
#*'''Vendor''': ''SQUEEZO''
#:Notice that the status of the added line is ''New Document''.
#Save your changes to the change order.
#:The '''Commitments Change Total''' in the Summary area must be equal to ''290.00'', as shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_1e5e27e9-66cd-440a-99ea-a7c8719cf639][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_CO_to_Commitments.png|popup|Changes to project commitments|400px]
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box; release the change order.
#Review the purchase order that has been modified when the change order was released as follows:
##In the '''PO Nbr.''' column of a line with the ''Update'' status, click the number of the purchase order, which is a link.
##:The system opens the purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form in a pop-up window.
##In the Summary area of the form, notice that you cannot select the '''Hold''' check box for the purchase order to be able to change the order. This check box is unavailable because the related project has the change order workflow turned on and the purchase order has a related change order.
##On the '''Document Details''' tab, review the updated '''Order Qty.''' of the lines with the ''INSTALL'' and ''TRAINING'' inventory items and the added line with the ''SITEREVIEW'' item.
##On the '''Change Orders''' tab, review the change order lines related to the purchase order.
##Close the pop-up window.
#Review the purchase order created by the change order as follows:
##On the '''Commitments''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] form (to which you return), in the '''PO Nbr.''' column of a line with the ''New Document'' status, click the number of the purchase order, which is a link.
##In the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form, which the system opens in a pop-up window, review the description of the created purchase order.
##On the '''Document Details''' tab, review the created line with the ''BASKET'' inventory item.
##On the '''Change Orders''' tab, review the change order line related to the purchase order.
##Close the pop-up window.

==Step 3: Reviewing the Updated Commitments==
To review the commitments that the system has updated based on the released change order you created in Step 2, do the following:[anchor|#_a9406f4a-bd76-4e5d-9553-a15da14476ee]
#In the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_60_00|Commitments] ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) form, select ''HMBAKERY12'' in the '''Project''' box, and review the commitments that have been updated on the '''Cost Commitments''' tab.
#:Notice that the commitments that have been updated with the change order have nonzero '''Committed CO Quantity''' and '''Committed CO Amount''' values. The '''Revised Committed Quantity''' and '''Revised Committed Amount''' values of these commitments also differ from the '''Original Committed Quantity''' and '''Original Committed Amount''' values, respectively.[anchor|#_0f6eb960-1e20-4f69-8a1e-a725d3ece908][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_CO_to_Commitments2.png|popup|Project commitments updated with the change order|400px]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''HMBAKERY12'' project.
#On the '''Cost Budget''' tab, review the updated committed values of the cost budget.
#On the '''Balances''' tab, review the updated committed values by account group.
#On the '''Commitments''' tab, review the list of purchase orders related to the project, including the new purchase order that was created based on the change order you have processed.
#On the '''Change Orders''' tab, review the change order created for the project.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Managing Changes in Projects: To Track Changes in Commitments In this activity, you will learn how you can track changes to project commitments with         change orders.  Before you start completing the activity, perform the instructions of  Managing Changes in Projects: Implementation Activity to create the change order class that is         used in this activity. The following activity is             based on the  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system             settings have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the             activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100              dataset to its initial state. Story Suppose that the HM's Bakery and Cafe customer has ordered the services of installation and         employee training on operating the previously bought juicer from the  SweetLife Fruits & Jams company. The project accountant of  SweetLife         has created the project in  Acumatica ERP and ordered the following services from the Squeezo Inc. vendor: Three hours of juicer installation Eight hours of training on operating the juicer The vendor has provided the services. Acting as the project accountant, you will create a         purchase order with both of the provided services in the appropriate quantities. You will         then receive the invoice from the vendor and realize that the quantity of the provided         services differs from the quantity of the ordered services as follows: An hour of an additional service, the site review, was provided. The vendor also provided and installed a feeder basket for the juicer. The installation took one hour more than the ordered quantity. The training took two hours less than the ordered number of hours. Per the agreement with the vendor, you will adjust the provided services within the created         purchase order and create a new purchase order for the feeder basket. Configuration Overview For the purposes of this activity, the following features have been enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form: Project Accounting , which provides support for the project accounting           functionality Change Orders , which gives you the ability to manage changes to the project’s           budgeted and committed values Inventory and Order Management  feature, which provides the functionality of           purchase orders On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, the  HMBAKERY12          project has been created and the  INSTALL  project task has been created for the         project. This project task is also the default task of the project. On the            Summary  tab of the form ( Project Properties          section), the  Change Order Workflow  check box is selected for the         project so that users can track all the changes to the budgeted values by using change         orders. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM203000|PM203000]) Change Order Classes (PM203000) form, the  INTERNAL  change order         class has been created in the scope of the  Managing Changes in Projects: Implementation Activity. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form, the  SITEREVIEW ,            INSTALL , and  TRAINING  non-stock items have been defined. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form, the  BASKET  stock item has         been defined. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors (AP303000) form, the  SQUEEZO  vendor has been         created. Process Overview In this activity, you will create a purchase order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form related to the  HMBAKERY12          project. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) Commitments (PM306000) form, you will         review the commitments that the system has created based on the purchase order. You will         also review the corresponding committed values of the project budget on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. From the same form, you will         create a change order to adjust the created commitments. You will then modify and process         the created change order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) Change Orders (PM308000)         form. System Preparation To sign in to the system and prepare to perform the instructions of the activity, do the         following: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website and sign in as Pam Brawner using the  brawner  username and  123            password. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP             screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to  1/30/2020. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and             select  1/30/2020 on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and             process all documents in the system during this business date. Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form, and on the  General             Settings  tab ( General Settings  section), select the              Internal Cost Commitment Tracking  check box to expose commitments           and committed values in the project budget, and save your changes to the project           accounting preferences. Step 1: Creating Commitments for the Project To create a purchase order for the project, which entails the creation of commitments, do         the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form, create a purchase order, and           specify the following settings in the Summary area:  Vendor :  SQUEEZO Description :  Purchase for HM's Bakery and                 Cafe On the  Document Details  tab, add two purchase order lines, and           specify the settings shown in the following table in the lines you add. Inventory ID Order Qty. Project INSTALL 3.00 HMBAKERY12 TRAINING 8.00 HMBAKERY12 In the Summary area, clear the  Hold  check box; click              Save  on the form toolbar to save the purchase order. The system             assigns the  Open  status to the purchase order and creates commitments for the             project. In the Summary area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) Commitments (PM306000) form,           select  HMBAKERY12  in the  Project  box, and review the           commitments that were created. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, open the              HMBAKERY12  project, and on the  Cost Budget  tab, review the           committed values of the cost budget. On the  Commitments  tab, review the list of purchase orders           related to the project. Step 2: Changing the Project Commitments To change the project commitments by using a change order, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, open the              HMBAKERY12  project. On the form toolbar, click  Create Change Order . The system           creates a change order and opens it on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) Change Orders           (PM308000) form. In the Summary area, specify the following settings: Class :  INTERNAL Description :  Adjustment to the purchase orders                 from Squeezo Inc. On the  Commitments  tab, to increase the quantity and amount of an           existing line of the purchase order, do the following: On the table toolbar, click  Select Commitments . In the  Select Commitments  dialog box, which opens, select the               commitment with the  INSTALL  inventory item by selecting the check box in the               unlabeled column, and click  Add Lines & Close . The system                 closes the dialog box and adds the selected purchase order line to the change order                 and closes the dialog box. Notice that the status of the added line is                  Update . In the added line, enter  1.00  in the                  Quantity  column. When you update the                    Quantity  value, the system automatically recalculates the                    Amount  value based on the  Unit Rate                  of the line. The system also calculates the  Potentially Revised                   Quantity  value as the sum of the  Order Qty.  and                    Quantity  values, and calculates the  Potentially                   Revised Amount  value as the sum of the  Ext.                   Cost  and  Amount  values. On the  Commitments  tab, to decrease the quantity and amount of an           existing line of the purchase order, do the following: On the table toolbar, click  Select Commitments . In the  Select Commitments  dialog box, select the commitment               with the  TRAINING  inventory item by selecting the check box in the unlabeled               column, and click  Add Lines & Close . The system closes                 the dialog box and adds the selected purchase order line to the change order. Notice                 that the status of the added line is  Update . In the added line, enter  -2.00  in the                  Quantity  column. When you update the                    Quantity  value, the system automatically recalculates the                    Amount ,  Potentially Revised                 Quantity , and  Potentially Revised Amount                  values. To add a new line to the existing purchase order, add a commitment line and specify the           following settings for it (see the screenshot below): Inventory ID :  SITEREVIEW Quantity :  1.00 Unit Cost :  40.00 PO Nbr. : The purchase order you have created, which is the               only purchase order that has been created for the project Notice that the status of the added line is  New Line . To add a new purchase order for the project, add a commitment line, and specify the           following settings for it: Inventory ID :  BASKET Quantity :  1.00 Unit Cost :  250.00 Vendor :  SQUEEZO Notice that the status of the added line is  New Document . Save your changes to the change order. The                Commitment s                Change Total  in the Summary area must be equal to  290.00 , as shown             in the following screenshot. Changes to project commitments In the Summary area, clear the  Hold  check box; release the change           order. Review the purchase order that has been modified when the change order was released as             follows: In the  PO Nbr.  column of a line with the  Update                status, click the number of the purchase order, which is a link. The system opens                 the purchase order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000)                 form in a pop-up window. In the Summary area of the form, notice that you cannot select the                  Hold  check box for the purchase order to be able to change               the order. This check box is unavailable because the related project has the change               order workflow turned on and the purchase order has a related change order. On the  Document Details  tab, review the updated                  Order Qty.  of the lines with the  INSTALL  and                  TRAINING  inventory items and the added line with the  SITEREVIEW                item. On the  Change Orders  tab, review the change order lines               related to the purchase order. Close the pop-up window. Review the purchase order created by the change order as follows: On the  Commitments  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) Change Orders form (to which you return), in the                  PO Nbr.  column of a line with the  New Document  status,               click the number of the purchase order, which is a link. In the Summary area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form, which               the system opens in a pop-up window, review the description of the created purchase               order. On the  Document Details  tab, review the created line with the                  BASKET  inventory item. On the  Change Orders  tab, review the change order line               related to the purchase order. Close the pop-up window. Step 3: Reviewing the Updated Commitments To review the commitments that the system has updated based on the released change order         you created in Step 2, do the following: In the Summary area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) Commitments (PM306000) form,           select  HMBAKERY12  in the  Project  box, and review the           commitments that have been updated on the  Cost Commitments              tab. Notice that the commitments that have been updated with the change order have             nonzero  Committed CO Quantity  and  Committed CO               Amount  values. The  Revised Committed Quantity  and                Revised Committed Amount  values of these commitments also             differ from the  Original Committed Quantity  and                Original Committed Amount  values, respectively. Project commitments updated with the change order On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, open the              HMBAKERY12  project. On the  Cost Budget  tab, review the updated committed values of           the cost budget. On the  Balances  tab, review the updated committed values by           account group. On the  Commitments  tab, review the list of purchase orders           related to the project, including the new purchase order that was created based on the           change order you have processed. On the  Change Orders  tab, review the change order created for the           project. ]]></column>

Suppose that the HM&rsquo;s Bakery and Cafe customer has ordered a juicer from the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company, along with the services of installation and training for its employees on operating the juicer. The installation is performed by the vendor of the juicers, Squeezo Inc. The project accountant of SweetLife has created a project with tasks corresponding to the installation and training phases. {br}

Acting as the project accountant, you need to capture the installation cost on the project. You will then lock the commitments for the project to prevent the direct processing of purchase orders for the project.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, the following features have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form:[anchor|#_4387db18-6b29-4015-8d96-56b9069f20d7]
*''Project Accounting'', which provides support for the project accounting functionality
*''Change Orders'', which gives you the ability to manage changes to the project’s budgeted and committed values
*''Inventory and Order Management'' feature, which provides the functionality of purchase orders

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, the ''HMBAKERY11'' project has been created and the ''PHASE1'' (for installation) and ''PHASE2'' (for training) project tasks have been created for the project. ''PHASE1'' is the default task of the project.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, the ''INSTALL'' non-stock item has been configured.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form, the ''SQUEEZO'' vendor has been created.
==Process Overview==
In this activity, you will create a purchase order for the project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. You will then lock the project commitments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form to prevent the creation of purchase orders for the project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form.
==System Preparation==
To sign in to the system and prepare to perform the instructions of the activity, do the following:[anchor|#_6c9e4914-0e56-4fc0-9f9d-df880dcd99b6]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the U100 dataset preloaded as Pam Brawner by using the ''brawner'' username and the ''123'' password.[anchor|#_6aafab12-df20-4751-8cb7-c87d18159c1c]
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select ''1/30/2020'' on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form, and on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''General Settings''' section), select the '''Internal Cost Commitment Tracking''' check box to expose commitments and committed values in the project budget, and save your changes to the project accounting preferences.

==Step 1: Creating a Purchase Order for the Project==
To create a purchase order for the project, do the following:[anchor|#_a7fc6e3b-d41e-45c3-8b1a-131a1a172a9b]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''HMBAKERY11'' project, and review the cost budget on the '''Cost Budget''' tab. Notice that all the committed values are zero.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, create a purchase order, and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Vendor''': ''SQUEEZO''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Purchase for HM&rsquo;s Bakery & Cafe</tt>
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the row:
#*'''Inventory ID''': ''INSTALL''
#* '''Order Qty.''': <tt>4.00</tt>
#*'''Project''': ''HMBAKERY11''
#:The system automatically selects the ''PHASE1'' project task when you select the project because this is the default project task; leave this task selected.
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box; save the purchase order, which now has the ''Open'' status.
#:When the ''Open'' status is assigned to the purchase order, the system updates the committed values of the project.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, open the ''HMBAKERY11'' project, and review the updated cost budget on the '''Cost Budget''' tab. Notice that the committed values of the budget line with the ''PHASE1'' project task and the ''INSTALL'' inventory item have been updated.
#Click the cost budget line, and on the table toolbar, click '''View Commitment Details''' to review the list of corresponding commitments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_60_00|Commitments] ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) form, which the system opens in a pop-up window.

==Step 2: Locking Commitments for the Project==
To prevent the direct creation of purchase orders for the project, do the following:[anchor|#_cddc3340-162f-4020-9f7e-9b61eadda571]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''HMBAKERY11'' project, and on the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Lock Commitments'''.
#:((({S:Warn}If you needed to unlock the project commitments, you would click '''Actions''' > '''Unlock Commitments''', which reverses the effects of the '''Lock Commitments''' action.
)))
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, create a purchase order, and specify the following settings:
#*'''Vendor''': ''SQUEEZO''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Purchase for HM&rsquo;s Bakery & Cafe</tt>
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, click '''Add Row''', and specify the following settings in the row:
#*'''Inventory ID''': ''INSTALL''
#* '''Order Qty.''': <tt>2.00</tt>
#*'''Project''': ''HMBAKERY11''
#:When you select the project, the system shows an error message in the '''Project''' column that says you cannot create purchase order commitments for this project because the commitments are locked for the project (see the following screenshot). Until you unlock the commitments for the project, you can process purchases for the project only with change orders.[anchor|#_4ad7563b-7bbb-4ad1-8865-cd6ce4bad453][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_LockBudget.png|popup|The restriction of direct commitment creation for the project|400px]

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Managing Changes in Projects: To Prevent Direct Changes to Commitments If you want to manage changes to a project's committed values, you can prevent the creation         of purchase orders for the project on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form         and create new commitments by using change orders.  The following activity is             based on the  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system             settings have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the             activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100              dataset to its initial state. Story Suppose that the HM's Bakery and Cafe customer has ordered a juicer from the  SweetLife Fruits & Jams company, along with the services of installation and training for its employees on         operating the juicer. The installation is performed by the vendor of the juicers, Squeezo         Inc. The project accountant of  SweetLife has created a project with tasks corresponding to the installation and training phases.  Acting as the project accountant, you need to capture the installation cost on the project.         You will then lock the commitments for the project to prevent the direct processing of         purchase orders for the project. Configuration Overview For the purposes of this activity, the following features have been enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form: Project Accounting , which provides support for the project accounting           functionality Change Orders , which gives you the ability to manage changes to the project’s           budgeted and committed values Inventory and Order Management  feature, which provides the functionality of           purchase orders On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, the  HMBAKERY11  project has         been created and the  PHASE1  (for installation) and  PHASE2  (for training)         project tasks have been created for the project.  PHASE1  is the default task of the         project. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form, the  INSTALL  non-stock item         has been configured. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors (AP303000) form, the  SQUEEZO  vendor has been         created. Process Overview In this activity, you will create a purchase order for the project on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form. You will then lock the project commitments on         the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form to prevent the creation of purchase         orders for the project on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form. System Preparation To sign in to the system and prepare to perform the instructions of the activity, do the         following: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the U100 dataset preloaded as Pam Brawner by           using the  brawner  username and the  123  password. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP             screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to  1/30/2020. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and             select  1/30/2020 on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and             process all documents in the system during this business date. Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form, and on the  General             Settings  tab ( General Settings  section), select the              Internal Cost Commitment Tracking  check box to expose commitments           and committed values in the project budget, and save your changes to the project           accounting preferences. Step 1: Creating a Purchase Order for the Project To create a purchase order for the project, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, open the  HMBAKERY11            project, and review the cost budget on the  Cost Budget  tab. Notice           that all the committed values are zero. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form, create a purchase order, and           specify the following settings in the Summary area: Vendor :  SQUEEZO Description :  Purchase for HM's Bakery &                 Cafe On the  Document Details  tab, click  Add Row            on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the row: Inventory ID :  INSTALL Order Qty. :  4.00 Project :  HMBAKERY11 The system automatically selects the  PHASE1  project task when you select             the project because this is the default project task; leave this task selected. In the Summary area, clear the  Hold  check box; save the purchase           order, which now has the  Open  status. When the  Open  status is assigned to             the purchase order, the system updates the committed values of the project. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, open the  HMBAKERY11  project, and           review the updated cost budget on the  Cost Budget  tab. Notice that           the committed values of the budget line with the  PHASE1  project task and the              INSTALL  inventory item have been updated. Click the cost budget line, and on the table toolbar, click  View Commitment             Details  to review the list of corresponding commitments on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) Commitments (PM306000) form, which the system opens in a pop-up           window. Step 2: Locking Commitments for the Project To prevent the direct creation of purchase orders for the project, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, open the  HMBAKERY11            project, and on the form toolbar, click  Actions Lock Commitments . If you needed to unlock the project commitments, you would click  Actions Unlock Commitments , which reverses the effects of the  Lock               Commitments  action. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PM301000) form, create a purchase order, and           specify the following settings: Vendor :  SQUEEZO Description :  Purchase for HM's Bakery &                 Cafe On the  Document Details  tab, click  Add           Row , and specify the following settings in the row: Inventory ID :  INSTALL Order Qty. :  2.00 Project :  HMBAKERY11 When you select the project, the system shows an error message in the                Project  column that says you cannot create purchase order             commitments for this project because the commitments are locked for the project (see the             following screenshot).

Each project has its own numbering sequence for the change orders that can affect the revenue of the project. By default, the '''Revenue Change Nbr.''' of a change order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) form is an integer that the system assigns sequentially: 0001 for the first change order for the project, 0002 for the second, 0003 for the third, and so on. The last assigned number for the project is shown in the '''Last Revenue Change Nbr.''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Project Properties''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]).{br}

You can manually change the '''Revenue Change Nbr.''' of a particular change order. (Duplicate numbers within a project are not allowed, however.) If you change this number for a change order, you should make a similar change to the '''Last Revenue Change Nbr.''' of the corresponding project so that the system continues to assign these numbers correctly.{br}

You should adhere to the following recommendations if you manually assign revenue change numbers:[anchor|#_206cbe82-fc44-413b-a9a3-71cf467e2669]
*Use a four-digit number as a revenue change number, such as ''0001''.
*If you need to use mixed characters for a revenue change number—that is, letters, symbols, and numerals—add a four-digit number to the character string, resulting in a revenue change number such as ''CO#0001''.
*If a project has revenue change orders and the numeric part of the last assigned revenue change number for the project consists of a one- or two-digit number, add enough zeros before the numeric part of the last change number so that the numeric part of the number is at least four digits. For example, if the '''Last Revenue Change Nbr.''' in the '''Project Properties''' area of the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form is ''CO#9'', change it to ''CO#0009''.

For change orders that cannot affect the project revenue and the ''Reversing'' change orders (those that reverse the impact of the original change orders), the '''Revenue Change Nbr.''' box is read-only and contains ''N/A''.{br}

For the ''Reversed'' change orders (those that have been reversed), you can reuse the '''Revenue Change Nbr.'''—that is, assign the '''Revenue Change Nbr.''' of a ''Reversed'' change order to a new change order. This will not lead to an error of duplicated numbers because the ''Reversed'' change order does not affect the project revenue anymore. If you reuse the '''Revenue Change Nbr.''' of a ''Reversed'' change order, you should make the appropriate change to the '''Last Revenue Change Nbr.''' of the corresponding project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form so that the system continues to assign these numbers correctly.]]></column>

This topic explains how to perform mass-processing operations related to change orders, and how the system generates, changes, or works with documents as a result of the mass processing.
==Mass-Validating Change Orders==
In some cases (for instance, if the project budget has been adjusted with change orders that have been modified through external tools or import scenarios), you may need to validate the project balances to make change order quantities and amounts of the project budget match the values of the change orders.{br}

To recalculate budget values affected by change orders, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_50_40_00|Validate Project Balances] ([~/?ScreenId=PM504000|PM504000]) form. On this form, you select the '''Recalculate Change Orders''' check box in the Selection area. You also select the unlabeled check boxes in the rows of the projects to be processed and click '''Validate''' on the form toolbar to process the selected projects; alternatively, you can click '''Validate All''' to process all the projects shown in the table. The system validates project balances and recalculates the following values on the '''Revenue Budget''' and '''Cost Budget''' tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form:[anchor|#_f5311b38-4538-49fe-987c-26764165af3b]

 Acumatica ERP provides the two-tier change management capability for projects, which is used to create change requests in addition to change orders. Change requests are detailed breakdowns of potential changes to the project budget and commitments, such as additions, deletions, or edits to the existing cost or revenue budget. In the first tier, you create change requests, and the second tier involves you grouping multiple change requests into a single change order to be approved.{br}

With the two-tier change management, you can also set up price markups that can be applied to an individual line of a change request and to the total amount of the document to charge the customer for the changes.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Configure a change order class that supports the two-tier change management
*Configure default markups
*Create a change request to update the project budget
*Process a change request with a cost change order
*Process a change request with a revenue change order

==Applicable Scenarios==
You turn on the change order workflow for a project to be able to track changes to the budgeted and committed values of the project. You create change requests before creating change orders, if the workflow of your project supposes a lot of small changes to the budget and you need to organize all these changes to process them with a single or several change orders, for example, for approval, instead of creating a lot of change orders.{br}

You can also need to create change requests for a project, if you want to charge the customer for the changes made to the project budget.
==Creating of Change Requests==
To make it possible for users to track changes for a project by using change requests, you select the '''Change Order Workflow''' check box on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form for the project. You need to select this check box for each project for which you want to turn on the change order workflow.{br}

Once you have selected this check box for a project, you can create a change request for the project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form by clicking '''Create Change Request''' on the form toolbar. The system creates a change request with the ''On Hold'' status and the project selected and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_85_00|Change Requests] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308500|PM308500]) form.((({S:Warn}In addition to creating a change request from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form for the selected project, you can create a new change request directly on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_85_00|Change Requests] form and select the needed project.
)))
In a change request with the ''On Hold'' status, on the '''Estimation''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_85_00|Change Requests] form, you add rows with potential changes that will affect the revenue budget and the cost budget of the selected project when the related change orders are released. For each estimation line, you specify the following settings:[anchor|#_a50bd6f7-c9a0-4d79-ad27-5ca285e52c0c]
*The '''Project Task''', '''Account Group''', and '''Inventory ID''' that represent the cost budget line to be updated or created if this combination of settings does not exist in the project budget
*:If you do not want to associate an estimation line with any inventory item, you select the empty item code (''N/A'') in the '''Inventory ID''' column.
*The '''Revenue Task''' and '''Revenue Account Group''' that represent the revenue budget line to be updated or created if this combination of settings does not exist in the project budget
*The '''Quantity''', '''Unit Cost''', and '''Unit Price''' for the specified unit of measure that estimate the change to the budget
*:Optionally, the '''Create Commitment''' and '''Vendor''' if you want to create a commitment line based on this estimation line

The amount in the '''Ext. Cost''' column estimates the change of the cost and calculated as follows:{br}

{{'''Ext. Cost''' = '''Quantity''' * '''Unit Cost'''}}{br}

The amount in the '''Line Amount''' column estimates the change of the revenue and calculated as follows:{br}

{{'''Line Amount''' = '''Ext. Price''' + '''Ext. Price''' * '''Line Markup (%)''' / <i>100<i>}}{br}

{{ '''Ext. Price''' = '''Quantity''' * '''Unit Price'''}}{br}

{{ '''Unit Price''' = '''Unit Price''' + '''Unit Price''' * '''Price Markup (%)''' / <i>100<i>}}{br}

Once you have saved a change request with the ''Open'' status, the '''Quantity''' and '''Ext. Cost''' values of each estimation line increase the '''Potential CO Quantity''' and '''Potential CO Amount''' of the corresponding cost budget line of the project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. The '''Quantity''' and '''Line Amount''' values of each estimation line increase the '''Potential CO Quantity''' and '''Potential CO Amount''' of the corresponding revenue budget line of the project.
==Applying of Markups==
You can configure markups to charge the customer with each created change request. The following types of markup can be applied to a change request on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_85_00|Change Requests] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308500|PM308500]) form:[anchor|#_85dd3f3a-6d3d-45dd-9d8b-3af48d444b6b]
*Line-level markups: These markups apply to an individual estimation line on the '''Estimation''' tab and affects the '''Line Amount''' value. This type includes the '''Price Markup (%)''' and '''Line Markup (%)'''.
*Document-level markups: These markups apply to the total line amount of the change request on the '''Markups''' tab.
*:You can define one or several markups of this type for the change request as well as define no markups. A document-level markup is applied to a change request only if all the key attributes of a project budget line—project task, account group, and optionally inventory item—are defined for the markup on the '''Markups''' tab.

==Adding of a Change Request to a Change Order==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_85_00|Change Requests] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308500|PM308500]) form, you can create a change order for the selected change request by clicking the '''Create Change Order''' button on the form toolbar. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) form, you can also add one or several change requests to the selected change order by clicking '''Select Change Requests''' on the table toolbar of the '''Change Requests''' tab.{br}

If the project cost budget and commitments affected by a change request need to be updated through a separate change order before the revenue part has been approved, a ''cost change order'' and a ''revenue change order'' may be used.{br}

A cost change order is a change order that contains only the cost and commitment parts of the change request based on the settings of the selected change order class. This change order created for a change request is shown in the '''Cost Change Order Nbr.''' box in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_85_00|Change Requests] form.{br}

A revenue change order is a change order that contains the revenue part of the change request as well as all types of estimation lines—that is, revenue budget, cost budget, and commitment lines. This change order created for a change request is shown in the '''Change Order Nbr.''' box in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_85_00|Change Requests] form.{br}

A change request may be associated with both a cost change order and a revenue change order. If you create a cost change order for a change request first, this makes it necessary to also create a revenue change order. You can release the cost change order as early as necessary to create commitments and change the project cost budget accordingly without having to have the revenue part approved at the same time. The revenue change order may be released later. Most commonly, however, a change request relates to only one change order that contains all types of estimation lines (a revenue change order).{br}

Based on each estimation line of the change request added to a change order and on the selected change order class, the system creates the following lines for the change order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] form:[anchor|#_ff7db998-0db5-46b2-ab84-8f0667a99360]
*A cost budget line on the '''Cost Budget''' tab with the '''Quantity''' and '''Amount''' values equal to the quantity and extended cost of the estimation line
*A revenue budget line on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab with the '''Quantity''' and '''Amount''' values equal to the quantity and line amount of the estimation line
*A commitment line on the '''Commitments''' tab with the '''Quantity''' and '''Amount''' values equal to the quantity and extended cost of the estimation line, if the estimation line has '''Create Commitment''' check box selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_85_00|Change Requests] form

If the change request has a markup line with the project task and account group on the '''Markups''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_85_00|Change Requests] form but has no estimation line with the same revenue task and revenue account group on the '''Estimation''' tab, on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] form, the system also creates a revenue budget line with the '''Amount''' value equal to the markup amount of this markup line. Otherwise, the markup amount is added to the existing revenue budget line created based on the estimation line.{br}

When the change request whose cost and commitment part and revenue part have been linked to one or two change orders (depending on whether the cost and commitment part and the revenue part are processed jointly or separately), the system assigns the ''Closed'' status to the change request.{br}

For information on further processing of change orders, see [HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_CO_GeneralInfo|Managing Changes in Projects: General Information]. With the two-tier change management, you can also create change order lines that do not originate from change requests.[anchor|#section_i2l_d4p_mcb]
==Workflow of Processing a Change Request==
The following diagram illustrates the workflow of processing a change request.[anchor|#fig_fhq_2nv_q2b][anchor|#image_ghq_2nv_q2b][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_Projects_Two_Tier_Change_Management.png|popup|450px][anchor|#section_qkr_hkx_mcb]
==Configuring of Change Order Classes==
A change order class defines which project data—the revenue budget, the cost budget, or commitments—can be adjusted with a change order of this class. The two-tier change management is controlled at the level of a change order class. If the '''2-Tier Change Management''' check box is selected for a particular class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_30_00|Change Order Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM203000|PM203000]) form, change orders of the selected class support two-tier change management and can include change requests.{br}

If a change order class has the '''Revenue Budget''' check box cleared and the '''Cost Budget''' and '''Commitments''' check box selected on the '''Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_30_00|Change Order Classes] form, change orders of this class are classified as ''cost change orders'' for change requests.{br}

If a change order class has the '''Revenue Budget''', '''Cost Budget''', and '''Commitments''' check box selected on the '''Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_30_00|Change Order Classes] form, change orders of this class are treated as ''revenue change orders''.]]></column>

You need to select this check box for each project for which you want to         turn on the change order workflow. Once you have selected this check box for a project, you can create a change request for         the project on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form by clicking  Create Change           Request  on the form toolbar. The system creates a change request with the            On Hold  status and the project selected and opens it on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308500|PM308500]) Change Requests (PM308500) form. In addition to creating a change request from the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form         for the selected project, you can create a new change request directly on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308500|PM308500]) Change Requests form and select the needed project. In a change request with the  On Hold  status, on the            Estimation  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308500|PM308500]) Change Requests form, you add         rows with potential changes that will affect the revenue budget and the cost budget of the         selected project when the related change orders are released. For each estimation line, you         specify the following settings: The  Project Task ,  Account Group , and              Inventory ID  that represent the cost budget line to be updated or           created if this combination of settings does not exist in the project budget If you do             not want to associate an estimation line with any inventory item, you select the empty             item code ( N/A ) in the  Inventory ID  column. The  Revenue Task  and  Revenue Account Group            that represent the revenue budget line to be updated or created if this combination of           settings does not exist in the project budget The  Quantity ,  Unit Cost , and              Unit Price  for the specified unit of measure that estimate the           change to the budget Optionally, the  Create Commitment  and                Vendor  if you want to create a commitment line based on this             estimation line The amount in the  Ext. Cost  column estimates the change of the cost         and calculated as follows: Ext. Cost  =  Quantity  *              Unit Cost The amount in the  Line Amount  column estimates the change of the         revenue and calculated as follows: Line Amount  =  Ext. Price  +              Ext. Price  *  Line Markup (%)  /            100 Ext. Price  =  Quantity  *              Unit Price Unit Price  =  Unit Price  +              Unit Price  *  Price Markup (%)  /            100 Once you have saved a change request with the  Open  status, the            Quantity  and  Ext. Cost  values of each         estimation line increase the  Potential CO Quantity  and            Potential CO Amount  of the corresponding cost budget line of the         project on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form. The            Quantity  and  Line Amount  values of each         estimation line increase the  Potential CO Quantity  and            Potential CO Amount  of the corresponding revenue budget line of the         project. Applying of Markups You can configure markups to charge the customer with each created change request. The         following types of markup can be applied to a change request on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308500|PM308500]) Change Requests (PM308500) form: Line-level markups: These markups apply to an individual estimation line on the              Estimation  tab and affects the  Line Amount            value. This type includes the  Price Markup (%)  and  Line             Markup (%) . Document-level markups: These markups apply to the total line amount of the change           request on the  Markups  tab. You can define one or several markups             of this type for the change request as well as define no markups. A document-level             markup is applied to a change request only if all the key attributes of a project budget             line—project task, account group, and optionally inventory item—are defined for the             markup on the  Markups  tab. Adding of a Change Request to a Change Order On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308500|PM308500]) Change Requests (PM308500) form, you can create a         change order for the selected change request by clicking the  Create Change           Order  button on the form toolbar. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) Change Orders (PM308000) form, you can also add one or several         change requests to the selected change order by clicking  Select Change           Requests  on the table toolbar of the  Change Requests          tab. If the project cost budget and commitments affected by a change request need to be updated         through a separate change order before the revenue part has been approved, a  cost change           order  and a  revenue change order  may be used. A cost change order is a change order that contains only the cost and commitment parts of         the change request based on the settings of the selected change order class. This change         order created for a change request is shown in the  Cost Change Order           Nbr.  box in the Summary area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308500|PM308500]) Change Requests form. A revenue change order is a change order that contains the revenue part of the change         request as well as all types of estimation lines—that is, revenue budget, cost budget, and         commitment lines. This change order created for a change request is shown in the            Change Order Nbr.  box in the Summary area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308500|PM308500]) Change Requests form. A change request may be associated with both a cost change order and a revenue change         order. If you create a cost change order for a change request first, this makes it necessary         to also create a revenue change order. You can release the cost change order as early as         necessary to create commitments and change the project cost budget accordingly without         having to have the revenue part approved at the same time. The revenue change order may be         released later. Most commonly, however, a change request relates to only one change order         that contains all types of estimation lines (a revenue change order). Based on each estimation line of the change request added to a change order and on the         selected change order class, the system creates the following lines for the change order on         the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) Change Orders form: A cost budget line on the  Cost Budget  tab with the              Quantity  and  Amount  values equal to the           quantity and extended cost of the estimation line A revenue budget line on the  Revenue Budget  tab with the              Quantity  and  Amount  values equal to the           quantity and line amount of the estimation line A commitment line on the  Commitments  tab with the              Quantity  and  Amount  values equal to the           quantity and extended cost of the estimation line, if the estimation line has              Create Commitment  check box selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308500|PM308500]) Change Requests form If the change request has a markup line with the project task and account group on the            Markups  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308500|PM308500]) Change Requests         form but has no estimation line with the same revenue task and revenue account group on the            Estimation  tab, on the  Revenue Budget  tab of         the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) Change Orders form, the system also creates a revenue         budget line with the  Amount  value equal to the markup amount of this         markup line. Otherwise, the markup amount is added to the existing revenue budget line         created based on the estimation line. When the change request whose cost and commitment part and revenue part have been linked to         one or two change orders (depending on whether the cost and commitment part and the revenue         part are processed jointly or separately), the system assigns the  Closed  status to         the change request. For information on further processing of change orders, see  Managing Changes in Projects: General Information. With the two-tier change management, you can also         create change order lines that do not originate from change requests. Workflow of Processing a Change Request The following diagram illustrates the workflow of processing a change request. Configuring of Change Order Classes A change order class defines which project data—the revenue budget, the cost budget, or         commitments—can be adjusted with a change order of this class. The two-tier change         management is controlled at the level of a change order class. If the  2-Tier           Change Management  check box is selected for a particular class on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM203000|PM203000]) Change Order Classes (PM203000) form, change orders of the selected         class support two-tier change management and can include change requests. If a change order class has the  Revenue Budget  check box cleared and         the  Cost Budget  and  Commitments  check box         selected on the  Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM203000|PM203000]) Change Order Classes form, change orders of this class are classified as            cost change orders  for change requests. If a change order class has the  Revenue Budget ,  Cost           Budget , and  Commitments  check box selected on the            Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM203000|PM203000]) Change Order Classes         form, change orders of this class are treated as  revenue change orders . ]]></column>

==Inventory and Order Management Settings Checklist==
If you want to use the functionality of change requests to manage changes in commitments, make sure that all the needed features have been enabled and settings have been specified, as described in [HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Commitments_Implem_Checklist|Processing Commitments: Implementation Checklist].
==Other Settings That Affect the Workflow==
You can affect the workflow of managing changes in projects by specifying additional settings as follows:[anchor|#_52406023-d3e0-4063-a060-735d623b3e9d]
*To change the format of change request identifiers, adjust the ''CHANGERST'' numbering sequence on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_10_10|Numbering Sequences] ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) form or create a new numbering sequence and select this sequence in the '''Change Request Numbering Sequence''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''Numbering Sequence''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form. For more information on numbering sequences, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Multiple_Numbering_Sequences|Numbering Sequence Usage].
*:By default, the ''CHANGERST'' numbering sequence specifies that the change request identifier is an automatically generated numeric string of six digits, such as ''000001''.
*To make it possible to create a change order for a change request selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_85_00|Change Requests] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308500|PM308500]) form, select the change order class that supports the two-tier change management in the '''Default Change Order Class''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''General Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] form. That is, the selected change order class must have the '''2-Tier Change Management''' check box selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_30_00|Change Order Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM203000|PM203000]) form.
*:((({S:Warn}Even if the default change order class selected in the project accounting preferences does not support the two-tier change management, you still can add a change request to a change order by creating a change order directly on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) form, selecting for this change order a change order class that supports the two-tier change management, and adding the change request to the change order.
)))
*To cause the system to automatically select a revenue account group for new estimation lines of a change request if there are multiple account groups of the ''Income'' type defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_10_00|Account Groups] ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) form, specify the '''Default Revenue Account Group''' for account groups of the ''Expense'' type in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_10_00|Account Groups] form. For more information on account groups, see [HelpRoot_Projects\Account_Groups_GeneralInfo|Account Groups: General Information].
*To cause the system to automatically select the '''Creates Commitment''' check box for a new estimation line with a particular account group selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_85_00|Change Requests] form, which results in creation of a commitment based on such an estimation line, select the '''Creates Commitment''' check box on the '''Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_10_00|Account Groups] form for this account group. For example, it can be an account group to which you map the expense accounts of the services that a subcontractor usually provides.

With these settings specified, users in your company can process change requests quickly and accurately with a minimum of manual actions.
==Validation of Configuration==
To make sure that all configuration has been performed correctly, we recommend that you process a change request by performing instructions similar to those described in [HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Two_Tier_Change_Management_Process_Activity|Processing Change Requests: Process Activity].]]></column>

))){br}{TOC}
==Story==
Suppose that you, as the project accountant of the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company, need to configure the two-tier change management in the system to be able to process change requests to projects. You need to enable the corresponding feature and create two following change order classes that support the two-tier change management: one that cannot affect the revenue and another that can. Also, you need to configure the default price markup of 25% to be applied to each individual change made with a change request and the following default markups to be applied to an entire change request:[anchor|#_eee724bf-649e-4094-b236-577c9f17d980]
*8% of the profit
*4% of overhead
*5% of all the previously charged markups
*A flat fee of $100 per each change request

==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, the following features have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form:[anchor|#_4387db18-6b29-4015-8d96-56b9069f20d7]
*''Project Accounting'', which provides support for the project accounting functionality
*''Change Orders'', which gives you the ability to manage changes to the project’s budgeted and committed values

==Process Overview==
You will enable the ''Change Requests'' feature on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. You will then configure the default price markups on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form. You will also create change order classes that support the two-tier change management on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_30_00|Change Order Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM203000|PM203000]) form.
==System Preparation==
To sign in to the system, launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the U100 dataset preloaded as Pam Brawner by using the ''brawner'' username and the ''123'' password.
==Step 1: Enabling the Two-Tier Change Management==
Perform the following instructions to enable the feature that provides the functionality of the two-tire change management:[anchor|#_4061e952-90ae-4b9a-bae5-b69cc8ff0bf3]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, and on the form toolbar, click '''Modify'''.
#In the '''Projects''' group of features, select the '''Change Requests''' check box to enable the ''Change Requests'' feature, which gives you the ability to set up the two-tier change management.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Enable'''.

==Step 2: Configuring Default Markups==
To specify the default markups that the system will assign to change requests, do the following:[anchor|#_8099f574-c339-485c-8984-c23d77f93f04]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form, on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''Markups''' section), enter <tt>25.00</tt> in the '''Default Price Markup, %''' box.
#In the '''Document Markups''' table, add four rows with the settings shown in the following table; these are the default document-level markups that are applied to the total amount of change requests.
#:{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="25%" ! '''Type'''
!width="50%" !  '''Description'''
!width="25%" !  '''Value'''
|- 
|  ''%''
| <tt>Profit</tt>
| <tt>8.00</tt>
|- 
| ''%''
| <tt>Overhead</tt>
| <tt>4.00</tt>
|- 
| ''Cumulative %''
| <tt>Default cumulative %</tt>
| <tt>5.00</tt>
|- 
| ''Flat Fee''
| <tt>Additional charges</tt>
| <tt>100.00</tt>
|}
#Save your changes to the project accounting preferences.

==Step 3: Creating Change Order Classes==
Perform the following instructions to create change order classes that support two-tier change management:[anchor|#_4d8e6841-79e9-4307-ba32-afaaff8c8c03]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_30_00|Change Order Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM203000|PM203000]) form, click '''Add New Record''' on the form toolbar to create a cost change order class that cannot affect the project revenue, and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Class ID''': <tt>INTERNAL</tt>
#*'''Description''': <tt>Cost change orders</tt>
#*'''2-tier Change Management''': Selected
#On the '''Details''' tab, clear the '''Revenue Budget''' check box.
#:Because you have selected the '''2-tier Change Management''' check box, the '''Cost Budget''' and '''Commitments''' check boxes are selected and unavailable to be cleared.
#Save the change order class.
#Click '''Add New Record''' on the form toolbar to create one more change order class that can affect the project revenue, and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Class ID''': <tt>EXTERNAL</tt>
#*'''Description''': <tt>Revenue change orders</tt>
#*'''2-tier Change Management''': Selected
#*:Again, notice that on the '''Details''' tab, all of the check boxes are selected. The '''Cost Budget''' and '''Commitments''' check boxes are unavailable to be cleared; you will leave the '''Revenue Budget''' check box selected.
#Save the change order class.

You have enabled and configured the two-tier change management and can create change request for projects with the change order workflow turned on.

Also,                 you need to configure the default price markup of 25% to be applied to each                 individual change made with a change request and the following default markups to be                 applied to an entire change request: 8% of the profit 4% of overhead 5% of all the previously charged markups A flat fee of $100 per each change request Configuration Overview For the purposes of this activity, the following features have been enabled on the                       ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form: Project Accounting , which provides support for the project accounting                     functionality Change Orders , which gives you the ability to manage changes to the                     project’s budgeted and committed values Process Overview You will enable the  Change Requests  feature on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. You will then configure the default                 price markups on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form. You will also                 create change order classes that support the two-tier change management on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM203000|PM203000]) Change Order Classes (PM203000) form. System Preparation To sign in to the system, launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the U100 dataset preloaded as Pam Brawner                 by using the  brawner  username and the  123  password. Step 1: Enabling the Two-Tier Change Management Perform the following instructions to enable the feature that provides the                 functionality of the two-tire change management: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, and on the form                     toolbar, click  Modify . In the  Projects  group of features, select the                          Change Requests  check box to enable the  Change                         Requests  feature, which gives you the ability to set up the two-tier                     change management. On the form toolbar, click  Enable . Step 2: Configuring Default Markups To specify the default markups that the system will assign to change requests, do the                 following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form, on the                          General Settings  tab ( Markups                      section), enter  25.00  in the  Default Price                         Markup, %  box. In the  Document Markups  table, add four rows with the                     settings shown in the following table; these are the default document-level                     markups that are applied to the total amount of change requests. Type Description Value % Profit 8.00 % Overhead 4.00 Cumulative % Default cumulative % 5.00 Flat Fee Additional charges 100.00 Save your changes to the project accounting preferences. Step 3: Creating Change Order Classes Perform the following instructions to create change order classes that support                 two-tier change management: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM203000|PM203000]) Change Order Classes (PM203000) form, click  Add New                         Record  on the form toolbar to create a cost change order class                     that cannot affect the project revenue, and specify the following settings in                     the Summary area: Class ID :  INTERNAL Description :  Cost change                                 orders 2-tier Change Management : Selected On the  Details  tab, clear the  Revenue                         Budget  check box. Because you have selected the                              2-tier Change Management  check box, the                              Cost Budget  and                              Commitments  check boxes are selected and                         unavailable to be cleared. Save the change order class. Click  Add New Record  on the form toolbar to create one                     more change order class that can affect the project revenue, and specify the                     following settings in the Summary area: Class ID :  EXTERNAL Description :  Revenue change                                 orders 2-tier Change Management : Selected Again,                                 notice that on the  Details  tab, all of the                                 check boxes are selected. The  Cost Budget  and                                      Commitments  check boxes are unavailable                                 to be cleared; you will leave the  Revenue                                     Budget  check box selected. Save the change order class. You have enabled and configured the two-tier change management and can create change                 request for projects with the change order workflow turned on. To review how to                 process change requests, complete the  Processing Change Requests: Process Activity. ]]></column>

==Story==
Suppose that the West BBQ Restaurant customer has ordered a juicer, along with the following services from the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company: two hours of site review, four hours of installation, and eight hours of employee training on operating the juicers. The SweetLife company has contracted the Squeezo Inc. vendor to provide the juicer and perform the installation while SweetLife will perform the services of site review and training.{br}

Acting as SweetLife&rsquo;s project accountant, you will create a project. SweetLife&rsquo;s consultant will provide the service of site review and you will then realize that the following adjustments to the project should be agreed upon with the customer: the site review, which has taken an additional hour beyond what was planned, has shown that the installation of the juicer will take two hours beyond the planned time frame. The customer will then ask you for an additional staff person to be trained, so the training will take two additional hours.{br}

You will make the needed corrections to the project budget by using change requests.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, the following features have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form:[anchor|#_4387db18-6b29-4015-8d96-56b9069f20d7]
*''Project Accounting'', which provides support for the project accounting functionality
*''Change Orders'', which gives you the ability to manage changes to the project’s budgeted and committed values
*''Change Requests'', which gives you the ability to processing change requests

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form, the default markups have been configured.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_30_00|Change Order Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM203000|PM203000]) form, the ''INTERNAL'' and ''EXTERNAL'' change order classes have been configured for processing cost change orders and revenue change orders, respectively.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, the ''SITEREVIEW'', ''INSTALL'', and ''TRAINING'' non-stock items have been defined.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, the ''JUICER15'' stock item has been defined.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form, the ''SQUEEZO'' vendor has been created.
==Process Overview==
In this activity, you will create the project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form and specify the document-level markups for it. To make changes to the project budget, you will create change requests on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_85_00|Change Requests] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308500|PM308500]) form. When an agreement has been reached with the customer about the changes, you will add open change requests to two change orders on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) form; you will release the change orders.
==System Preparation==
To sign in to the system and prepare to perform the instructions of the activity, do the following:[anchor|#_5e4e87f1-6fe1-4688-b21b-a3ae5c8f4117]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website and sign in as Pam Brawner using the ''brawner'' username and ''123'' password.[anchor|#_1d4da622-e29e-4504-90c3-d0d8a439727b]
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select ''1/30/2020'' on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form, on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''General Settings''' section), select the '''Internal Cost Commitment Tracking''' check box to expose commitments and committed values in the project budget; save your changes to the project accounting preferences.

==Step 1: Creating a Project==
To create a project and define the project-specific document markups, do the following:[anchor|#_de8b7925-a170-40ef-91d6-1d90afb86754]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, click '''Add New Record''' on the form toolbar to create a new project, and specify the following settings in the Summary area: 
#*'''Project ID''': <tt>WESTBBQ3</tt>
#*'''Customer''': ''WESTBBQ''
#* '''Description''': <tt>A juicer with the installation and training for employees</tt>
#:On the '''Summary''' tab ('''Project Properties''' section), notice that the '''Change Order Workflow''' check box is selected by default, which means you can make changes to the project budget with change orders, including the creation of change requests. Leave the check box selected.
#On the '''Tasks''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar and specify the following settings in the row:
#*'''Task ID''': <tt>INSTALL</tt>
#*'''Description''': <tt>A juicer with the installation and training</tt>
#*'''Status''': ''Active''
#* '''Default''': Selected
#On the '''Revenue Budget''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar and enter <tt>3,400.00</tt> in the '''Project Task''' column. The system has automatically selected the ''ISNTALL'' project task in the row as it is the default project task.
#On the '''Cost Budget''' tab, add four budget lines (by clicking '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar) with the settings shown in the following table.
#:{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="33%" ! '''Inventory ID'''
!width="33%" !  '''Original Budgeted Quantity'''
!width="33%" !  '''Unit Rate'''
|- 
|  ''SITEREVIEW''
| <tt>2.00</tt>
| <tt>40.00</tt>
|- 
| ''JUICER15''
| <tt>1.00</tt>
| <tt>2,000.00</tt>
|- 
| ''INSTALL''
| <tt>4.00</tt>
| <tt>80.00</tt>
|- 
| ''TRAINING''
| <tt>8.00</tt>
| <tt>40.00</tt>
|}
#On the '''Settings''' tab, in the '''Document Markups''' table, notice that the system has copied the document markups from the project accounting preferences.
#For each markup in the table, select ''INSTALL'' in the '''Project Task''' column and ''REVENUE'' in the '''Account Group''' column.
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box.
#:The system assigns the project the ''Active'' status.
#Save the project.

==Step 2: Creating a Change Request==
To make changes to the project budget with a change request, do the following:[anchor|#_58b4a4d9-2258-43b5-872f-9de34a1d2fe8]
#While remaining on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form with the ''WESTBBQ3'' project opened, on the form toolbar, click '''Create Change Request'''.
#:The system creates a change request for the project and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_85_00|Change Requests] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308500|PM308500]) form.
#In the Summary area of this form, enter <tt>Additional time for site review and installation</tt> as the '''Description'''.
#:On the '''Markups''' tab, notice that the system has copied the document markups from the project to the change request with all the settings you have specified at the project level.
#On the '''Estimation''' tab, to represent an additional hour of site review, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the row:
#*'''Account Group''': ''LABOR''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''SITEREVIEW''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>1.00</tt>
#*'''Line Markup (%)''': <tt>10.00</tt>
#:Notice that the system has filled in the '''Price Markup (%)''' column with the default price markup specified in the project accounting preferences. The '''Unit Price''' is calculated as the '''Unit Cost''' plus the price markup ($40&#42;1.25), and the '''Line Amount''', which is $55, is calculated as the '''Ext. Price''' plus the line markup ($50&#42;1.1).
#Add one more line to represent the two additional hours needed for the installation by clicking '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar and specifying the following settings in the row:
#*'''Account Group''': ''SUBCON''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''INSTALL''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>2.00</tt>
#*'''Line Markup (%)''': <tt>10.00</tt>
#*'''Vendor''': ''SQUEEZO''
#* '''Create Commitment''': Selected
#:The line amount of the added row should be equal to $220.
#:You have selected the '''Create Commitment''' check box because you have contracted Squeezo Inc. to perform the installation. By creating a commitment, you will make the system to create a purchase order for this change.
#On the '''Markups''' tab, review the markup amounts that the system has calculated based on the document totals.
#:The system calculated the ''Profit'' and ''Overhead'' markups ($22 and $11, respectively) based on the line total of the change request, which is shown in the '''Amount Subject to Markup''' column and is equal to $275.
#:The ''Default cumulative %'' markup is calculated based on the markups of the ''%'' type calculated above the markup line ($22 + $11) and is equal to $1.65.
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box.
#:The system has assigned the change request the ''Open'' status.
#Save the change request.

==Step 3: Creating the Second Change Request==
To create one more change request for additional two hours of training, do the following:[anchor|#_af369c73-0e35-475a-a2b8-aec44270dce2]
#While remaining on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_85_00|Change Requests] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308500|PM308500]) form, click '''Add New Record''' on the form toolbar, and specify the following settings in the Summary area of the form:
#*'''Project''': ''WESTBBQ3''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Additional time for training</tt>
#On the '''Estimation''' tab, to represent two additional hours of training, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the row:
#*'''Account Group''': ''LABOR''
#* '''Inventory ID''': ''TRAINING''
#* '''Quantity''': <tt>2.00</tt>
#*'''Line Markup (%)''': <tt>10.00</tt>
#:The line amount of the added row should be equal to $110.
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box.
#:The system has assigned the change request the ''Open'' status.
#Save the change request.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, select the ''WESTBBQ3'' project in the Summary area, and review the change-related data of the project as follows:
#*On the '''Change Requests''' tab, notice that both of the related change requests have the ''Open'' status (see the screenshot below).
#*On the '''Cost Budget''' tab, review the values in the '''Potential CO Quantity''' and '''Potential CO Amount''' columns, which the system has filled in based on the estimation lines of the open change requests for the rows with the ''SITEREVIEW'', ''TRAINING'', and ''INSTALL'' inventory items.
#*On the '''Revenue Budget''' tab, review the values in the '''Potential CO Amount''' column, which is $633.51. Notice that this amount equals to the total price of both change requests ($409.65+$223.86) and includes markup totals calculated at the document level.[anchor|#_1e5e27e9-66cd-440a-99ea-a7c8719cf639][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_Two_Tier_Change_Management.png|popup|Change requests related to the project|400px]

==Step 4: Adding a Change Request to a Cost Change Order==
To create a cost change order based on the first change request you created, do the following:[anchor|#_3b993c67-0753-4b4b-b208-590e4b2fca35]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) form, click '''Add New Record''' on the form toolbar, and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Project''': ''WESTBBQ3''
#* '''Description''': <tt>An adjustment to the WESTBBQ3 project</tt>
#:Notice that the system has inserted the ''DEFAULT'' class for the change order. This is the default change order class specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form.
#Select ''INTERNAL'' as the '''Class'''.
#:Notice that the '''Change Requests''' tab has appeared on the form, and the '''Revenue Budget''' tab has been hidden based on the settings of the selected class.
#On the table toolbar of the '''Change Requests''' tab, click '''Select Change Requests''' to add a change request to the change order.
#In the '''Select Change Requests''' dialog box, which opens, select the change request with the ''Additional time for site review and installation'' description by selecting the check box in the unlabeled column, and click '''Add Change Requests & Close'''.
#:The system adds the selected change request to the change order and closes the dialog box. Notice that the added change request still has the ''Open'' status because the revenue part of the change request has not been processed yet.
#:On the '''Cost Budget''' tab, notice that the system has added two lines based on the estimation lines of the change request. 
#:On the '''Commitments''' tab, notice that the system has added a line for the installation service based on the estimation line of the change request with the '''Create Commitment''' check box selected.
#:In the Summary area, notice that the '''Revenue Budget Change Total''' value is zero. The system has not specified the '''Revenue Change Nbr.''' for the change order because the change order makes no changes to the revenue budget of the project.
#Clear the '''Hold''' check box.
#:The system has assigned the change order the ''Open'' status.
#Save the change order.

==Step 5: Adding Change Requests to a Revenue Change Orders==
Suppose that the agreement with the customer has been reached. To create a revenue change order based on both change requests, do the following:[anchor|#_23408a66-e766-421d-a5b0-4673aceebf93]
#While remaining on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) form, click '''Add New Record''' on the form toolbar, and specify the following settings in the Summary area:
#*'''Project''': ''WESTBBQ3''
#* '''Description''': <tt>The second adjustment to the WESTBBQ3 project</tt>
#*'''Class''': ''EXTERNAL''
#*:Notice that the '''Change Requests''' tab has appeared on the form and the '''Revenue Budget''' tab remains visible based on the settings of the selected class.
#On the table toolbar of the '''Change Requests''' tab, click '''Select Change Requests''' to add change requests to the change order.
#In the '''Select Change Requests''' dialog box, which opens, select both change requests you have created by selecting the check boxes in the unlabeled column; click '''Add Change Requests & Close'''.
#:The system adds the selected change requests to the change order and closes the dialog box. Notice that both change requests have been assigned the ''Closed'' status because the change requests have been fully processed with the change order.
#On the '''Revenue Budget''' tab, do the following to review the line that the system has created based on the estimation lines of the change requests:
##Click the line.
##On the table toolbar, click '''View Change Request Details'''.
##In the '''Change Request Details''' dialog box, which opens, review the change request lines and the markups that correspond to the selected change order line. There are three estimation lines and eight markup lines that affect the same revenue budget line.
##Close the dialog box.
#:In the Summary area, notice the system has assigned the '''Revenue Change Nbr.''' to the change order because the change order makes changes to the revenue budget of the project.
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box.
#:The system has assigned the change order the ''Open'' status.
#Save the change order.

==Step 6: Reviewing the Project and Change Requests==
To review the project and the related change requests you have processed, do the following:
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''WESTBBQ3'' project.
#On the '''Change Requests''' tab, notice that both change requests have been assigned the ''Closed'' status.
#In the line with the ''Additional time for site review and installation'' description, click the link in the '''Reference Nbr.''' column to open the first change request.
#:On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_85_00|Change Requests] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308500|PM308500]) form, which the system opens in a pop-up window, review the change request. In the Summary area, notice that change request has both the '''Change Order Nbr.''' box and the '''Cost Change Order Nbr.''' box filled in because the revenue part of the change request has been processed with a separate change order, whose reference number is shown in the '''Change Order Nbr.''' box.
#Close the pop-up window.
#In the line with the ''Additional time for training'' description, click the link in the '''Reference Nbr.''' column to open the second change request.
#:On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_85_00|Change Requests] form, which opens in a pop-up window, review the change request. In the Summary area, notice that change request has only the '''Change Order Nbr.''' box filled in (the '''Cost Change Order Nbr.''' box is hidden) because both the revenue part and the cost part of the change request have been processed with a single change order.
#Close the pop-up window.
#:On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form (to which you return), on the '''Cost Budget''' and '''Revenue Budget''' tabs, notice that the potential change order quantities and amounts remain the same after you have created open change orders based on the change requests.

==Step 7: Releasing the Change Orders==
To release the change orders, do the following:[anchor|#_5d901975-2bb7-4b54-84dc-81e8022587fc]
#While still reviewing the project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, on the '''Change Orders''' tab, open and release each created order by doing the following:
##Click the link in the '''Reference Nbr.''' column to open the change order.
##On the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) form, which opens in a pop-up window, click '''Release'''.
##Close the pop-up window with the form.
#On the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form (to which you return), click '''Cancel''' to refresh the project data.
#:When you normally click '''Cancel''', the system negates all unsaved changes you have made to the project. In your case, you have made no changes to the project on this tab so nothing is negated. The system just refreshes the project data that has been changed by means of the released change orders.
#:On the '''Change Orders''' tab, notice that both change orders have been assigned the ''Closed'' status.
#:On the '''Cost Budget''' and '''Revenue Budget''' tabs, notice that potential change order quantities and amounts have been moved to the budgeted change order quantities and amounts, which have resulted in an increase of the revised budgeted quantities and amounts.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Processing Change Requests: Process Activity In this activity, you will learn how you can turn on the change order workflow for a                 project and manage changes to the project’s budgeted values by creating change                 requests and including these change requests to change orders. Before you start completing this activity, perform the instructions of  Processing Change Requests: Implementation Activity to enable the                 two-tier change management and configure the system. The following activity is             based on the  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system             settings have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the             activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100              dataset to its initial state. Story Suppose that the West BBQ Restaurant customer has ordered a juicer, along with the                 following services from the  SweetLife Fruits & Jams company: two hours of site review, four hours of installation, and eight hours of                 employee training on operating the juicers. The  SweetLife company has contracted the Squeezo Inc. vendor to provide the juicer and perform                 the installation while  SweetLife will perform the services of site review and training. Acting as  SweetLife's project accountant, you will create a project.  SweetLife's consultant will provide the service of site review and you will then realize                 that the following adjustments to the project should be agreed upon with the                 customer: the site review, which has taken an additional hour beyond what was                 planned, has shown that the installation of the juicer will take two hours beyond                 the planned time frame. The customer will then ask you for an additional staff                 person to be trained, so the training will take two additional hours. You will make the needed corrections to the project budget by using change                 requests. Configuration Overview For the purposes of this activity, the following features have been enabled on the                       ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form: Project Accounting , which provides support for the project accounting                     functionality Change Orders , which gives you the ability to manage changes to the                     project’s budgeted and committed values Change Requests , which gives you the ability to processing change                     requests On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form, the default markups have been                 configured. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM203000|PM203000]) Change Order Classes (PM203000) form, the  INTERNAL  and                      EXTERNAL  change order classes have been configured for processing cost                 change orders and revenue change orders, respectively. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form, the  SITEREVIEW ,                      INSTALL , and  TRAINING  non-stock items have been defined. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form, the  JUICER15  stock                 item has been defined. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors (AP303000) form, the  SQUEEZO  vendor has                 been created. Process Overview In this activity, you will create the project on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects                 (PM301000) form and specify the document-level markups for it. To make changes to                 the project budget, you will create change requests on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308500|PM308500]) Change Requests (PM308500) form. When an agreement has been reached                 with the customer about the changes, you will add open change requests to two change                 orders on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) Change Orders (PM308000) form; you will release the                 change orders. System Preparation To sign in to the system and prepare to perform the instructions of the activity, do                 the following: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website and sign in as Pam Brawner using the  brawner  username and                          123  password. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP             screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to  1/30/2020. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and             select  1/30/2020 on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and             process all documents in the system during this business date. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form, on the                          General Settings  tab ( General                         Settings  section), select the  Internal Cost                         Commitment Tracking  check box to expose commitments and                     committed values in the project budget; save your changes to the project                     accounting preferences. Step 1: Creating a Project To create a project and define the project-specific document markups, do the                 following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, click  Add New                         Record  on the form toolbar to create a new project, and specify                     the following settings in the Summary area:  Project ID :  WESTBBQ3 Customer :  WESTBBQ Description :  A juicer with the                                 installation and training for employees On the  Summary  tab ( Project                             Properties  section), notice that the  Change Order                             Workflow  check box is selected by default, which means you                         can make changes to the project budget with change orders, including the                         creation of change requests. Leave the check box selected. On the  Tasks  tab, click  Add Row  on                     the table toolbar and specify the following settings in the row: Task ID :  INSTALL Description :  A juicer with the                                 installation and training Status :  Active Default : Selected On the  Revenue Budget  tab, click  Add                         Row  on the table toolbar and enter                          3,400.00  in the  Project Task                      column. The system has automatically selected the  ISNTALL  project task in                     the row as it is the default project task. On the  Cost Budget  tab, add four budget lines (by                     clicking  Add Row  on the table toolbar) with the settings                     shown in the following table. Inventory ID Original Budgeted Quantity Unit Rate SITEREVIEW 2.00 40.00 JUICER15 1.00 2,000.00 INSTALL 4.00 80.00 TRAINING 8.00 40.00 On the  Settings  tab, in the  Document                         Markups  table, notice that the system has copied the document                     markups from the project accounting preferences. For each markup in the table, select  INSTALL  in the  Project                         Task  column and  REVENUE  in the  Account                         Group  column. In the Summary area, clear the  Hold  check box. The                         system assigns the project the  Active  status. Save the project. Step 2: Creating a Change Request To make changes to the project budget with a change request, do the following: While remaining on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM308000) form with the                          WESTBBQ3  project opened, on the form toolbar, click  Create                         Change Request . The system creates a change request for the                         project and opens it on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308500|PM308500]) Change Requests (PM308500)                         form. In the Summary area of this form, enter  Additional time for site                         review and installation  as the                          Description . On the  Markups                          tab, notice that the system has copied the document markups from the project                         to the change request with all the settings you have specified at the                         project level. On the  Estimation  tab, to represent an additional hour of                     site review, click  Add Row  on the table toolbar, and                     specify the following settings in the row: Account Group :  LABOR Inventory ID :  SITEREVIEW Quantity :  1.00 Line Markup (%) :                              10.00 Notice that the system has filled in the  Price Markup                             (%)  column with the default price markup specified in the                         project accounting preferences. The  Unit Price  is                         calculated as the  Unit Cost  plus the price markup                         ($40*1.25), and the  Line Amount , which is $55, is                         calculated as the  Ext. Price  plus the line markup                         ($50*1.1). Add one more line to represent the two additional hours needed for the                     installation by clicking  Add Row  on the table toolbar and                     specifying the following settings in the row: Account Group :  SUBCON Inventory ID :  INSTALL Quantity :  2.00 Line Markup (%) :                              10.00 Vendor :  SQUEEZO Create Commitment : Selected The line amount of the added row should be equal to $220. You have                         selected the  Create Commitment  check box because you                         have contracted Squeezo Inc. to perform the installation. By creating a                         commitment, you will make the system to create a purchase order for this                         change. On the  Markups  tab, review the markup amounts that the                     system has calculated based on the document totals. The system calculated the                              Profit  and  Overhead  markups ($22 and $11, respectively)                         based on the line total of the change request, which is shown in the                              Amount Subject to Markup  column and is equal to                         $275. The  Default cumulative %  markup is calculated based on                         the markups of the  %  type calculated above the markup line ($22 +                         $11) and is equal to $1.65. In the Summary area, clear the  Hold  check box. The                         system has assigned the change request the  Open  status. Save the change request. Step 3: Creating the Second Change Request To create one more change request for additional two hours of training, do the                 following: While remaining on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308500|PM308500]) Change Requests (PM308500) form, click                          Add New Record  on the form toolbar, and specify the                     following settings in the Summary area of the form: Project :  WESTBBQ3 Description :  Additional time for                                 training On the  Estimation  tab, to represent two additional hours                     of training, click  Add Row  on the table toolbar, and                     specify the following settings in the row: Account Group :  LABOR Inventory ID :  TRAINING Quantity :  2.00 Line Markup (%) :                              10.00 The line amount of the added row should be equal to $110. In the Summary area, clear the  Hold  check box. The                         system has assigned the change request the  Open  status. Save the change request. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM308000) form, select the                          WESTBBQ3  project in the Summary area, and review the change-related                     data of the project as follows: On the  Change Requests  tab, notice that both of                             the related change requests have the  Open  status (see the                             screenshot below). On the  Cost Budget  tab, review the values in the                                  Potential CO Quantity  and                                  Potential CO Amount  columns, which the system                             has filled in based on the estimation lines of the open change requests                             for the rows with the  SITEREVIEW ,  TRAINING , and                                  INSTALL  inventory items. On the  Revenue Budget  tab, review the values in                             the  Potential CO Amount  column, which is $633.51.                             Notice that this amount equals to the total price of both change                             requests ($409.65+$223.86) and includes markup totals calculated at the                             document level. Change requests related to the project Step 4: Adding a Change Request to a Cost Change Order To create a cost change order based on the first change request you created, do the                 following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) Change Orders (PM308000) form, click  Add New                         Record  on the form toolbar, and specify the following settings                     in the Summary area: Project :  WESTBBQ3 Description :  An adjustment to the                                 WESTBBQ3 project Notice that the system has inserted the  DEFAULT  class for the                         change order. This is the default change order class specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form. Select  INTERNAL  as the  Class . Notice that the                              Change Requests  tab has appeared on the form, and                         the  Revenue Budget  tab has been hidden based on the                         settings of the selected class. On the table toolbar of the  Change Requests  tab, click                          Select Change Requests  to add a change request to the                     change order. In the  Select Change Requests  dialog box, which opens,                     select the change request with the  Additional time for site review and                         installation  description by selecting the check box in the unlabeled                     column, and click  Add Change Requests & Close . The                         system adds the selected change request to the change order and closes the                         dialog box. Notice that the added change request still has the  Open                          status because the revenue part of the change request has not been processed                         yet. On the  Cost Budget  tab, notice that the                         system has added two lines based on the estimation lines of the change                         request.  On the  Commitments  tab, notice that                         the system has added a line for the installation service based on the                         estimation line of the change request with the  Create                             Commitment  check box selected. In the Summary area,                         notice that the  Revenue Budget Change Total  value is                         zero. The system has not specified the   Revenue Change                             Nbr.  for the change order because the change order makes no                         changes to the revenue budget of the project. Clear the  Hold  check box. The system has assigned the                         change order the  Open  status. Save the change order. Step 5: Adding Change Requests to a Revenue Change Orders Suppose that the agreement with the customer has been reached. To create a revenue                 change order based on both change requests, do the following: While remaining on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) Change Orders (PM308000) form, click                          Add New Record  on the form toolbar, and specify the                     following settings in the Summary area: Project :  WESTBBQ3 Description :  The second adjustment to                                 the WESTBBQ3 project Class :  EXTERNAL Notice that the                                      Change Requests  tab has appeared on the                                 form and the  Revenue Budget  tab remains                                 visible based on the settings of the selected class. On the table toolbar of the  Change Requests  tab, click                          Select Change Requests  to add change requests to the                     change order. In the  Select Change Requests  dialog box, which opens,                     select both change requests you have created by selecting the check boxes in the                     unlabeled column; click  Add Change Requests &                         Close . The system adds the selected change requests to the                         change order and closes the dialog box. Notice that both change requests                         have been assigned the  Closed  status because the change requests have                         been fully processed with the change order. On the  Revenue Budget  tab, do the following to review the                     line that the system has created based on the estimation lines of the change                         requests: Click the line. On the table toolbar, click  View Change Request                                 Details . In the  Change Request Details  dialog box, which                             opens, review the change request lines and the markups that correspond                             to the selected change order line. There are three estimation lines and                             eight markup lines that affect the same revenue budget line. Close the dialog box. In the Summary area, notice the system has assigned the                              Revenue Change Nbr.  to the change order because                         the change order makes changes to the revenue budget of the                     project. In the Summary area, clear the  Hold  check box. The                         system has assigned the change order the  Open  status. Save the change order. Step 6: Reviewing the Project and Change Requests To review the project and the related change requests you have processed, do the                 following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM308000) form, open the  WESTBBQ3                      project. On the  Change Requests  tab, notice that both change                     requests have been assigned the  Closed  status. In the line with the  Additional time for site review and installation                      description, click the link in the  Reference Nbr.  column                     to open the first change request. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308500|PM308500]) Change Requests                         (PM308500) form, which the system opens in a pop-up window, review the                         change request. In the Summary area, notice that change request has both the                              Change Order Nbr.  box and the  Cost                             Change Order Nbr.  box filled in because the revenue part of                         the change request has been processed with a separate change order, whose                         reference number is shown in the  Change Order Nbr.                          box. Close the pop-up window. In the line with the  Additional time for training  description, click the                     link in the  Reference Nbr.  column to open the second                     change request. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308500|PM308500]) Change Requests form, which opens in a                         pop-up window, review the change request. In the Summary area, notice that                         change request has only the  Change Order Nbr.  box                         filled in (the  Cost Change Order Nbr.  box is hidden)                         because both the revenue part and the cost part of the change request have                         been processed with a single change order. Close the pop-up window. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form (to which                         you return), on the  Cost Budget  and                              Revenue Budget  tabs, notice that the potential                         change order quantities and amounts remain the same after you have created                         open change orders based on the change requests. Step 7: Releasing the Change Orders To release the change orders, do the following: While still reviewing the project on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects                     (PM308000) form, on the  Change Orders  tab, open and                     release each created order by doing the following: Click the link in the  Reference Nbr.  column to                             open the change order. On the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) Change Orders (PM308000)                             form, which opens in a pop-up window, click                                  Release . Close the pop-up window with the form. On the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form (to which you                     return), click  Cancel  to refresh the project data. When                         you normally click  Cancel , the system negates all                         unsaved changes you have made to the project. In your case, you have made no                         changes to the project on this tab so nothing is negated. The system just                         refreshes the project data that has been changed by means of the released                         change orders. On the  Change Orders  tab, notice                         that both change orders have been assigned the  Closed                          status. On the  Cost Budget  and                              Revenue Budget  tabs, notice that potential change                         order quantities and amounts have been moved to the budgeted change order                         quantities and amounts, which have resulted in an increase of the revised                         budgeted quantities and amounts. ]]></column>

You can configure markups to charge the customer with each created change request. The following types of markup can be applied to a change request on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_85_00|Change Requests] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308500|PM308500]) form:[anchor|#_85dd3f3a-6d3d-45dd-9d8b-3af48d444b6b]
*Line-level markups: These markups apply to an individual estimation line on the '''Estimation''' tab.
*Document-level markups: These markups apply to the total line amount of the change request on the '''Markups''' tab.

You can override all markups and delete document-level markups at the change request level.
==Line-Level Markups==
A price markup is an item-specific markup. When you select an inventory item in an estimation line on the '''Estimation''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_85_00|Change Requests] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308500|PM308500]) form, the markup percent specified for the item is retrieved as the '''Price Markup (%)''' value. You can specify the price markup for the item on the '''Price/Cost Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form or on the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. If no price markup is specified for the item, the system uses the default price markup specified in the '''Default Price Markup, %''' box ('''Markup''' section) on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form. If no default price markup is specified in the project accounting preferences, the price markup of the estimation line is zero.{br}

A line markup is defined at the account group level. When you select an account group in an estimation line in the '''Account Group''' column on the '''Estimation''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_85_00|Change Requests] form, the default markup specified for the account group is retrieved as the '''Line Markup (%)''' value. You can specify the default line markup for the account group on the '''Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_10_00|Account Groups] ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) form. If no default markup is specified in the account group, the line markup of the estimation line is zero.{br}

The line amount of an estimation line considers the line-level markups and is calculated as follows:{br}

{{'''Unit Price''' = '''Unit Price''' + '''Unit Price''' * '''Price Markup (%)''' / <i>100<i>}}{br}

{{ '''Ext. Price''' = '''Quantity''' * '''Unit Price'''}}{br}

{{ '''Line Amount''' = '''Ext. Price''' + '''Ext. Price''' * '''Line Markup (%)''' / <i>100<i>}}
==Document-Level Markups==
A document-level markup applies to the total line amount of a change request. On the '''Markups''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_85_00|Change Requests] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308500|PM308500]) form, for a change request, you can define one or several document-level markups of the following types as well as define no markups:[anchor|#_fceb394e-b3c5-479a-bbeb-9fd1bc9f8c3f]
*''%'': A markup whose amount is calculated as follows:
*:{{Markup Amount = '''Line Total''' * <i>% Markup Value<i> / <i>100<i>}}
*:You can define as many markups of this type as necessary.
*''Cumulative %'': A markup whose amount is calculated as follows:
*:{{Markup Amount = (all the previously applied % markups) * <i>Cumulative % Value<i> / <i>100<i>}}
*:A markup of this type requires at least one markup of the ''%'' type.
*''Flat Fee'': A markup whose amount is specified manually to be added to the total markup.
*:You can define as many markups of this type as necessary.

A document-level markup is applied to a change request only if all the project budget key attributes—project task, account group, and optionally inventory item—are defined for the markup on the '''Markups''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_85_00|Change Requests] form.{br}

A change request inherits document-level markup from the project that you can define on the '''Settings''' tab ('''Document Markups''' table) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. The project inherits document markups from the '''General Settings''' tab ('''Markup''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form.]]></column>

*Distribute budgeted values among the financial periods
*Update the project budget based on the forecast
*Update the forecast financial periods based on the updated actual values

==Applicable Scenarios==
You create a budget forecast for a project if you need to breakdown the budget structure by financial periods to be able to control the budget performance by periods.[anchor|#section_fdf_x42_p2b]
==Creation of the Project Budget Forecast==
Each project can have multiple revisions of the budget forecast. For a new project budget forecast, in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_96_00|Project Budget Forecast] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209600|PM209600]) form, you select the project and enter an alphanumeric revision identifier of the budget forecast, which must be unique within the project. When you enter the revision, the system automatically fills in the table with the revenue and cost budget lines of the selected project.{br}

In a forecast revision, you distribute original and revised budget amounts of existing revenue and cost budget lines among the financial periods in the selected range to estimate project revenue and expenses by periods.{br}

You can manually add financial periods for the selected budget line of the forecast revision by clicking '''Add Periods''' on the table toolbar and selecting the range of financial periods in the '''Add Periods''' dialog box.{br}

You can also make the system automatically add financial periods for all the project budget lines of the forecast revision listed in the table according to the selection criteria specified in the Summary area. When you click '''Generate Periods''' on the form toolbar, for each line in the table, the system adds periods based on the settings of the project task and related project transactions.{br}

Each financial period added for a project budget line of the forecast revision has quantities and amounts of zero. You can manually specify the '''Original Budgeted Quantity''', '''Original Budgeted Amount''', '''Revised Budgeted Quantity''', and '''Revised Budgeted Amount''' values for each period of the project budget line.{br}

You can also distribute the original and revised quantities and amounts of a project budget lines among period lines automatically by clicking '''Distribute''' on the form toolbar. In the '''Distribute''' dialog box, you define which values the system should distribute, in which columns, and for which budget lines. The distribution function rounds equally distributed values using the built-in logarithmic rounding algorithm. For an example of rounding, see [HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Budget_Forecasts_Rounding|Creating Project Budget Forecasts: Example of Rounding].{br}

For each project budget line with added period lines, the system calculates the following totals in the '''Original Budgeted Quantity''', '''Original Budgeted Amount''', '''Revised Budgeted Quantity''', and '''Revised Budgeted Amount''' columns:[anchor|#_eb8115b3-a136-4595-93c5-02e6ce127d45]
*'''Total''': The total of the period lines
*'''Delta''': The difference between the value of the project budget line and the total of the period lines

==Processing Project Budget Forecasts==
When actual values of a project are updated, the system automatically updates actual values of budget forecasts of the project, including period lines. The system calculates the differences between revised budgeted values and actual values in the '''Revised Quantity - Actual Quantity''' and '''Revised Amount - Actual Amount ''' columns on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_96_00|Project Budget Forecast] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209600|PM209600]) form so you can compare performance of each budget line by periods.
If you need to update financial periods of a project budget line of the forecast revision, you click this line in the table on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_96_00|Project Budget Forecast] form, and on the table toolbar, click '''Update Forecast Lines'''. For the selected line, the system adds the financial periods to which actual values or change order values have been posted for the corresponding project budget line and that have been missed in the forecast revision.{br}

If you need to update the original and revised budgeted values of the corresponding project budget line on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form with the delta values of a project budget line of the forecast revision, you click this line of the forecast revision in the table on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_96_00|Project Budget Forecast] form, and on the table toolbar, click '''Update Project Budget Line'''.

==Story==
Suppose that the HM&rsquo;s Bakery and Cafe customer has ordered 80 hours of new-employee training on operating juicers. The project accountant has created a project to account for the provided training.{br}

The project accountant wants to prepare a budget forecast by periods to be able to compare and analyze monthly budgets versus actual costs within the project work breakdown structure. Because the training will take place in January and February, the project accountant wants to distribute the total budget across the periods when this work is going to be performed for further review and analysis of budget performance.{br}

Acting as the project accountant, you will create a project budget forecast. Distributing the budget across periods, you will realize that the budget will require an update. You will update the project budget based on the budget forecast. When the training takes place, you will update the progress of the project and review the budget forecast.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, the following features have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form:[anchor|#_4387db18-6b29-4015-8d96-56b9069f20d7]
*''Project Accounting'', which provides support for the project accounting functionality
*''Budget Forecasts'', which gives you the ability to create budget forecasts for projects

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, the ''HMBAKERY13'' project has been created and the ''TRAINING'' project task has been created for the project. Also, the revenue budget and the cost budget is defined with the line with the ''TRAINING'' inventory item and the ''LABOR'' account group for the project.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) form, the ''PM00000020'' batch of project transactions related to the project has been created.
==Process Overview==
In this activity, you will create the first revision of the budget forecast and generate periods for the revision on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_96_00|Project Budget Forecast] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209600|PM209600]) form. On this form, you will then distribute budgeted amounts by periods and update the project budget based on the distributed values. You will update actual values of the project by releasing transactions on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) form. You will finally update the budget forecast on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_96_00|Project Budget Forecast] form based on the updated actual values.
==System Preparation==
To sign in to the system and prepare to perform the instructions of the activity, do the following:[anchor|#_6c9e4914-0e56-4fc0-9f9d-df880dcd99b6]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the U100 dataset preloaded as Pam Brawner by using the ''brawner'' username and the ''123'' password.

==Step 1: Creating a Project Budget Forecast and Generating Periods==
To create a forecast revision for the project, do the following:[anchor|#_5767f8fd-fc1b-46b2-9bd2-86d198fc7858]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''HMBAKERY13'' project, and on the '''Revenue Budget''' and '''Cost Budget''' tabs, notice that the project has a single revenue budget line and a single cost budget line.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Inquiries''' > '''Project Budget Forecast'''.
#:The system opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_96_00|Project Budget Forecast] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209600|PM209600]) form with the project selected in the Summary area.
#:The project has no budget forecast revision yet so you are suggested to create a new one.
#In the Summary area, specify the following settings for the revision:
#*'''Revision''': <tt>1</tt>
#*'''Description''': <tt>2020 budget forecast</tt>.
#:When you specify the revision number, the system adds to the revision all the project budget lines. Notice that only the cost budget line with the ''LABOR'' account group is shown in the table. In the table, the system displays budget lines with account groups of the type selected in the Summary are shown, which is ''Expense'' by default.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Generate Periods''' to make the system add period lines to each budget line listed in the table.
#:Notice that for the budget line with the ''LABOR'' account group the system has added a line with the ''01-2020'' period. Also, the '''Total''' and '''Delta''' lines are now shown for the budget line because the line have period lines.
#In the Summary area, select ''All'' in the '''Type''' box.
#:The system displays in the table all the budget lines of the forecast revision—that is, the revenue budget line with the ''REVENUE'' account group has appeared in the table. Notice that no period lines have been added to the revenue budget line.
#In the table, click the budget line with the ''LABOR'' account group, and on the table toolbar, click '''Add Periods''' to add period lines to the selected budget line.
#In the '''Add Periods''' dialog box, select ''02-2020'' in the '''Period To''' box, and click '''OK'''.
#:The system adds one more period line to the budget line and closes the dialog box.
#Save your changes to the forecast revision.

==Step 2: Distributing Amounts Across the Periods==
To distribute budgeted amounts across periods of the forecast revision, do the following:[anchor|#_d49b6440-8232-4bd2-b54d-bafff09cee05]
#While you are still viewing the project budget forecast on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_96_00|Project Budget Forecast] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209600|PM209600]) form, on the form toolbar, click '''Distribute'''.
#In the '''Distribute''' dialog box, leave the default settings and click '''OK'''.
#:For the budget line with the ''LABOR'' account group, which have period lines, the system equally distributes original and revised budgeted quantities and amounts among period lines.
#For the ''01-2020'' period line, adjust the automatically distributed values as follows:
#*'''Original Budgeted Quantity''': <tt>30.00</tt>
#*'''Original Budgeted Amount''': <tt>1200.00</tt>
#*'''Revised Budgeted Quantity''': <tt>30.00</tt>
#*'''Revised Budgeted Amount''': <tt>1200.00</tt>
#:Notice the system has calculated values in the '''Total''' and '''Delta''' lines based on the changes you made. The total budgeted quantity of the period lines is ''70.00'', the total budgeted amount is ''2,800.00'', the delta of the budgeted quantity is ''10.00'', and the delta of the budgeted amount is ''400''.
#Save your changes to the forecast revision.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''HMBAKERY13'' project, and on the '''Cost Budget''' tab, notice that the '''Original Budgeted Quantity''' and '''Revised Budgeted Quantity''' of the cost budget line are still ''80.00'' and the '''Original Budgeted Amount''' and '''Revised Budgeted Amount''' are ''3,200.00''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Inquiries''' > '''Project Budget Forecast'''.
#:The system opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_96_00|Project Budget Forecast] form with the last modified revision of the project, which is ''1''.
#In the table, click the budget line with the ''LABOR'' account group, and on the table toolbar, click '''Update Project Budget Line'''.
#:The system updates the corresponding budget line of the project with the values from the '''Total''' line of the selected line of the forecast revision. The values in the '''Delta''' line become zero.
#Save your changes to the forecast revision.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, open the ''HMBAKERY13'' project, and on the '''Cost Budget''' tab, notice that the '''Original Budgeted Quantity''' and '''Revised Budgeted Quantity''' of the cost budget line are ''70.00'' and the '''Original Budgeted Amount''' and '''Revised Budgeted Amount''' are ''2,800.00''.

==Step 3: Updating Actual Values of the Project==
To capture the cost of the provided training on the project and update its actual values, do the following:[anchor|#_53f72d04-07f9-4079-b9bf-5ca43ef8d285]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) form, open the ''PM00000020'' batch of project transactions that represent the provided training.
#:Notice that 20 hours of the training were provided in the ''01-2020'' period, 40 hours were provided in the ''02-2020'' period, and 10 hours were provided in the ''03-2020'' period.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the transactions.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_96_00|Project Budget Forecast] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209600|PM209600]) form, select ''HMBAKERY13'' in the '''Project''' box.
#:In the table, notice that for the project budget line with the ''LABOR'' account group, the values in the '''Delta''' line in the '''Actual Quantity''' and '''Actual Amount''' columns are highlighted in red. This means that at least one period for which actual values exist is not displayed in the forecast revision.
#In the table, click the budget line with the ''LABOR'' account group, and on the table toolbar, click '''Update Forecast Lines'''.
#:The system updates budget line of the forecast revision selected in the table and adds the ''03-2019'' period with the actual quantity of ''10.00'' and the actual amount of ''400.00''.
#For the budget line with the ''LABOR'' account group, review the value in the '''Revised Quantity - Actual Quantity''' column for the following financial periods:
#*''01-2020'': The company provided 10 hours of training less than it was planned.
#*''02-2020'': The training was performed as it was planned.
#*''03-2020'': The company provided 10 hours of training more than it was planned.
#Save your changes to the forecast revision.

You will finally update the budget forecast on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM209600|PM209600]) Project Budget Forecast form based on                 the updated actual values. System Preparation To sign in to the system and prepare to perform the instructions of the activity, do                 the following: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the U100 dataset preloaded as Pam                     Brawner by using the  brawner  username and the  123  password. Step 1: Creating a Project Budget Forecast and Generating Periods To create a forecast revision for the project, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects                     (PM301000) form, open the  HMBAKERY13  project, and on the                          Revenue Budget  and  Cost Budget                      tabs, notice that the project has a single revenue budget line and a single cost                     budget line. On the form toolbar, click  Inquiries Project Budget Forecast . The system opens the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM209600|PM209600]) Project Budget Forecast                         (PM209600) form with the project selected in the Summary area. The                         project has no budget forecast revision yet so you are suggested to create a                         new one. In the Summary area, specify the following settings for the revision: Revision :  1 Description :  2020 budget                                 forecast . When you specify the revision number, the system adds to the revision                         all the project budget lines. Notice that only the cost budget line with the                              LABOR  account group is shown in the table. In the table, the                         system displays budget lines with account groups of the type selected in the                         Summary are shown, which is  Expense  by default. On the form toolbar, click  Generate Periods  to make the                     system add period lines to each budget line listed in the table. Notice that                         for the budget line with the  LABOR  account group the system has added                         a line with the  01-2020  period. Also, the                              Total  and  Delta  lines are                         now shown for the budget line because the line have period lines. In the Summary area, select  All  in the  Type                          box. The system displays in the table all the budget lines of the forecast                         revision—that is, the revenue budget line with the  REVENUE  account                         group has appeared in the table. Notice that no period lines have been added                         to the revenue budget line. In the table, click the budget line with the  LABOR  account group, and on                     the table toolbar, click  Add Periods  to add period lines                     to the selected budget line. In the  Add Periods  dialog box, select  02-2020  in                     the  Period To  box, and click                          OK . The system adds one more period line to the                         budget line and closes the dialog box. Save your changes to the forecast revision. Step 2: Distributing Amounts Across the Periods To distribute budgeted amounts across periods of the forecast revision, do the                 following: While you are still viewing the project budget forecast on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM209600|PM209600]) Project Budget Forecast (PM209600)                     form, on the form toolbar, click  Distribute . In the  Distribute  dialog box, leave the default settings                     and click  OK . For the budget line with the  LABOR                          account group, which have period lines, the system equally distributes                         original and revised budgeted quantities and amounts among period                     lines. For the  01-2020  period line, adjust the automatically distributed values                     as follows: Original Budgeted Quantity :                                  30.00 Original Budgeted Amount :                                  1200.00 Revised Budgeted Quantity :                                  30.00 Revised Budgeted Amount :                                  1200.00 Notice the system has calculated values in the                              Total  and  Delta  lines                         based on the changes you made. The total budgeted quantity of the period                         lines is  70.00 , the total budgeted amount is  2,800.00 , the                         delta of the budgeted quantity is  10.00 , and the delta of the                         budgeted amount is  400 . Save your changes to the forecast revision. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects                     (PM301000) form, open the  HMBAKERY13  project, and on the  Cost                         Budget  tab, notice that the  Original Budgeted                         Quantity  and  Revised Budgeted Quantity  of                     the cost budget line are still  80.00  and the  Original Budgeted                         Amount  and  Revised Budgeted Amount  are                          3,200.00 . On the form toolbar, click  Inquiries Project Budget Forecast . The system opens the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM209600|PM209600]) Project Budget Forecast form                         with the last modified revision of the project, which is  1 . In the table, click the budget line with the  LABOR  account group, and on                     the table toolbar, click  Update Project Budget                         Line . The system updates the corresponding budget line of the                         project with the values from the  Total  line of the                         selected line of the forecast revision. The values in the                              Delta  line become zero. Save your changes to the forecast revision. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects                     form, open the  HMBAKERY13  project, and on the  Cost                         Budget  tab, notice that the  Original Budgeted                         Quantity  and  Revised Budgeted Quantity  of                     the cost budget line are  70.00  and the  Original Budgeted                         Amount  and  Revised Budgeted Amount  are                          2,800.00 . Step 3: Updating Actual Values of the Project To capture the cost of the provided training on the project and update its actual                 values, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) Project Transactions (PM304000) form, open the                          PM00000020  batch of project transactions that represent the provided                         training. Notice that 20 hours of the training were provided in the                              01-2020  period, 40 hours were provided in the  02-2020                          period, and 10 hours were provided in the  03-2020  period. On the form toolbar, click  Release  to release the                     transactions. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM209600|PM209600]) Project Budget Forecast                     (PM209600) form, select  HMBAKERY13  in the  Project                          box. In the table, notice that for the project budget line with the                              LABOR  account group, the values in the                              Delta  line in the  Actual                             Quantity  and  Actual Amount  columns                         are highlighted in red. This means that at least one period for which actual                         values exist is not displayed in the forecast revision. In the table, click the budget line with the  LABOR  account group, and on                     the table toolbar, click  Update Forecast Lines . The                         system updates budget line of the forecast revision selected in the table                         and adds the  03-2019  period with the actual quantity of  10.00                          and the actual amount of                      400.00 . For                     the budget line with the  LABOR  account group, review the value in the                          Revised Quantity - Actual Quantity  column for the                     following financial periods: 01-2020 : The company provided 10 hours of training less than it                             was planned. 02-2020 : The training was performed as it was planned. 03-2020 : The company provided 10 hours of training more than it                             was planned. Save your changes to the forecast revision. ]]></column>

When the system automatically distributes the quantities and amounts of a project budget line among period lines, the {{DistibuteRound}} distribution function rounds equally distributed values using the built-in logarithmic rounding algorithm.{br}

The {{DistibuteRound(value, rowCount)}} function has the following values as the input parameters:[anchor|#_7b2da504-7bd5-4db4-a39d-7fdf291a5970]
*{{value}}: The quantity or amount of the project budget line to be distributed divided by the {{rowCount}}
*{{rowCount}}: The number of period lines to distribute the quantity or amount of the project budget line among

Rounding on a logarithmic scale is accomplished by taking the log of the amount and doing normal rounding to the nearest value on the log scale. Using the rounded value, which has been calculated, the system calculates the leftover for the last period line.{br}

The following example shows the way the system rounds a distributed amount.{br}

Suppose that the original budgeted amount to distribute is ''1,176.00''. The number of period lines to distribute the amount among is five. Thus, {{rowCount = 5}} and {{value = 1,176.00 / rowCount = 235.2}}{br}

The {{DistributeRound}} function rounds the {{value}} and returns {{240}}, which is the nearest number on the log scale. The leftover for the last period line is {{1,176.00 - ((rowCount - 1) * 240) = 216}}.{br}

Thus, the distribution function splits the original budgeted amount among five period lines as follows: [anchor|#_4c01e0e9-65d8-4089-910c-a561e6451310]
*''240.00'': Period lines from the first one to the fourth

According to the GAAP matching principle, the expenses related to the revenue have to be recorded to the same financial period as the revenue. Expenses may happen in several financial periods before an invoice is created for those costs for the customer and the generated revenue can be recognized.{br}

To set up the accounting for work-in-progress (WIP) costs for a project so that it corresponds to the GAAP Matching principle, you can temporarily allocate the project costs to a work-in-progress account group and then reverse the allocation back to the initial labor account group in the financial period in which an accounts receivable invoice is generated for the project and the revenue is recognized.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#_c2d80195-0536-41e7-83c9-c0675b471c59]
*Configure an allocation rule to move project costs to a WIP account group
*Configure a cost-plus project for allocating costs to the WIP account group
*Temporary allocate costs of the project to the WIP account group
*Bill the project with the allocated costs

==Applicable Scenarios==
If you have a long-term cost-plus project with expenses that have been posted to several financial periods but the project has not been billed yet, and in accordance with GAAP you want to record these expenses to the same financial period as the income generated by the invoice, you can to move the expenses to the needed period by allocating the project.
==Creating the Allocation Rule==
To temporarily allocate costs of a cost-plus project to a WIP account, you create an allocation rule on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_75_00|Allocation Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207500|PM207500]) form. Using this allocation rule, the system creates allocation transactions based on the project transactions posted to a particular account group or groups, which moves costs form the original accounts to a WIP account.{br}

For this allocation rule, you specify the following settings on the '''Calculation Rules''' tab:[anchor|#_2459a20c-1fc3-42d5-819e-9d750b6e4fa0]
*

You specify the following settings for the allocation rule on the '''Allocation Settings''' tab:[anchor|#_127b229e-b4aa-4a60-a73b-c5c0ee053175]
*'''Post Transaction to GL''' ('''Transaction Options''' section): Selected
*:With this check box selected, allocation transactions and reversing allocation transactions are posted to the general ledger.
*'''Reverse Allocation''' ('''Transaction Options''' section): ''On AR Invoice Generation'' or ''On AR Invoice Release''
*:With this setting, the allocation transaction is reversed automatically when an AR invoice is generated based on the allocation transactions or when this AR invoice is released, respectively.
*'''Account Origin''' ('''Debit Transaction''' section): ''Replace'' with a WIP account
*:With this setting, the system generates an allocation transaction that debits the specified WIP account. The account must be mapped to a dedicated WIP account group that reflects the allocated amount and that you will later use in the billing rule.
*'''Account Origin''' ('''Credit Transaction''' section): ''Debit Source''
*:With this setting, the system generates an allocation transaction that credits the debit account of the source transaction.

==Configuring Cost-Plus Projects for Allocation==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, for a cost-plus project to be allocated, you assign the created allocation rule to the project tasks on the '''Tasks''' tab.{br}

To be able to use the created allocation transactions in project billing, you need to modify the existing billing rule that is used for the project or create a new one on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form. For that billing rule, you create a ''Time and Material'' step that processes allocated transactions posted to the WIP account group. Except for the account group, the settings of this step are the same as the settings of the billing rule step that is used to process the original transactions, which are the source of the allocation transactions. On the '''Tasks''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, the modified or created billing rule must be assigned to project tasks.
==Allocating and Billing Projects==[anchor|#_dade6088-5667-4ecf-8b5f-1cc1de1e47e3]
You run the allocation process for a project by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Run Allocation''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form while reviewing the project. As a result, the system creates allocation transactions based on the project transactions selected by using the allocation rules specified for project tasks on the '''Tasks''' tab. To make it possible to identify a batch of created allocation transactions, the system assigns the ''Allocation for &lt;Project ID&gt;'' description to such a batch. For the project transactions that have been used as a source of the allocation, the system selects the '''Allocated''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_10_00|Project Transaction Details] ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) form.{br}

When you bill a cost-plus project, the system automatically reverses the allocation transactions on creation or release of the accounts receivable document, depending on the settings of the corresponding allocation rule. Reversing allocation transactions copy original allocation transactions and reverse the sign of the amount. Allocation transactions are always reversed in the full amount. The reversing clears the WIP account group and moves the allocated costs back to the original accounts in the financial period the AR document created in.]]></column>
			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Billing Cost-Plus Projects with WIP Costs: General Information According to the GAAP matching principle, the expenses related to the revenue have to be recorded to the same financial period as the revenue. Expenses may happen in several financial periods before an invoice is created for those costs for the customer and the generated revenue can be recognized. To set up the accounting for work-in-progress (WIP) costs for a project so that it corresponds to                 the GAAP Matching principle, you can temporarily allocate the project costs to a                 work-in-progress account group and then reverse the allocation back to the initial                 labor account group in the financial period in which an accounts receivable invoice                 is generated for the project and the revenue is recognized. Learning Objectives In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following: Configure an allocation rule to move project costs to a WIP account group Configure a cost-plus project for allocating costs to the WIP account group Temporary allocate costs of the project to the WIP account group Bill the project with the allocated costs Applicable Scenarios If you have a long-term cost-plus project with expenses that have been posted to several     financial periods but the project has not been billed yet, and in accordance with GAAP you want     to record these expenses to the same financial period as the income generated by the invoice,     you can to move the expenses to the needed period by allocating the project. Creating the Allocation Rule To temporarily allocate costs of a cost-plus project to a WIP account, you create an     allocation rule on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207500|PM207500]) Allocation Rules (PM207500)     form. Using this allocation rule, the system creates allocation transactions based on the     project transactions posted to a particular account group or groups, which moves costs form the     original accounts to a WIP account. For this allocation rule, you specify the following settings on the  Calculation      Rules  tab: You specify the following settings for the allocation rule on the  Allocation      Settings  tab: Post Transaction to GL  ( Transaction Options       section): Selected With this check box selected, allocation transactions and reversing       allocation transactions are posted to the general ledger. Reverse Allocation  ( Transaction Options       section):  On AR Invoice Generation  or  On AR Invoice Release With this setting,       the allocation transaction is reversed automatically when an AR invoice is generated based on       the allocation transactions or when this AR invoice is released, respectively. Account Origin  ( Debit Transaction  section):        Replace  with a WIP account With this setting, the system generates an allocation       transaction that debits the specified WIP account. The account must be mapped to a dedicated       WIP account group that reflects the allocated amount and that you will later use in the       billing rule. Account Origin  ( Credit Transaction  section):        Debit Source With this setting, the system generates an allocation transaction that       credits the debit account of the source transaction. Configuring Cost-Plus Projects for Allocation On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, for a cost-plus project         to be allocated, you assign the created allocation rule to the project tasks on the            Tasks  tab. To be able to use the created allocation transactions in project billing, you need to modify         the existing billing rule that is used for the project or create a new one on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules (PM207000) form. For that billing         rule, you create a  Time and Material  step that processes allocated transactions         posted to the WIP account group. Except for the account group, the settings of this step are         the same as the settings of the billing rule step that is used to process the original         transactions, which are the source of the allocation transactions. On the            Tasks  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects         (PM301000) form, the modified or created billing rule must be assigned to project tasks. Allocating and Billing Projects You run the allocation process for a project by             clicking  Actions Run Allocation  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects             (PM301000) form while reviewing the project. As a result, the system creates allocation             transactions based on the project transactions selected by using the allocation rules             specified for project tasks on the  Tasks  tab. To make it possible             to identify a batch of created allocation transactions, the system assigns the                  Allocation for <Project ID>  description to such a batch. For the project             transactions that have been used as a source of the allocation, the system selects the                  Allocated  check box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) Project Transaction Details (PM401000) form. When you bill a cost-plus project, the system automatically reverses the allocation         transactions on creation or release of the accounts receivable document, depending on the         settings of the corresponding allocation rule. Reversing allocation transactions copy         original allocation transactions and reverse the sign of the amount. Allocation transactions         are always reversed in the full amount. The reversing clears the WIP account group and moves         the allocated costs back to the original accounts in the financial period the AR document         created in. ]]></column>

))){br}{TOC}
==Story==
Suppose that the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company needs to process projects in accordance with the GAAP matching principle—that is, the expenses related to the revenue have to be recorded to the same financial period as the revenue even if the expenses have been already posted to the system. Acting as an administrative user of SweetLife, you will configure an allocation rule that can temporarily allocate the project labor costs to a work-in-progress account group and then reverse the costs back to the initial labor account group in the financial period in which the revenue is recognized—that is, an AR invoice is released.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Project Accounting'' feature has been enabled to support the project accounting functionality.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_10_00|Account Groups] ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) form, the ''WIP'' account group has been created; the ''12400 - Work in Progress'' account has been mapped to the account group.
==Process Overview==
You will configure an allocation rule for work-in-progress labor on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_75_00|Allocation Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207500|PM207500]) form.
==System Preparation==
To sign in to the system, launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the U100 dataset preloaded as Kimberly Gibbs by using the ''gibbs'' username and the ''123'' password.
==Step: Configuring an Allocation Rule==
To configure an allocation rule used for allocating work-in-progress labor costs, perform the following instructions:[anchor|#ol_qvk_dvs_sbb]
#On the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_75_00|Allocation Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207500|PM207500]) form, click '''Add New Record''' to create a new allocation rule.
#In the Summary area, specify the following settings:
#*'''Allocation Rule''': <tt>WIP&#95;CP</tt>
#*'''Description''': <tt>WIP allocation</tt>
#In the left pane, add a row for the allocation rule step with the following settings:
#*'''Step ID''': <tt>10</tt>
#*'''Description''': <tt>Labor</tt>
#
#In the right pane, on the '''Allocation Settings''' tab, specify the following settings of the step selected in the left pane:
#*'''Post Transaction to GL''' ('''Transaction Options''' section): Selected
#*'''Reverse Allocation''' ('''Transaction Options''' section): ''On AR Invoice Release''
#*:With this setting, the allocation transaction is reversed automatically when an AR invoice generated based on this allocation transaction is released.
#*'''Account Origin''' ('''Debit Transaction''' section): ''Replace'' with ''12400 - Work in Progress''
#*:With this setting, the system generates an allocation transaction that debits the specified account—that is, the ''12400 - Work in Progress'' account, which is mapped to the ''WIP'' account group.
#*'''Account Origin''' ('''Credit Transaction''' section): ''Debit Source''
#Save the created allocation rule.

You have configured the allocation rule that can be used for allocating work-in-progress labor expenses of a cost-plus project. To allocate the expenses of a project by using this rule, you need to assign the rule to the project tasks.

==Story==
Suppose that in January, the West BBQ Restaurant customer ordered training for new employees on the operation of juicers from the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company. The customer did not know the exact number of employees or the number of training sessions that would be needed. The SweetLife company agreed with the customer to provide as many training sessions as the customer needed in January and February. Further, both parties agreed that ''2/25/2020'', the customer would pay for all the hours of training sessions that took place.{br}

The project manager of SweetLife created a project for this work. Then suppose that ''1/21/2020'', a consultant of SweetLife provided eight hours of training and logged the time spent by creating and releasing a time card in Acumatica ERP. In February, no more training sessions were needed.{br}

Acting as SweetLife&rsquo;s project accountant, you need to bill the customer, and you want the project expense incurred in January to be recorded in the same financial period as the project revenue—that is, in February. You will allocate the project expenses and bill the project.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Project Accounting'' feature has been enabled to support the project accounting functionality.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, the ''WESTBBQ6A'' project has been created and the ''TRAINING'' task has been created for the project.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_10_00|Account Groups] ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) form, the ''WIP'' and ''LABOR'' account groups have been created; the ''12400 - Work in Progress'' account has been mapped to the ''WIP'' account group.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_75_00|Allocation Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207500|PM207500]) form, the ''WIPTM'' allocation rule has been created. This allocation rule will be used to allocate project transactions that represent a particular type of expenses to the ''12400 - Work in Progress'' account. The allocation rule will also create a reversing allocation transaction on the release of an AR invoice created based on the allocation transaction.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, the ''WIP'' billing rule has been created, which processes the allocated transactions from the ''WIP'' account group during the project billing.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_50_00|Employee Time Card] ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]) form, the ''0000001'' time card, reflecting the work of Pam Brawner on the ''WESTBBQ6A'' project, has been created. The time card has been also released and the ''PM00000019'' batch of project transactions that corresponds to the time card has been created.
==Process Overview==
In this activity, you will first specify the allocation rule and billing rule for the project task on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form. You will review existing project transactions to be allocated on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_10_00|Project Transaction Details] ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) form and then perform allocation for the project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. On the same form, you will bill the project and release the AR invoice created as a result of the billing on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form. The system will create the reversing allocation transactions that you review on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_10_00|Project Transaction Details] form.
==System Preparation==
To sign in to the system and prepare to perform the instructions of the activity, do the following:[anchor|#_5912a575-84db-4f90-804b-2433d5b74fd3]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded as Pam Brawner by using the ''brawner'' username and the ''123'' password.
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''2/25/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select ''2/25/2020'' on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.

==Step 1: Configuring the Project for Allocation and Allocating the Project==
To configure the project for allocation and allocate project transactions, do the following:[anchor|#_59ad6955-6a39-4afa-a56c-08a8dd60fc80]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''WESTBBQ6A'' project and do the following:
##In the table on the '''Tasks''' tab, click the ''TRAINING'' link in the '''Task ID''' column.
##:The system opens the task on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form in a pop-up window.
##In the '''Billing and Allocation Settings''' section on the '''Summary''' tab, specify the following settings, which are shown in the screenshot below:
##*'''Allocations Rule''': ''WIPTM''
##* '''Billing Rule''': ''WIP''
##:Notice that the '''Non-Billable WIP Account Group''' box is not defined (that is, the box is blank).[anchor|#_82bf2e6f-e3c5-43bc-be1f-4c74da5129eb][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_WIP_Allocation_With_Costs.png|popup|The settings of the project task|400px]
##Save your changes to the project task and close the pop-up window with the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] form.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_10_00|Project Transaction Details] ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) form, in the Selection area, select ''WESTBBQ6A'' in the '''Project''' box.
#:In the table, review the only project transaction and notice the values in the following columns:
#*'''Orig. Doc. Type''': The value in this column is ''Time Card'' because the transaction has been created based on the release of the time card created for Pam Brawner for the ''WESTBBQ6A'' project.
#*'''Fin. Period''': The transaction has been posted to the ''01-2020'' financial period.
#*'''Debit Account Group''': The transaction has debited the ''LABOR'' account group.
#*'''Billed''': This check box is cleared, indicating that the transaction has not been billed yet.
#*'''Allocated''': This check box is cleared, indicating that the transaction has not been allocated yet.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, open the ''WESTBBQ6A'' project.
#:On the '''Balances''' tab, review the project balance. Notice that the actual amount of project expenses ($360) is posted to the ''LABOR'' account group.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Run Allocation''' to perform the allocation for the selected project.
#:When the allocation is completed, on the '''Balances''' tab, review the project balance again. Notice that the actual amount of project expenses has been moved from the ''LABOR'' account group to the ''WIP'' account group.
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_10_00|Project Transaction Details] form, and in the Summary area, select ''WESTBBQ6A'' in the '''Project''' box.
#:In the table, notice that a new transaction has appeared. Review the transactions, noticing the values in the following columns:
#*'''Orig. Doc. Type''': The value in this column is ''Allocation'' for the new transaction, which means the transaction is an allocation transaction.
#*'''Date''': The date of the allocation transaction is the same as the date of the original transaction. Thus, the allocation transaction has been posted to ''01-2020'', which is the same financial period to which the original transaction was posted.
#*'''Debit Account Group''': The allocation transaction has debited the ''WIP'' account group.
#*'''Credit Account Group''': The allocation transaction has credited the ''LABOR'' account group, which is the debit account group of the original transaction.
#*'''Billed''': This check box is cleared, indicating that the allocation transaction has not been billed yet (as is the case with the original transaction).
#*'''Allocated''': This check box is selected for the original transaction with the ''Time Card'' original document type, indicating that the transaction has been used as the source for allocation.

==Step 2: Billing the Project==
To bill the project, do the following:[anchor|#_b56ac811-3393-4ef3-90e5-9bf89fa15b0e]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''WESTBBQ6A'' project, and on the form toolbar, click '''Run Project Billing'''.
#:The system creates an AR invoice and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form in a pop-up window.
#In the Summary area of the form, make sure that the '''Date''' of the invoice is ''2/25/2020'', which is the business date, and that the '''Post Period''' is ''02-2020''.
#:((({S:Warn}If a different date is selected, select ''2/25/2020''. The system will adjust the post period accordingly.
)))
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and on the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the AR invoice.
#Close the pop-up window with the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] form.
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_10_00|Project Transaction Details] ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) form, and in the Selection area, select ''WESTBBQ6A'' in the '''Project''' box.
#:In the table, notice that two new transactions have been created. Review the transactions, noticing the values in the following columns (see the screenshot below):
#*'''Orig. Doc. Type''': The value in this column is ''Allocation Reversal'' and ''Invoice'' for the new transactions, which means that the first one is a reversing transaction for the allocation transaction and the second one originates from the released invoice.
#*'''Date''': The date of the new transactions is the invoice date. Thus, the transactions have been posted to the ''02-2020'' financial period.
#*'''Debit Account Group''': The transaction with the ''Allocation Reversal'' original document type has cleared the ''WIP'' account group (debited the account group with a negative amount) and debited the ''LABOR'' account group. This reversing allocation transaction, which moved the expenses back to the original account group, was created on release of the AR invoice, based on the '''Reverse Allocation''' setting of the allocation rule on the '''Allocation Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_75_00|Allocation Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207500|PM207500]) form.
#*:The transaction with the ''Invoice'' original document type has debited the ''REVENUE'' account group with the amount calculated with the billing rule of the project task.
#*'''Billed''': This check box is selected for the transaction with the ''Allocation'' original document type, indicating that the allocation transaction has been used in billing.[anchor|#_3be7ce96-1c5a-4dd8-a9e0-7facb7926c8b][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_WIP_Allocation_With_Costs2.png|popup|Project transactions of the WESTBBQ6A project|400px]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, open the ''WESTBBQ6A'' project, and on the '''Balances''' tab, review the project balance. Notice that the actual amount of project expenses ($360) has been moved back from the ''WIP'' account group to the ''LABOR'' account group. The actual amount of the ''REVENUE'' account group has been updated.

Type : The value in this column is                  Allocation  for the new transaction, which means the transaction is an               allocation transaction. Date : The date of the allocation transaction is the same as               the date of the original transaction. Thus, the allocation transaction has been posted               to  01-2020 , which is the same financial period to which the original               transaction was posted. Debit Account Group : The allocation transaction has debited               the  WIP  account group. Credit Account Group : The allocation transaction has credited               the  LABOR  account group, which is the debit account group of the original               transaction. Billed : This check box is cleared, indicating that the               allocation transaction has not been billed yet (as is the case with the original               transaction). Allocated : This check box is selected for the original               transaction with the  Time Card  original document type, indicating that the               transaction has been used as the source for allocation. Step 2: Billing the Project To bill the project, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, open the  WESTBBQ6A            project, and on the form toolbar, click  Run Project Billing . The             system creates an AR invoice and opens it on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos             (AR301000) form in a pop-up window. In the Summary area of the form, make sure that the  Date  of the           invoice is  2/25/2020 , which is the business date, and that the  Post             Period  is  02-2020 . If a different date is selected, select                2/25/2020 . The system will adjust the post period accordingly. In the Summary area, clear the  Hold  check box, and on the form           toolbar, click  Release  to release the AR invoice. Close the pop-up window with the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos form.

In the table, notice             that two new transactions have been created. Review the transactions, noticing the             values in the following columns (see the screenshot below): Orig. Doc. Type : The value in this column is  Allocation                 Reversal  and  Invoice  for the new transactions, which means that the first               one is a reversing transaction for the allocation transaction and the second one               originates from the released invoice. Date : The date of the new transactions is the invoice date.               Thus, the transactions have been posted to the  02-2020  financial period. Debit Account Group : The transaction with the  Allocation                 Reversal  original document type has cleared the  WIP  account group               (debited the account group with a negative amount) and debited the  LABOR                account group. This reversing allocation transaction, which moved the expenses back to               the original account group, was created on release of the AR invoice, based on the                  Reverse Allocation  setting of the allocation rule on the                  Allocation Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207500|PM207500]) Allocation Rules (PM207500) form. The transaction with the  Invoice  original document type                 has debited the  REVENUE  account group with the amount calculated with the                 billing rule of the project task. Billed : This check box is selected for the transaction with               the  Allocation  original document type, indicating that the allocation               transaction has been used in billing. Project transactions of the WESTBBQ6A project On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, open the  WESTBBQ6A  project, and on           the  Balances  tab, review the project balance. Notice that the           actual amount of project expenses ($360) has been moved back from the  WIP  account           group to the  LABOR  account group.

When you allocate projects, the system creates allocation transactions based on the settings of the allocation rules associated with the project tasks. Depending on the settings of the allocation rules and project tasks, the system also can create reversing allocation transactions. These transactions are described in the following sections.{br}{TOC}

==Reversing Allocation Transactions Generated on Billing of a Cost-Plus Project==
When a cost-plus project is billed with a time and material billing rule, the system generates a batch of reversing allocation transactions shown in the table below, which prevents the allocation transactions used for billing from affecting the project balance. Reversing transactions copy original allocation transactions and reverse the sign of the amount.{br}

The system assigns one of the following descriptions to the reversing batch depending on when the reversing batch is created according to the option selected in the '''Reverse Allocation''' box on the '''Allocation Settings''' tab ('''Transaction Options''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_75_00|Allocation Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207500|PM207500]) form:[anchor|#_d6ef0991-8818-4e4b-aa89-d4267f14e35e]
*''Allocation Reversal on AR Invoice Release'': The batch is created with the ''Released'' status on the release of the corresponding accounts receivable document based on the ''On AR Invoice Release'' option of the allocation rule.
*''Allocation Reversal on AR Invoice Generation'': The batch is created on the creation of the corresponding accounts receivable document based on the ''On AR Invoice Generation'' option of the allocation rule.
*:If the accounts receivable document is created with the ''Balanced'' status, the reversing batch is also created with the ''Balanced'' status. The reversing batch is automatically released or deleted when the corresponding accounts receivable document is released or deleted, respectively.

According to the GAAP matching principle, the expenses related to the revenue have to be recorded to the same financial period as the revenue. Expenses may happen in several financial periods before an invoice is created for those costs for the customer and the generated revenue can be recognized.{br}

To set up the accounting for work-in-progress (WIP) costs for a project so that it corresponds to the GAAP Matching principle, you can temporarily allocate the project costs to a work-in-progress account group and then reverse the allocation back to the initial labor account group in the financial period in which an accounts receivable invoice is generated for the project and the revenue is recognized.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#_c2d80195-0536-41e7-83c9-c0675b471c59]
*Configure an allocation rule to move project costs to a WIP account group
*Configure a fixed-price project for allocating costs to the WIP account group
*Temporary allocate costs of the project to the WIP account group
*Bill the project with the allocated costs

==Applicable Scenarios==
If you have a long-term fixed-price project with expenses that have been posted to several financial periods but the project has not been billed yet, and in accordance with GAAP you want to record these expenses to the same financial period as the income generated by the invoice, you can move the expenses to the needed period by allocating the project.
==Creating the Allocation Rule==
To temporarily allocate costs of a fixed-price project to a WIP account, you create an allocation rule on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_75_00|Allocation Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207500|PM207500]) form. Using this allocation rule, the system creates allocation transactions based on the project transactions posted to a particular account group or groups, which moves costs form the original accounts to a WIP account.{br}

For this allocation rule, you specify the following settings on the '''Calculation Rules''' tab:[anchor|#_2459a20c-1fc3-42d5-819e-9d750b6e4fa0]
*

You specify the following settings for the allocation rule on the '''Allocation Settings''' tab:[anchor|#_127b229e-b4aa-4a60-a73b-c5c0ee053175]
*'''Post Transaction to GL''' ('''Transaction Options''' section): Selected
*:With this check box selected, allocation transactions and reversing allocation transactions are posted to the general ledger.
*'''Reverse Allocation''' ('''Transaction Options''' section): ''Never''
*:With this setting, the allocation transaction is not reversed automatically. A fixed-price project with a progress billing rule does not use allocation transactions for billing so you cannot use the allocation rule for creating reversing allocation transactions.
*'''Account Origin''' ('''Debit Transaction''' section): ''Replace'' with a WIP account
*:With this setting, the system generates an allocation transaction that debits the specified WIP account. The account must be mapped to a dedicated WIP account group that reflects the allocated amount and that you will later use in the billing rule.
*'''Account Origin''' ('''Credit Transaction''' section): ''Debit Source''
*:With this setting, the system generates an allocation transaction that credits the debit account of the source transaction.

==Configuring Fixed-Price Projects for Allocation==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, for a fixed-price project to be allocated, you assign the created allocation rule to the project tasks on the '''Tasks''' tab.{br}

You bill a fixed-price project with a billing rule with a ''Progress Billing'' step that does not use project transactions, including allocation transactions, for billing. To make the system automatically reverse created allocation transactions, which prevents the allocation transactions from affecting the project balance after you bill the project, you select the WIP account group to which you allocate the project costs in the '''Non-Billable WIP Account Group''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Billing and Allocation Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form.
==Allocating and Billing Projects==[anchor|#_29d2051c-5e52-4987-bcbb-bb084940aae6]
You run the allocation process for a project by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Run Allocation''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form while reviewing the project. As a result, the system creates allocation transactions based on the project transactions selected by using the allocation rules specified for project tasks on the '''Tasks''' tab. To make it possible to identify a batch of created allocation transactions, the system assigns the ''Allocation for &lt;Project ID&gt;'' description to such a batch. For the project transactions that have been used as a source of the allocation, the system selects the '''Allocated''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_10_00|Project Transaction Details] ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) form.{br}

When you bill a fixed-price project and create the accounts receivable document, the system automatically reverses the allocation transactions posted to the account group selected in the '''Non-Billable WIP Account Group''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Billing and Allocation Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form. Reversing allocation transactions copy original allocation transactions and reverse the sign of the amount. Allocation transactions are always reversed in the full amount. When you release the reversing allocation transactions, the system clears the WIP account group and moves the allocated costs back to the original accounts in the financial period the AR document created in.]]></column>

To set up the accounting for work-in-progress (WIP) costs for a project so that it corresponds to                 the GAAP Matching principle, you can temporarily allocate the project costs to a                 work-in-progress account group and then reverse the allocation back to the initial                 labor account group in the financial period in which an accounts receivable invoice                 is generated for the project and the revenue is recognized. Learning Objectives In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following: Configure an allocation rule to move project costs to a WIP account group Configure a fixed-price project for allocating costs to the WIP account group Temporary allocate costs of the project to the WIP account group Bill the project with the allocated costs Applicable Scenarios If you have a long-term fixed-price project with expenses that have been posted to several         financial periods but the project has not been billed yet, and in accordance with GAAP you         want to record these expenses to the same financial period as the income generated by the         invoice, you can move the expenses to the needed period by allocating the project. Creating the Allocation Rule To temporarily allocate costs of a fixed-price project to a WIP account, you create an         allocation rule on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207500|PM207500]) Allocation Rules (PM207500)         form. Using this allocation rule, the system creates allocation transactions based on the         project transactions posted to a particular account group or groups, which moves costs form         the original accounts to a WIP account. For this allocation rule, you specify the following settings on the  Calculation      Rules  tab: You specify the following settings for the allocation rule on the  Allocation      Settings  tab: Post Transaction to GL  ( Transaction Options       section): Selected With this check box selected, allocation transactions and reversing       allocation transactions are posted to the general ledger. Reverse Allocation  ( Transaction Options            section):  Never With this setting, the allocation transaction is not reversed             automatically. A fixed-price project with a progress billing rule does not use             allocation transactions for billing so you cannot use the allocation rule for creating             reversing allocation transactions. Account Origin  ( Debit Transaction  section):        Replace  with a WIP account With this setting, the system generates an allocation       transaction that debits the specified WIP account. The account must be mapped to a dedicated       WIP account group that reflects the allocated amount and that you will later use in the       billing rule. Account Origin  ( Credit Transaction  section):        Debit Source With this setting, the system generates an allocation transaction that       credits the debit account of the source transaction. Configuring Fixed-Price Projects for Allocation On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, for a fixed-price         project to be allocated, you assign the created allocation rule to the project tasks on the            Tasks  tab. You bill a fixed-price project with a billing rule with a  Progress Billing  step that         does not use project transactions, including allocation transactions, for billing. To make         the system automatically reverse created allocation transactions, which prevents the         allocation transactions from affecting the project balance after you bill the project, you         select the WIP account group to which you allocate the project costs in the            Non-Billable WIP Account Group  box on the            Summary  tab ( Billing and Allocation Settings          section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) Project Tasks (PM302000) form. Allocating and Billing Projects You run the allocation process for a project by             clicking  Actions Run Allocation  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects             (PM301000) form while reviewing the project. As a result, the system creates allocation             transactions based on the project transactions selected by using the allocation rules             specified for project tasks on the  Tasks  tab. To make it possible             to identify a batch of created allocation transactions, the system assigns the                  Allocation for <Project ID>  description to such a batch. For the project             transactions that have been used as a source of the allocation, the system selects the                  Allocated  check box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) Project Transaction Details (PM401000) form. When you bill a fixed-price project and create the accounts receivable document, the system         automatically reverses the allocation transactions posted to the account group selected in         the  Non-Billable WIP Account Group  box on the            Summary  tab ( Billing and Allocation Settings          section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) Project Tasks (PM302000) form. Reversing allocation         transactions copy original allocation transactions and reverse the sign of the amount.         Allocation transactions are always reversed in the full amount. When you release the         reversing allocation transactions, the system clears the WIP account group and moves the         allocated costs back to the original accounts in the financial period the AR document         created in. ]]></column>

==Story==
Suppose that the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company needs to process projects in accordance with the GAAP matching principle—that is, the expenses related to the revenue have to be recorded to the same financial period as the revenue even if the expenses have been already posted to the system. Acting as SweetLife’s administrative user, you will configure an allocation rule that can temporarily allocate the project labor costs to a work-in-progress account group. To reverse the costs back you will not use the allocation rule.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Project Accounting'' feature has been enabled to support the project accounting functionality.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_10_00|Account Groups] ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) form, the ''WIP'' account group has been created; the ''12400 - Work in Progress'' account has been mapped to the account group.
==Process Overview==
You will configure an allocation rule for work-in-progress labor on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_75_00|Allocation Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207500|PM207500]) form.
==System Preparation==
To sign in to the system, launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the U100 dataset preloaded as Kimberly Gibbs by using the ''gibbs'' username and the ''123'' password.
==Step: Configuring an Allocation Rule==
To configure an allocation rule used for allocating work-in-progress labor costs, perform the following instructions:[anchor|#ol_qvk_dvs_sbb]
#On the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_75_00|Allocation Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207500|PM207500]) form, click '''Add New Record''' to create a new allocation rule.
#In the Summary area, specify the following settings:
#*'''Allocation Rule''': <tt>WIP&#95;FP</tt>
#*'''Description''': <tt>WIP allocation</tt>
#In the left pane, add a row for the allocation rule step with the following settings:
#*'''Step ID''': <tt>10</tt>
#*'''Description''': <tt>Labor</tt>
#
#In the right pane, on the '''Allocation Settings''' tab, specify the following settings of the step selected in the left pane:
#*'''Post Transaction to GL''' ('''Transaction Options''' section): Selected
#*'''Reverse Allocation''' ('''Transaction Options''' section): ''Never''
#*:A fixed-price project with a progress billing rule does not use allocation transactions for billing so you will not use the allocation rule for creating of reversing allocation transactions.
#*'''Account Origin''' ('''Debit Transaction''' section): ''Replace'' with ''12400 - Work in Progress''
#*:With this setting, the system generates an allocation transaction that debits the specified account—that is, the ''12400 - Work in Progress'' account, which is mapped to the ''WIP'' account group.
#*'''Account Origin''' ('''Credit Transaction''' section): ''Debit Source''
#Save the created allocation rule.

You have configured the allocation rule that can be used for allocating work-in-progress labor expenses of a cost-plus project. To allocate the expenses of a project by using this rule, you need to assign the rule to the project tasks.

==Story==
Suppose that in January, the West BBQ Restaurant customer ordered training on operating juicers for 10 employees from the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company. The parties were not able to determine how many training sessions would be needed for the employees to master the use of the juicers. The SweetLife company agreed with the customer that provide as many training sessions as the customer needed in January and February, and that ''2/25/2020'', the customer would pay $80 for each employee who attended these training sessions.{br}

 SweetLife&rsquo;s project manager has created a project for this work. Then suppose that ''1/21/2020'', a consultant of SweetLife provided eight hours of training and logged the time spent by creating and releasing a time card in Acumatica ERP. All 10 of the customer&rsquo;s employees attended that training session, and no more training sessions were needed in February.{br}

Acting as SweetLife&rsquo;s project accountant, you need to bill the customer, and you want the project expense incurred in January to be recorded in the same financial period as the project revenue—that is, in February. You will allocate the project expenses and bill the project.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Project Accounting'' feature has been enabled to support the project accounting functionality.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, the ''WESTBBQ6B'' project has been created an the ''TRAINING'' task has been created for the project.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_10_00|Account Groups] ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) form, the ''WIP'' and ''LABOR'' account groups have been created; also, the ''12400 - Work in Progress'' account has been mapped to the ''WIP'' account group.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_75_00|Allocation Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207500|PM207500]) form, the ''WIPPROGRESS'' allocation rule has been created. This allocation rule will be used to allocate project transactions that represent a particular type of expenses to the ''WIP'' account group. The allocation rule will not create a reversing allocation transaction.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, the ''PROGRESS'' billing rule has been created. The billing rule has been configured fro progress billing and has been assigned to the ''TRAINING'' task of the ''WESTBBQ6B'' project.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_50_00|Employee Time Card] ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]) form, the ''0000001'' time card, reflecting the work of Pam Brawner on the ''WESTBBQ6B'' project, has been created. The time card has been also released and the ''PM00000019'' batch of project transactions that corresponds to the time card has been created.
==Process Overview==
In this activity, you will first specify the allocation rule, the billing rule, and the non-billable wip account group for the project task on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form. You will review existing project transactions to be allocated on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_10_00|Project Transaction Details] ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) form and then perform allocation for the project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. On the same form, you will bill the project and release the AR invoice created as a result of the billing on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form. The system will create the reversing allocation transactions that you review on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_10_00|Project Transaction Details] form and release on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) form.
==System Preparation==
To sign in to the system and prepare to perform the instructions of the activity, do the following:[anchor|#_5912a575-84db-4f90-804b-2433d5b74fd3]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded as Pam Brawner by using the ''brawner'' username and the ''123'' password.
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''2/25/2020''.

##In the '''Billing and Allocation Settings''' section on the '''Summary''' tab, specify the following settings, which are shown in the screenshot below:
##*'''Allocations Rule''': ''WIPPROGRESS''
##* '''Non-Billable WIP Account Group''': ''WIP''
##:Notice that the ''PROGRESS'' billing rule is selected in the '''Billing Rule'''. You do not need to change the progress billing rule because the allocation transactions are not used in the billing of fixed-price projects.[anchor|#_67c361f3-dcd7-4e2c-a26e-13722dc03015][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_WIP_Allocation_With_Revenue.png|popup|The settings of the project task|400px]
##Close the pop-up window with the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] form.

#:In the table, review the only project transaction and notice the values in the following columns:
#*'''Orig. Doc. Type''': The value in this column is ''Time Card'' because the transaction has been created based on the release of the time card created for Pam Brawner for the ''WESTBBQ6B'' project.
#*'''Fin. Period''': The transaction has been posted to the ''01-2020'' financial period.
#*'''Debit Account Group''': The transaction has debited the ''LABOR'' account group.
#*'''Billed''': This check box is cleared, indicating that the transaction has not been billed yet.
#*'''Allocated''': This check box is cleared, indicating that the transaction has not been allocated yet.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, open the ''WESTBBQ6B'' project.
#:On the '''Balances''' tab, review the project balance. Notice that the actual amount of project expenses ($360) is posted to the ''LABOR'' account group.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Run Allocation''' to perform the allocation for the selected project.
#:When the allocation is completed, on the '''Balances''' tab, review the project balance again. Notice that the actual amount of project expenses has been moved from the ''LABOR'' account group to the ''WIP'' account group.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_10_00|Project Transaction Details] form, in the Summary area, select ''WESTBBQ6B'' in the '''Project''' box.
#:In the table, notice that a new transaction has appeared. Review the transactions, noticing the values in the following columns:
#*'''Orig. Doc. Type''': The value in this column is ''Allocation'' for the new transaction, which means the transaction is an allocation transaction.
#*'''Date''': The date of the allocation transaction is the same as the date of the original transaction. Thus, the allocation transaction has been posted to ''01-2019'', which is the same financial period to which the original transaction was posted.
#*'''Debit Account Group''': The allocation transaction has debited the ''WIP'' account group.
#*'''Credit Account Group''': The allocation transaction has credited the ''LABOR'' account group, which is the debit account group of the original transaction.
#*'''Billed''': This check box is cleared, indicating that the allocation transaction has not been billed yet along with the original transaction.
#*'''Allocated''': This check box is selected for the original transaction with the ''Time Card'' original document type, indicating that the transaction has been used as the source for allocation.

==Step 2: Billing the Project==
To update the progress of project completion and bill the project in an amount that corresponds to the progress, do the following:[anchor|#_b56ac811-3393-4ef3-90e5-9bf89fa15b0e]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''WESTBBQ6B'' project, and review the following settings:
#On the '''Revenue Budget''' tab, specify <tt>100.00</tt> in the '''Completed (%)''' column of the revenue budget line. That is, the project has been entirely completed.
#:Notice that the system calculates the '''Pending Invoice Amount''' in the row ($800).
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save''' to your changes to the project, and then click '''Run Project Billing'''.
#:The system creates an AR invoice and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form in a pop-up window.
#In the Summary area of the form, make sure that the '''Date''' of the invoice is ''2/25/2020'', which is the business date, and that the '''Post Period''' is ''02-2020''.
#:((({S:Warn}If a different date is selected, select ''2/25/2020''. The system will adjust the post period accordingly.
)))
#In the Summary area, clear the '''Hold''' check box, and on the form toolbar, click '''Release''' to release the AR invoice.
#Close the pop-up window with the form.

#:In the table, notice that two new transactions have been created. Review the transactions, noticing the values in the following columns (see the screenshot below):
#*'''Orig. Doc. Type''': The value in this column is ''WIP Reversal'' and ''Invoice'' for the new transactions, which means that the first one is a reversing transaction and the second one originates from the released invoice.
#*'''Date''': The date of the new transactions is the invoice date. Thus, the transactions have been posted to the ''02-2019'' financial period.
#*'''Debit Account Group''': The transaction with the ''WIP Reversal'' original document type has credited the ''WIP'' account group and debited the ''LABOR'' account group. This reversing transaction was created on project billing to clear the WIP account group selected for the project task.
#*:The transaction with the ''Invoice'' original document type has debited the ''REVENUE'' account group with the amount calculated with the billing rule of the project task. The transaction was created on release of the AR invoice.
#*'''Billed''': This check box is cleared for all the transactions, indicating that the transactions has not been used in billing.
#*'''Released''': This check box is cleared for the reversing transaction with the ''WIP Reversal'' original document type, indicating that it has not been released yet.[anchor|#_3be7ce96-1c5a-4dd8-a9e0-7facb7926c8b][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_WIP_Allocation_With_Revenue2.png|popup|Project transactions of the WESTBBQ6B project|400px]

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Billing Fixed-Price Projects with WIP Costs: Process Activity In this activity, you will learn how to temporarily allocate project expenses to a         work-in-progress account group and bill the project without using allocation transactions as         a basis for billing. The following activity is             based on the  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system             settings have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the             activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100              dataset to its initial state. Story Suppose that in January, the West BBQ Restaurant customer ordered training on operating         juicers for 10 employees from the  SweetLife Fruits & Jams company. The parties were not able to determine how many training sessions would be         needed for the employees to master the use of the juicers. The  SweetLife         company agreed with the customer that provide as many training sessions as the customer         needed in January and February, and that  2/25/2020 , the customer would pay $80 for         each employee who attended these training sessions.  SweetLife's project manager has created a project for this work. Then suppose that          1/21/2020 , a consultant of  SweetLife         provided eight hours of training and logged the time spent by creating and releasing a time         card in  Acumatica ERP. All 10 of the customer's employees attended that training session, and no more training         sessions were needed in February. Acting as  SweetLife's         project accountant, you need to bill the customer, and you want the project expense incurred         in January to be recorded in the same financial period as the project revenue—that is, in         February. You will allocate the project expenses and bill the project. Configuration Overview For the purposes of this activity, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form,         the  Project Accounting  feature has been enabled to support the project accounting         functionality. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, the  WESTBBQ6B  project has         been created an the  TRAINING  task has been created for the project. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) Account Groups (PM201000) form, the  WIP  and  LABOR          account groups have been created; also, the  12400 - Work in Progress  account has been         mapped to the  WIP  account group. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207500|PM207500]) Allocation Rules (PM207500) form, the  WIPPROGRESS  allocation         rule has been created. This allocation rule will be used to allocate project transactions         that represent a particular type of expenses to the  WIP  account group. The allocation         rule will not create a reversing allocation transaction. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules (PM207000) form, the  PROGRESS  billing rule         has been created. The billing rule has been configured fro progress billing and has been         assigned to the  TRAINING  task of the  WESTBBQ6B  project. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]) Employee Time Card (EP305000) form, the  0000001  time card,         reflecting the work of Pam Brawner on the  WESTBBQ6B  project, has been created. The         time card has been also released and the  PM00000019  batch of project transactions         that corresponds to the time card has been created. Process Overview In this activity, you will first specify the allocation rule, the billing rule, and the         non-billable wip account group for the project task on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) Project Tasks         (PM302000) form. You will review existing project transactions to be allocated on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) Project Transaction Details (PM401000) form and then perform allocation for the project on         the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. On the same form, you will bill the         project and release the AR invoice created as a result of the billing on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form. The system will create the reversing allocation         transactions that you review on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM401000|PM401000]) Project Transaction Details form and release on the             ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) Project Transactions (PM304000) form. System Preparation To sign in to the system and prepare to perform the instructions of the activity, do the         following: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the  U100  dataset preloaded as Pam Brawner           by using the  brawner  username and the  123  password. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to  2/25/2020 . If           a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select              2/25/2020  on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and           process all documents in the system during this business date.

To help employees to categorize and track the expenses, including the expenses related to a project, Acumatica ERP supports the use of corporate credit cards in expense receipts and claims. In this chapter, you will find topics that explain how to configure the system and process expense receipts with corporate cards.
==In This Chapter==
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Expense_Receipts_GeneralInfo|Expense Receipts with Corporate Cards: General Information]
*:Acumatica ERP supports the use of corporate credit cards on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_10_00|Expense Claim] ([~/?ScreenId=EP301000|EP301000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_10_20|Expense Receipt] ([~/?ScreenId=EP301020|EP301020]) forms. This helps employees to categorize and track the expenses, including the expenses related to a project. For example, while in the field, your employees can buy something that they want to charge on a project and pay for it with a corporate card. Employees can still have out-of-pocket expenses that are reimbursed through the standard process.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Expense_Receipts_Implem_Checklist|Expense Receipts with Corporate Cards: Implementation Checklist]
*:The following sections provide details you can use to ensure that the system is configured properly for processing expense receipts with the corporate cards, and to understand (and change, if needed) the settings that affect the processing workflow.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Expense_Receipts_Implem_Activity|Expense Receipts with Corporate Cards: Implementation Activity]
*:The following activity will walk you through the process of creating the necessary entities for processing of expense receipts with corporate credit cards.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Expense_Receipts_Process_Activity|Expense Receipts with Corporate Cards: To Process Expense Receipts]
*:The following activity will walk you through the process of creating and processing of expense receipts with corporate cards.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Expense_Receipts_Transactions|Expense Receipts with Corporate Cards: Generated Transactions]
*:The release of an expense claim does not generate general ledger transactions or project transactions directly. When you release the expense claim , the system creates corresponding accounts payable documents. On release of the accounts payable documents, the system generates the general ledger transactions and optionally project transactions described in the following sections.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Expense_Receipts_Reports_Inquiries|Expense Receipts with Corporate Cards: Related Reports and Forms]
*:In the following sections, you can find details about the reports and forms you may want to review to gather information about expense claims.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Expense_Receipts_MassProcessing|Expense Receipts with Corporate Cards: Mass-Processing of Documents]
*:This topic explains how to process multiple expense claims, and how the system generates, changes, or works with documents as a result of the mass processing.
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Expense_Receipts_Bank_Reconciliation|Expense Receipts with Corporate Cards: Bank Reconciliation]
*:You can maintain internal control over the corporate credit cards by performing regular reconciliations of the cash account configured for corporate cards. Generally, the goal of reconciliation is to find discrepancies between account balances tracked by different means, locate any errors, and make needed corrections or adjustments. Reconciliation is usually done at the end of each period or more frequently. For more information on the reconciliation process, see [HelpRoot_Financials\Finance_Bank_Reconciliation_GenInfo|Bank Reconciliation: General Information].
*[HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Expense_Receipts_Reconciliation_Process|Expense Receipts with Corporate Cards: To Reconcile Bank Statements]

Employees can still have out-of-pocket expenses that are reimbursed through the standard process.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#_d0dffcc8-792b-41cf-a4d7-1a17e54017d3]
*Create a GL account, cash account, and payment method for a corporate credit card
*Create a corporate credit card in the system
*Create an expense receipt for company&rsquo;s expenses paid the corporate credit card
*Process an expense claim for the expense receipt paid with the corporate credit card
*Process personal expenses paid with the corporate credit card
*Process company&rsquo;s expenses paid with a personal account
*Reconcile a bank statement for the corporate credit card
*Create and release a bill for the bank

==Applicable Scenarios==
You process an expense receipt with a corporate credit card when you want to record expenses paid by a company corporate credit card.
==Configuration of Corporate Cards==
You configure corporate credit cards on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_25_00|Corporate Cards] ([~/?ScreenId=CA202500|CA202500]) form. You enter the card number for matching transactions on a bank statement. Multiple employees can use a single corporate card; you add these employees to the table on the form.{br}

In order to create corporate cards on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_25_00|Corporate Cards] form, GL accounts, cash accounts, payment methods, and employees must be configured as described below.{br}

You configure a separate GL account for each bank and currency. For each GL account, you create a separate cash account with the following settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_20_00|Cash Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CA202000|CA202000]) form:[anchor|#_0318118d-544d-4ea4-a2b6-080040eb38b7]
*The '''Clearing Account''' check box is cleared.
*The '''Restrict Visibility with Branch''' check box is cleared.
*The '''Use for Corporate Cards''' check box is selected.
*Only one payment method can be associated with the cash account.
*Optionally, the '''Requires Reconciliation''' check box is selected; if it is, a numbering sequence must be specified in the '''Reconciliation Numbering Sequence''' box. The predefined ''CARECON'' numbering sequence can be selected.
{br}

Although the cash account that is used for a corporate card must have only one associated payment method, this payment method can be selected for multiple cash accounts. If a payment method is selected for a cash account that is used for a corporate card, in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_40_00|Payment Methods] ([~/?ScreenId=CA204000|CA204000]) form, the '''Use in AP''' check box is selected. Also, on the '''Settings for Use in AP''' tab of the form, this payment method should have the following settings:[anchor|#_88735079-9395-4939-973b-95bc4b462db3]
*'''Not Required''' ('''Additional Processing''' section): Selected
*'''Require Unique Payment Ref.''' ('''Payment Settings''' section): Cleared

If the card currency differs from the currency of an employee who uses the corporate card, for this employee, the '''Enable Currency Override''' and '''Enable Rate Override''' check boxes must be selected on the '''General Info''' tab ('''Employee Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form. (The '''Currency ID''' box, where the employee currency is specified, can also be found in this section of the form.)
==Payment of Expense Receipts with Corporate Cards==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_10_20|Expense Receipt] ([~/?ScreenId=EP301020|EP301020]) form, you create expense receipts to the employee that is associated with you user. You can also create expense receipts for any subordinates of that employee. In the '''Paid With''' box (in the '''Expense Details '''section of the '''Receipt Details''' tab), you select how the expense receipt has been paid. The following options are available:[anchor|#_1411788c-144d-4520-a3e0-8f3e519271a5]
*''Personal Account'': The company&rsquo;s expenses that the employee paid with his or her own funds and the company will need to reimburse this amount to you. This is the default option if the employee has no active corporate card assigned.
*''Corporate Card, Company Expense'': The company&rsquo;s expenses that are paid with a corporate card. This is the default option if the employee has an active corporate card assigned.
*''Corporate Card, Personal Expense'': The employee&rsquo;s personal expenses that are paid with a corporate card.

In the '''Corporate Card''' box, you select a corporate card associated with the employee. The default corporate card, if any, is selected as follows:[anchor|#_fa68e37c-f829-43e1-a6d0-98e9b677a9d5]
*The corporate card used in the employee&rsquo;s most recent expense receipt is selected, if it is available. The most recent receipt is determined by the receipt&rsquo;s creation date.
*If the corporate card that was used most recently is unavailable—that is, inactive, deleted, or no longer assigned to the employee—the employee&rsquo;s only active card or the first active card the system finds for the employee. The first corporate card is the first card in the employee&rsquo;s card list; this list is sorted alphabetically by name.

Corporate card expenses cannot be split. That is, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_10_20|Expense Receipt] form, in the '''Expense Details''' section of the '''Receipt Details''' tab, the '''Employee Part''' of an expense receipt paid with a corporate card must be zero.{br}

The '''Ref. Nbr.''' box, you enter the reference number that usually matches the number of the original receipt.
==Claiming of Expense Receipts Paid with Corporate Cards==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_10_00|Expense Claim] ([~/?ScreenId=EP301000|EP301000]) form, you can claim with a single expense claim all the employee's expense receipts paid with corporate cards as long as they have the same card currency. Each expense claim line on the '''Expense Claim Details''' tab refers to an expense receipt. If you create a new expense claim line on the form that does not originate from any expense receipt, on release of the expense claim, the system creates the corresponding expense receipt for that expense claim line.{br}

On release of an expense claim, the system creates documents as follows for the expense claim lines, depending on the value in the '''Paid With''' column:[anchor|#_0497cdd1-5185-401c-ad2a-29b56b794f48]
*''Personal Account'': A single AP bill is created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form for all the expense claim lines with positive amounts and a single AP debit adjustment is created on the same form for all the expense claim lines with negative amounts.
*''Corporate Card, Company Expense'': An AP quick check is created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_40_00|Quick Checks] ([~/?ScreenId=AP304000|AP304000]) form for each expense claim line, if the '''Post Summarized Corporate Card Company Expenses''' check box is cleared on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_10_10_00|Time and Expenses Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=EP101000|EP101000]) form.
*:If the '''Post Summarized Corporate Card Company Expenses''' check box in selected, the system creates a separate AP quick check for each group of the expense claim lines with the same date, corporate card, and reference number.
*''Corporate Card, Personal Expense'': A single AP debit adjustment is created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] form for all the expense claim lines.

==Workflow of Claiming Expenses Paid with Corporate Cards==
The following diagram illustrates the workflow of claiming an expense paid with a corporate credit card.[anchor|#fig_fhq_2nv_q2b][anchor|#image_ghq_2nv_q2b][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_Expense_Receipt_Workflow.png|popup|350px]]]></column>
			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Expense Receipts with Corporate Cards: General Information  Acumatica ERP supports the use of corporate credit cards on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP301000|EP301000]) Expense Claim (EP301000) and   ([~/?ScreenId=EP301020|EP301020]) Expense Receipt (EP301020) forms. This helps employees to         categorize and track the expenses, including the expenses related to a project. For example,         while in the field, your employees can buy something that they want to charge on a project         and pay for it with a corporate card. Employees can still have out-of-pocket expenses that         are reimbursed through the standard process. Learning Objectives In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following: Create a GL account, cash account, and payment method for a corporate credit card Create a corporate credit card in the system Create an expense receipt for company's expenses paid the corporate credit card Process an expense claim for the expense receipt paid with the corporate credit           card Process personal expenses paid with the corporate credit card Process company's expenses paid with a personal account Reconcile a bank statement for the corporate credit card Create and release a bill for the bank Applicable Scenarios You process an expense receipt with a corporate credit card when you want to record         expenses paid by a company corporate credit card. Configuration of Corporate Cards You configure corporate credit cards on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA202500|CA202500]) Corporate Cards         (CA202500) form. You enter the card number for matching transactions on a bank statement.         Multiple employees can use a single corporate card; you add these employees to the table on         the form. In order to create corporate cards on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA202500|CA202500]) Corporate Cards         form, GL accounts, cash accounts, payment methods, and employees must be configured as         described below. You configure a separate GL account for each bank and currency. For each GL account, you         create a separate cash account with the following settings on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA202000|CA202000]) Cash Accounts (CA202000) form: The  Clearing Account  check box is cleared. The  Restrict Visibility with Branch  check box is cleared. The  Use for Corporate Cards  check box is selected. Only one payment method can be associated with the cash account. Optionally, the  Requires Reconciliation  check box is selected;             if it is, a numbering sequence must be specified in the  Reconciliation               Numbering Sequence  box. The predefined  CARECON  numbering sequence             can be selected. Although the cash account that is used for a corporate card must have only one associated         payment method, this payment method can be selected for multiple cash accounts. If a payment         method is selected for a cash account that is used for a corporate card, in the Summary area         of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA204000|CA204000]) Payment Methods (CA204000) form, the  Use in           AP  check box is selected. Also, on the  Settings for Use in           AP  tab of the form, this payment method should have the following         settings: Not Required  ( Additional Processing            section): Selected Require Unique Payment Ref.  ( Payment             Settings  section): Cleared If the card currency differs from the currency of an employee who uses the corporate card,         for this employee, the  Enable Currency Override  and  Enable           Rate Override  check boxes must be selected on the  General           Info  tab ( Employee Settings  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) Employees (EP203000) form. (The  Currency           ID  box, where the employee currency is specified, can also be found in this         section of the form.) Payment of Expense Receipts with Corporate Cards On the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP301020|EP301020]) Expense Receipt (EP301020) form, you create expense         receipts to the employee that is associated with you user. You can also create expense         receipts for any subordinates of that employee. In the  Paid With  box         (in the  Expense Details  section of the  Receipt           Details  tab), you select how the expense receipt has been paid. The following         options are available: Personal Account : The company's expenses that the employee paid with his or her           own funds and the company will need to reimburse this amount to you. This is the default           option if the employee has no active corporate card assigned. Corporate Card, Company Expense : The company's expenses that are paid with a           corporate card. This is the default option if the employee has an active corporate card           assigned. Corporate Card, Personal Expense : The employee's personal expenses that are paid           with a corporate card. In the  Corporate Card  box, you select a corporate card associated         with the employee. The default corporate card, if any, is selected as follows: The corporate card used in the employee's most recent expense receipt is selected, if it           is available. The most recent receipt is determined by the receipt's creation date. If the corporate card that was used most recently is unavailable—that is, inactive,           deleted, or no longer assigned to the employee—the employee's only active card or the           first active card the system finds for the employee. The first corporate card is the first           card in the employee's card list; this list is sorted alphabetically by name. Corporate card expenses cannot be split. That is, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP301020|EP301020]) Expense Receipt form, in the  Expense Details          section of the  Receipt Details  tab, the  Employee           Part  of an expense receipt paid with a corporate card must be zero. The  Ref. Nbr.  box, you enter the reference number that usually         matches the number of the original receipt. Claiming of Expense Receipts Paid with Corporate Cards On the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP301000|EP301000]) Expense Claim (EP301000) form, you can claim with a         single expense claim all the employee's expense receipts paid with corporate cards as long         as they have the same card currency. Each expense claim line on the  Expense Claim           Details  tab refers to an expense receipt. If you create a new expense claim         line on the form that does not originate from any expense receipt, on release of the expense         claim, the system creates the corresponding expense receipt for that expense claim line. On release of an expense claim, the system creates documents as follows for the expense         claim lines, depending on the value in the  Paid With  column: Personal Account : A single AP bill is created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form for all the expense claim lines           with positive amounts and a single AP debit adjustment is created on the same form for all           the expense claim lines with negative amounts. Corporate Card, Company Expense : An AP quick check is created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP304000|AP304000]) Quick Checks (AP304000) form for each expense claim line, if           the  Post Summarized Corporate Card Company Expenses  check box is           cleared on the  General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP101000|EP101000]) Time and Expenses Preferences (EP101000) form. If the  Post               Summarized Corporate Card Company Expenses  check box in selected, the             system creates a separate AP quick check for each group of the expense claim lines with             the same date, corporate card, and reference number. Corporate Card, Personal Expense : A single AP debit adjustment is created on the               ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments form for all the expense claim lines.

==Story==
Suppose that Jon Waite and Bill Owen—employees of the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company—can use a corporate credit card for charging their business expenses. Acting as an administrative user of SweetLife, you need to create an account, payment method, and cash account for company corporate cards as well as to create the corporate card itself in the system.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, the ''Expense Management'' feature has been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_30_00|Entry Types] ([~/?ScreenId=CA203000|CA203000]) form, the ''BANKFEE'' entry type has been added.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form, the accounts for Jon Waite and Bill Owen have been created.
==Process Overview==
To create a corporate card, you will first create a GL account on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_20_25_00|Chart of Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=GL202500|GL202500]) form. You the will create a payment method for the card on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_40_00|Payment Methods] ([~/?ScreenId=CA204000|CA204000]) form. The GL account and payment method you will specify for a cash account, which you will create on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_20_00|Cash Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CA202000|CA202000]) form. Finally, you will create a corporate credit card on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_25_00|Corporate Cards] ([~/?ScreenId=CA202500|CA202500]) form.
==System Preparation==
To sign in to the system, launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the U100 dataset preloaded as Kimberly Gibbs by using the ''gibbs'' username and the ''123'' password.
==Step 1: Creating a GL Account for a Corporate Card==

#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_20_25_00|Chart of Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=GL202500|GL202500]) form, and on the form toolbar, click '''Add Row'''.
#In the new line, create an account with the following settings:
#*'''Account''': <tt>29000</tt>
#*'''Account Class''': ''OTHCURLIAB''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Corporate Credit Card</tt>
#*'''Post Option''': ''Detail''
#Save the new account.

==Step 2: Creating a Payment Method==
To create a payment method for the corporate credit card, do the following:[anchor|#_cdad7d84-5bdf-470c-bf83-3264012dd14e]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_40_00|Payment Methods] ([~/?ScreenId=CA204000|CA204000]) form, and on the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record'''.
#In the Summary area, specify the following settings:
#*'''Payment Method ID''': <tt>CORPCC</tt>
#*'''Means of Payment''': ''Credit Card''

#*'''Use in AR''': Cleared
#*:This payment method is not going to be used for customer payments.
#*'''Require Remittance Information for Cash Account''': Cleared
#*:Remittance information is not required by this payment method for the related cash accounts.
#:Make sure that the '''Use in AP''' check box is selected.
#On the '''Settings for Use in AP''' tab, clear the '''Require Unique Payment Ref.''' check box in the '''Payment Settings''' section so that a unique payment reference number is not required for each payment document created with this payment method.
#:Make sure that '''Not Required''' is selected in the '''Additional Processing''' section. Payment documents created with this payment method do not require additional processing such as printing checks.
#Save the payment method.

==Step 3: Creating a Cash Account==
Create a cash account as follows:[anchor|#_c68dff2c-7259-41ac-a9d8-1aa7957116a7]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_20_00|Cash Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CA202000|CA202000]) form, and on the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record'''.
#In the Summary area, specify the following settings:
#*'''Cash Account''': <tt>29000</tt>

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Expense Receipts with Corporate Cards: Implementation Activity The following activity will walk you through the process of creating the necessary                 entities for processing of expense receipts with corporate credit cards. The following activity is             based on the  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system             settings have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the             activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100              dataset to its initial state. Story Suppose that Jon Waite and Bill Owen—employees of the  SweetLife Fruits & Jams company—can use a corporate credit card for charging their business expenses.                 Acting as an administrative user of  SweetLife, you need to create                 an account, payment method, and cash account for company corporate cards as well as                 to create the corporate card itself in the system. Configuration Overview For the purposes of this activity, the  Expense Management  feature has been                 enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA203000|CA203000]) Entry Types                 (CA203000) form, the  BANKFEE  entry type has been added. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) Employees                 (EP203000) form, the accounts for Jon Waite and Bill Owen have been created. Process Overview To create a corporate card, you will first create a GL account on the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL202500|GL202500]) Chart of Accounts (GL202500) form.                 You the will create a payment method for the card on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA204000|CA204000]) Payment Methods (CA204000) form.

==Story==
Suppose that the West BBQ Restaurant customer ordered a service of installation for previously bought juicers from the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company. The project accountant of SweetLife created a project to account for the provided services. Jon Waite, a SweetLife&rsquo;s employee, worked in a customer&rsquo;s restaurant installing a juicer on January 29, 2020, and it turned out that there was not enough electric cable. Jon went to a construction store and bought 20 meters of electric cable for $27 for which he paid with a company corporate card. He also bought a cup of coffee in a cafe near the store and paid $6 for it by the same corporate credit card. Then Jon took a taxi to return back for which he paid $10 by cash.{br}

The next day Alberto Jimenez, SweetLife&rsquo;s employee, went to a meeting with the customer to discuss a project. He took a taxi and paid $25 by a corporate card.{br}

Acting as Jon Waite, you will enter Jon&rsquo;s expenses into the system and filed a claim for the reimbursement of expenses. You will also enter Alberto Jimenez&rsquo;s expenses into the system.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, the ''Expense Management'' feature has been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, the ''WESTBBQ7'' project has been created and the ''INSTALL'' project task has been created for the project and configured as the default task. The cost budget of the project consists of a single line with 12 hours of installation.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, the ''CABLE'', ''MEAL'', and ''TAXI'' non-stock items with the ''Expense'' type have been created.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_25_00|Corporate Cards] ([~/?ScreenId=CA202500|CA202500]) form, the ''000001 - USD Corporate Card'' corporate card has been added, as described in [HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Expense_Receipts_Implem_Activity|Expense Receipts with Corporate Cards: Implementation Activity].{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form, the accounts for Jon Waite and Alberto Jimenez have been created.
==Process Overview==
First, you will create an expense receipt for paying electric cable by Jon Waite on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_10_10|Expense Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=EP301010|EP301010]) form. You then will create an expense claim, which will also include expenses for a taxi and coffee, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_10_00|Expense Claim] ([~/?ScreenId=EP301000|EP301000]) form. As the last step, you will create the second expense receipt for paying a taxi by Alberto Jimenez on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_10_10|Expense Receipts] form.
==System Preparation==
Do the following:[anchor|#_f811a610-8f11-49fe-9fd6-edb04d0e9b26]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as Jon Waite, a project manager, by using the ''waite'' username and the ''123'' password.
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''1/29/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select ''1/29/2020'' from the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.

==Step 1: Creating the First Expense Receipt==
To create an expense receipt to enter the purchase of electric cable, do the following:[anchor|#_b30c96b3-ac31-4b17-bf4a-586037bc0ad7]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_10_10|Expense Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=EP301010|EP301010]) form, and on the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record'''. 
#:The system opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_10_20|Expense Receipt] ([~/?ScreenId=EP301020|EP301020]) form.
#In the Summary area, select ''CABLE'' in the '''Expense Item''' box.
#:Make sure that the expense date is ''1/29/2020''.
#:Notice that ''EP00000003 - Jon Waite'' is selected in the '''Claimed by''' box.
#On the '''Receipt Details''' tab, specify the following settings:
#*'''Description''': <tt>Electric cable</tt>
#*'''Unit Cost''': <tt>27.00</tt>
#*'''Project/Contract''': ''WESTBBQ7''
#* '''Paid With''': ''Corporate Card, Company Expense''
#* '''Corporate Card''': ''000001 - USD Corporate Card''
#:When you select the project, the system automatically populates the '''Project Task''' box with the default task of the project, which is ''INSTALL''.
#Save the receipt.

==Step 2: Processing an Expense Claim for the Expense Receipt==
To claim the expense receipt you have created along with the cost of coffee and a taxi, do the following:[anchor|#_525ee06d-d82d-4b4b-9e1e-5750935bce4b]
#While you are still on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_10_20|Expense Receipt] ([~/?ScreenId=EP301020|EP301020]) form, on the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Claim'''. 
#:The [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_10_00|Expense Claim] ([~/?ScreenId=EP301000|EP301000]) form opens. On the '''Expense Claim Details''' tab, notice the line for the electric cable.
#On the table toolbar of the '''Expense Claim Details''' tab, click '''Add Row''', and specify the following settings in the new row (see the screenshot below):
#*'''Expense Item''': ''MEAL''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Coffee</tt>
#*'''Unit Cost''': <tt>6</tt>
#*'''Project/Contract''': ''WESTBBQ7''
#* '''Paid With''': ''Corporate Card, Personal Expense''
#* '''Corporate Card''': ''000001 - USD Corporate Card''
#:Notice that when you select ''Corporate Card, Personal Expense'' in the '''Paid With''' column, the system automatically populates the '''Project/Contract''' column with the non-project code (''X'') instead of the ''WESTBBQ7'' project you have selected and clears the '''Project Task''' column because you cannot classify personal expenses against a project.
#Click '''Add Row''', and specify the following settings in the new row:
#*'''Expense Item''': ''TAXI''
#* '''Description''': <tt>Taxi</tt>
#*'''Unit Cost''': <tt>10</tt>
#*'''Project/Contract''': ''WESTBBQ7''
#* '''Paid With''': ''Personal Account''[anchor|#_1e5e27e9-66cd-440a-99ea-a7c8719cf639][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_Projects_Expense_Receipts.png|popup|The expenses to be claimed|400px]
#Save the expense claim.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Submit'''.
#:The system assigns the ''Approved'' status to the claim.
#Click '''Actions''' > '''Release'''.
#:The system assigns the ''Released'' status to the claim.
#:On the '''Financial Details''' tab, review the documents that the system generated for the claim: a quick check for the cable, a debit adjustment for the coffee, and a bill for the taxi.

==Step 3: Creating the Second Expense Receipt==
To create an expense receipt to enter the amount spent on a taxi by Alberto Jimenez, do the following:[anchor|#_e3a13f77-6d47-4164-aa42-9164a530f445]
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, set the business date to ''1/30/2020''. 
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_10_10|Expense Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=EP301010|EP301010]) form, and on the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record'''. 
#:The system opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_10_20|Expense Receipt] ([~/?ScreenId=EP301020|EP301020]) form.
#In the Summary area, specify the following settings:
#*'''Expense Item''': ''TAXI''
#* '''Claimed by''': ''EP00000004 - Alberto Jimenez''
#On the '''Receipt Details''' tab, specify the following settings:
#*'''Description''': <tt>Taxi to the customer meeting</tt>
#*'''Unit Cost''': <tt>25.00</tt>
#*'''Project/Contract''': ''WESTBBQ7''
#* '''Paid With''': ''Corporate Card, Company Expense''
#* '''Corporate Card''': ''000001 - USD Corporate Card''
#Save the receipt.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''WESTBBQ7'' project.
#:On the '''Cost Budget''', notice that two lines have been added to the budget. The line with the ''CABLE'' item has the actual amount equals to ''27.00'' and the line with the ''TAXI'' item has the actual amount equals to ''10.00''. The system created these budget lines when the expense claim with the corresponding lines that refer to the project was released. Alberto Jimenez&rsquo;s expenses on a taxi have not been recorded to the project budget because these expenses have not been claimed yet.

On the table toolbar of the  Expense Claim Details  tab,                     click  Add Row , and specify the following settings in the                     new row (see the screenshot below): Expense Item :  MEAL Description :  Coffee Unit Cost :  6 Project/Contract :  WESTBBQ7 Paid With :  Corporate Card, Personal                                 Expense Corporate Card :  000001 - USD Corporate                                 Card Notice that when you select  Corporate Card, Personal Expense  in                         the  Paid With  column, the system automatically                         populates the  Project/Contract  column with the                         non-project code ( X ) instead of the  WESTBBQ7  project you have                         selected and clears the  Project Task  column because                         you cannot classify personal expenses against a project. Click  Add Row , and specify the following settings in the                     new row: Expense Item :  TAXI Description :  Taxi Unit Cost :  10 Project/Contract :  WESTBBQ7 Paid With :  Personal Account The expenses to be claimed Save the expense claim. On the form toolbar, click  Actions Submit . The system assigns the  Approved  status to the                         claim. Click  Actions Release . The system assigns the  Released  status to the                         claim. On the  Financial Details  tab, review the                         documents that the system generated for the claim: a quick check for the                         cable, a debit adjustment for the coffee, and a bill for the taxi. Step 3: Creating the Second Expense Receipt To create an expense receipt to enter the amount spent on a taxi by Alberto Jimenez,                 do the following: In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP screen, set the business date to  1/30/2020 .  Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP301010|EP301010]) Expense Receipts                     (EP301010) form, and on the form toolbar, click  Add New                         Record .  The system opens the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP301020|EP301020]) Expense Receipt                         (EP301020) form. In the Summary area, specify the following settings: Expense Item :  TAXI Claimed by :  EP00000004 - Alberto                             Jimenez On the  Receipt Details  tab, specify the following                         settings: Description :  Taxi to the customer                                 meeting Unit Cost :  25.00 Project/Contract :  WESTBBQ7 Paid With :  Corporate Card, Company                             Expense Corporate Card :  000001 - USD Corporate                                 Card Save the receipt. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM308000) form, open the  WESTBBQ7                          project. On the  Cost Budget , notice that two lines                         have been added to the budget. The line with the  CABLE  item has the                         actual amount equals to  27.00  and the line with the  TAXI  item                         has the actual amount equals to  10.00 . The system created these                         budget lines when the expense claim with the corresponding lines that refer                         to the project was released. Alberto Jimenez's expenses on a taxi have not                         been recorded to the project budget because these expenses have not been                         claimed yet. ]]></column>

You can maintain internal control over the corporate credit cards by performing regular reconciliations of the cash account configured for corporate cards. Generally, the goal of reconciliation is to find discrepancies between account balances tracked by different means, locate any errors, and make needed corrections or adjustments. Reconciliation is usually done at the end of each period or more frequently. For more information on the reconciliation process, see [HelpRoot_Financials\Finance_Bank_Reconciliation_GenInfo|Bank Reconciliation: General Information].
==Importing of Bank Transactions==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_30_65_00|Import Bank Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=CA306500|CA306500]) form, you upload bank statement records for the liability cash account of corporate cards. If a bank statement record contains the corporate card number in text format, this number is shown in the '''Card Number''' column on the form. A single bank statement may contain transactions of all the corporate cards associated with the same cash account. For more information about importing bank transactions, see [HelpRoot_Financials\Finance_Bank_Reconciliation_Preparation|Bank Reconciliation: Uploading and Processing of Bank Transactions] and [HelpRoot_Financials\CA__CON_ImportBankTrans|Importing Transactions].
==Processing of Imported Bank Transactions==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_30_60_00|Process Bank Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=CA306000|CA306000]) form, for the selected liability cash account configured for corporate cards, you match an uploaded bank statement record to an existing payment, AP bill, or expense receipt as well as create a cash transaction if such a transaction has not found in the system. For details about matching bank transactions, see [HelpRoot_Financials\CA__CON_ProcessingImportTrans|Processing Imported Transactions].{br}

When you click '''Auto-Match''' on the form toolbar, the system uses the available information about imported transactions for calculating the relevance rate, which is a measure of how closely a document matches the selected transaction and for searching for matching documents with the following priority:[anchor|#_48f77b83-8120-4db5-af3c-977db6d740e7]
#The system searches payments and invoices as matching candidates using the settings in the '''Weights for Relevance Calculation''' section of the '''Transaction Match Settings''' dialog box—'''Ref. Nbr. Weight''', '''Doc. Date Weight''', and '''Doc. Payee Weight'''. For more information about the matching process and the relevance calculation, see [HelpRoot_Financials\CA__CON_BankTran_MatchingSettings|Transaction Matching Settings].
#If no payment or invoice is found, the system searches expense receipts for matching candidates using certain settings in the '''Weights for Relevance Calculation''' and '''Expense Receipt Matching''' sections of the '''Transaction Match Settings''' dialog box—'''Ref. Nbr. Weight''', '''Doc. Date Weight''', and '''Amount Weight'''.

After the system has matched imported bank transactions on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_30_60_00|Process Bank Transactions] form, for a bank transaction selected in the left pane, in the right pane, the system shows the list of matching documents it has found. Payments are shown on the '''Match to Payments''' tab. AP documents are shown on the '''Match to Invoices''' tab. A cash transaction can be created for the bank transaction on the '''Create Payment''' tab. Expense receipts are shown on the '''Match to Expense Receipts''' tab, which is displayed on the form only for cash accounts that are used for corporate cards. The system selects the '''Matched''' check box for the best candidate among all the found candidates by using the following rules:[anchor|#_7f418d5f-ed7c-4488-8ae5-a73f30b0c5a7]
#The best match is the document with the highest match relevance that is greater than 0.75.
#If multiple documents have the same highest match relevance, the system selects the first found document with the following priority: a payment, an AP document, and an expense receipt.
#If no documents have a match relevance greater than 0.75, the best match is a document that has a match relevance is equal to or greater than 0.2.
#:For example, if the match relevance of one document is 0.25 and the match relevance of another document is 0.5, the system selects the document with the match relevance of 0.5.
#:If more than one document satisfies this condition, the system selects the first found document with the following priority: a payment, an AP document, and an expense receipt.
#If only one document is found, it is the best match if its match relevance is equal to or greater than 0.2.

If none of the conditions above has been met, there is no best match for the transaction of the bank statement.{br}

When the imported transactions are matched, you click '''Process''' on the toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_30_60_00|Process Bank Transactions] form to complete reconciliation. An expense receipt and its corresponding bank statement record that have been matched and processed are no longer displayed on the form.
==Limitations of the Matching Process==
There are the following limitations of the matching process on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_30_60_00|Process Bank Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=CA306000|CA306000]) form:[anchor|#_6d324446-8bc9-4029-8279-9ed730e76126]
*If you match a bank transaction to an expense receipt in a different currency with the amount within the amount difference threshold, release the corresponding claim, and the cash transaction is posted, and then you unmatch the bank transaction from the expense receipt, the cash transaction will not appear as a candidate for matching because the amounts differ.
*If a cash transaction originates from an expense claim, the cash transaction date in the system equals the expense claim date. There can be a significant delay between the date of the bank statement transaction and the date of the cash transaction in the system, which should be considered in the filter of dates in the '''Transaction Match Settings''' dialog box.

==Calculation of the Relevance Rate for Expense Receipts==
Unlike the relevance calculation for payments and invoices, for calculating the relevance rate for expense receipts on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_30_60_00|Process Bank Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=CA306000|CA306000]) form, the system includes in the calculation the amount weight instead of the payee weight, using the following formula:{br}

{{AmountDistance() = NORMDIST(x, 0, DifferenceAmount, probability mass function) / NORMDIST(0, 0, DifferenceAmount, probability mass function)}}{br}

{{x = ABS(BankTransactionAmount - ExpenseCardCurrencyAmount)}}{br}

{{DifferenceAmount = Amount Difference Threshold (%) * BankTransactionAmount / 100}}{br}

Payments and invoices are selected as matching candidates by the exact amount of a bank transaction, which is consistent to the logic of bank transaction matching for regular bank accounts. The '''Amount Difference Threshold (%)''' is not applied for matching of payments and invoices and applied for matching of expense receipts that are recorded with the expense currency that differs from the card currency and therefore a difference between the amount of a bank transaction and the amount of an expense receipt may take place.{br}

The {{AmountDistance()}} formula returns a floating number that ranges in value from ''0'' to ''1''.{br}

The system calculates the relevance rate for an expense receipt by using the following formula:{br}

{{Match Relevance = DocDateWeight*DateDistance() + RefNbrWeight*RefNbrDistance() + AmountWeight*AmountDistance()}}]]></column>
			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Expense Receipts with Corporate Cards: Bank Reconciliation You can maintain internal control over the corporate credit cards by performing regular         reconciliations of the cash account configured for corporate cards. Generally, the goal of         reconciliation is to find discrepancies between account balances tracked by different means,         locate any errors, and make needed corrections or adjustments. Reconciliation is usually         done at the end of each period or more frequently. For more information on the         reconciliation process, see  Bank Reconciliation: General Information. Importing of Bank Transactions On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA306500|CA306500]) Import Bank Transactions (CA306500) form, you upload bank         statement records for the liability cash account of corporate cards. If a bank statement         record contains the corporate card number in text format, this number is shown in the            Card Number  column on the form. A single bank statement may contain         transactions of all the corporate cards associated with the same cash account. For more         information about importing bank transactions, see  Bank Reconciliation: Uploading and Processing of Bank Transactions and  Importing Transactions. Processing of Imported Bank Transactions On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA306000|CA306000]) Process Bank Transactions (CA306000) form, for the selected         liability cash account configured for corporate cards, you match an uploaded bank statement         record to an existing payment, AP bill, or expense receipt as well as create a cash         transaction if such a transaction has not found in the system. For details about matching         bank transactions, see  Processing Imported Transactions. When you click  Auto-Match  on the form toolbar, the system uses the         available information about imported transactions for calculating the relevance rate, which         is a measure of how closely a document matches the selected transaction and for searching         for matching documents with the following priority: The system searches payments and invoices as matching candidates using the settings in           the  Weights for Relevance Calculation  section of the              Transaction Match Settings  dialog box— Ref. Nbr.             Weight ,  Doc. Date Weight , and  Doc. Payee             Weight .

Expense receipts         are shown on the  Match to Expense Receipts  tab, which is displayed on         the form only for cash accounts that are used for corporate cards. The system selects the            Matched  check box for the best candidate among all the found         candidates by using the following rules: The best match is the document with the highest match relevance that is greater than           0.75. If multiple documents have the same highest match relevance, the system selects the           first found document with the following priority: a payment, an AP document, and an           expense receipt. If no documents have a match relevance greater than 0.75, the best match is a document           that has a match relevance is equal to or greater than 0.2. For example, if the match             relevance of one document is 0.25 and the match relevance of another document is 0.5,             the system selects the document with the match relevance of 0.5. If more than one             document satisfies this condition, the system selects the first found document with the             following priority: a payment, an AP document, and an expense receipt.

==Story==
Suppose that employees of the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company used a corporate card related to the New York Bank. At the end of January, 2020, the New York Bank sent a monthly statement. Acting as SweetLife&rsquo;s accountant, you will reconcile this statement and process a bill for the bank in the system.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, the standard set of features has been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_20_25_00|Chart of Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=GL202500|GL202500]) form, the ''29000 - Corporate Credit Card'' account has been created. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_20_00|Cash Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CA202000|CA202000]) form, the ''29000'' cash account linked to the GL account has been created.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_25_00|Corporate Cards] ([~/?ScreenId=CA202500|CA202500]) form, the ''000001 - USD Corporate Card'' corporate card has been added, as described in [HelpRoot_Projects\Projects_Expense_Receipts_Implem_Activity|Expense Receipts with Corporate Cards: Implementation Activity].{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form, the ''NYBANK'' vendor account for the New York Bank has been created.
==Process Overview==
To reconcile a bank statement, you will first import bank transactions on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_30_65_00|Import Bank Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=CA306500|CA306500]) form. You will match the bank transactions with the transactions in the system on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_30_60_00|Process Bank Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=CA306000|CA306000]) form. You then will reconcile the bank statement on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_30_20_00|Reconciliation Statements] ([~/?ScreenId=CA302000|CA302000]) form. Finally, you will create a bill to pay the outstanding balance to the bank on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form.

Notice that the                         system has found documents with transactions that match the bank statement                         transactions. On the form toolbar, click  Process . On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA306500|CA306500]) Import Bank Transactions                     (CA306500) form, open the bank statement you have imported and notice that the                     transactions have been processed and matched—that is, the check boxes in the                          Matched  and  Processed  columns                     are selected. Step 3: Reconciling a Bank Statement Reconcile the bank statement as follows: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA302000|CA302000]) Reconciliation Statements                     (CA302000) form, and on the form toolbar, click  Add New                         Record . In the  Cash Account  box, select the  29000 - Corporate Credit Card                      account. In the table, for both uploaded rows, select the                          Reconciled  check box. In the Summary area, in the  Statement Balance  box,                     specify  -33 . Clear the  Hold  check box. On the form toolbar, click  Release . Step 4: Paying the Outstanding Balance to the Bank To create an accounts payable bill for the bank, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments                     (AP301000) form, and on the table toolbar, click  Add New                         Record . In the Summary area, specify the following settings: In the  Vendor  box, select  NYBANK . In the  Description  box, type  Bank account                                 settlement . Make sure that the bill date is  1/31/2020 . On the  Document Details  tab, add a row with the following settings: Branch :  HEADOFFICE Ext. Cost :  33.00 Account :  29000  (selected by default based on vendor                             settings) In the Summary area, clear the  Hold  check box. On the form toolbar, click  Release . You can now pay the bill and process the related documents in the system. ]]></column>

In Acumatica ERP, the billing procedure provides opportunities for grouping invoices and creating separate invoices depending on the project settings and the settings of billing rules.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
You will learn how to:[anchor|#ul_nwj_gch_tbb]
*Configure project billing to create a single invoice for the project or to create multiple separate invoices
*Bill the project with different billing rules assigned to the project tasks
*Bill a project task separately from the other tasks of the project
*Bill project transactions that are processed by particular steps of billing rules with a separate invoice

==Applicable Scenarios==
You bill a project with separate invoices if, for example, the customer has asked to provide a separate invoice for each project task, or you need to create a separate invoice based on the transactions of each account group.
==Grouping Invoices==
During the billing process, the system groups the billable amounts into invoices based on the following settings of project tasks specified on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Billing and Allocation Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form and settings of billing rules specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form:[anchor|#_8a99bcda-f0fc-41bb-91f2-3dc376410b41]
*The customer of a project task selected in the '''Customer''' box
*The customer&rsquo;s location of a project task selected in the '''Location''' box
*The originating branch the logic of which retrieval is described below
*The '''Bill Separately''' check box of a project task
*The '''Invoice Group''' of the billing rule, which is specified for a project task in the '''Billing Rule''' box

The system selects the originating branch for an invoice created during project billing by using the following priority:[anchor|#_75f48642-e592-4e3e-b91a-4d8645aaf5d6]
*For a pro forma invoice, the project branch specified in the '''Branch''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Billing and Allocation Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, if any. For an accounts receivable invoice, the system ignores the project branch.
*The shipping branch of the location selected in the project task, which is specified in the '''Shipping Branch''' box on the '''General Info''' tab ('''Location Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_20|Customer Locations] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303020|AR303020]) form, if any. (Therefore a number of invoices with different originating branches can be created for the same project if the project branch is not defined.)
*The shipping branch of the default location of the customer specified for the project task, if any.
*The current branch selected in the company and branch selection menu.

By default with no additional settings, the system creates a single invoice for a project even if the project tasks have different billing rules assigned.{br}

The system creates a separate invoice for a project task that has the selected '''Bill Separately''' check box in the '''Billing and Allocation Settings''' section on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form.{br}

The system also creates a separate invoice for all the billing steps of billing rules with the same '''Invoice Group''' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form. That is, if some tasks of a project have single or multiple billing rules with billing steps that have the same invoice group, during the project billing, the system creates a separate invoice for all the invoice lines created with these billing steps.]]></column>

))){br}{TOC}
==Story==
Suppose that the Thai Food Restaurant customer has ordered two juicers, along with the following services: site review, installation, and employee training on operating the juicers. The project accountant has created the project for these items and services. The juicers have been delivered and installed, and a consultant has provided the training.{br}

Acting as the project accountant, you need to bill the customer.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Project Accounting'' feature has been enabled to provide the support of project accounting functionality.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, the ''TOMYUM9'' project has been created.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) form, the ''PM00000005'' batch of project transactions related to the project has been created and released.
==Process Overview==
To bill a time and material project, you first review and configure project invoices with the billing rule on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form and with the project tasks on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. You then bill the project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. Finally, you review the created pro forma invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form.
==System Preparation==
Before you begin performing the steps of this activity, perform the following instructions to prepare the system:[anchor|#_6c9e4914-0e56-4fc0-9f9d-df880dcd99b6]
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the U100 dataset preloaded as Pam Brawner by using the ''brawner'' username and the ''123'' password.[anchor|#_b98267c7-bdfa-4793-b999-8b38ad674700]
#In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the Acumatica ERP screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to ''1/30/2020''. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and select ''1/30/2020'' on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and process all documents in the system during this business date.

==Step 1: Billing a Project with Multiple Billing Rules==
To bill the project with different billing rules assigned to the project tasks, do the following:[anchor|#_6c55e3eb-2ba3-45ea-a66f-4754be402562]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''TOMYUM9'' project.
#On the '''Cost Budget''' tab, review the cost budget of the project.
#On the '''Tasks''' tab, in the line with the ''PHASE2'' task, select the ''TM'' as the '''Billing Rule'''. When you bill the project, the system will use this billing rule to process unbilled transactions associated with this project task.
#Save your changes to the project.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Run Project Billing'''.
#:The system creates a pro forma invoice and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form.
#On the '''Time and Material''' tab, review the invoice lines and notice that lines related to all the project tasks are in the same invoice, even though the project tasks have different billing rules assigned.
#Delete the pro forma invoice, so you can bill this project again when you change the configuration of project billing.

==Step 2: Billing Project Tasks Separately==
To bill one of the project tasks separately from the other project tasks, do the following:[anchor|#_3e31345c-ad35-44c5-90a2-4d2aef197f49]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, open the ''TOMYUM9'' project.
#On the '''Tasks''' tab, do the following to add a needed table column to those displayed on the tab:
##In the table, click the Column Configuration button, the leftmost icon among the column headers. The system opens the '''Column Configuration''' dialog box in a pop-up window.
##In the '''Available Columns''' list of the dialog box, click the '''Bill Separately''' column.
##Click the Add Column button (the right arrow icon between the lists) to add the column to the '''Selected Columns''' list.
##Click '''OK''' to apply your changes to the list of columns and close the dialog box.
#In the row with the ''PHASE3'' task, select the check box in the '''Bill Separately''' column to bill the task with a separate invoice.
#Save your changes to the project.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Run Project Billing'''.
#:The system creates two pro forma invoices. One invoice includes the transactions related to the ''PHASE3'' project task, and the other invoice includes the transactions related to the other project tasks.
#Open and review each created pro forma invoice as follows:
##On the '''Invoices''' tab, click the link in the '''Pro Forma Reference Nbr.''' column to open the pro forma invoice.
##On the '''Time and Material''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form, which the system opens in a pop-up window, review the lines of the invoice.
##:Notice that one invoice has lines related to the ''PHASE1'' and ''PHASE2'' tasks, whereas the other invoice has lines related to only the ''PHASE3'' task.
##Close the pop-up window with the form.
#After you review both pro forma invoices in the previous step, delete the invoices to be able to bill the project again when you change the configuration of project invoices.

==Step 3: Grouping Invoices by Steps of Billing Rules==
To bill project transactions that are processed by particular steps of billing rules with a separate invoice, do the following:[anchor|#_6d5166ea-40e0-4605-94ac-8ea9f15e6e8f]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, open the ''TM'' billing rule.
#In the left pane, enter <tt>MATERIAL</tt> as the '''Invoice Group''' of the ''10 - Material cost plus markup'' step.
#:This step of the billing rule is used for time and material billing of transactions associated with the ''MATERIAL'' account group.
#Save your changes to the billing rule.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Grouping Invoices: Process Activity The following activity will walk you through the process of configuring                 project billing to create a single invoice for the project or to create multiple                 separate invoices. You will learn how to bill the project with different billing                 rules assigned to the project tasks, how to bill a project task separately from the                 other tasks of the project, and how to bill project transactions that are processed                 by particular steps of billing rules with a separate invoice. The following activity is             based on the  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system             settings have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the             activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100              dataset to its initial state. Story Suppose that the Thai Food Restaurant customer has ordered two juicers, along with                 the following services: site review, installation, and employee training on                 operating the juicers. The project accountant has created the project for these                 items and services. The juicers have been delivered and installed, and a consultant                 has provided the training. Acting as the project accountant, you need to bill the customer. Configuration Overview For the purposes of this activity, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000)                 form, the  Project Accounting  feature has been enabled to provide the support                 of project accounting functionality. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, the  TOMYUM9  project                 has been created. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) Project Transactions (PM304000) form, the  PM00000005  batch                 of project transactions related to the project has been created and released. Process Overview To bill a time and material project, you first review and configure project invoices                 with the billing rule on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules (PM207000) form and                 with the project tasks on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. You                 then bill the project on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form. Finally, you                 review the created pro forma invoice on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices                 (PM307000) form. System Preparation Before you begin performing the steps of this activity, perform the following                 instructions to prepare the system: Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in to a company with the U100 dataset preloaded as Pam                     Brawner by using the  brawner  username and the  123  password. In the info area, in the upper-right corner of the top pane of the  Acumatica ERP             screen, make sure that the business date in your system is set to  1/30/2020. If a different date is displayed, click the Business Date menu button, and             select  1/30/2020 on the calendar. For simplicity, in this activity, you will create and             process all documents in the system during this business date. Step 1: Billing a Project with Multiple Billing Rules To bill the project with different billing rules assigned to the project tasks, do                 the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, open the  TOMYUM9                      project. On the  Cost Budget  tab, review the cost budget of the                     project. On the  Tasks  tab, in the line with the  PHASE2                      task, select the  TM  as the  Billing Rule . When you                     bill the project, the system will use this billing rule to process unbilled                     transactions associated with this project task. Save your changes to the project. On the form toolbar, click  Run Project Billing . The                         system creates a pro forma invoice and opens it on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form. On the  Time and Material  tab, review the invoice lines                     and notice that lines related to all the project tasks are in the same invoice,                     even though the project tasks have different billing rules assigned. Delete the pro forma invoice, so you can bill this project again when you change                     the configuration of project billing. Step 2: Billing Project Tasks Separately To bill one of the project tasks separately from the other project tasks, do the                 following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, open the  TOMYUM9                      project. On the  Tasks  tab, do the following to add a needed table                     column to those displayed on the tab: In the table, click the Column Configuration button, the leftmost icon                             among the column headers. The system opens the  Column                                 Configuration  dialog box in a pop-up window. In the  Available Columns  list of the dialog box,                             click the  Bill Separately  column. Click the Add Column button (the right arrow icon between the lists) to                             add the column to the  Selected Columns  list. Click  OK  to apply your changes to the list of                             columns and close the dialog box. In the row with the  PHASE3  task, select the check box in the                          Bill Separately  column to bill the task with a                     separate invoice. Save your changes to the project. On the form toolbar, click  Run Project Billing . The                         system creates two pro forma invoices. One invoice includes the transactions                         related to the  PHASE3  project task, and the other invoice includes                         the transactions related to the other project tasks. Open and review each created pro forma invoice as follows: On the  Invoices  tab, click the link in the                                  Pro Forma Reference Nbr.  column to open the                             pro forma invoice. On the  Time and Material  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form, which the system opens in                             a pop-up window, review the lines of the invoice. Notice that one                                 invoice has lines related to the  PHASE1  and  PHASE2                                  tasks, whereas the other invoice has lines related to only the                                      PHASE3  task. Close the pop-up window with the form. After you review both pro forma invoices in the previous step, delete the                     invoices to be able to bill the project again when you change the configuration                     of project invoices. Step 3: Grouping Invoices by Steps of Billing Rules To bill project transactions that are processed by particular steps of billing rules                 with a separate invoice, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules (PM207000) form, open the  TM                      billing rule. In the left pane, enter  MATERIAL  as the                          Invoice Group  of the  10 - Material cost plus                         markup  step. This step of the billing rule is used for time and                         material billing of transactions associated with the  MATERIAL  account                         group. Save your changes to the billing rule. Open the  COMBINED  billing rule. In the left pane, enter  MATERIAL  as the                          Invoice Group  of the  20 - Material cost plus                         markup  step. This step of the billing rule is used for time and                         material billing of transactions associated with the  MATERIAL  account                         group. Save your changes to the billing rule. When you bill the project by using                         these billing rules, the system will group invoice lines created with the                         steps of the billing rules with the  MATERIAL  account group in a                         separate invoice. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, open the  TOMYUM9                      project. On the  Tasks  tab, make sure that the billing rule of the                          PHASE1  and  PHASE3  tasks is  COMBINED  and the billing                     rule of the  PHASE2  task is  TM . On the form toolbar, click  Run Project Billing . The                         system creates three pro forma invoices. The system has created one more                         separate invoice based on unbilled transactions with the  MATERIAL                          account group using the steps of the billing rules with the  MATERIAL                          invoice group. Open and review each created pro forma invoice as follows: On the  Invoices  tab, click the link in the                                  Pro Forma Reference Nbr.  column to open the                             pro forma invoice. On the  Time and Material  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form, which the system opens in                             a pop-up window, review the lines of the invoice. Close the pop-up window with the form. ]]></column>

((({S:Warn}The functionality of project approval is available only if the ''Approval Workflow'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
)))
==Approval of Projects==
To make approval required for projects, in the '''Approval Map''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form, you must specify the approval map to be used to assign projects to employees for approval. If no value is specified in the box, approval is not required. You can create an approval map by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_55_00|Assignment and Approval Maps] ([~/?ScreenId=EP205500|EP205500]) form; in the map, you can specify conditions for assigning projects to specific workgroups and particular employees for approval. {br}

If approval of projects is configured, once a user takes a project off hold, the system assigns the project the ''Pending Approval'' status and uses the rules defined by the approval map to assign the project to a workgroup or to a particular employee (in the workgroup) for approval. If no assignment occurs, the project gets the ''Active'' status. {br}

Once the project is assigned to a workgroup, any member of the workgroup can view the project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) form and approve or reject it. If the project is rejected, it gets the ''In Planning'' status. {br}

An approved project gets the ''Active'' status and becomes visible when users process project-related transactions.
==Approval of Time Activities==
To control completion of projects, you can assign a ''project manager'' to each project by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. If the same project manager will be assigned to most projects that are based on the same template, you can assign the project manager to the template on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_00|Project Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) form. The project manager is authorized to approve any time activities related to the project by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_70_10|Approve Time Activities] ([~/?ScreenId=EP507010|EP507010]) form.{br}

Once a project has been activated and approved, users can use project tasks to account for the time they worked on the project. For each project task, you can assign an approver—an employee who is authorized to approve time activities filed by employees working on the project. For a common task (a typical task not associated with any particular project template) added to the project, you can assign an approver on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_30|Common Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208030|PM208030]) form. For project-specific tasks, you can assign an approver to each task by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form. {br}

An employee appointed to be the approver of specific tasks can view the time activities associated with these tasks on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_70_10|Approve Time Activities] ([~/?ScreenId=EP507010|EP507010]) form. On this form, the project manager can view all the activities associated with all tasks of the project. The approver or project manager can apply a filter to the list of activities to find specific activities and to then approve or reject all of the listed activities.

Retainage is an amount held by a customer until a contractor finishes work. You can specify a retainage percent to be held by the customer of a project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. The system will use this retainage percent to automatically calculate the retained amount for each invoice issued for the project.
==Enabling Retainage==
To start using the functionality of retainage, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, an administrative user enables the ''Retainage Support'' feature and optionally the ''Payment Application by Line'' feature.{br}

If the ''Retainage Support'' feature is enabled, retainage can be calculated in one of the following ways:[anchor|#_c759ed05-c59b-4740-947c-707dcb8ee28d]
*As standard retainage: The standard processing of retainage.
*As standard retainage with steps: The standard processing of retainage that also allows users to specify a list of retainage percent values for the entire project to be applied in accordance with the project completion percent

If the ''Payment Application by Line'' feature is also enabled, retainage can be calculated as follows:[anchor|#_24e770a5-3fad-41bb-b42c-bea5384a6e3e]
*As project cap retainage: The retainage percent and cap are specified at the project level. The retainage amount is allocated across the billed lines until the maximum value is reached.
*As project cap retainage with steps: This retainage works as project cap retainage does, but a list of retainage percent values can be specified for the entire project to be applied in accordance with the project completion percent.
*As project item cap retainage: The retainage percent and cap are specified at the line level, and the retainage amount and maximum cap are calculated individually for each line.

==Default Retainage Settings==
You can specify default retainage settings for a project template in the '''Retainage''' section on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_00|Project Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) form. You can specify the retainage mode, retainage percent, cap percent, retainage steps, and whether change order amounts are to be included in the calculation of the contract total. The specified values will be used by default for all projects created based on this template. You can override the default values for each project (or specify new values, if no default values were defined on the template level) in the '''Retainage''' section on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form.{br}

When you select a customer for a new project, the system populates the '''Retainage %''' box in the '''Retainage''' section on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form with the '''Retainage Percent''' of the customer from the '''Retainage Settings''' section on the '''General Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form. When you change the customer of the project, the system suggests updating the '''Retainage %''' with the retainage percentage of the selected customer.
==Retainage in Revenue Budget==
When you save your changes after specifying a retainage percent for a project, the system calculates the retainage amount for each revenue budget line of the project according to the specified percent. You can manually override the retainage percent for each revenue budget line on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form.{br}

When you manually adjust the retainage percentage of a project in the '''Retainage (%)''' box in the '''Retainage''' section on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the system suggests updating the retainage percentage of the revenue budget lines of the project.
==Retainage Tracking in Progress Billing==
The way retainage is processed during the progress billing depends on settings selected in the '''Retainage''' section of the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form: what retainage mode is selected for the project and whether the '''Use Steps''' check box is selected or cleared.{br}

For the ''Standard'' retainage mode with the '''Use Steps''' check box cleared for the project, the retainage percent specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form (also in the '''Retainage''' section of the '''Summary''' tab) is used by default for revenue budget lines and for the lines of AR invoices related to the project, which originate from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form. The user can update the retainage percent at any time.{br}

This scenario is applicable if the ''Retainage Support'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

For the ''Standard'' retainage mode with the '''Use Steps''' check box selected for the project, the user specifies a retainage percent for a particular project completion threshold in the '''Stepped Retainage''' table in the '''Retainage''' section of the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. During the billing, the retainage percent that corresponds to the current project completion percent is used for revenue budget lines and for the lines of AR invoices related to the project, which originate from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] form{br}

This scenario is applicable if the ''Retainage Support'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form.{br}

For the ''Contract Cap'' retainage mode with the '''Use Steps''' check box cleared for the project, the functionality works as follows:[anchor|#_473c85d4-f67e-4dfb-bb85-940aaa54ab36]
#On the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the user specifies values in the '''Retainage (%)''' and '''Cap (%)''' boxes and selects or clears the '''Include CO''' check box depending on whether the contract total and project completion percent should be calculated based on the original revenue budget values or the revised ones.
#The system calculates the cap amount, which is the maximum retainage amount that can be held for the project, as follows:
#:{{Cap Amount = '''Contract Total''' * '''Cap (%)''' * '''Retainage (%)'''}}
#Progress billing with a pro forma invoice is performed for the project, the total retained amount held per project is validated for each pro forma invoice, and the retainage amount is calculated.
#Once the cap is reached and the total retained amount held per project is at its maximum, no new retainage amount is calculated, and reallocation of the allocated retained amount is performed based on the weight of the invoice lines.

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_51_00_00|Release AR Retainage] ([~/?ScreenId=AR510000|AR510000]) form, invoice lines can be filtered by various criteria, such as project, project task, account group, inventory ID, and cost code. On this form, the user can gradually release the retainage held to clear the unreleased retainage balance held on the AR invoice lines, thus decreasing the total retained amount held per project. Several retainage invoices may be generated during the processing because the lines are grouped by the parent AR invoice, and each retainage invoice can relate to only one AR invoice. In this case, the progress billing procedure follows the same rules so that the total retained amount would tend toward the cap amount once again. {br}

The scenario of releasing retainage by AR invoice lines and using the ''Contract Cap'' retainage mode is applicable if the ''Retainage Support'' and ''Payment Application by Line'' features are enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form, the '''Create Pro Forma on Billing''' check box is selected for the project on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, and the '''Pay by Line''' check box is selected for the AR invoice on the '''Financial Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] form.{br}

For the ''Contract Cap'' retainage mode with the '''Use Steps''' check box selected for the project, the scenario is similar to the previous one, but instead of a single retainage percent, the user can specify multiple retainage percent values that correspond to particular thresholds of project completion. If the project completion reaches a threshold and the retainage percent is changed, the system recalculates the cap amount, and the current and further billing iterations will be validated against the newly calculated cap figures.{br}

This scenario is applicable if the ''Retainage Support'' and ''Payment Application by Line'' features are enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form and the '''Create Pro Forma on Billing''' check box is selected for the project on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form.{br}

For the ''Contract Item Cap'' retainage mode, the scenario is similar to that for the ''Contract Cap'' retainage mode with the '''Use Steps''' check box cleared for the project, but it is performed for each line individually.{br}

This scenario is applicable if the ''Retainage Support'' and ''Payment Application by Line'' features are enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form and the '''Create Pro Forma on Billing''' check box is selected for the project on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form.((({S:Warn}For the ''Contract Cap'' and ''Contract Item Cap'' retainage modes, the '''Pay by Line''' check box is automatically selected and unavailable for editing on the '''Financial Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] form for AR invoices that originate from pro forma invoices.
)))
==Retainage Tracking in Time and Material Billing==
For time and material billing, the retainage percent is copied from the '''Retainage %''' box on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form and can be overridden. The time and material billing also supports the ''Standard'' retainage mode with the '''Use Steps''' check box selected in the retainage settings of the project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form.
==Retainage in AR Invoices==
The system generates the AR invoice based on the pro forma invoice or project transactions, depending on the billing workflow configured for the project. If draft invoice (pro forma) workflow is used, the retained amounts are copied from pro forma to the AR invoice once the latter is created, otherwise the retained amount is copied from a corresponding project transaction. The generated invoice with retainage is listed among other invoices for the project on the '''Invoices''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. Also, on this tab, you can initiate release of the retainage of the invoice by clicking the row of the invoice in the table and then clicking the '''Release Retainage''' button on the table toolbar.
==Retainage in Commitments==
The following amounts of a commitment that originate from the purchase order line always include the retained amount on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_60_00|Commitments] ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) form even if the corresponding purchase order line has the amount after retainage in the '''Amount''' column on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form:[anchor|#ul_hgb_znn_ldb]
*'''Original Committed Amount''': The amount originates from the '''Ext. Cost''' of the purchase order line that includes the retained amount.
*'''Committed Open Amount''': The amount originates from the '''Open Amount''' of the purchase order line that includes the retained amount.
*'''Revised Committed Amount''': The amount originates from the '''Ext. Cost''' of the purchase order line that includes the retained amount.

The other commitment amounts are calculated based on the amounts listed above—that is, the commitment amounts include the retained amount if any.
==Limitations of the Retainage Processing==
The following limitations apply to the retainage processing.{br}

The ''Contract Cap'' and ''Contract Item Cap'' retainage modes are available for selection only if the ''Retainage Support'' and ''Payment Application by Line'' features are enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. For these modes, the '''Pay by Line''' check box on the '''Financial Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form is selected and unavailable for editing for all AR invoices generated during the project billing.{br}

The ''Contract Cap'' retainage mode can be selected only if the '''Create Pro Forma on Billing''' check box is selected for the project on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form.{br}

Retainage with foreign currency documents is not supported. As a result, the base currency should be used as the billing currency. If a foreign currency is used as the project currency, the system will not be able to generate a pro forma invoice for the project.

As standard retainage with steps: The standard processing of retainage that also allows           users to specify a list of retainage percent values for the entire project to be applied           in accordance with the project completion percent If the  Payment Application by Line  feature is also enabled, retainage can be         calculated as follows: As project cap retainage: The retainage percent and cap are specified at the project           level. The retainage amount is allocated across the billed lines until the maximum value           is reached.

As project item cap retainage: The retainage percent and cap are specified at the line           level, and the retainage amount and maximum cap are calculated individually for each           line. Default Retainage Settings You can specify default retainage settings for a project template in the            Retainage  section on the  Summary  tab of the             ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) Project Templates (PM208000) form. You can specify the retainage mode,         retainage percent, cap percent, retainage steps, and whether change order amounts are to be         included in the calculation of the contract total. The specified values will be used by         default for all projects created based on this template. You can override the default values         for each project (or specify new values, if no default values were defined on the template         level) in the  Retainage  section on the  Summary          tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. When you select a customer for a new project, the system populates the  Retainage           %  box in the  Retainage  section on the            Summary  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form with the            Retainage Percent  of the customer from the  Retainage           Settings  section on the  General Info  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000) form. When you change the customer of         the project, the system suggests updating the  Retainage %  with the         retainage percentage of the selected customer. Retainage in Revenue Budget When you save your changes after specifying a retainage percent for a project, the system         calculates the retainage amount for each revenue budget line of the project according to the         specified percent. You can manually override the retainage percent for each revenue budget         line on the  Revenue Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects         (PM301000) form. When you manually adjust the retainage percentage of a project in the  Retainage           (%)  box in the  Retainage  section on the            Summary  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, the system         suggests updating the retainage percentage of the revenue budget lines of the project. Retainage Tracking in Progress Billing The way retainage is processed during the progress billing depends on settings selected in         the  Retainage  section of the  Summary  tab of         the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form: what retainage mode is         selected for the project and whether the  Use Steps  check box is         selected or cleared. For the  Standard  retainage mode with the  Use Steps  check box         cleared for the project, the retainage percent specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form (also in the  Retainage          section of the  Summary  tab) is used by default for revenue budget         lines and for the lines of AR invoices related to the project, which originate from the             ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form. The user can update the         retainage percent at any time. This scenario is applicable if the  Retainage Support  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. For the  Standard  retainage mode with the  Use Steps  check box         selected for the project, the user specifies a retainage percent for a particular project         completion threshold in the  Stepped Retainage  table in the            Retainage  section of the  Summary  tab of the             ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form. During the billing, the retainage         percent that corresponds to the current project completion percent is used for revenue         budget lines and for the lines of AR invoices related to the project, which originate from         the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos form This scenario is applicable if the  Retainage Support  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features form. For the  Contract Cap  retainage mode with the  Use Steps  check         box cleared for the project, the functionality works as follows: On the  Summary  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, the user specifies values in the              Retainage (%)  and  Cap (%)  boxes and           selects or clears the  Include CO  check box depending on whether the           contract total and project completion percent should be calculated based on the original           revenue budget values or the revised ones. The system calculates the cap amount, which is the maximum retainage amount that can be           held for the project, as follows: Cap Amount =  Contract                 Total  *  Cap (%)  *  Retainage                 (%) Progress billing with a pro forma invoice is performed for the project, the total           retained amount held per project is validated for each pro forma invoice, and the           retainage amount is calculated. Once the cap is reached and the total retained amount held per project is at its           maximum, no new retainage amount is calculated, and reallocation of the allocated retained           amount is performed based on the weight of the invoice lines. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR510000|AR510000]) Release AR Retainage (AR510000) form, invoice lines can be         filtered by various criteria, such as project, project task, account group, inventory ID,         and cost code.

For the  Contract Cap  retainage mode with the  Use Steps  check         box selected for the project, the scenario is similar to the previous one, but instead of a         single retainage percent, the user can specify multiple retainage percent values that         correspond to particular thresholds of project completion. If the project completion reaches         a threshold and the retainage percent is changed, the system recalculates the cap amount,         and the current and further billing iterations will be validated against the newly         calculated cap figures. This scenario is applicable if the  Retainage Support  and  Payment Application by           Line  features are enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features form and         the  Create Pro Forma on Billing  check box is selected for the project         on the  Summary  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form. For the  Contract Item Cap  retainage mode, the scenario is similar to that for the            Contract Cap  retainage mode with the  Use Steps  check box         cleared for the project, but it is performed for each line individually. This scenario is applicable if the  Retainage Support  and  Payment Application by           Line  features are enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features form and         the  Create Pro Forma on Billing  check box is selected for the project         on the  Summary  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form. For the  Contract Cap  and  Contract Item Cap  retainage modes, the            Pay by Line  check box is automatically selected and unavailable for         editing on the  Financial Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos form for AR invoices that originate from pro forma         invoices. Retainage Tracking in Time and Material Billing For time and material billing, the retainage percent is copied from the            Retainage %  box on the  Summary  tab of the             ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form and can be overridden. The time and         material billing also supports the  Standard  retainage mode with the  Use           Steps  check box selected in the retainage settings of the project on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. Retainage in AR Invoices The system generates the AR invoice based on the pro forma invoice or project transactions,         depending on the billing workflow configured for the project. If draft invoice (pro forma)         workflow is used, the retained amounts are copied from pro forma to the AR invoice once the         latter is created, otherwise the retained amount is copied from a corresponding project         transaction. The generated invoice with retainage is listed among other invoices for the         project on the  Invoices  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects         form. Also, on this tab, you can initiate release of the retainage of the invoice by         clicking the row of the invoice in the table and then clicking the  Release           Retainage  button on the table toolbar. Retainage in Commitments The following amounts of a commitment that originate from the purchase order line always         include the retained amount on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) Commitments (PM306000) form even         if the corresponding purchase order line has the amount after retainage in the            Amount  column on the  Document Details  tab of         the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form: Original Committed Amount : The amount originates from the              Ext. Cost  of the purchase order line that includes the retained           amount. Committed Open Amount : The amount originates from the              Open Amount  of the purchase order line that includes the retained           amount. Revised Committed Amount : The amount originates from the              Ext. Cost  of the purchase order line that includes the retained           amount. The other commitment amounts are calculated based on the amounts listed above—that is, the         commitment amounts include the retained amount if any. Limitations of the Retainage Processing The following limitations apply to the retainage processing. The  Contract Cap  and  Contract Item Cap  retainage modes are available for         selection only if the  Retainage Support  and  Payment Application by Line          features are enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form.         For these modes, the  Pay by Line  check box on the            Financial Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form is selected and unavailable for         editing for all AR invoices generated during the project billing. The  Contract Cap  retainage mode can be selected only if the  Create Pro           Forma on Billing  check box is selected for the project on the            Summary  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects         (PM301000) form. Retainage with foreign currency documents is not supported. As a result, the base currency         should be used as the billing currency. If a foreign currency is used as the project         currency, the system will not be able to generate a pro forma invoice for the project. ]]></column>

With the ''Multi-Currency Projects'' feature, you can track a project in the project currency, which can differ from the base currency. You can do the following:[anchor|#_53c525fe-9cfd-4942-ab5a-35077ea26f1e]
*Manage project budgets in the project currency
*Review actual revenues, actual costs, and committed costs in the project currency, with an ability to calculate project profitability in both the project currency and the base currency, and present costs to the customer in the customer&rsquo;s currency
*Track actual balances in the base currency at the historical exchange rate
*Track cost commitments in the project currency at the historical exchange rate
*Track change orders for budgeted amounts in the project currency
*Create change orders for commitments in a currency that differs from the base currency and the project currency
*Bill projects by using progress billing based on the revenue budget that is defined in the project currency
*Apply the exchange rates of the project currency to time and material transactions billed by quantity
*Add markup to billable amounts in the project currency during time and material billing
*Re-bill the exact amount of an expense in a foreign currency if the currency of the expense transaction is the same as the project currency in which the project is billed, which can be useful to re-bill travel expenses incurred during visits to the customer
*Plan budgets by financial period and create budget forecasts in the project currency to compare actual budgets and change order amounts with monthly budgets
*Create a project quote in a foreign currency and convert the quote to a project in this currency

The functionality of multicurrency project accounting is available only if the ''Multi-Currency Projects'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. The ''Multi-Currency Projects'' feature can be enabled only if the ''Multi-Currency Accounting'' feature has been enabled.{br}{TOC}
==Configuration of Exchange Rates==
Projects in a foreign currency use currency exchange rates that are configured and maintained on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CM_30_10_00|Currency Rates] ([~/?ScreenId=CM301000|CM301000]) form. For more information on managing exchange rates, see [HelpRoot_Financials\Multicurrency_Configuring_Rates_GeneralInfo|Configuring Rates: General Information].{br}

For multicurrency accounting in projects, as the default rate type, the system uses the rate type specified in the '''PM Rate Type''' box ('''Default Rate Types''' section) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CM_10_10_00|Currency Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) form.[anchor|#section_fdf_x42_p2b]
==Projects with Multicurrency Accounting==
Projects can have configurable currencies on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. If the project currency differs from the base currency, you can track the project in both the base currency and the project currency.{br}

For a new project created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the system fills in the '''Project Currency''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Project Properties''' section) with the customer&rsquo;s currency, which is selected in the '''Currency ID''' box on the '''General Info''' tab ('''Financial Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form. If the customer has no currency defined, the base currency is selected as the '''Project Currency'''. You can change the '''Project Currency''' if the project has no transactions, commitments, and change orders.{br}

The system selects the project currency in the '''Billing Currency''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Billing and Allocation Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. This currency is used as the currency of the invoices created during the project billing. You can select any currency as the '''Billing Currency''' if the project currency is the base currency.{br}

The following table lists possible configurations for common business scenarios.[anchor|#_f9daa89e-499f-4a66-8fb3-eae1fc03f603]

The '''Currency Rate for Budget''' (in the Summary area) is the exchange rate that is used to display amounts in the project and base currencies on the '''Revenue Budget''', '''Cost Budget''', and '''Balances''' tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. By default, this is the exchange rate of the rate type selected in the '''Currency Rate Type''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Project Properties''' section). If this box is cleared, which is the default value, the system uses the default rate type of projects specified in the '''PM Rate Type''' box ('''Default Rate Types''' section) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CM_10_10_00|Currency Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) form.{br}

You can click the exchange rate value in the '''Currency Rate for Budget''' box in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. Then in the '''Rate Selection''' dialog box, which is opened, you can override the exchange rate for the project if the '''Enable Rate Override''' check box is selected on the '''General Info''' tab ('''Financial Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form.{br}

By default, on the '''Revenue Budget''', '''Cost Budget''', and '''Balances''' tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the system shows the amounts in the project currency. You can enter the amounts in the project currency only. If you click the '''View Base''' button in the '''Currency Rate for Budget''' box in the Summary area, the system shows the budgeted amounts and balances in the base currency converted based on the rate shown in the '''Currency Rate for Budget''' box. To show the amounts in the project currency, you click the '''View Cury''' button in the '''Currency Rate for Budget''' box in the Summary area.{br}

Only amounts in the '''Hist. Actual Amount in Base Currency''' column on the '''Revenue Budget''', '''Cost Budget''', and '''Balances''' tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form are always shown in the base currency.
==Project Transactions with Multicurrency Accounting==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) form, you can create project transactions with the amount in any foreign currency. The system converts the amount of these transactions in the project currency, which is specified in the '''Project Currency''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Project Properties''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form.{br}

The '''Project Currency Rate''' of the project transaction is defined by the project-specific rate type selected in the '''Currency Rate Type''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Project Properties''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. If the project has no rate type selected, the system uses the default rate type of projects specified in the '''PM Rate Type''' box ('''Default Rate Types''' section) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CM_10_10_00|Currency Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) form.{br}

You enter the amount of the project transaction in the transaction currency. The system uses this amount in the transaction currency to calculate the transaction amounts in the project currency and in the base currency. The transaction amount in the base currency is not shown on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] form. The system also updates the actual amounts of the project budget in the project currency and in the base currency with the corresponding amounts of the project transaction.{br}

When the system creates a project transaction based on a general ledger transaction, the amount in the transaction currency and the amount in the base currency are copied from the general ledger transaction to the project transaction. The corresponding amount in the project currency of the project transaction is calculated based on the amount in the transaction currency. (See the following diagram.)[anchor|#_660d9149-36ce-4111-9fec-df590787dd2f][anchor|#_0c192b0f-5f24-45b4-b656-db53ca11d985][image:UserGuide/Images/Project_Multi_Currency2.png|popup|A project transaction created based on a GL transaction|300px]
When the system creates a general ledger transaction based on a project transaction, the amount in the transaction currency and the amount in the base currency are copied from the project transaction to the general ledger transaction, as the following diagram illustrates.[anchor|#_d0b16557-a678-4ce0-8593-833dfda5306d][anchor|#_7dd2a10e-f98e-4cea-a7dd-9044c25868aa][image:UserGuide/Images/Project_Multi_Currency3.png|popup|A GL transaction created based on a project transaction|300px]
==Invoices for Projects with Multicurrency Accounting==
During project billing, the system creates pro forma or accounts receivable invoices in the billing currency of the project specified in the '''Billing Currency''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Billing and Allocation Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form.{br}

The exchange rate for the invoice is defined by the project-specific rate type selected in the '''Currency Rate Type''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Project Properties''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. If the project has no rate type selected, the system uses the default rate type of projects specified in the '''PM Rate Type''' box ( '''Default Rate Types''' section) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CM_10_10_00|Currency Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) form.{br}

You can override the exchange rate for an invoice if for the customer, the '''Enable Rate Override''' check box is selected on the '''General Info''' tab ('''Financial Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form.{br}

All the invoice amounts can be reviewed in both the invoice currency and the base currency.
==Billing Process with Multicurrency Accounting==
During the billing process, the system produces amounts in the project currency. Then the amounts are converted into the billing currency of the project.{br}

If the {{@Price}} parameter is used in a time and material step of a billing rule on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, during the billing process with this billing rule, the system looks for the price in the project currency. If the price in the project currency is not found, the system converts the price from the base currency by using the exchange rate defined by the rate type of the project.{br}

If the {{@Rate}} parameter is used in a time and material step of a billing rule on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] form, during the billing process with this billing rule, the system retrieves the rate as is for use in the user-defined formulas of the billing rule. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] form, in formulas of time and material steps of a billing rule, you can convert an amount retrieved with the {{@Rate}} parameter by using the {{ConvertAmountToCurrency()}} function.{br}

The {{Report.ConvertAmountToCurrency(fromCuryID, toCuryID, rateType, effectiveDate, value)}} function has the following parameters:[anchor|#_8996a5fd-2fe8-4844-a643-507ac7ae8f12]
*{{fromCuryID}}: The source currency in which the {{@Rate}} has been defined
*{{toCuryID}}: The project currency
*{{rateType}}: The rate type of the project
*{{effectiveDate}}: The date on which the exchange rate is effective
*{{value}}: The amount to be converted

To re-bill an amount in the project currency as is, in the formula of a time and material step of a billing rule on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, you can use the following data field: {{[PMTran.ProjectCuryAmount]}}. {{PMTran.Amount}} is the amount in the base currency. {{PMTran.TranCuryAmount}} is the amount in the transaction currency. 
==Cost Commitments with Multicurrency Accounting==
The system creates commitments for a project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_60_00|Commitments] ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) form in the project currency.{br}

The exchange rate from the document currency to the project currency for the creation of the commitment is defined by the project-specific rate type selected in the '''Currency Rate Type''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Project Properties''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. If the project has no rate type selected, the system uses the default rate type of projects specified in the '''PM Rate Type''' box ( '''Default Rate Types''' section) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CM_10_10_00|Currency Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) form.
==Change Orders with Multicurrency Accounting==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) form, in the Summary area and on the '''Revenue Budget''' and '''Cost Budget''' tabs, amounts are shown in the project currency, which is specified in the '''Project Currency''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Project Properties''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. On the '''Commitments''' tab, amounts of change order lines are shown in the currency of the corresponding purchase orders.
==Project Quotes with Multicurrency Accounting==
For a new project quote created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) form, the system fills in the '''Currency''' box in the Summary area with the business account&rsquo;s currency selected in the '''Currency ID''' box on the '''General Info''' tab ('''Financial Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form. If no currency is defined for the customer, the base currency is selected as the project quote currency.{br}

If a project quote is created based on an opportunity selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) form, the system selects the opportunity currency as the project quote currency.{br}

You can change the project quote currency if for the customer, the '''Enable Currency Override''' check box is selected on the '''General Info''' tab ('''Financial Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form. If you change the project quote currency and the project quote is the primary quote of an opportunity, the system changes the opportunity currency accordingly.{br}

For project quotes, the system uses the exchange rate of the default rate type of projects specified in the '''PM Rate Type''' box ('''Default Rate Types''' section) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CM_10_10_00|Currency Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) form. You can override the exchange rate for a project quote if for the customer, the '''Enable Rate Override''' check box is selected on the '''General Info''' tab ('''Financial Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form.{br}

For the estimation lines of a project quote, the system converts the retrieved unit prices and unit costs of the selected inventory items to the project quote currency by using the exchange rate of the project quote.{br}

Although all the project quote amounts can be reviewed in both the project quote currency and the base currency, you can edit the amounts only in the project quote currency.{br}

When a project is created based on the project quote, the system copies to the project the project quote currency, the exchange rate of the project quote, and the price and cost information from the project quote in the project currency.

The  Multi-Currency Projects  feature can be enabled only if the            Multi-Currency Accounting  feature has been enabled. Configuration of Exchange Rates Projects in a foreign currency use currency exchange rates that are configured and         maintained on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CM301000|CM301000]) Currency Rates (CM301000) form. For more         information on managing exchange rates, see  Configuring Rates: General Information. For multicurrency accounting in projects, as the default rate type, the system uses the         rate type specified in the  PM Rate Type  box ( Default Rate           Types  section) on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) Currency Management Preferences (CM101000)         form. Projects with Multicurrency Accounting Projects can have configurable currencies on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. If the project currency differs from the base currency, you can track         the project in both the base currency and the project currency. For a new project created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, the         system fills in the  Project Currency  box on the            Summary  tab ( Project Properties  section)         with the customer's currency, which is selected in the  Currency ID          box on the  General Info  tab ( Financial           Settings  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers         (AR303000) form. If the customer has no currency defined, the base currency is selected as         the  Project Currency . You can change the  Project           Currency  if the project has no transactions, commitments, and change         orders. The system selects the project currency in the  Billing Currency  box         on the  Summary  tab ( Billing and Allocation           Settings  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form.         This currency is used as the currency of the invoices created during the project billing.         You can select any currency as the  Billing Currency  if the project         currency is the base currency. The following table lists possible configurations for common business scenarios. Business Scenario Possible Configuration Base Currency Project Currency Billing Currency A company performs projects for local clients only. The project currency equals the base currency. All currencies are the                 same. USD USD USD A company performs projects for local clients but can occasionally have a                 project for a foreign client. The project currency equals the base currency. The billing currency differs                 from the project currency and the base currency. USD USD EUR A company performs projects for local and foreign clients. The project currency differs from the base currency. The billing currency                 always equals the project currency. USD EUR EUR only The  Currency Rate for Budget  (in the Summary area) is the exchange         rate that is used to display amounts in the project and base currencies on the            Revenue Budget ,  Cost Budget , and            Balances  tabs of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects         form. By default, this is the exchange rate of the rate type selected in the            Currency Rate Type  box on the  Summary  tab           ( Project Properties  section). If this box is cleared, which is the         default value, the system uses the default rate type of projects specified in the            PM Rate Type  box ( Default Rate Types          section) on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) Currency Management Preferences (CM101000) form. You can click the exchange rate value in the  Currency Rate for           Budget  box in the Summary area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form. Then in the  Rate           Selection  dialog box, which is opened, you can override the exchange rate for         the project if the  Enable Rate Override  check box is selected on the            General Info  tab ( Financial Settings          section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers form. By default, on the  Revenue Budget ,  Cost           Budget , and  Balances  tabs of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, the system shows the amounts in the project         currency. You can enter the amounts in the project currency only. If you click the            View Base  button in the  Currency Rate for           Budget  box in the Summary area, the system shows the budgeted amounts and         balances in the base currency converted based on the rate shown in the  Currency           Rate for Budget  box. To show the amounts in the project currency, you click         the  View Cury  button in the  Currency Rate for           Budget  box in the Summary area. Only amounts in the  Hist. Actual Amount in Base Currency  column on         the  Revenue Budget ,  Cost Budget , and            Balances  tabs of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects         form are always shown in the base currency. Project Transactions with Multicurrency Accounting On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) Project Transactions (PM304000) form, you can create project         transactions with the amount in any foreign currency. The system converts the amount of         these transactions in the project currency, which is specified in the  Project           Currency  box on the  Summary  tab ( Project           Properties  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects         (PM301000) form. The  Project Currency Rate  of the project transaction is defined by         the project-specific rate type selected in the  Currency Rate Type  box         on the  Summary  tab ( Project Properties          section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form. If the project has no         rate type selected, the system uses the default rate type of projects specified in the            PM Rate Type  box ( Default Rate Types          section) on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) Currency Management Preferences (CM101000) form. You enter the amount of the project transaction in the transaction currency. The system         uses this amount in the transaction currency to calculate the transaction amounts in the         project currency and in the base currency. The transaction amount in the base currency is         not shown on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) Project Transactions form. The system also updates         the actual amounts of the project budget in the project currency and in the base currency         with the corresponding amounts of the project transaction. When the system creates a project transaction based on a general ledger transaction, the         amount in the transaction currency and the amount in the base currency are copied from the         general ledger transaction to the project transaction. The corresponding amount in the         project currency of the project transaction is calculated based on the amount in the         transaction currency. (See the following diagram.) A project transaction created based on a GL transaction When the system creates a general ledger transaction based on a project transaction, the         amount in the transaction currency and the amount in the base currency are copied from the         project transaction to the general ledger transaction, as the following diagram         illustrates. A GL transaction created based on a project transaction Invoices for Projects with Multicurrency Accounting During project billing, the system creates pro forma or accounts receivable invoices in the         billing currency of the project specified in the  Billing Currency  box         on the  Summary  tab ( Billing and Allocation           Settings  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects         (PM301000) form. The exchange rate for the invoice is defined by the project-specific rate type selected in         the  Currency Rate Type  box on the  Summary  tab           ( Project Properties  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form. If the project has no rate type selected, the         system uses the default rate type of projects specified in the  PM Rate           Type  box (  Default Rate Types  section) on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) Currency Management Preferences (CM101000) form. You can override the exchange rate for an invoice if for the customer, the            Enable Rate Override  check box is selected on the            General Info  tab ( Financial Settings          section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers form. All the invoice amounts can be reviewed in both the invoice currency and the base         currency. Billing Process with Multicurrency Accounting During the billing process, the system produces amounts in the project currency. Then the         amounts are converted into the billing currency of the project. If the  @Price  parameter is used in a time and material step of a billing         rule on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules (PM207000) form, during the billing         process with this billing rule, the system looks for the price in the project currency. If         the price in the project currency is not found, the system converts the price from the base         currency by using the exchange rate defined by the rate type of the project. If the  @Rate  parameter is used in a time and material step of a billing         rule on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules form, during the billing process         with this billing rule, the system retrieves the rate as is for use in the user-defined         formulas of the billing rule. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules form, in         formulas of time and material steps of a billing rule, you can convert an amount retrieved         with the  @Rate  parameter by using the            ConvertAmountToCurrency()  function. The  Report.ConvertAmountToCurrency(fromCuryID, toCuryID, rateType, effectiveDate,           value)  function has the following parameters: fromCuryID : The source currency in which the  @Rate  has           been defined toCuryID : The project currency rateType : The rate type of the project effectiveDate : The date on which the exchange rate is effective value : The amount to be converted To re-bill an amount in the project currency as is, in the formula of a time and material         step of a billing rule on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules (PM207000) form,         you can use the following data field:  [PMTran.ProjectCuryAmount] .            PMTran.Amount  is the amount in the base currency.            PMTran.TranCuryAmount  is the amount in the transaction currency.  Cost Commitments with Multicurrency Accounting The system creates commitments for a project on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) Commitments (PM306000) form in the project currency. The exchange rate from the document currency to the project currency for the creation of         the commitment is defined by the project-specific rate type selected in the            Currency Rate Type  box on the  Summary  tab           ( Project Properties  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. If the project has no rate type         selected, the system uses the default rate type of projects specified in the  PM           Rate Type  box (  Default Rate Types  section) on the             ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) Currency Management Preferences (CM101000) form. Change Orders with Multicurrency Accounting On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) Change Orders (PM308000) form, in the Summary area         and on the  Revenue Budget  and  Cost Budget          tabs, amounts are shown in the project currency, which is specified in the            Project Currency  box on the  Summary  tab           ( Project Properties  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. On the            Commitments  tab, amounts of change order lines are shown in the         currency of the corresponding purchase orders. Project Quotes with Multicurrency Accounting For a new project quote created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes         (PM304500) form, the system fills in the  Currency  box in the Summary         area with the business account's currency selected in the  Currency ID          box on the  General Info  tab ( Financial           Settings  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers         (AR303000) form. If no currency is defined for the customer, the base currency is selected         as the project quote currency. If a project quote is created based on an opportunity selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) Opportunities (CR304000) form, the system selects the opportunity         currency as the project quote currency. You can change the project quote currency if for the customer, the  Enable           Currency Override  check box is selected on the  General           Info  tab ( Financial Settings  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers form. If you change the project quote currency and         the project quote is the primary quote of an opportunity, the system changes the opportunity         currency accordingly. For project quotes, the system uses the exchange rate of the default rate type of projects         specified in the  PM Rate Type  box ( Default Rate           Types  section) on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) Currency Management Preferences (CM101000)         form. You can override the exchange rate for a project quote if for the customer, the            Enable Rate Override  check box is selected on the            General Info  tab ( Financial Settings          section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers form. For the estimation lines of a project quote, the system converts the retrieved unit prices         and unit costs of the selected inventory items to the project quote currency by using the         exchange rate of the project quote. Although all the project quote amounts can be reviewed in both the project quote currency         and the base currency, you can edit the amounts only in the project quote currency. When a project is created based on the project quote, the system copies to the project the         project quote currency, the exchange rate of the project quote, and the price and cost         information from the project quote in the project currency. ]]></column>
