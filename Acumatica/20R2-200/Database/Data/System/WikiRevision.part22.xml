If your organization sells products or provides services in the United States, you need to collect sales taxes and periodically remit them to the appropriate taxing authorities. Generally, the sales tax rate that applies to a particular transaction is determined by the location of the customer and the location of the seller, as well as whether the seller has a significant business presence (''nexus'') in the state of the customer. {br}

The sales tax on a transaction is a combination of sales taxes paid to different tax authorities. In addition to the sales tax with the rate defined by the state, local jurisdictions may add various local taxes. There are up to 10,000 tax jurisdictions in the U.S., each with its own tax rates and rules. With this complexity and variation of rules, it can be difficult for most organizations to calculate and manage sales and use taxes. {br}

 Acumatica ERP gives you the ability to enable automatic calculation of taxes by setting up online integration with the external tax provider (AvaTax service provided by Avalara, Tax Calculation service provided by Vertex, or another external tax provider). Online integration between Acumatica ERP and an external tax provider gives your organization the following benefits:[anchor|#ul_zj5_wvn_bq]
*Real-time calculation of taxes on all transactions
*Up-to-date tax rates for all tax jurisdictions in the United States
*Verification of customer addresses for determining the correct tax jurisdiction
*Management of customer reseller permits and exemption certificates
*The ability to easily create tax rules and use them for appropriate transactions automatically
*Filing of tax reports on behalf of each branch that reports separately to each tax authority involved

This chapter describes the details of configuring the online integration of Acumatica ERP with built-in external tax providers.

If your company sells multiple types of products in many tax jurisdictions, configuring tax calculation and reporting in Acumatica ERP and maintaining up-to-date rates for all the taxes may require too much work and time. In this case, you might consider integrating with the AvaTax service by Avalara and then processing sales and use taxes online by using AvaTax. Because Acumatica ERP provides built-in support for online integration with AvaTax, you can easily set up this integration. {br}

The integration involves tasks that should be performed on both sides: in Acumatica ERP and in Avalara AvaTax.((({S:Warn}Make sure that the ''External Tax Calculation Integration'' feature is enabled in your system on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
))){br}{TOC}
==Account Configuration on the Avalara Website==
You can configure the integration with the AvaTax service as soon as you have the following: a subscription to the AvaTax service ([http://www.avalara.com/|http://www.avalara.com]), the license key and password to your organization&rsquo;s account in AvaTax, and the credentials (user name and password) to the AvaTax admin console.((({S:Hint}We recommend that you subscribe to the AvaTax Pro service, which has the features to meet most of your tax-related needs. It validates addresses, maintains up-to-date tax rates, stores customer exemption certificates, and files tax returns.
)))
In your AvaTax account, you should configure the company structure that corresponds to the structure of branches in Acumatica ERP, and configure the tax profile for each company in AvaTax (which corresponds to each Acumatica ERP branch).{br}

For more information, see [HelpRoot_Integration\TX__how_Setting_Up_Avalara_Integration|To Configure Your AvaTax Account].
==Setup of Integration with AvaTax in Acumatica ERP==
To set up the integration with the AvaTax service in Acumatica ERP, you should perform the following general tasks:[anchor|#ol_ur2_pxh_bq]
#Setting up the connection between your Acumatica ERP and AvaTax account. You also map each Acumatica ERP branch to the corresponding company that you have created in the AvaTax account for that branch.
#Setting up address verification. AvaTax uses address verification to determine the correct tax jurisdictions.
#Creating a dedicated tax agency account for use with AvaTax.
#Creating a tax zone associated with the tax agency you have created.
#Setting up the AvaTax tax codes (AvaTax uses hundreds of tax codes for products and services that are sold in the United States) as tax categories in one of the following ways:
#*If your company&rsquo;s stock list includes many types of products, you can define all these tax codes as tax categories in Acumatica ERP by creating a tax category for each tax code. In this case, consider importing the needed tax codes by using an import scenario, which you can create on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) form.
#*If your company&rsquo;s stock list is small, use only the codes that apply to your company&rsquo;s products by creating the appropriate tax categories manually by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\TX_20_55_00|Tax Categories] ([~/?ScreenId=TX205500|TX205500]) form.
#*If it is sufficient for your company to use the default tax category, create one tax category (for example, you can name it ''Taxable'') by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\TX_20_55_00|Tax Categories] ([~/?ScreenId=TX205500|TX205500]) form. In this case, you should create the corresponding tax code in your Avalara AvaTax account to associate it with the default tax category in Acumatica ERP.
#Configuring customers by specifying the Avalara tax zone for each required customer as the default tax zone. For each customer location with an effective tax exemption certificate, you should specify the number of this certificate and the default entity use code that provides the reasons for exemption.
#Configuring stock items and non-stock items by assigning them a special tax category that corresponds to the appropriate AvaTax tax code.
#:If you are going to import stock item records from the source application you used before Acumatica ERP, consider adding to your import scenario the steps for assigning tax categories to the items. 
#:((({S:Hint}To facilitate assigning tax categories to stock items, you can use item classes, which are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form. Item classes provide settings for similar products, and most items in the class have the same tax category. Once you assign a tax category to an item class, all items (of this class) that you create later will have this tax category and other class settings by default.
)))

For instructions on configuring the integration with AvaTax, see [HelpRoot_Integration\TX__how_To_Configure_Integration_with_AvaTax|To Set Up Integration With AvaTax].((({S:Hint}We recommend that you use tax calculation either by configuring integration with the AvaTax service, or by setting up the tax calculation process within Acumatica ERP (for details, see [HelpRoot_Financials\TX__con_Tax_Calculation_Process|Setting Up Tax Calculation]). Thus, you do not mix two tax calculation approaches in one system. 
)))
==Document Processing==
Once integration with AvaTax is configured and activated, documents are processed as follows:[anchor|#ul_adb_wq5_bq]
*Individually, in real time, by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) forms. Once a user takes a sales order or an invoice off hold, the system checks whether the customer location specified on the document is in the special (''AVALARA'') tax zone. If so, the system sends a request to AvaTax for processing the document. AvaTax determines the applicable taxes based on the customer location address, entity code, available exemption certificates, and tax rules (if any), and computes the tax amounts. AvaTax shows the tax IDs and tax amounts of the applicable taxes on the processed documents.
*In bulk, on schedule, by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_50_16_00|Calculate Taxes] ([~/?ScreenId=AP501600|AP501600]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_50_16_00|Calculate Taxes] ([~/?ScreenId=CA501600|CA501600]), or [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_50_16_00|Calculate Taxes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR501600|AR501600]) forms. Each of these forms displays the documents (of particular types) for which taxes have not been calculated (for example, if the connection was not available). AvaTax processes the documents one by one, by calculating taxes and returning tax IDs and tax amounts. A user can initiate document processing manually or schedule it to be performed at night or any other convenient time. 
((({S:Warn}Taxes are calculated on sales orders only for informational purposes. Only taxes on invoices are actually reported. 
)))
==Avalara Tax Calculation in AR Invoices==
For sales tax calculation of an AR invoice, Acumatica ERP sends to Avalara the invoice amount and the information on two addresses used in Avalara: ''Address From'' and ''Address To''. {br}

''Address From'' is generally the address of the branch specified for the invoice as a whole—the one specified in the '''Branch''' box on the '''Financial Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form. If the invoice has been created from a service order or an appointment, ''Address From'' is the address of the warehouse (if applicable) specified for the line item, or the branch location address of the service order (if no warehouse is applicable). This address does not affect the sales tax calculation but is required in the Avalara API.{br}

For a document of the ''Credit Memo'' or ''Cash Return'' type, Acumatica ERP sends the address of the customer&rsquo;s location as the ''Address From'' in the header and in document lines that have been directly entered.{br}

''Address To'' affects the tax calculation. In all existing versions of Acumatica ERP, the system uses the following sources of the addresses to send to Avalara for tax calculation of a particular document. [anchor|#_78361775-8e63-4e52-88ad-a3f1065729ae]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="50%" ! Document
!width="50%" ! Address To
|- 
| An AR invoice created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] form, including an invoice that refers to a project (but excluding an invoice that refers to a service order or appointment)
| The main contact address that is specified for the customer account on the '''General Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form
|- 
| An AR invoice created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] form if the invoice has been generated for a service order or appointment
| The address specified in the '''Address''' section on the '''Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) form for the related service order
|- 
| An AR invoice created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] form, for lines that were added to the invoice on this form and for lines that do not have an associated shipment reference number
| The address of the customer location that is specified for the invoice in the '''Location''' box in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] form and that is also displayed in the '''Ship-To Address''' section of the '''Address Details''' tab of this form
|- 
| A document with the ''Invoice'', ''Cash Sale'', or ''Debit Memo'' type created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form, with lines added directly on this form
| The address of the customer location that is specified for the document in the '''Location''' box in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] form and that is also displayed in the '''Ship-To Address''' section of the '''Address Details''' tab of this form
|- 
| A pro forma invoice created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form, with lines added directly on this form
| The address of the customer location that is specified for the document in the '''Location''' box in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] form and that is also displayed in the '''Ship-To Address''' section of the '''Address Details''' tab of this form
|}{br}

If you need the system to use different logic in retrieving ''Address To'' for sales tax calculation in documents, you can override the appropriate method through customization of Acumatica ERP.
==Tax Reporting==
By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\TX_50_15_00|Post Taxes] ([~/?ScreenId=TX501500|TX501500]) form, you can select the documents to be reflected on your tax reports. This form displays the list of released transactions for which AvaTax has calculated the taxes. You can post to your AvaTax account all the listed transactions or only those that you select, depending on the information you want AvaTax to use on the tax reports for your organization. Each posted document will have a copy in AvaTax. You can specify whether you want AvaTax to use the same sales accounts to store the transactions.

It validates addresses, maintains         up-to-date tax rates, stores customer exemption certificates, and files tax returns. In your AvaTax account, you should configure the company structure that corresponds to the         structure of branches in  Acumatica ERP, and configure the tax profile for each company in AvaTax (which corresponds to each  Acumatica ERP branch). For more information, see  To Configure Your AvaTax Account. Setup of Integration with AvaTax in  Acumatica ERPTo set up the integration with the AvaTax service in  Acumatica ERP, you should perform the following general tasks: Setting up the connection between your  Acumatica ERP and AvaTax account. You also map each  Acumatica ERP branch to the corresponding company that you have created in the AvaTax account for           that branch. Setting up address verification. AvaTax uses address verification to determine the           correct tax jurisdictions. Creating a dedicated tax agency account for use with AvaTax. Creating a tax zone associated with the tax agency you have created. Setting up the AvaTax tax codes (AvaTax uses hundreds of tax codes for products and           services that are sold in the United States) as tax categories in one of the following             ways: If your company's stock list includes many types of products, you can define all               these tax codes as tax categories in  Acumatica ERP by creating a tax category for each tax code. In this case, consider importing the               needed tax codes by using an import scenario, which you can create on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) Import Scenarios (SM206025) form. If your company's stock list is small, use only the codes that apply to your               company's products by creating the appropriate tax categories manually by using the                   ([~/?ScreenId=TX205500|TX205500]) Tax Categories (TX205500) form. If it is sufficient for your company to use the default tax category, create one tax               category (for example, you can name it  Taxable ) by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=TX205500|TX205500]) Tax Categories (TX205500) form. In this case, you should create the               corresponding tax code in your Avalara AvaTax account to associate it with the default               tax category in  Acumatica ERP. Configuring customers by specifying the Avalara tax zone for each required customer as           the default tax zone. For each customer location with an effective tax exemption           certificate, you should specify the number of this certificate and the default entity use           code that provides the reasons for exemption. Configuring stock items and non-stock items by assigning them a special tax category           that corresponds to the appropriate AvaTax tax code. If you are going to import stock             item records from the source application you used before  Acumatica ERP, consider adding to your import scenario the steps for assigning tax categories to             the items.  To facilitate assigning tax categories to stock items,             you can use item classes, which are defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes             (IN201000) form. Item classes provide settings for similar products, and most items in             the class have the same tax category. Once you assign a tax category to an item class,             all items (of this class) that you create later will have this tax category and other             class settings by default. For instructions on configuring the integration with AvaTax, see  To Set Up Integration With AvaTax. We recommend that you use tax calculation either by configuring integration         with the AvaTax service, or by setting up the tax calculation process within  Acumatica ERP (for details, see  Setting Up Tax Calculation). Thus, you do not         mix two tax calculation approaches in one system.  Document Processing Once integration with AvaTax is configured and activated, documents are processed as         follows: Individually, in real time, by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) and               ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) forms. Once a user takes a sales order or an           invoice off hold, the system checks whether the customer location specified on the           document is in the special ( AVALARA ) tax zone. If so, the system sends a request to           AvaTax for processing the document. AvaTax determines the applicable taxes based on the           customer location address, entity code, available exemption certificates, and tax rules           (if any), and computes the tax amounts. AvaTax shows the tax IDs and tax amounts of the           applicable taxes on the processed documents. In bulk, on schedule, by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP501600|AP501600]) Calculate Taxes (AP501600),   ([~/?ScreenId=CA501600|CA501600]) Calculate Taxes (CA501600), or   ([~/?ScreenId=AR501600|AR501600]) Calculate Taxes           (AR501600) forms. Each of these forms displays the documents (of particular types) for           which taxes have not been calculated (for example, if the connection was not available).           AvaTax processes the documents one by one, by calculating taxes and returning tax IDs and           tax amounts.

Avalara Tax Calculation in AR Invoices For sales tax calculation of an AR invoice,  Acumatica ERP sends to Avalara the invoice amount and the information on two addresses used in Avalara:            Address From  and  Address To .  Address From  is generally the address of the branch specified for the invoice as a         whole—the one specified in the  Branch  box on the  Financial           Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form. If the         invoice has been created from a service order or an appointment,  Address From  is the         address of the warehouse (if applicable) specified for the line item, or the branch location         address of the service order (if no warehouse is applicable). This address does not affect         the sales tax calculation but is required in the Avalara API. For a document of the  Credit Memo  or  Cash Return  type,  Acumatica ERP sends the address of the customer's location as the  Address From  in the header and         in document lines that have been directly entered.

If your company sells multiple types of products in many tax jurisdictions, configuring tax calculation and reporting in Acumatica ERP and maintaining up-to-date rates for all the taxes may require too much work and time. In this case, you might consider integrating with the Tax Calculation service by Vertex and then processing sales and VAT taxes online by using it. Because Acumatica ERP provides built-in support for online integration with Vertex Tax Calculation, you can easily set up this integration. {br}

The integration involves tasks that should be performed on both sides: in Acumatica ERP and in Vertex Cloud.((({S:Warn}Make sure that the ''External Tax Calculation Integration'' feature is enabled in your system on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
))){br}{TOC}
==Account Configuration on the Vertex Website==
You can configure the integration with the Vertex Tax Calculation service as soon as you have the following: a subscription to the Vertex Cloud ([http://www.avalara.com/|http://www.vertexinc.com]), the unique identifier (Trusted ID) for your organization&rsquo;s account in Vertex Cloud, and the credentials (username and password) to access your Vertex Cloud account.{br}

In your Vertex Cloud account, you should configure the company structure that corresponds to the structure of branches in Acumatica ERP, and configure the tax profile for each company in Vertex Cloud (which corresponds to each Acumatica ERP branch).{br}

For more information, see [HelpRoot_Integration\TX__HOW_Setting_Up_Vertex_Integration|To Configure Your Vertex Cloud Account].
==Setup of Integration with Vertex Tax Calculation in Acumatica ERP==
To set up the integration with the Vertex Tax Calculation service in Acumatica ERP, you should perform the following general tasks:[anchor|#ol_ur2_pxh_bq]
#Setting up the connection between your Acumatica ERP and Vertex Cloud account. You also map each Acumatica ERP branch to the corresponding company that you have created in the Vertex Cloud account for that branch.
#Creating a dedicated tax agency account for use with Vertex Tax Calculation.
#Creating a tax zone associated with the tax agency you have created.
#Setting up the Vertex Cloud tax codes (Vertex uses hundreds of tax codes for products and services that are sold in the United States) as tax categories in one of the following ways:
#*If your company&rsquo;s stock list includes many types of products, you can define all these tax codes as tax categories in Acumatica ERP by creating a tax category for each tax code. In this case, consider importing the needed tax codes by using an import scenario, which you can create on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) form.
#*If your company&rsquo;s stock list is small, use only the codes that apply to your company&rsquo;s products by creating the appropriate tax categories manually by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\TX_20_55_00|Tax Categories] ([~/?ScreenId=TX205500|TX205500]) form.
#*If it is sufficient for your company to use the default tax category, create one tax category (for example, you can name it ''Taxable'') by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\TX_20_55_00|Tax Categories] ([~/?ScreenId=TX205500|TX205500]) form. In this case, you should create the corresponding tax code in your Avalara AvaTax account to associate it with the default tax category in Acumatica ERP.
#Configuring customers by specifying the Vertex tax zone for each required customer as the default tax zone. For each customer location with an effective tax exemption certificate, you should specify the number of this certificate and the default entity use code that provides the reasons for exemption.
#Configuring stock items and non-stock items by assigning them a special tax category that corresponds to the appropriate Vertex tax code.
#:If you are going to import stock item records from the source application you used before Acumatica ERP, consider adding to your import scenario the steps for assigning tax categories to the items. 
#:((({S:Hint}To facilitate assigning tax categories to stock items, you can use item classes, which are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form. Item classes provide settings for similar products, and most items in the class have the same tax category. Once you assign a tax category to an item class, all items (of this class) that you create later will have this tax category and other class settings by default.
)))

For instructions on configuring the integration with Vertex Tax Calculation, see [HelpRoot_Integration\TX_HOW_Configure_Integration_with_Vertex|To Set Up Integration With Vertex Tax Calculation].((({S:Hint}We recommend that you use tax calculation either by configuring integration with the Vertex Tax Calculation service, or by setting up the tax calculation process within Acumatica ERP (for details, see [HelpRoot_Financials\TX__con_Tax_Calculation_Process|Setting Up Tax Calculation]). Thus, you do not mix two tax calculation approaches in one system. 
)))
==Document Processing==
Once integration with Vertex Tax Calculation is configured and activated, documents are processed as follows:[anchor|#ul_adb_wq5_bq]
*Individually, in real time, by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) forms. Once a user takes a sales order or an invoice off hold, the system checks whether the customer location specified on the document is in the special (''VERTEX'') tax zone. If so, the system sends a request to Vertex Tax for processing the document. Vertex Tax Calculation determines the applicable taxes based on the customer location address, entity code, available exemption certificates, and tax rules (if any), and computes the tax amounts. Vertex Tax Calculation shows the tax IDs and tax amounts of the applicable taxes on the processed documents.
*In bulk, on schedule, by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_50_16_00|Calculate Taxes] ([~/?ScreenId=AP501600|AP501600]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_50_16_00|Calculate Taxes] ([~/?ScreenId=CA501600|CA501600]), or [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_50_16_00|Calculate Taxes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR501600|AR501600]) forms. Each of these forms displays the documents (of particular types) for which taxes have not been calculated (for example, if the connection was not available). Vertex Tax Calculation processes the documents one by one, by calculating taxes and returning tax IDs and tax amounts. A user can initiate document processing manually or schedule it to be performed at night or any other convenient time. 
((({S:Warn}Taxes are calculated on sales orders only for informational purposes. Only taxes on invoices are actually reported. 
)))
==Vertex Tax Calculation in AR Invoices==
For sales tax calculation of an AR invoice, Acumatica ERP sends to Vertex the invoice amount and the information on two addresses used in Vertex: ''Address From'' and ''Address To''. {br}

''Address From'' is generally the address of the branch specified for the invoice as a whole—the one specified in the '''Branch''' box on the '''Financial Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form. If the invoice has been created from a service order or an appointment, ''Address From'' is the address of the warehouse (if applicable) specified for the line item, or the branch location address of the service order (if no warehouse is applicable). This address does not affect the sales tax calculation but is required in the Vertex API.{br}

For a document of the ''Credit Memo'' or ''Cash Return'' type, Acumatica ERP sends the address of the customer&rsquo;s location as the ''Address From'' in the header and in document lines that have been directly entered.{br}

''Address To'' affects the tax calculation. In all existing versions of Acumatica ERP, the system uses the following sources of the addresses to send to Vertex for tax calculation of a particular document. [anchor|#_78361775-8e63-4e52-88ad-a3f1065729ae]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="50%" ! Document
!width="50%" ! Address To
|- 
| An AR invoice created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] form, including an invoice that refers to a project (but excluding an invoice that refers to a service order or appointment)
| The main contact address that is specified for the customer account on the '''General Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form
|- 
| An AR invoice created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] form if the invoice has been generated for a service order or appointment
| The address specified in the '''Address''' section on the '''Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) form for the related service order
|- 
| An AR invoice created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] form, for lines that were added to the invoice on this form and for lines that do not have an associated shipment reference number
| The address of the customer location that is specified for the invoice in the '''Location''' box in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] form and that is also displayed in the '''Ship-To Address''' section of the '''Address Details''' tab of this form
|- 
| A document with the ''Invoice'', ''Cash Sale'', or ''Debit Memo'' type created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form, with lines added directly on this form
| The address of the customer location that is specified for the document in the '''Location''' box in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] form and that is also displayed in the '''Ship-To Address''' section of the '''Address Details''' tab of this form
|- 
| A pro forma invoice created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form, with lines added directly on this form
| The address of the customer location that is specified for the document in the '''Location''' box in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] form and that is also displayed in the '''Ship-To Address''' section of the '''Address Details''' tab of this form
|}{br}

If you need the system to use different logic in retrieving ''Address To'' for sales tax calculation in documents, you can override the appropriate method through customization of Acumatica ERP.
==Tax Reporting==
By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\TX_50_15_00|Post Taxes] ([~/?ScreenId=TX501500|TX501500]) form, you can select the documents to be reflected on your tax reports. This form displays the list of released transactions for which Vertex has calculated the taxes. You can post to your Vertex Cloud account all the listed transactions or only those that you select, depending on the information you want Vertex Cloud to use on the tax reports for your organization. Each posted document will have a copy in Vertex Cloud.

For each customer location with an effective tax exemption           certificate, you should specify the number of this certificate and the default entity use           code that provides the reasons for exemption. Configuring stock items and non-stock items by assigning them a special tax category           that corresponds to the appropriate Vertex tax code. If you are going to import stock             item records from the source application you used before  Acumatica ERP, consider adding to your import scenario the steps for assigning tax categories to             the items.  To facilitate assigning tax categories to stock items,             you can use item classes, which are defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes             (IN201000) form. Item classes provide settings for similar products, and most items in             the class have the same tax category. Once you assign a tax category to an item class,             all items (of this class) that you create later will have this tax category and other             class settings by default. For instructions on configuring the integration with Vertex Tax Calculation, see  To Set Up Integration With Vertex Tax Calculation. We recommend that you use tax calculation either by configuring integration         with the Vertex Tax Calculation service, or by setting up the tax calculation process within            Acumatica ERP (for details, see  Setting Up Tax Calculation). Thus, you do not         mix two tax calculation approaches in one system.

Only taxes on         invoices are actually reported.  Vertex Tax Calculation in AR Invoices For sales tax calculation of an AR invoice,  Acumatica ERP sends to Vertex the invoice amount and the information on two addresses used in Vertex:            Address From  and  Address To .  Address From  is generally the address of the branch specified for the invoice as a         whole—the one specified in the  Branch  box on the  Financial           Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form. If the         invoice has been created from a service order or an appointment,  Address From  is the         address of the warehouse (if applicable) specified for the line item, or the branch location         address of the service order (if no warehouse is applicable). This address does not affect         the sales tax calculation but is required in the Vertex API. For a document of the  Credit Memo  or  Cash Return  type,  Acumatica ERP sends the address of the customer's location as the  Address From  in the header and         in document lines that have been directly entered. Address To  affects the tax calculation. In all existing versions of  Acumatica ERP, the system uses the following sources of the addresses to send to Vertex for tax         calculation of a particular document.  Document Address To An AR invoice created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos form, including an                 invoice that refers to a project (but excluding an invoice that refers to a service                 order or appointment) The main contact address that is specified for the customer account on the                    General Info  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers                 (AR303000) form An AR invoice created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos form if the                 invoice has been generated for a service order or appointment The address specified in the  Address  section on the                    Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) Service Orders                 (FS300100) form for the related service order An AR invoice created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos form, for lines                 that were added to the invoice on this form and for lines that do not have an                 associated shipment reference number The address of the customer location that is specified for the invoice in the                    Location  box in the Summary area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos form and that is also displayed in the                    Ship-To Address  section of the  Address                   Details  tab of this form A document with the  Invoice ,  Cash Sale , or  Debit Memo  type                 created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form, with lines added                 directly on this form The address of the customer location that is specified for the document in the                    Location  box in the Summary area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices form and that is also displayed in the                    Ship-To Address  section of the  Address                   Details  tab of this form A pro forma invoice created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000)                 form, with lines added directly on this form The address of the customer location that is specified for the document in the                    Location  box in the Summary area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices form and that is also displayed in the                    Ship-To Address  section of the  Address                   Details  tab of this form If you need the system to use different logic in retrieving  Address To  for sales tax         calculation in documents, you can override the appropriate method through customization of            Acumatica ERP.

Address data quality is essential for many business operations. The integration of Acumatica ERP with web map services gives users the ability to maximize the accuracy of address information.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Set up integration with the Google Maps web map service
*Set up integration with the Bing Maps web map service

==Applicable Scenarios==
You may need to set up integration with web map services in scenarios that include the following:[anchor|#_322dd48e-d1aa-4573-8191-acc971af61ee]
*Users need to find a company address by a company name.
*Users need to find a company address by a postal code if no other address details are available.
*Users need to find a full address by a street address.

==Address Enrichment Functionality Through Web Map Services==
With the address enrichment functionality through integration with web map services, you can add a new address, update an existing address, and fill in the missing address information in a record that has address settings. To make this functionality available, you must enable the ''Address Lookup Integration'' feature on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form in the ''Customer Management'' group of features. You then need to set up integration with the web map service on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_30_00|Address Providers] ([~/?ScreenId=CS103000|CS103000]) form and select the address provider on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_05|Site Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200505|SM200505]) form, as described in [HelpRoot_Integration\config_Web_Map_Services_Implem_Activity|Integration with Web Map Services: Implementation Activity].{br}

As a result, the selected web map service will be used as the address provider on all forms that have address information (if applicable).{br}

 The ''Address Lookup Integration'' feature can also be used for the Acumatica Self-Service                         Portal: To do so, after the ''Address Lookup Integration'' feature has been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form and the address provider has been set up on the ''Address Providers (CS103000)'' form, you should set up the address provider on the ''Portal Preferences (SP800000)'' form.
==Web Map Services as Address Providers==
 Acumatica ERP provides integration with the Google Maps and Bing Maps web map services. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_30_00|Address Providers] ([~/?ScreenId=CS103000|CS103000]) form, you need to enter an identifier for the provider in the '''Provider ID''' box and select either of the following plug-ins in the '''Plug-In''' box:[anchor|#_891cbbca-6241-4bdf-897f-a96407ba352e]
*''Google Maps''
* ''Bing Maps''

When the plug-in has been selected, on the '''Plug-In Parameters''' tab of the form, you need to specify values in the '''Value''' column for the following parameters:[anchor|#_5603b5ad-b041-43a0-8fda-537f2aa9d640]
*''API KEY'': You get an API key when you register with the particular web map service that you are planning to use. This key should be entered here. 
*''COUNTRY'': You specify the ISO 3166 country code (For details, see [https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html].) for each country in which users can search for addresses, with the codes separated by commas. The countries supported by the Google Maps address provider are the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Mexico. The country supported by the Bing Maps address provider is the United States.
*:((({S:Warn}A user can select up to five countries to be used for the address search by Google Maps and one country to be used for the address search by Bing Maps. The countries that are not supported by the web map services may have different address templates used by postal services, and Acumatica cannot guarantee that the data from these templates will be correctly processed by the system.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Integration with Web Map Services: Implementation Activity The following activity will help you set up integration with the Google Maps web map                     service. You can perform similar steps to set up integration                     with Bing Maps instead. Story You, as administrator, need to set up integration with the Google Maps web map                 service to give users the ability to add new addresses, update existing addresses,                 and fill in the missing address information of a company or a person. Process Overview In this activity, you will do the following: Define the Google Maps address provider on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS103000|CS103000]) Address Providers                     (CS103000) form. Check the connection of  Acumatica ERP with the address provider. Select this address provider on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200505|SM200505]) Site Preferences                     (SM200505) form. Optional: Select this address provider on the  Portal Preferences                         (SP800000)  form of the  Acumatica Self-Service                         Portal. System Preparation Before you start setting up integration with an address provider, you need to do the                 following: Complete registration in the Google Maps web map service and obtain an API                         key. You get the API key on either of the following                             websites: Google Maps:  Bing Maps:  Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as an administrator. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, enable the                     following features: Customer Management : Provides the customer relationship                             management (CRM) functionality, including lead and customer tracking, as                             well as the handling of sales opportunities, contacts, marketing lists,                             and marketing campaigns. Address Lookup Integration : Provides the address enrichment                             functionality, which gives users the ability to add new addresses,                             update existing addresses, and fill in the missing address information                             on all the forms that have address information. Step 1: Creating an Address Provider Based On the Google Maps Plug-In To create an address provider based on the Google Maps plug-in, do the                     following: You can similarly create an address provider based on                     the Bing Maps plug-in. Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS103000|CS103000]) Address Providers (CS103000) form. On the form toolbar, click  New Record In the  Provider ID  box, specify the identifier for the                     Google Maps address provider, such as  GOOGLE MAPS .  In the  Description  box, specify the description of the                     address provider, such as  Google Maps web map service . In the  Plug-In  box, select the  Google Maps                      plug-in. On the  Plug-In Parameters  tab, the system adds                     to the table the rows that have the  API KEY  and  COUNTRIES                      identifiers. In the row that has  API KEY  as its identifier, in the                          Value  column, enter the API key you have                     received. In the row that has  COUNTRIES  as its identifier, notice the default                     values in the  Value  column, which are the ISO 3166                     country codes (that are supported by Google Maps) separated by commas. The                     system will be searching for addresses in these countries. For Google Maps, you can specify up to five country codes; for Bing Maps,                         you can specify one country code. Optional: Make any needed changes to the selected country codes. On the form toolbar, click  Test Connection  to check the                     connection with the address provider. If the connection is successful, the                     system opens the  Settings  dialog box. In the dialog box, click  OK . In the Summary area, select the  Active  check box to make                     the address provider available for use in the system. On the form toolbar, click  Save . You have created an address provider based on the Google Maps plug-in.  Step 2: Selecting Google Maps as the Address Provider to Be Used To select the Google Maps web map service you have created as the address provider to                 be used in the system, you need to select the address provider in the preference                 settings of the  Acumatica ERP website. Do the following: You can similarly select the Bing Maps                     web map service as the address provider to be used in the system. Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200505|SM200505]) Site Preferences (SM200505) form. In the  Address Lookup Plug-In  box of the Summary area,                     select  GOOGLE MAPS , which is the address provider that you have created                     in the previous step of this activity. On the form toolbar, click  Save . On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200505|SM200505]) Site Preferences (SM200505) form,                 you can create, set up, and select an address provider as well. If you had opened                 this form before defining the address provider, you could have clicked the Edit                 button right of the  Address Lookup Plug-In  box; the system                 would have opened the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS103000|CS103000]) Address Providers (CS103000) form in a pop-up                 window, in which you could specify the settings that you have specified in Step 1 of                 this topic. You have selected the Google Maps web map service as the address provider to be used                 by the system. Now the address enrichment functionality is available to the                 users. Step 3: Selecting Google Maps as the Address Provider in the  Acumatica Self-Service                         PortalTo select the Google Maps web map service as the address provider to be used in the                      Acumatica Self-Service                         Portal, do the following: You can similarly select the Bing Maps web map                     service as the address provider to be used in the  Self-Service Portal. Open the  Portal Preferences (SP800000)  form. In the  Address Lookup Plug-In  box of the Summary area,                     select  GOOGLE MAPS , which is the address provider that you have created                     in Step 1 of this activity.

ACH payments are electronic payments made through the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network in the United States. In Acumatica ERP, you can automate payments to vendors by making ACH payments. To do this, you export a batch of payments to a file that is then processed in the ACH system. For each vendor, the specified amount is automatically credited from one of your company&rsquo;s bank accounts and transferred to the payment recipient electronically. {br}

The National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) has developed the rules and standards about ACH transactions, including the following:[anchor|#ul_ywj_sb3_rp]
*To set up ACH payments, you need an agreement and an account with the ACH operator—that is, the financial institution providing ACH services. 
*You need agreements with your vendors covering ACH transaction authorization, and information about their accounts in the ACH network. Accounts are identified by the financial institution&rsquo;s routing number and the account number within that institution.

By using ACH payments, you reduce errors, while eliminating the hassles of check preparation, printing, and emailing. Because you can pay promptly, you also can usually get available cash discounts. {br}{TOC}
==Setup of Payment Processing==
To start paying your vendors through the ACH network, you should perform the following steps:[anchor|#ol_tfp_lcn_pp]
#You sign up for the ACH service with the ACH operator. As part of the sign-up process, you receive the credentials with which your company is registered in the ACH network, such as account number, bank routing number, and company identification.
#You set up agreements with your vendors covering ACH transaction authorization, and you get information about their accounts in the ACH network.
#You set up the payment method to be used for ACH payments. The payment method includes elements that need to be filled with the vendor&rsquo;s custom information, file export details, and details that need to filled with your ACH credentials. For details, see [HelpRoot_Integration\CA__HOW_Add_PM_for_ACH|To Add a Payment Method for ACH Payments]. 
#You specify remittance information (ACH credentials) for each cash account you are going to use as a source for paying your vendors. For details, see [HelpRoot_Integration\CA__HOW_Add_RemittanceInfo_to_CashAccount|To Add Remittance Information to a Cash Account].
#You assign the payment method intended for ACH payments to each vendor that will accept ACH payments. By using the ACH-related information you collected from each vendor in Step 2, fill in the settings of the payment method on the '''Payment Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form. 

==Implementation Details==
The ACH system supports the processing of ''balanced'' and ''unbalanced'' files. A balanced file contains an offsetting entry that automatically credits or debits the specified offset account for the debit or credit transactions in the file. An unbalanced file contains only the transactions you specify and does not include an offsetting entry.{br}

 Acumatica ERP provides functionality you can use to export payments to get a balanced or unbalanced file. You export payments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_70_25|Export Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM207025|SM207025]) form by using a scenario designed for the ACH payment method. The export scenarios ''Export AP Payments to ACH'' and ''Export AP Payments to ACH Balanced'', which were developed for the corporate credit or debit (CCD) application of the ACH system, fully complies with the file format specifications for ACH. The result of exporting payments is a file that is then processed in the ACH system. {br}

The export scenarios ''Export AP Payments to ACH'' and ''Export AP Payments to ACH Balanced'' (which are provided with Acumatica ERP) create unbalanced and balanced files respectively that are then processed in the ACH system. {br}

Also, you can modify the scenario if another ACH application will be used or if your financial institution uses another format for electronic funds transfer. {br}

The ''Export AP Payments to ACH'' scenario uses the <tt>ACHExportProvider</tt> data provider and the ''Export AP Payments to ACH Balanced'' one uses <tt>ACHBalancedProvider</tt>. ((({S:Hint}
Do not delete the <tt>ACHExportProvider</tt> or <tt>ACHBalancedProvider</tt> data providers. If you have accidentally deleted it, contact Acumatica ERP support to restore it.
))){br}

The export scenario is configured to use exact identifiers of payment method details as those defined for payment method details in the ''FEDWIRE'' and ''FEDWIREBA'' demo payment methods. If you add details to your payment method manually, either copy identifiers from the demo payment method or adjust the scenario accordingly. For details, see [HelpRoot_Integration\CA__HOW_Add_PM_for_ACH|To Add a Payment Method for ACH Payments].]]></column>

In Acumatica ERP, recording of card payments can occur in two ways, depending on how the bank your company works with reports card payments—as a batch or as individual transactions.{br}

If your bank reports card payments as a batch, we recommend that you use a clearing cash account to record card payment transactions, so you can group these transactions in a deposit and reconcile the deposit with the bank record in the statement. For details, see [[#recording_CC_using_deposits|Recording Card Payments by Using Deposits].{br}

If your bank reports card payments as separate transactions, you can record card payment transactions directly to your bank cash account and reconcile them one to one with the statement records. For details, see [[#recording_CC_directly|Recording Card Payments Directly].{br}{TOC}[anchor|#recording_CC_using_deposits]
==Recording Card Payments by Using Deposits==
For a bank that reports multiple card payments as a batch, you configure and then process card payments as follows:{br}

''Configuration'': You perform the following configuration steps:[anchor|#ol_prv_tjc_vt]
#You create a cash account that represents your merchant account with a processing center (linked to a GL account of the ''Asset'' type), and mark it as a clearing account. (Before performing this step, you should already have a cash account that represents your bank account.) 
#You specify the merchant cash account as a clearing account for the bank cash account.
#:For details on the configuration of cash accounts, see [HelpRoot_Financials\CA__MNG_CashAccounts|Configuring Cash Accounts].
#You configure integration with a processing center and assign the merchant cash account to the processing center in the system. Acumatica ERP supports the processing of credit and debit card payments through the Authorize.Net payment gateway. The cash account specified for the processing center sets the currency to be used to process transactions. For details on configuring this integration, see [HelpRoot_Integration\CA__CON_AuthorizeNet|Means of Integration with Authorize.Net].
#You configure the payment methods, such as Visa, Mastercard, or American Express. You specify the merchant cash account as the allowed cash account and mark it as the default one for use in Accounts Receivable. For details, see [HelpRoot_Integration\CA__HOW_Add_PM_Card|To Add a Payment Method for Payment Processing].
#You configure customer payment methods (customer credit or debit cards), using the payment methods as templates. For details, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__CON_Customer_PaymentMethods|Configuring Customer Payment Methods].
[HelpRoot_Integration\CA__CON_CardProcessingScenario|Setup of Card Payment Processing]
''Initiation'': You create payments in the system and initiate the processing of card payments through a processing center. After you receive a response from the processing center about the transaction status, you release the payment. The system records the transaction to the merchant cash account associated with the customer payment method.[anchor|#_6135ca72-9ceb-47ea-9d4b-e134d452063d]((({S:Warn}If the '''Enable Integrated CC Processing''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) form, you cannot release the payment. The system releases the payment automatically after it captures the payment amount.
)))
''Settlement'': You receive a statement from the processing center that shows the settlement amount deposited to your bank account. Optionally, you can perform reconciliation for the merchant cash account by using the received statement. For details on the reconciliation process, see [HelpRoot_Financials\Finance_Bank_Reconciliation_GenInfo|Bank Reconciliation: General Information].{br}

''Reconciliation'': You create and process a deposit in the system that includes card payments in the amount of the settlement. When you receive a bank statement, you can easily reconcile the deposit with a transaction from the bank statement. For details on configuring and processing deposits, see [HelpRoot_Financials\CA__CON_Preparation_of_Deposits|Preparation of Deposits].[anchor|#recording_CC_directly]
==Recording Card Payments Directly==
For a bank that reports each card payment individually, you configure and then process card payments as follows:{br}

''Configuration'': You perform the following configuration steps:[anchor|#ol_npx_jtc_vt]
#You create a cash account that represents your bank account (linked to a GL account of the ''Asset'' type) to which the processing center will move funds. 
#:For details on the configuration of cash accounts, see [HelpRoot_Financials\CA__MNG_CashAccounts|Configuring Cash Accounts].
#You configure integration with a processing center, and assign the bank cash account to the processing center in the system.

For details on configuring integration, see [HelpRoot_Integration\CA__CON_AuthorizeNet|Means of Integration with Authorize.Net].
#You configure the payment methods, such as Visa, Mastercard, or American Express. You specify the bank cash account created in Step 1 as the allowed cash account and mark it as the default one for use in Accounts Receivable. For details, see [HelpRoot_Integration\CA__HOW_Add_PM_Card|To Add a Payment Method for Payment Processing].
#You configure customer payment methods (customer credit or debit cards), using the payment methods as templates. For details, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__CON_Customer_PaymentMethods|Configuring Customer Payment Methods].

''Initiation'': When your customers want to pay by using credit or debit cards, you create these payments in the system and initiate the processing of card payments through a processing center. After you receive a response from the processing center about the transaction status, you release the payment. The system records the transaction to the bank cash account associated with the customer payment method.[anchor|#_312ae1ae-aee2-4695-abe6-690ae65fca1c]((({S:Warn}If the '''Enable Integrated CC Processing''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) form, you cannot release the payment. The system releases the payment automatically after it captures the payment amount.

''Reconciliation'': You receive a bank statement and reconcile each document in the system with a bank transaction. For details on the reconciliation process, see [HelpRoot_Financials\Finance_Bank_Reconciliation_Activity|Bank Reconciliation: To Reconcile a Cash Account]. ]]></column>

After you receive a response from the processing center about the         transaction status, you release the payment. The system records the transaction to the         merchant cash account associated with the customer payment method. If the  Enable Integrated CC                 Processing  check box is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) Accounts Receivable Preferences (AR101000) form, you cannot release the             payment. The system releases the payment automatically after it captures the payment             amount. Settlement : You receive a statement from the processing center that shows the         settlement amount deposited to your bank account. Optionally, you can perform reconciliation         for the merchant cash account by using the received statement. For details on the         reconciliation process, see  Bank Reconciliation: General Information. Reconciliation : You create and process a deposit in the system that         includes card payments in the amount of the settlement. When you receive a bank statement,         you can easily reconcile the deposit with a transaction from the bank statement. For details         on configuring and processing deposits, see  Preparation of Deposits. Recording Card Payments Directly For a bank that reports each card payment individually, you configure and then process card         payments as follows: Configuration : You perform the following configuration steps: You create a cash account that represents your bank account (linked to a GL account of           the  Asset  type) to which the processing center will move funds.  For details on             the configuration of cash accounts, see  Configuring Cash Accounts. You configure integration with a processing center, and assign the bank cash account to           the processing center in the system.  Acumatica ERP supports the processing of credit and debit card payments through the Authorize.Net           payment gateway. For details on configuring integration, see  Means of Integration with Authorize.Net. You configure the payment methods, such as Visa, Mastercard, or American Express. You           specify the bank cash account created in Step 1 as the allowed cash account and mark it as           the default one for use in Accounts Receivable. For details, see  To Add a Payment Method for Payment Processing. You configure customer payment methods (customer credit or debit cards), using the           payment methods as templates. For details, see  Configuring Customer Payment Methods. Initiation : When your customers want to pay by using credit or debit cards, you         create these payments in the system and initiate the processing of card payments through a         processing center. After you receive a response from the processing center about the         transaction status, you release the payment. The system records the transaction to the bank         cash account associated with the customer payment method. If the  Enable Integrated CC                 Processing  check box is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) Accounts Receivable Preferences (AR101000) form, you cannot release the             payment. The system releases the payment automatically after it captures the payment             amount. Reconciliation : You receive a bank statement and reconcile each document in the         system with a bank transaction. For details on the reconciliation process, see  Bank Reconciliation: To Reconcile a Cash Account.  ]]></column>

 Acumatica ERP offers three payment plug-ins for implementing integration with Authorize.Net. For a comparison of the features of the plug-ins, see [HelpRoot_Integration\CA__CON_AuthorizeNet|Means of Integration with Authorize.Net].{br}

In this topic, you will read about the details of integration for the Authorize.Net API plug-in. You will also learn how to set up and test a connection to Authorize.Net with the plug-in.{br}{TOC}
==Integration Details==
The plug-in uses Authorize.Net API to submit transactions to the payment gateway. The plug-in provides PCI DSS–compliant integration with Authorize.Net. It supports encrypted storage of your credentials that are used to connect to the processing center server. Sensitive credit card information is not stored in the Acumatica ERP database. Instead, the system sends customer credit card details to the processing center through an encrypted channel.{br}

Integration with Authorize.Net also requires that you have a valid SSL certificate and that your website is capable of initiating both client- and server-side SSL connections.
==Support of Multiple Currencies==
Authorize.Net supports multiple currencies. You select the currency to be used for processing transactions when you set up the merchant account. Thus, you need to make sure that all accounts involved in the processing of payments are denominated in the currency you have specified in Authorize.Net for your merchant account. For each currency, you need to apply for a separate merchant account with Authorize.Net and configure a dedicated processing center in Acumatica ERP.
==Authorize.Net-Hosted Form==
You may use either an Acumatica ERP form or an Authorize.Net-hosted form to fill in customers&rsquo; credit card details. The value of the '''Allow Direct Input''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_50_00|Processing Centers] ([~/?ScreenId=CA205000|CA205000]) form defines which form will be used to fill in customer credit card details as follows:[anchor|#ul_tgp_mml_vt]
*''Cleared'': An Authorize.Net-hosted form is used.
*''Selected'': An Acumatica ERP form is used.

For details, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__HOW_Add_Customer_CC_AuthNet|To Add a Credit Card Through an Authorize.Net Form].
==Support of Fraud Detection Services==
The plug-in supports fraud detection services enabled in the Authorize.Net Merchant Interface when a user adds a new credit card for a customer by using the Authorize.Net hosted form.{br}

For example, if you turned on the address verification service provided in the Authorize.Net Merchant Interface, after you have integrated Acumatica ERP and Authorize.Net, the address will be verified by this service when a user adds a new credit card for a customer by using the Authorize.Net-hosted form. 
==Validation Modes==
The plug-in supports the following validation modes that you set up on the '''Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_50_00|Processing Centers] ([~/?ScreenId=CA205000|CA205000]) form:[anchor|#_2a34f1c0-6ca9-45aa-a884-9b25a5dbc307]
*''Test Mode'': With this mode, which is recommended for use in a test environment, the credit card data will be sent to the processing center without it being validated there; a test transaction will not be generated.
*''Live Mode'': With this mode, which you must select if you are setting up a production environment, the credit card data will be sent to the processing center, which will generate a test transaction to validate the customer profile. The processing center will create a test transaction with the ''0.00'' amount and then void it automatically.

For details, see [HelpRoot_Integration\CA__HOW_Configure_AuthorizeNet_ProcCenterAPI|To Configure the Authorize.Net Processing Center with the API Plug-in].
==Support of CVV Verification==
Users can configure the ''Enhanced CCV Handling Filter'' in the Authorize.Net Merchant Interface to turn on CVV verification. In this case, a transaction with a CVV code not matching the CVV code stored in the processing center&rsquo;s settings will be declined by Authorize.Net.{br}

For CVV verification to be turned on for a processing center, on the '''Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_50_00|Processing Centers] ([~/?ScreenId=CA205000|CA205000]) form, ''Live Mode'' must be selected for the ''VALIDATION'' setting in the table.
==Update of Expiration Dates==
The plug-in supports the retrieval of unmasked expiration dates from Authorize.Net. By using the '''Update Expiration Dates''' button on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_50_00|Processing Centers] ([~/?ScreenId=CA205000|CA205000]) form, you can retrieve expiration dates for customer payment methods for which these dates were not specified.
==Record Maintenance==
When you add a credit or debit card for a customer account for the first time by using Acumatica ERP, Authorize.Net returns the following: [anchor|#ul_fgg_sgk_vt]
*'''Customer Profile ID''': The identifier that is associated with the customer account. Its main purpose is to link multiple payment profiles (credit or debit cards) with a single customer entity.
*'''Payment Profile ID''': The identifier that is associated with the customer payment method. This identifier is used for storing sensitive payment information with Authorize.Net in a secure and PCI-compliant manner. 

When you add another credit or debit card for this customer account, Acumatica ERP includes the customer profile ID of the customer in the request sent to Authorize.Net, and in return receives only the new payment profile identifier that has been linked to this customer profile identifier.{br}

By using these two identifiers, Acumatica ERP and Authorize.Net synchronize the changes of the customer payment method in both systems. You can edit the details of a payment method by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_10|Customer Payment Methods] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303010|AR303010]) form and the Authorize.Net Merchant Interface tools. {br}

 You can control the synchronization of the deletion of profiles by using the '''Synchronize Deletion''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_50_00|Processing Centers] ([~/?ScreenId=CA205000|CA205000]) form as follows:[anchor|#ul_gmf_24t_15]
*Cleared: With this setting, when a user deletes (in Acumatica ERP) a customer payment method that is registered with Authorize.Net, the payment method information is not deleted from the Authorize.Net server.
*Selected: With this setting, when a user deletes (in Acumatica ERP) a customer payment method that is registered with Authorize.Net, the payment method information is automatically deleted from the Authorize.Net server.

==Restriction for the Number of Payment Methods==
Authorize.Net restricts the number of payment profiles for a customer profile, it allows up to ten payment profiles for a single customer profile. If you have customers who uses more than ten credit or debit cards to pay for your goods or services, you select the '''Create Additional Customer Profiles''' check box on the '''Preferences''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_50_00|Processing Centers] ([~/?ScreenId=CA205000|CA205000]) form. {br}

With the check box selected, each time the number of payment profiles exceeds 10 for a customer profile in Authorize.Net, the system creates an additional customer profile to be associated with the respective customer account in Acumatica ERP. For example, when you add a credit or debit card for a customer account, the system checks whether the number of payment profiles for this customer exceeds 10. If it does, the system creates an additional customer profile for this customer at Authorize.Net. The system associates the next nine payment profiles with the additional customer profile for the customer. ((({S:Warn}If you want to decrease the threshold, you can specify a new one in the '''Maximum Credit Cards per Profile''' box that s displayed if the '''Create Additional Customer Profiles''' check box is selected on the '''Preferences''' tab.
)))
==Integration Setup==
To start processing payments from customers with Authorize.Net, you should perform the following steps: [anchor|#ol_akr_x4f_pn]
#You sign up with Authorize.Net. You apply for a payment gateway account and a merchant account if you do not have these accounts. A merchant account is an agreement with a merchant bank that you use to accept payment by credit and debit card. Authorize.Net provides you with the login credentials to the Authorize.Net Merchant Interface. You sign in to the Merchant Interface, and create your account API login ID and transaction key. The processing center will use these two values to authenticate you and ensure that you are authorized to submit transactions. For details, see [http://www.authorize.net/|the Authorize.Net official site].
#:((({S:Warn}You can also create a [http://developer.authorize.net/#sandbox|sandbox account] at Authorize.Net to test payment processing. For details, see [[#_0adfda98-c816-4bdb-aa66-5c36c060de87|API Plug-in Test Mode].
)))
#You configure the Authorize.Net processing center in Acumatica ERP. For details, see [HelpRoot_Integration\CA__HOW_Configure_AuthorizeNet_ProcCenterAPI|To Configure the Authorize.Net Processing Center with the API Plug-in].
#Optional: You create a vendor account for Authorize.Net by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form, and specify the accounts (and subaccounts) for recording any fees and charges applied by the center for processing your credit card transactions.
#You create a payment method for each bank operator whose cards you are going to process (such as Visa, Mastercard, or American Express), and associate payment methods with the Authorize.Net processing center. You can then use these payment methods as templates to create customer payment methods. For details, see [HelpRoot_Integration\CA__HOW_Add_PM_Card|To Add a Payment Method for Payment Processing].
#You collect credit and debit card details from your customers, and create customer payment methods for all customers whose payments you want to process with Authorize.Net. For details, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__CON_Customer_PaymentMethods|Configuring Customer Payment Methods].
#You test payment processing with Authorize.Net, as described in the next section.

==Authorize.Net Test Mode==
After initial setup, your Authorize.Net account is placed in test mode by default. In test mode, Authorize.Net does not process transactions and always returns a successful response. Thus, a test payment never gets charged. {br}

The Acumatica ERP plug-in is configured to use the live connection URL by default. Namely, the '''TESTMODE''' parameter is set to ''0''.{br}

To switch test mode off, log in to the Authorize.Net Merchant Interface, and switch off test mode.[anchor|#_0adfda98-c816-4bdb-aa66-5c36c060de87]
==API Plug-in Test Mode==
You can create a sandbox account at Authorize.Net to test payment processing. The sandbox account provides the same Merchant Interface as a live merchant account does. You generate the API login and transaction key in the Merchant Interface. Then you configure a processing center by using the generated login and transaction key, and you change the value of the '''TESTMODE''' parameter to ''1''. With this setting, the plug-in will use sandbox URL for connection.]]></column>

You can control the synchronization of the deletion of profiles by using the            Synchronize Deletion  check box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA205000|CA205000]) Processing Centers (CA205000) form as follows: Cleared: With this setting, when a user deletes (in  Acumatica ERP) a customer payment method that is registered with Authorize.Net, the payment method           information is not deleted from the Authorize.Net server. Selected: With this setting, when a user deletes (in  Acumatica ERP) a customer payment method that is registered with Authorize.Net, the payment method           information is automatically deleted from the Authorize.Net server. Restriction for the Number of Payment Methods Authorize.Net restricts the number of payment profiles for a customer profile, it allows up         to ten payment profiles for a single customer profile. If you have customers who uses more         than ten credit or debit cards to pay for your goods or services, you select the            Create Additional Customer Profiles  check box on the            Preferences  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA205000|CA205000]) Processing Centers (CA205000)         form.  With the check box selected, each time the number of payment profiles exceeds 10 for a         customer profile in Authorize.Net, the system creates an additional customer profile to be         associated with the respective customer account in  Acumatica ERP. For example, when you add a credit or debit card for a customer account, the system         checks whether the number of payment profiles for this customer exceeds 10. If it does, the         system creates an additional customer profile for this customer at Authorize.Net. The system         associates the next nine payment profiles with the additional customer profile for the         customer.  If you want to decrease the threshold, you can specify a new one in the            Maximum Credit Cards per Profile  box that s displayed if the            Create Additional Customer Profiles  check box is selected on the            Preferences  tab. Integration Setup To start processing payments from customers with Authorize.Net, you should perform the         following steps:  You sign up with Authorize.Net. You apply for a payment gateway account and a merchant           account if you do not have these accounts. A merchant account is an agreement with a           merchant bank that you use to accept payment by credit and debit card. Authorize.Net           provides you with the login credentials to the Authorize.Net Merchant Interface. You sign           in to the Merchant Interface, and create your account API login ID and transaction key.           The processing center will use these two values to authenticate you and ensure that you           are authorized to submit transactions. For details, see  the Authorize.Net             official site the Authorize.Net official site. You can also create a  sandbox               account sandbox account at Authorize.Net to test payment processing. For details, see  API Plug-in Test Mode API Plug-in Test Mode. You configure the Authorize.Net processing center in  Acumatica ERP. For details, see  To Configure the Authorize.Net Processing Center with the API Plug-in. Optional: You create a vendor account for Authorize.Net by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors (AP303000) form, and specify the accounts (and subaccounts)           for recording any fees and charges applied by the center for processing your credit card           transactions. You create a payment method for each bank operator whose cards you are going to process           (such as Visa, Mastercard, or American Express), and associate payment methods with the           Authorize.Net processing center. You can then use these payment methods as templates to           create customer payment methods. For details, see  To Add a Payment Method for Payment Processing. You collect credit and debit card details from your customers, and create customer           payment methods for all customers whose payments you want to process with Authorize.Net.           For details, see  Configuring Customer Payment Methods. You test payment processing with Authorize.Net, as described in the next section. Authorize.Net Test Mode After initial setup, your Authorize.Net account is placed in test mode by default. In test         mode, Authorize.Net does not process transactions and always returns a successful response.         Thus, a test payment never gets charged.  The  Acumatica ERP plug-in is configured to use the live connection URL by default. Namely, the            TESTMODE  parameter is set to  0 . To switch test mode off, log in to the Authorize.Net Merchant Interface, and switch off         test mode. API Plug-in Test Mode You can create a sandbox account at Authorize.Net to test payment processing. The sandbox         account provides the same Merchant Interface as a live merchant account does. You generate         the API login and transaction key in the Merchant Interface. Then you configure a processing         center by using the generated login and transaction key, and you change the value of the            TESTMODE  parameter to  1 . With this setting, the plug-in will         use sandbox URL for connection. ]]></column>

 Acumatica ERP offers three payment plug-ins for implementing integration with Authorize.Net. For a comparison of the features of the plug-ins, see [HelpRoot_Integration\CA__CON_AuthorizeNet|Means of Integration with Authorize.Net].{br}

In this topic, you will read about the details of integration for the Authorize.Net AIM plug-in. You will also learn how to set up and test a connection to Authorize.Net with the plug-in.{br}{TOC}
==Integration Details==
The plug-in uses Advanced Integration Method (AIM) to submit transactions to the payment gateway. It also uses the specific format of the transaction response returned by the gateway. To comply with the format, you should make sure that the settings of a direct response are configured as follows in the Merchant Interface: A comma is set as the default field separator, and field encapsulation is blank. You can do this under the '''Settings''' > '''Direct Response''' menu.{br}

You use an Acumatica ERP form to fill in the customer&rsquo;s credit card details, and the system encrypts sensitive credit card information and stores it in the Acumatica ERP database. This behavior is not PCI DSS–compliant; thus, we recommend using the Authorize.Net API plug-in instead.{br}

Integration with Authorize.Net also requires that you have a valid SSL certificate and that your website is capable of initiating both client- and server-side SSL connections.
==Support of Multiple Currencies==
Authorize.Net supports multiple currencies. You select the currency to be used for processing transactions when you set up the merchant account. Thus, you need to make sure that all accounts involved in the processing of payments are denominated in the currency you have specified in Authorize.Net for your merchant account. For each currency, you need to apply for a separate merchant account with Authorize.Net and configure a dedicated processing center in Acumatica ERP.
==Support of Fraud Detection Services==
The plug-in supports fraud detection services enabled in the Authorize.Net Merchant Interface when a user adds a new credit card for a customer by using the Authorize.Net-hosted form.{br}

For example, if you turned on the address verification service provided in the Authorize.Net Merchant Interface, after you have integrated Acumatica ERP and Authorize.Net, the address will be verified by this service when a user adds a new credit card for a customer. 
==Integration Setup==
To start processing payments from customers with Authorize.Net, you should perform the following steps: [anchor|#ol_akr_x4f_pn]
#You sign up with Authorize.Net. You apply for a payment gateway account and a merchant account if you do not have these accounts. A merchant account is an agreement with a merchant bank that you use to accept payment by credit and debit card.

The processing center will use these two values to authenticate you and ensure that you are authorized to submit transactions. For details, see [http://www.authorize.net/|the Authorize.Net official site].
#:((({S:Warn}You can also create a [http://developer.authorize.net/#sandbox|sandbox account] at Authorize.Net to get the URL and credentials to test payment processing. 
)))
#You configure the Authorize.Net processing center in Acumatica ERP by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_50_00|Processing Centers] ([~/?ScreenId=CA205000|CA205000]) form.
#Optional: You create a vendor account for Authorize.Net by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form and specify the accounts (and subaccounts) for recording any fees and charges applied by the center for processing your credit card transactions.
#You create a payment method for each bank operator whose cards you are going to process (such as Visa, Mastercard, or American Express), and associate payment methods with the Authorize.Net processing center. You can then use these payment methods as templates to create customer payment methods. For details, see [HelpRoot_Integration\CA__HOW_Add_PM_Card|To Add a Payment Method for Payment Processing].
#You collect credit and debit card details from your customers, and create customer payment methods for all customers whose payments you want to process with Authorize.Net. For details, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__CON_Customer_PaymentMethods|Configuring Customer Payment Methods].
#You test payment processing with Authorize.Net, as described in the next section.

==Authorize.Net Test Mode==
After initial setup, your Authorize.Net account is placed in test mode by default; you can view a red bar with the warning in the Authorize.Net Merchant Interface. In test mode, Authorize.Net does not process transactions and always returns a successful response. Thus, a test payment never gets charged. {br}

Alternatively, you can create a sandbox account at Authorize.Net and use the URL and the login credentials provided for the sandbox account.{br}

The Acumatica ERP plug-in also has a parameter whose value controls whether a transaction sent to the payment gateway is marked as a test transaction. It can be used to test payment processing when your Authorize.Net account is in live mode. {br}

To switch test mode off, perform the following steps:[anchor|#ol_wgr_4sz_pn]
#Log in to the Authorize.Net Merchant Interface, and switch off test mode on the Authorize.Net side.
#Reconfigure the Authorize.Net processing center in Acumatica ERP. To do this, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_50_00|Processing Centers] ([~/?ScreenId=CA205000|CA205000]) form, change the '''TESTMODE''' value to ''0''. Save your changes.
#:((({S:Warn}If you have configured the plug-in to use the URL and login credentials for your sandbox account, you need to change these values to production ones and then switch off test mode on the Authorize.Net side.

 Acumatica ERP offers three payment plug-ins for implementing integration with Authorize.Net. For a comparison of the features of the plug-ins, see [HelpRoot_Integration\CA__CON_AuthorizeNet|Means of Integration with Authorize.Net].{br}

In this topic, you will read about the details of integration for the Authorize.Net CIM plug-in. You will also learn how to set up and test a connection to Authorize.Net with the plug-in.{br}{TOC}
==Integration Details==
The plug-in uses Hosted CIM to submit transactions to the payment gateway and will be deprecated on March 1, 2018. We recommend using the Authorize.Net API plug-in instead.{br}

The plug-in provides PCI DSS–compliant integration with Authorize.Net. The plug-in supports encrypted storage of your credentials that are used to connect to the processing center server. Sensitive credit card information is not stored in theAcumatica ERP database. Instead, the system sends the customer&rsquo;s credit card details to the processing center through an encrypted channel.{br}

Integration with Authorize.Net also requires that you have a valid SSL certificate and that your website is capable of initiating both client- and server-side SSL connections.
==Support of Multiple Currencies==
Authorize.Net supports multiple currencies. You select the currency to be used for processing transactions when you set up the merchant account. Thus, you need to make sure that all accounts involved in the processing of payments are denominated in the currency you have specified in Authorize.Net for your merchant account. For each currency, you need to apply for a separate merchant account with Authorize.Net and configure a dedicated processing center in Acumatica ERP.
==Authorize.Net-Hosted Form==
You may use either an Acumatica ERP form or an Authorize.Net-hosted form to fill in customers&rsquo; credit card details. The value of the '''Allow Direct Input''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_50_00|Processing Centers] ([~/?ScreenId=CA205000|CA205000]) form defines which form will be used to fill in customer credit card details as follows:[anchor|#ul_tgp_mml_vt]
*''Cleared'': An Authorize.Net-hosted form is used.
*''Selected'': An Acumatica ERP form is used.

For details, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__HOW_Add_Customer_CC_AuthNet|To Add a Credit Card Through an Authorize.Net Form].
==Support of Fraud Detection Services==
The plug-in supports fraud detection services enabled in the Authorize.Net Merchant Interface when a user adds a new credit card for a customer by using the Authorize.Net-hosted form.{br}

For example, if you turned on the address verification service provided in the Authorize.Net Merchant Interface, after you have integrated Acumatica ERP and Authorize.Net, the address will be verified by this service when a user adds a new credit card for a customer by using the Authorize.Net-hosted form. 
==Update of Expiration Dates==
Starting with Acumatica ERP 5.3 Update 2, the plug-in supports the retrieval of unmasked expiration dates from Authorize.Net. By using the '''Update Expiration Dates''' button on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_50_00|Processing Centers] form, you can retrieve expiration dates for customer payment methods for which these dates were not specified. If you use the button for a processing center that was configured before your site upgraded to this version, the system adds the new <tt>DATEFRMT</tt> parameter to the table on the '''Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_50_00|Processing Centers] form. For new processing centers, the parameter is added on the configuration step. The parameter defines the date format used to parse the date string received from Authorize.Net. By default, it is <tt>yyyy-MM</tt>.
==Record Maintenance==
When you add a credit or debit card for a customer account for the first time by using Acumatica ERP, Authorize.Net returns the following: [anchor|#ul_fgg_sgk_vt]
*'''Customer Profile ID''': The identifier that is associated with the customer account. Its main purpose is to link multiple payment profiles (credit or debit cards) with a single customer entity.
*'''Payment Profile ID''': The identifier that is associated with the customer payment method. This identifier is used for storing sensitive payment information with Authorize.Net in a secure and PCI-compliant manner. 

When you add another credit or debit card for this customer account, Acumatica ERP includes the customer profile ID of the customer in the request sent to Authorize.Net, and in return receives only the new payment profile identifier that has been linked to this customer profile identifier.{br}

By using these two identifiers, Acumatica ERP and Authorize.Net synchronize the changes of the customer payment method in both systems. You can edit the details of a payment method by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_10|Customer Payment Methods] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303010|AR303010]) form and the Authorize.Net Merchant Interface tools. {br}

 You can control the synchronization of the deletion of profiles by using the '''Synchronize Deletion''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_50_00|Processing Centers] ([~/?ScreenId=CA205000|CA205000]) form as follows:[anchor|#ul_gmf_24t_15]
*Cleared: With this setting, when a user deletes (in Acumatica ERP) a customer payment method that is registered with Authorize.Net, the payment method information is not deleted from the Authorize.Net server.
*Selected: With this setting, when a user deletes (in Acumatica ERP) a customer payment method that is registered with Authorize.Net, the payment method information is automatically deleted from the Authorize.Net server.

==Additional Validation of the Customer Payment Method==
You can control whether to pre-authorize a credit or debit card for a minimum amount after the card details have been sent to Authorize.Net through its hosted form by using the '''TESTMODE''' parameter of the CIM plug-in as follows:[anchor|#_fef42bc4-1f9e-48d2-b410-7d67b3b2fde5]
*''0'': With this setting, when a user enters the details of a credit or debit card through the Authorize.Net-hosted form, the card is pre-authorized for a minimum amount.
*''1'': With this setting, no additional validation is performed. 
((({S:Warn}If you merchant account is in test mode, the card will not be pre-authorized. 
)))
==Integration Setup==
To start processing payments from customers with Authorize.Net, you should perform the following steps: [anchor|#ol_akr_x4f_pn]
#You sign up with Authorize.Net. You apply for a payment gateway account and a merchant account if you do not have these accounts. A merchant account is an agreement with a merchant bank that you use to accept payment by credit and debit card. Authorize.Net provides you with the URL and the login credentials to the Authorize.Net Merchant Interface. You sign in to the Merchant Interface, and create your account API login ID and transaction key. The processing center will use these two values to authenticate you and ensure that you are authorized to submit transactions. For details, see [http://www.authorize.net/|the Authorize.Net official site].
#:((({S:Warn}You can also create a [http://developer.authorize.net/#sandbox|sandbox account] at Authorize.Net to get the URL and credentials to test payment processing. 
)))
#You configure the Authorize.Net processing center in Acumatica ERP. For details, see [HelpRoot_Integration\CA__HOW_Configure_AuthorizeNet_ProcCenterCIM|To Configure the Authorize.Net Processing Center with the CIM Plug-in].
#Optional: You create a vendor account for Authorize.Net by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form, and specify the accounts (and subaccounts) for recording any fees and charges applied by the center for processing your credit card transactions.
#You create a payment method for each bank operator whose cards you are going to process (such as Visa, Mastercard, or American Express), and associate payment methods with the Authorize.Net processing center. You can then use these payment methods as templates to create customer payment methods. For details, see [HelpRoot_Integration\CA__HOW_Add_PM_Card|To Add a Payment Method for Payment Processing].
#You collect credit and debit card details from your customers, and create customer payment methods for all customers whose payments you want to process with Authorize.Net. For details, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__CON_Customer_PaymentMethods|Configuring Customer Payment Methods].
#You test payment processing with Authorize.Net, as described in the next section.

==Authorize.Net Test Mode==
After initial setup, your Authorize.Net account is placed in test mode by default; you can view a red bar with the warning in the Authorize.Net Merchant Interface. In test mode, Authorize.Net does not process transactions and always returns a successful response. Thus, a test payment never gets charged. {br}

Alternatively, you can create a sandbox account at Authorize.Net and use the URL and the login credentials provided for the sandbox account.{br}

To switch test mode off, perform the following steps:[anchor|#ol_wgr_4sz_pn]
#If you have used a sandbox account, reconfigure the Authorize.Net processing center in Acumatica ERP. To do this, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_50_00|Processing Centers] ([~/?ScreenId=CA205000|CA205000]) form, change the '''APIURL''', '''MERCNAME''', and '''TRANKEY''' values to the values for your actual merchant account. Save your changes.
#Log in to the Authorize.Net Merchant Interface, and switch off test mode on the Authorize.Net side.

Acumatica ERP offers three payment plug-ins for implementing integration with Authorize.Net. For a         comparison of the features of the plug-ins, see  Means of Integration with Authorize.Net. In this topic, you will read about the details of integration for the Authorize.Net CIM         plug-in. You will also learn how to set up and test a connection to Authorize.Net with the         plug-in. Integration Details The plug-in uses Hosted CIM to submit transactions to the payment gateway and will be         deprecated on March 1, 2018. We recommend using the Authorize.Net API plug-in instead. The plug-in provides PCI DSS–compliant integration with Authorize.Net. The plug-in         supports encrypted storage of your credentials that are used to connect to the processing         center server. Sensitive credit card information is not stored in the Acumatica ERP database. Instead, the system sends the customer's credit card details to the processing         center through an encrypted channel. Integration with Authorize.Net also requires that you have a valid SSL certificate and that     your website is capable of initiating both client- and server-side SSL connections. Support of Multiple Currencies Authorize.Net supports multiple currencies. You select the currency to be used for         processing transactions when you set up the merchant account. Thus, you need to make sure         that all accounts involved in the processing of payments are denominated in the currency you         have specified in Authorize.Net for your merchant account. For each currency, you need to         apply for a separate merchant account with Authorize.Net and configure a dedicated         processing center in  Acumatica ERP. Authorize.Net-Hosted Form You may use either an  Acumatica ERP form or an Authorize.Net-hosted form to fill in customers' credit card details. The value         of the  Allow Direct Input  check box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA205000|CA205000]) Processing Centers (CA205000) form defines which form will be used to fill in         customer credit card details as follows: Cleared : An Authorize.Net-hosted form is used. Selected : An  Acumatica ERP form is used. For details, see  To Add a Credit Card Through an Authorize.Net Form. Support of Fraud Detection Services The plug-in supports fraud detection services enabled in the Authorize.Net Merchant         Interface when a user adds a new credit card for a customer by using the         Authorize.Net-hosted form. For example, if you turned on the address verification service provided in the         Authorize.Net Merchant Interface, after you have integrated  Acumatica ERP and Authorize.Net, the address will be verified by this service when a user adds a new         credit card for a customer by using the Authorize.Net-hosted form.  Update of Expiration Dates Starting with  Acumatica ERP 5.3 Update 2, the plug-in supports the retrieval of unmasked expiration dates from         Authorize.Net. By using the  Update Expiration Dates  button on the             ([~/?ScreenId=CA205000|CA205000]) Processing Centers form, you can retrieve expiration dates for customer         payment methods for which these dates were not specified. If you use the button for a         processing center that was configured before your site upgraded to this version, the system         adds the new  DATEFRMT  parameter to the table on the  Settings          tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA205000|CA205000]) Processing Centers form. For new processing centers, the parameter         is added on the configuration step. The parameter defines the date format used to parse the         date string received from Authorize.Net. By default, it is  yyyy-MM . Record Maintenance When you add a credit or debit card for a customer account for the first time by using  Acumatica ERP,     Authorize.Net returns the following:  Customer Profile ID : The identifier that is associated with the      customer account. Its main purpose is to link multiple payment profiles (credit or debit cards)      with a single customer entity. Payment Profile ID : The identifier that is associated with the      customer payment method. This identifier is used for storing sensitive payment information with      Authorize.Net in a secure and PCI-compliant manner.  When you add another credit or debit card for this customer account,  Acumatica ERP     includes the customer profile ID of the customer in the request sent to Authorize.Net, and in     return receives only the new payment profile identifier that has been linked to this customer     profile identifier. By using these two identifiers,  Acumatica ERP     and Authorize.Net synchronize the changes of the customer payment method in both systems. You     can edit the details of a payment method by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303010|AR303010]) Customer Payment Methods     (AR303010) form and the Authorize.Net Merchant Interface tools.   You can control the synchronization of the deletion of profiles by using the            Synchronize Deletion  check box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA205000|CA205000]) Processing Centers (CA205000) form as follows: Cleared: With this setting, when a user deletes (in  Acumatica ERP) a customer payment method that is registered with Authorize.Net, the payment method           information is not deleted from the Authorize.Net server. Selected: With this setting, when a user deletes (in  Acumatica ERP) a customer payment method that is registered with Authorize.Net, the payment method           information is automatically deleted from the Authorize.Net server. Additional Validation of the Customer Payment Method You can control whether to pre-authorize a credit or debit card for a minimum amount after         the card details have been sent to Authorize.Net through its hosted form by using the            TESTMODE  parameter of the CIM plug-in as follows: 0 : With this setting, when a user enters the details of a credit or debit card           through the Authorize.Net-hosted form, the card is pre-authorized for a minimum           amount. 1 : With this setting, no additional validation is performed.  If you merchant account is in test mode, the card will not be pre-authorized.  Integration Setup To start processing payments from customers with Authorize.Net, you should perform the     following steps:  You sign up with Authorize.Net. You apply for a payment gateway account and a merchant           account if you do not have these accounts. A merchant account is an agreement with a           merchant bank that you use to accept payment by credit and debit card. Authorize.Net           provides you with the URL and the login credentials to the Authorize.Net Merchant           Interface. You sign in to the Merchant Interface, and create your account API login ID and           transaction key. The processing center will use these two values to authenticate you and           ensure that you are authorized to submit transactions. For details, see  the Authorize.Net             official site the Authorize.Net official site. You can also create a  sandbox               account sandbox account at Authorize.Net to get the URL and credentials to test payment             processing.  You configure the Authorize.Net processing center in  Acumatica ERP. For details, see  To Configure the Authorize.Net Processing Center with the CIM Plug-in. Optional: You create a vendor account for Authorize.Net by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors (AP303000) form, and specify the accounts (and subaccounts)           for recording any fees and charges applied by the center for processing your credit card           transactions. You create a payment method for each bank operator whose cards you are going to process           (such as Visa, Mastercard, or American Express), and associate payment methods with the           Authorize.Net processing center. You can then use these payment methods as templates to           create customer payment methods. For details, see  To Add a Payment Method for Payment Processing. You collect credit and debit card details from your customers, and create customer payment           methods for all customers whose payments you want to process with Authorize.Net. For           details, see  Configuring Customer Payment Methods. You test payment processing with Authorize.Net, as described in the next section. Authorize.Net Test Mode After initial setup, your Authorize.Net account is placed in test mode by default; you can         view a red bar with the warning in the Authorize.Net Merchant Interface. In test mode,         Authorize.Net does not process transactions and always returns a successful response. Thus,         a test payment never gets charged.  Alternatively, you can create a sandbox account at Authorize.Net and use the URL and the         login credentials provided for the sandbox account. To switch test mode off, perform the following steps: If you have used a sandbox account, reconfigure the Authorize.Net processing center in              Acumatica ERP. To do this, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA205000|CA205000]) Processing Centers (CA205000) form, change the              APIURL ,  MERCNAME , and              TRANKEY  values to the values for your actual merchant account.           Save your changes. Log in to the Authorize.Net Merchant Interface, and switch off test mode on the      Authorize.Net side. ]]></column>

You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_40_00|Payment Methods] ([~/?ScreenId=CA204000|CA204000]) form to create a payment method. This procedure describes how you create a payment method that is used as a template for configuring customer payment methods—credit or debit cards.{br}

This topic describes how to configure payment methods, such as Visa, Mastercard, or American Express.
==Before You Proceed==
You should review the cash accounts you have defined in the system, and decide which one you are going to use to record customer payments made with the payment method you are adding. For details, see [HelpRoot_Integration\CA__CON_CardProcessingScenario|Setup of Card Payment Processing].{br}

Make sure that you have configured the processing center and established and tested the connection to the Authorize.Net payment gateway.
==To Add a Payment Method for Actual Payment Processing==[anchor|#ol_dvg_zrc_1l]

#Select the '''Active''' check box to make the payment method available for use in the system.
#In the '''Means of Payment''' box, select ''Credit Card'' to use the template that is specifically designed for the configuration of credit and debit cards. When you select this template, the system adds the built-in elements that are usually established by financial institutions and required by the processing center to the '''Payment Method Details''' table on the '''Settings for Use in AR''' tab. Also, this selection causes the '''Require Card/Account Number''' and the '''Has Billing Information''' check boxes to be selected automatically.
#Select the '''Use in AR''' check box to make the payment method available for the creation of customer methods. 
#Make sure that the '''Use in AP''' and '''Require Remittance Information for Cash Account''' check boxes are cleared.
#In the '''Description''' box, type a description of the payment method.
#On the '''Allowed Cash Accounts''' tab, do the following for each cash account you are planning to record customer payments to as follows:
##Click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and select the cash account.
##If the selected cash account in this row should be used by default for recording card transactions, select the '''AR Default''' check box.
##Optional: Select the '''AR-Suggest Next Number''' check box to enable auto-numeration of the payments created with this payment method and cash account. If you have selected the check box in the '''AR Last Reference Number''' column, specify the last number of the payment made, which will be incremented by 1 each time you create a new payment. The system automatically assigns the next number in the '''Payment Ref.''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_20_00|Payments and Applications] ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) form.
#On the '''Settings for Use in AR''' tab, do the following:
##Select the '''Integrated Processing''' check box. 
##:The '''Processing Centers''' tab appears on the form so you can associate the payment method with the processing center that you have configured (which you will do in the next step).
##Make sure that the '''Require Card/Account Number''' check box is selected. 
##If you use the address verification service of Authorize.Net, select the '''Has Billing Information''' check box.
##Make sure that the '''Void On Clearing Account''' and the '''Default Void Date to Document Date''' check boxes are cleared (because these are used for processing deposits).
#On the '''Processing Centers''' tab, which you use to associate the payment method with multiple processing centers, do the following for each processing center:
##On the table toolbar, click '''Add Row'''.
##In the '''Proc. Center ID''' box, select the processing center that you have configured for integration with Authorize.Net.
##Select the '''Active''' check box to make the association available.
##Optional: Select the '''Default''' check box if this processing center should be used by default with the payment method.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

After the payment method is configured, you should configure the customer payment methods by specifying custom information for each customer account. For details, see the following procedures:[anchor|#ul_z2l_dgk_xt]

When you are working with a processing center or customer payment methods based on credit cards and these use a discontinued plug-in, you will receive a warning message from the system that the processing center is using a discontinued plug-in and that you should set up a processing center to use the API plug-in. The following instructions describe how to replace a processing center that uses a discontinued plug-in with a processing center that uses the new API plug-in.{br}

The following instructions are designed for users of the Authorize.Net API plug-in. Users of other processing centers should request a new plug-in from their provider, and then complete these instructions, selecting the needed plug-in.
==Before You Proceed==
Before you configure the new processing center and convert customer payment methods based on credit cards to use the new processing center, you must make sure that you have the credentials (API login, signature key, and transaction key) of the processing center that will be replaced with the new one. You will do this by creating a test processing center and converting a test customer payment method.{br}

For each deprecated plug-in used in a processing center, you should complete the following instructions:[anchor|#_c77f4a02-d2f4-42a1-b292-e71db1322cc1]
#Create a test processing center with a deprecated plug-in, as described in [[#_f39d6ec4-80a5-45ab-8c52-d3b3debbb054|Step 1] of this topic, using test credentials.
#Create a test customer payment method and configure it to use the test processing center you have created.
#Perform the authorization process for the test customer payment method as follows:
##On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_20_00|Payments and Applications] ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) form, enter a new credit card payment.
##On the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Authorize CC Payment'''.
#Configure another test processing center with a supported plug-in, using the same credentials as you used for the first test processing center.
#Update the customer payment method to use the API plug-in (the Version 2 plug-in), as described in [[#_d82fbd7a-90f5-4049-a0a8-7a4737505559|Step 3] below.
#Perform the capture process for the test customer payment method as follows:
##On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_20_00|Payments and Applications] form, select the credit card payment.
##On the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Capture CC Payment'''.

If this process has been completed successfully for the test customer payment method, you can proceed in updating other customer payment methods configured with the same processing center and the same plug-in as the test customer payment method. If you have encountered issues while performing this process, you need to contact your Acumatica support provider for assistance.[anchor|#_f39d6ec4-80a5-45ab-8c52-d3b3debbb054]
==Step 1: Configure a Processing Center to Use the API Plug-in==
To configure a new processing center to use the API plug-in, do the following:[anchor|#_e61cf5d0-5481-4fff-962e-2e13e87de88f]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_50_00|Processing Centers] ([~/?ScreenId=CA205000|CA205000]) form.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Add New Record'''.
#In the '''Proc. Center ID''' box, type the identifier to be used for the new processing center.
#In the '''Name''' box, type the name of the processing center.
#In the '''Cash Account''' box, select the cash account associated with the old processing center (the one that is being replaced).
#Select the '''Active''' check box to make it possible to select a plug-in in the '''Payment Plug-In (Type)''' box.
#In the '''Payment Plug-In (Type)''' box, select the ''Authorize.Net API'' plug-in.
#Optional: Select the '''Synchronize Deletion''' check box to cause the customer payment method information to be automatically deleted from the Authorize.Net server when a user deletes a customer payment method that is registered with Authorize.Net in Acumatica ERP.
#Optional: Select the '''Accept Payment from New Card''' check box to give this processing center the ability to accept payments from customers&rsquo; credit cards that are not stored in the system.
#On the '''Settings''' tab, specify the following settings: 
#*'''MERCNAME''': The API login of the old processing center that was created by an administrator of your site.
#*'''SIGNKEY''' (optional): The signature key of the old processing center, used by web hooks. If the old processing center did not use this setting, you can obtain the signature key on the website of the processing center and configure web hooks.
#*'''TESTMODE''': A value that indicates whether you are using the production account or a sandbox account. Change the value from ''0'' (default) to ''1'' if you are configuring the processing center to connect to your sandbox merchant account. The ''0'' default value means that the production URL is used for connection.
#*'''TRANKEY''': The transaction key of the old processing center that was created in the Authorize.Net Merchant Interface.
#*'''VALIDATION''': The mode that is used to validate customer payment methods set up to use this processing center. ''Test Mode'' can be used for a sandbox environment, and ''Live Mode'' should be selected for a production environment.
#Optional: On the '''Connection Preferences''' tab, select the '''Create Additional Profiles''' check box if you plan to accept payments from customers who use more than 10 customer payment methods.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Test Credentials''' to validate the credentials you have entered with the processing center.

==Step 2: Process Transactions for Each Processing Center with the Fraud Detection Suite (Optional) ==
For each processing center that has the Fraud Detection Suite set up to hold suspicious transactions for review, do the following:[anchor|#_b239ac92-a4c0-418d-85af-261e164f08c3]
#On the processing center website, approve or decline the transactions held for review.
#In Acumatica ERP, process the documents with transactions held for review, as described in [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__HOW_To_Process_CCTransaction_Held_for_Review|To Process a Transaction Held for Review by the Processing Center].
[anchor|#_d82fbd7a-90f5-4049-a0a8-7a4737505559]
==Step 3: Configure Customer Payment Methods to Use the New Processing Center==
For each processing center to be replaced, you should update customer payment methods to use the new processing center. For each payment method associated with the processing center, the following instructions should be performed:[anchor|#_33554d4c-7c55-45b4-939b-522a70b05d62]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_70_00|Payment Method Converter] ([~/?ScreenId=CA207000|CA207000]) form.
#In the '''Old Payment Method ID''' box, select the payment method ID of the payment method.
#:The system populates the '''Old Proc. Center ID''' box with the ID of the default processing center assigned to the selected payment method.
#Select another processing center if necessary.
#In the '''New Proc. Center ID''' box, select the ID of the new processing center you configured in Step 1 of these instructions.
#Select the '''Process Expired Cards''' check box.
#:Selecting this check box deactivates customer payment methods corresponding to expired credit cards and deletes all sensitive credit card details of these customer payment methods from the Acumatica ERP database. The corresponding customer payment methods are shown on documents, but do not allow credit card processing.
#In the table, select the '''Selected''' check boxes for the customer payment methods to be converted; on the form toolbar, click '''Process'''.

TESTMODE : A value that indicates whether you are                             using the production account or a sandbox account. Change the value from                                  0  (default) to  1  if you are configuring the processing                             center to connect to your sandbox merchant account. The  0  default                             value means that the production URL is used for connection. TRANKEY : The transaction key of the old                             processing center that was created in the Authorize.Net Merchant                             Interface. VALIDATION : The mode that is used to validate                             customer payment methods set up to use this processing center.  Test                                 Mode  can be used for a sandbox environment, and  Live Mode                              should be selected for a production environment. Optional: On the  Connection Preferences  tab, select the                          Create Additional Profiles  check box if you plan to                     accept payments from customers who use more than 10 customer payment                     methods. On the form toolbar, click  Save . On the form toolbar, click  Test Credentials  to validate                     the credentials you have entered with the processing center. Step 2: Process Transactions for Each Processing Center with the Fraud Detection                 Suite (Optional)  For each processing center that has the Fraud Detection Suite set up to hold                 suspicious transactions for review, do the following: On the processing center website, approve or decline the transactions held for                     review. In  Acumatica ERP, process the documents with transactions held for review, as described in                          To Process a Transaction Held for Review by the Processing Center. Step 3: Configure Customer Payment Methods to Use the New Processing                 Center For each processing center to be replaced, you should update customer payment methods                 to use the new processing center. For each payment method associated with the                 processing center, the following instructions should be performed: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA207000|CA207000]) Payment Method Converter (CA207000) form. In the  Old Payment Method ID  box, select the payment                     method ID of the payment method. The system populates the  Old Proc.                             Center ID  box with the ID of the default processing center                         assigned to the selected payment method. Select another processing center if necessary. In the  New Proc. Center ID  box, select the ID of the new                     processing center you configured in Step 1 of these instructions. Select the  Process Expired Cards  check box. Selecting                         this check box deactivates customer payment methods corresponding to expired                         credit cards and deletes all sensitive credit card details of these customer                         payment methods from the  Acumatica ERP database. The corresponding customer payment methods are shown on                         documents, but do not allow credit card processing. In the table, select the  Selected  check boxes for the                     customer payment methods to be converted; on the form toolbar, click                          Process . ]]></column>

Synchronization policies define the settings for synchronization between your Exchange Server and Acumatica ERP instances, such as the record types to be synchronized, the synchronization direction, and the way the synchronized records will be marked. {br}

You can create different synchronization policies to meet the needs of the employees of your company. Rather than configuring synchronization individually for each employee, you define the synchronization policies and assign them to employees. Changing a synchronization policy changes the synchronization settings for all employees with this policy assigned.{br}{TOC}
==Record Types==
For a synchronization policy, you can select the types of records to be synchronized. The following table shows how record types are mapped between Acumatica ERP and Exchange Server.[anchor|#table_owg_njv_dp]
===Supported Record Types===
{| class="checklist" | width="100%"

|}
For more information, see [HelpRoot_Integration\EM__con_Sync_Records|Record Synchronization in Acumatica ERP].
==Category==
Any synchronization policy includes a category to be used to mark records exported from Acumatica ERP. A category includes a color and a word (or a phrase) that you have entered for the policy.
==Synchronization Direction==
A policy defines the direction for synchronization. You can select either unidirectional or bidirectional synchronization for tasks, contacts, and events. Email synchronization is bidirectional only.
==Conflict Resolution==
If a policy includes bidirectional synchronization of any type of records, you need to define how the system is to resolve possible conflicts that may arise if records of the corresponding type have been updated since the previous synchronization. You can give priority to records from a particular system, or you can choose to keep copies of records from both systems.
==Contact Synchronization==
For a synchronization policy that includes contact synchronization, you have to decide the following:[anchor|#ol_xxs_qkc_2p]
*Which contacts will be synchronized: all the available contacts, or specific contact groups (such as the contacts associated with the user or the user&rsquo;s workgroup)
*Whether a specific folder will be used for synchronized contacts

==Email Synchronization==
For a synchronization policy that includes email synchronization, you have to decide the following:[anchor|#ul_e2p_bnc_2p]
*Whether a specific folder will be used to store synchronized emails
*Whether a new contact is to be created each time an employee receives an email from an unknown address
*Whether you want to synchronize attachments

Managing synchronization with Exchange Server includes the following basic tasks, described in this topic:[anchor|#ul_jzw_gn1_dq]
*Selecting the employee accounts for which synchronization is to be performed
*Scheduling synchronization
{br}{TOC}
==Employee Account Configuration==
You configure synchronization for an employee account by associating the employee account with the Exchange server account and assigning a synchronization policy for the employee account. For details, see [HelpRoot_Integration\EM__how_Set_up_employee|To Configure Synchronization for the Employee Accounts]. For more information about synchronization policies, see [HelpRoot_Integration\EM__con_Synch_Policies|Synchronization Policies].{br}

After you configure the employee account, you can perform synchronization manually to check the settings, as described in [HelpRoot_Integration\EM__how_Add_Server|To Set Up a Connection with an Exchange Server].
==System Email Accounts for Synchronization with Exchange Server==
A system email account of the ''Exchange'' type is automatically added when you enable synchronization of the employee account with an Exchange server. You can view and edit the automatically generated accounts on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_02|System Email Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=SM204002|SM204002]) form. If you disable Exchange synchronization for an employee account, the corresponding system email account is automatically deleted.

After you have set up integration with the Exchange server, synchronization of all relevant records is performed automatically in accordance with the configured schedule and applied policies.{br}

In this topic, you will find information about the basic principles that users should follow to ensure seamless synchronization of records.{br}{TOC}
==Contact Synchronization==
In Acumatica ERP, all contact records available for synchronization are listed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) form. These contacts are synchronized with the contacts stored in the mailbox on the Exchange server, as specified in the synchronization policy settings. The following synchronization scenarios are possible:[anchor|#ul_mck_hhc_2p]
*A new contact has been created in the system—as a result, an identical contact is added to the user mailbox on the Exchange server.
*An existing contact has been modified in the system—as a result, the corresponding contact from the user mailbox on the Exchange server is updated accordingly.
*A contact has been deleted from the system—as a result, the corresponding contact is deleted from the specific public folder on the Exchange Server.
*A contact has been added to the specific public folder on the Exchange Server—as a result, an identical contact is added to the system.
*An existing contact has been modified in the specific public folder on the Exchange Server—as a result, the corresponding contact is updated accordingly in the system.
*A contact has been deleted from the specific public folder on the Exchange Server—as a result, the corresponding contact is deleted from the system.
((({S:Warn}If a contact record on Exchange Server has no country specified, and if, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_10|Exchange Synchronization Policies] ([~/?ScreenId=SM204010|SM204010]) form, the '''Conflict Resolution Priority''' setting is set to ''System'' for the synchronization policy applied to contact records, then the synchronized records will be assigned the branch country specified in the configuration settings of the user&rsquo;s branch on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_20_00|Branches] ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) form (or the default country, if one is specified for the branch).
)))
==Email Synchronization==
In Acumatica ERP, each contact can have associated email activities listed on the '''Activities''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) form. These emails can be synchronized with emails from a specific email folder on the Exchange server; the name of this folder should be specified in the synchronization policy settings. Email attachments can also be synchronized. If an email contains new contacts specified as recipients, the corresponding contact records are created automatically.((({S:Warn}Email synchronization has the following limitation: Emails with the ''Draft'' status are not included in synchronization between Microsoft Exchange Server and Acumatica ERP.
)))
==Task Synchronization==
Tasks listed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_40_40_00|Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=EP404000|EP404000]) form are synchronized with Exchange tasks included in a specific category that should be specified in the synchronization policy settings. New tasks assigned to a particular contact can be synchronized in both directions. Any shared task information, if updated, is also synchronized. If a task has been deleted in the system, the corresponding task is deleted on Exchange Server; likewise, if a task is deleted on Exchange Server, the corresponding task is deleted in Acumatica ERP.{br}

 Task statuses, which indicate the task processing stages, are mapped as shown in the table below. No synchronization is performed for any task whose status has no corresponding status.[anchor|#table_avk_mrc_2p]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="50%" ! System Task Status
!width="50%" ! Exchange Task Status

|  ''Not Started''
|-

| N/A

|- 
|  ''Pending Approval''
|  ''Waiting on Others''
|- 
|  ''Rejected''
| N/A
|- 
| N/A
| ''Deferred''
|}
==Event Synchronization==
Events listed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_40_41_00|Events] ([~/?ScreenId=EP404100|EP404100]) form are synchronized with Exchange appointments. Appointments that correspond to canceled events are deleted from the Exchange Server. Completion of an event does not require synchronization with the corresponding appointment. Also, the following synchronization scenarios are possible:[anchor|#ul_rqz_nsc_2p]
*A new event has been created in the system—as a result, an identical appointment is added to the initiator&rsquo;s calendar on the Exchange server.
*The list of attendees has been updated for an existing event—as a result, the list of attendees is updated accordingly for the corresponding appointment; invitations are automatically sent to attendees.
*An event has been deleted—as a result, the corresponding appointment is deleted from the initiator&rsquo;s calendar on the Exchange server.
*An appointment has been deleted from the initiator&rsquo;s calendar on the Exchange server—as a result, the corresponding event is deleted in the system.
*All updated event information is synchronized with appointment information, and the reverse is true as well.
((({S:Warn}Event synchronization has the following limitation: If an employee (event owner) whose events are not synchronized with Exchange appointments creates an event in the system and invites an employee (attendee) whose events are synchronized with Exchange appointments, no corresponding appointment will appear on the attendee&rsquo;s calendar on the Exchange server. This happens because an appointment has to be created before an attendee is assigned to it, and if event synchronization is disabled for the event owner, no appointment is created at all. The best way to bypass this limitation is to enable event synchronization for all employees in your company.

)))((({S:Hint}Enabling integration with AD does not affect the standard authorization and authentication mechanism of Acumatica ERP. With the AD integration enabled, you still can create regular (non-AD) users in Acumatica ERP.
))){br}{TOC}
==Configuration Steps==
To integrate an instance of Acumatica ERP with AD, you perform the following steps:[anchor|#ol_a41_bnd_vl]
#Enable integration with Active Directory by modifying the <tt>web.config</tt> file of the application instance, as described in [HelpRoot_Integration\US__how_Active_Directory_Integration__Enable|To Enable Active Directory Integration].
#:((({S:Danger}When you save changes to the <tt>web.config</tt> file, the website is automatically restarted. Make sure that all users are warned about the restart so that they can save their documents in advance.
)))
#Map the user roles configured in Acumatica ERP to the groups configured in the Active Directory domain by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_05|User Roles] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201005|SM201005]) form in Acumatica ERP. For details, see [HelpRoot_Integration\US__how_Active_Directory_Integration__Map_Roles|To Map Active Directory Groups to Roles in Acumatica ERP].
#:((({S:Hint}Enabling AD integration does not affect the standard authorization and authentication capabilities of Acumatica ERP. With AD integration enabled, you can still create internal users in Acumatica ERP.
)))
#Optional: If you need to override roles assigned to AD users, manually add the AD user accounts to the system (if necessary) and specify the roles for the accounts. For details, see [HelpRoot_Integration\US__how_AD_Groups_Override|To Set Up Role Assignment for Domain Users].
[anchor|#_54e0a56e-21c4-47e6-ad97-20022c1500fb]
==User Accounts of Domain Users in Acumatica ERP==
After you have enabled integration with the identity management system, user accounts for domain users are created automatically when the users sign in to your Acumatica ERP instance for the first time.{br}

The accounts of domain users in Acumatica ERP are based on their accounts in the domain. The password of a domain user in Acumatica ERP is the same as the domain account password. The email address and the first and last name of the user are populated from the domain account as well. However, the login, password, email address, and first and last name are managed through the domain and cannot be changed in Acumatica ERP.((({S:Warn}You cannot restore the passwords of domain users by using Acumatica ERP tools. You should restore users&rsquo; domain credentials by using tools of Active Directory (AD).
))){br}

To speed up authentication of users, the information about AD groups is automatically cashed by Acumatica ERP, if the count of the user groups is greater than or equals to the value of the {{ADGroupCacheLimit}} parameter, specified in the <tt>web.config</tt> file. To update the list of the user groups in Acumatica ERP with current information from AD, click the '''Reload AD Groups''' button on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_05|User Roles] (201005) form. {br}

The '''Reload AD Groups''' button appears only when you integrated Acumatica ERP instance with AD, AD FS or Azure AD and when the number of the user groups in AD, AD FS or Azure AD is greater than or equals to the value of the{{ADGroupCacheLimit}} parameter, specified in the <tt>web.config</tt> file. If the number of the users and groups in AD is less than the value of the {{ADGroupCacheLimit}} parameter, Acumatica ERP retrieves the lists of users and groups directly from AD.
==Domain User Authentication==
Generally, to sign in to Acumatica ERP, AD users type their domain credentials without specifying the domain name. But some employees may have both a local user account and a domain user account with the same user name. In this case, Acumatica ERP will authenticate the users based on the password they specify (assuming that the local and domain passwords differ).{br}

If both the user names and the passwords are the same for a local user account and a domain user account, on the Sign-In page, the user can select the account to sign in with as follows:[anchor|#ul_jsf_1m3_ss]
*To sign in with a local account, the user enters the user name of the local account (as usual).
*To sign in with a domain account, the user enters the login in the <tt>&lt;Domain&#95;Name&gt;\&lt;User&#95;Name&gt;</tt> format, where <tt>&lt;Domain&#95;Name&gt;</tt> is the NetBIOS domain name of the integrated domain and <tt>&lt;User&#95;Name&gt;</tt> is the user account name in the integrated domain.
((({S:Hint}If there is a local account with the name which includes a domain name and a user name from this domain, for example, <tt>Terra\User1</tt>, a domain user with the name ''User1'' from domain ''Terra'' will be mapped to this local account and will inherit all permissions of this account. In this case passwords of a local user and a domain user may differ but they both will access the same user account. To prevent confusion, we recommend that you disable or delete the local accounts of employees who do not perform any administration or configuration tasks in Acumatica ERP.
)))[anchor|#_d6ca28f6-0704-4696-a30a-536c6036d6ff]
==Domain User Authorization==
 When a domain user tries to access Acumatica ERP, user authorization occurs as follows:[anchor|#_9738c4d5-bdfe-4d01-bd48-d8256ddb154b]
#The application instance sends an authentication request to the AD server to validate the user&rsquo;s credentials.
#When validation has completed successfully, the AD server sends Acumatica ERP the list of AD groups to which the user is assigned.
# Acumatica ERP compares the list of AD groups with the internal Acumatica ERP roles, based on the mapping rules defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_05|User Roles] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201005|SM201005]) form.
#The system finds any Acumatica ERP roles that are associated with AD groups to which the domain user account is assigned. If Acumatica ERP finds at least one role, the user is authenticated to sign in to the Acumatica ERP instance.
#:The user access rights within the Acumatica ERP application instance are based on the internal list of roles.

For more information about authentication in Acumatica ERP, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Managing_User_Access_Mapref|Managing User Access]. For details about roles and access rights in Acumatica ERP, see [HelpRoot_Administration\User_Roles_Mapref|Configuring User Roles].[anchor|#_991e65ac-2e99-48ae-8b4b-ea7ba5261924]
==Access Rights of Domain Users==
Domain users inherit access rights from the AD groups that you mapped to Acumatica ERP user roles. In addition, you can assign specific user roles to each domain user if the access rights for this user should differ from the AD group rights.{br}

New domain users automatically get the rights to sign in to Acumatica ERP when they join a domain. The membership of these users in Acumatica ERP roles is then automatically updated to comply with the membership of the users in the domain groups.((({S:Warn}The user type functionality, described in [HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Managing_User_Access_User_Types_Usage_Concept|User Access: Linked Entity and User Type], cannot be applied to domain users.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Integration with Active Directory You integrate  Acumatica ERP with Microsoft Active Directory (AD) to manage users and access in one place. You                 create, delete, and manage user accounts by using AD. During integration you map AD                 groups with user roles in  Acumatica ERP to determine users' access rights. This functionality is available only if the  Active Directory                     and Other External SSO  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features form. Enabling integration with AD does not affect the standard authorization                 and authentication mechanism of  Acumatica ERP. With the AD integration enabled, you still can create regular (non-AD) users in                      Acumatica ERP. Configuration Steps To integrate an instance of  Acumatica ERP with AD, you perform the following steps: Enable integration with Active Directory by modifying the                          web.config  file of the application instance, as                     described in  To Enable Active Directory Integration. When you save changes to the                  web.config  file, the website is automatically restarted. Make             sure that all users are warned about the restart so that they can save their documents             in advance. Map the user roles configured in  Acumatica ERP to the groups configured in the Active Directory domain by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201005|SM201005]) User Roles (SM201005) form in  Acumatica ERP. For details, see  To Map Active Directory Groups to Roles in Acumatica ERP. Enabling AD integration does not affect the standard                         authorization and authentication capabilities of  Acumatica ERP. With AD integration enabled, you can still create internal users in  Acumatica ERP. Optional: If you need to override roles assigned to AD users, manually add the                     AD user accounts to the system (if necessary) and specify the roles for the                     accounts. For details, see  To Set Up Role Assignment for Domain Users. User Accounts of Domain Users in  Acumatica ERPAfter you have enabled integration with the identity management system, user accounts                 for domain users are created automatically when the users sign in to your  Acumatica ERP instance for the first time. The accounts of domain users in  Acumatica ERP are based on their accounts in the domain. The password of a domain user in  Acumatica ERP is the same as the domain account password. The email address and the first and                 last name of the user are populated from the domain account as well. However, the                 login, password, email address, and first and last name are managed through the                 domain and cannot be changed in  Acumatica ERP. You cannot restore the passwords of domain users by                     using  Acumatica ERP tools. You should restore users' domain credentials by using tools of Active                     Directory (AD). To speed up authentication of users, the information about AD groups is automatically                 cashed by  Acumatica ERP, if the count of the user groups is greater than or equals to the value of the                      ADGroupCacheLimit  parameter, specified in the                      web.config  file. To update the list of the user groups in                 Acumatica ERP with current information from AD, click the  Reload AD Groups                  button on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201005|SM201005]) User                     Roles User Roles (201005) form.  The  Reload AD Groups  button appears only when you integrated  Acumatica ERP instance with AD, AD FS or Azure AD and when the number of the user groups in AD,                 AD FS or Azure AD is greater than or equals to the value of                     the ADGroupCacheLimit  parameter, specified in the                      web.config  file. If the number of the users and groups in                 AD is less than the value of the  ADGroupCacheLimit  parameter,  Acumatica ERP retrieves the lists of users and groups directly from AD. Domain User Authentication Generally, to sign in to  Acumatica ERP, AD users type their domain credentials without specifying the domain name. But                 some employees may have both a local user account and a domain user account with the                 same user name. In this case,  Acumatica ERP will authenticate the users based on the password they specify (assuming that the                 local and domain passwords differ). If both the user names and the passwords are the same for a local user account and a                 domain user account, on the Sign-In page, the user can select the account to sign in                 with as follows: To sign in with a local account, the user enters the user name of the local                     account (as usual). To sign in with a domain account, the user enters the login in the                          <Domain_Name>\<User_Name>  format, where                          <Domain_Name>  is the NetBIOS domain name of the                     integrated domain and  <User_Name>  is the user account                     name in the integrated domain. If there is a local account with the name which includes a domain name                 and a user name from this domain, for example,  Terra\User1 , a                 domain user with the name  User1  from domain  Terra  will be mapped to                 this local account and will inherit all permissions of this account. In this case                 passwords of a local user and a domain user may differ but they both will access the                 same user account. To prevent confusion, we recommend that you disable or delete the                 local accounts of employees who do not perform any administration or configuration                 tasks in  Acumatica ERP. Domain User Authorization  When a domain user tries to access  Acumatica ERP, user authorization occurs as follows: The application instance sends an authentication request to the AD server to validate the user's                     credentials. When validation has completed successfully, the AD server sends  Acumatica ERP the list of AD groups to which the user is assigned.  Acumatica ERP compares                     the list of AD groups with the internal  Acumatica ERP roles, based on the mapping rules defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201005|SM201005]) User Roles (SM201005) form. The system finds any  Acumatica ERP roles that are associated with AD groups to which the domain user account is                     assigned. If  Acumatica ERP finds at least one role, the user is authenticated to sign in to the  Acumatica ERP instance. The user access rights within the  Acumatica ERP application instance are based on the internal list of roles. For more information about authentication in  Acumatica ERP, see  Managing User Access. For details                 about roles and access rights in  Acumatica ERP, see  Configuring User Roles. Access Rights of Domain Users Domain users inherit access rights from the AD groups that you mapped to  Acumatica ERP user roles. In addition, you can assign specific user roles to each domain user                 if the access rights for this user should differ from the AD group rights. New domain users automatically get the rights to sign in to  Acumatica ERP when they join a domain. The membership of these users in  Acumatica ERP roles is then automatically updated to comply with the membership of the users in                 the domain groups. The user type functionality, described in   User Access: Linked Entity and User Type,                 cannot be applied to domain users.   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201005|SM201005]) ]]></column>

}}}} In the code shown above: 
##*''Domain&#95;Path'' is the DNS name or the IP address of the domain controller (DC).
##*''Domain&#95;Name'' is the domain name, such as ''terra'', ''terra.com'', or ''sing.terra.com''. This setting affects the visibility of the data of Acumatica ERP to the domain users.
##*:Preferably, you should use the highest-level domain of the domain name. For example, in the ''sing.terra.com'' domain name, the highest level domain is ''sing'', and you would have to specify <tt>dc=&ldquo;sing&ldquo;</tt>. For the ''terra.net'' domain, the highest level domain is ''terra'' and you would have to specify <tt>dc=&ldquo;terra&ldquo;</tt>.
##*''User&#95;Name'' is the name of the user account you created in Step 1. Depending on the AD settings, you should use one of the following formats: ''User&#95;Name'', ''User&#95;Name@Domain&#95;Name'', or ''Domain&#95;Name\User&#95;Name''.
##*''User&#95;Password'' is the AD password of the user account you created in Step 1.
##Save the <tt>web.config</tt> file. The website restarts automatically.

You integrate Acumatica ERP with Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) when you want to manage users and access rights using Active Directory (AD) and your Acumatica ERP instance is deployed on the Internet but not in your organization&rsquo;s intranet. {br}

Integration of Acumatica ERP with AD FS also provides single sign-on for domain users between your Acumatica ERP instance and other services that use AD FS.((({S:Warn}This functionality is available only if the ''Active Directory and Other External SSO'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form.
))){br}{TOC}
==Requirements==
To seamlessly integrate your AD FS server and your Acumatica ERP instance, make sure that the following requirements are met.[anchor|#ul_slg_xpd_ss]
*The AD FS version is 2012 R2 (included in Windows Server 2012 R2).
*AD FS is configured to provide access to external web services.
*The domain users have preconfigured email addresses.

==Configuration Steps==
You can configure integration with AD FS when you implement Acumatica ERP or at any later time. To integrate an instance of Acumatica ERP with AD FS, you perform the following steps:[anchor|#ol_hfn_dbq_z4]
#Configure the AD FS server. Do the following:
##Configure AD FS Relying Party Trust to register your Acumatica ERP instance with AD FS. For details, see [HelpRoot_Integration\US__how_ADFS_Configure_ADFS_relying_party_trust|To Configure the AD FS Relying Party Trust].
##Configure claims for Acumatica ERP, as described in [HelpRoot_Integration\US__how_ADFS_Configure_ADFS_Claims|To Configure AD FS Claims].
#Enable integration with AD FS by modifying the <tt>web.config</tt> file of the application instance, as described in [HelpRoot_Integration\US__how_ADFS_Enable_Integration|To Enable AD FS Integration with Acumatica ERP].
#:((({S:Danger}When you save changes to the <tt>web.config</tt> file, the website is automatically restarted. Make sure that all users are warned about the restart so that they can save their documents in advance.
)))
#Map the AD FS claims to Acumatica ERP roles. This process is described in [HelpRoot_Integration\US__how_ADFS_map_claims|To Map AD FS Claims to Roles in Acumatica ERP] .
#Optional: If required, override the roles assigned to any user automatically by selecting the required roles manually. For details, see [HelpRoot_Integration\US__how_ADFS_Groups_Override|To Set Up Role Assignment for Domain Users].
#Optional: If you want to use the AD FS service as the default identity provider, enable silent logon with AD FS, as described in [HelpRoot_Integration\US__how_ADFS_Silent_Logon_Enable|To Enable Silent Logon].
[anchor|#_34631b16-8489-4856-8d68-1dd2deb97366]
==User Accounts of Domain Users in Acumatica ERP==
After you have enabled integration with the identity management system, user accounts for domain users are created automatically when the users sign in to your Acumatica ERP instance for the first time.{br}

The accounts of domain users in Acumatica ERP are based on their accounts in the domain. The password of a domain user in Acumatica ERP is the same as the domain account password. The email address and the first and last name of the user are populated from the domain account as well. However, the login, password, email address, and first and last name are managed through the domain and cannot be changed in Acumatica ERP.((({S:Warn}You cannot restore the passwords of domain users by using Acumatica ERP tools. You should restore users&rsquo; domain credentials by using tools of Active Directory (AD).
))){br}

To speed up authentication of users, the information about AD groups is automatically cashed by Acumatica ERP, if the count of the user groups is greater than or equals to the value of the {{ADGroupCacheLimit}} parameter, specified in the <tt>web.config</tt> file. To update the list of the user groups in Acumatica ERP with current information from AD, click the '''Reload AD Groups''' button on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_05|User Roles] (201005) form. {br}

The '''Reload AD Groups''' button appears only when you integrated Acumatica ERP instance with AD, AD FS or Azure AD and when the number of the user groups in AD, AD FS or Azure AD is greater than or equals to the value of the{{ADGroupCacheLimit}} parameter, specified in the <tt>web.config</tt> file. If the number of the users and groups in AD is less than the value of the {{ADGroupCacheLimit}} parameter, Acumatica ERP retrieves the lists of users and groups directly from AD.
==Domain User Authentication==
After integration of Acumatica ERP with AD FS users use single sign-on (SSO) with the domain to sign in to Acumatica ERP. By default, the users do the following to authenticate themselves:[anchor|#ol_u3b_wdk_ss]
#On the '''Welcome''' page of your Acumatica ERP instance, the user selects the Azure AD icon ([image:UserGuide/Images/AD_AzureAD.png|12px]) to open the AD FS sign-in page.
#On the sign-in page, the user enters the domain credentials in the following format: <tt>&lt;User&#95;Name&gt;@&lt;Domain&#95;Name&gt;</tt>, where ''&lt;User&#95;Name&gt;'' is the user account name in the integrated domain and ''&lt;Domain&#95;Name&gt;'' is the UPN suffix, also known as the domain name.

To simplify the procedure, you can configure silent logon with the AD FS server. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Integration\US__how_ADFS_Silent_Logon_Enable|To Enable Silent Logon].[anchor|#_e68c7663-534c-4977-9d44-1356cfd8eb36]((({S:Warn}If you configured a multicompany instance and selected the '''Secure Company on Login''' option on the '''Company Setup''' page (see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Support_of_Multiple_Companies|Support of Multiple Tenants]), then users with access to several companies, who sign in to Acumatica ERP using single sign-on with an external identity provider, will be logged in to the first company with enabled single sign-on.
)))[anchor|#_5868b579-8f32-41c9-9ff7-b19ace9bf28c]
==Domain User Authorization==
 When a domain user tries to access Acumatica ERP, user authorization occurs as follows:[anchor|#_be8b60f8-aae8-4e5d-acb3-e41e394917ad]
#The application instance sends an authentication request to the AD server to validate the user&rsquo;s credentials.
#When validation has completed successfully, the AD server sends Acumatica ERP the list of AD groups to which the user is assigned.
# Acumatica ERP compares the list of AD groups with the internal Acumatica ERP roles, based on the mapping rules defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_05|User Roles] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201005|SM201005]) form.
#The system finds any Acumatica ERP roles that are associated with AD groups to which the domain user account is assigned. If Acumatica ERP finds at least one role, the user is authenticated to sign in to the Acumatica ERP instance.
#:The user access rights within the Acumatica ERP application instance are based on the internal list of roles.

For more information about authentication in Acumatica ERP, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Managing_User_Access_Mapref|Managing User Access]. For details about roles and access rights in Acumatica ERP, see [HelpRoot_Administration\User_Roles_Mapref|Configuring User Roles].[anchor|#_43ba72c5-6968-4a51-808e-5f48d9a88e8d]
==Access Rights of Domain Users==
Domain users inherit access rights from the AD groups that you mapped to Acumatica ERP user roles. In addition, you can assign specific user roles to each domain user if the access rights for this user should differ from the AD group rights.{br}

New domain users automatically get the rights to sign in to Acumatica ERP when they join a domain. The membership of these users in Acumatica ERP roles is then automatically updated to comply with the membership of the users in the domain groups.((({S:Warn}The user type functionality, described in [HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Managing_User_Access_User_Types_Usage_Concept|User Access: Linked Entity and User Type], cannot be applied to domain users.

Integration of  Acumatica ERP with AD FS also provides single sign-on for domain users between your  Acumatica ERP instance and other services that use AD FS. This functionality is available only if the  Active Directory and           Other External SSO  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features form. Requirements To seamlessly integrate your AD FS server and your  Acumatica ERP instance, make sure that the following requirements are met. The AD FS version is 2012 R2 (included in Windows Server 2012 R2). AD FS is configured to provide access to external web services. The domain users have preconfigured email addresses. Configuration Steps You can configure integration with AD FS when you implement  Acumatica ERP or at any later time. To integrate an instance of  Acumatica ERP with AD FS, you perform the following steps: Configure the AD FS server. Do the following: Configure AD FS Relying Party Trust to register your  Acumatica ERP instance with AD FS. For details, see  To Configure the AD FS Relying Party Trust. Configure claims for  Acumatica ERP, as described in  To Configure AD FS Claims. Enable integration with AD FS by modifying the  web.config  file of           the application instance, as described in  To Enable AD FS Integration with Acumatica ERP. When you save changes to the                  web.config  file, the website is automatically restarted. Make             sure that all users are warned about the restart so that they can save their documents             in advance. Map the AD FS claims to  Acumatica ERP roles. This process is described in  To Map AD FS Claims to Roles in Acumatica ERP . Optional: If required, override the roles assigned to any user automatically by           selecting the required roles manually. For details, see  To Set Up Role Assignment for Domain Users. Optional: If you want to use the AD FS service as the default identity provider, enable           silent logon with AD FS, as described in  To Enable Silent Logon. User Accounts of Domain Users in  Acumatica ERPAfter you have enabled integration with the identity management system, user accounts                 for domain users are created automatically when the users sign in to your  Acumatica ERP instance for the first time. The accounts of domain users in  Acumatica ERP are based on their accounts in the domain. The password of a domain user in  Acumatica ERP is the same as the domain account password. The email address and the first and                 last name of the user are populated from the domain account as well. However, the                 login, password, email address, and first and last name are managed through the                 domain and cannot be changed in  Acumatica ERP. You cannot restore the passwords of domain users by                     using  Acumatica ERP tools. You should restore users' domain credentials by using tools of Active                     Directory (AD). To speed up authentication of users, the information about AD groups is automatically                 cashed by  Acumatica ERP, if the count of the user groups is greater than or equals to the value of the                      ADGroupCacheLimit  parameter, specified in the                      web.config  file. To update the list of the user groups in                 Acumatica ERP with current information from AD, click the  Reload AD Groups                  button on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201005|SM201005]) User                     Roles User Roles (201005) form.  The  Reload AD Groups  button appears only when you integrated  Acumatica ERP instance with AD, AD FS or Azure AD and when the number of the user groups in AD,                 AD FS or Azure AD is greater than or equals to the value of                     the ADGroupCacheLimit  parameter, specified in the                      web.config  file. If the number of the users and groups in                 AD is less than the value of the  ADGroupCacheLimit  parameter,  Acumatica ERP retrieves the lists of users and groups directly from AD. Domain User Authentication After integration of  Acumatica ERP with AD FS users use single sign-on (SSO) with the domain to sign in to  Acumatica ERP. By default, the users do the following to authenticate themselves: On the  Welcome  page of your  Acumatica ERP instance, the user selects the Azure AD icon ( ) to open the AD FS sign-in           page. On the sign-in page, the user enters the domain credentials in the following format:              <User_Name>@<Domain_Name> , where  <User_Name>  is           the user account name in the integrated domain and  <Domain_Name>  is the UPN           suffix, also known as the domain name. To simplify the procedure, you can configure silent logon with the AD FS server. For more         information, see  To Enable Silent Logon. If you configured a multicompany             instance and selected the  Secure Company on Login  option on the                  Company Setup  page (see  Support of Multiple Tenants), then users with             access to several companies, who sign in to  Acumatica ERP             using single sign-on with an external identity provider, will be logged in to the first             company with enabled single sign-on. Domain User Authorization  When a domain user tries to access  Acumatica ERP, user authorization occurs as follows: The application instance sends an authentication request to the AD server to validate the user's                     credentials. When validation has completed successfully, the AD server sends  Acumatica ERP the list of AD groups to which the user is assigned.  Acumatica ERP compares                     the list of AD groups with the internal  Acumatica ERP roles, based on the mapping rules defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201005|SM201005]) User Roles (SM201005) form. The system finds any  Acumatica ERP roles that are associated with AD groups to which the domain user account is                     assigned. If  Acumatica ERP finds at least one role, the user is authenticated to sign in to the  Acumatica ERP instance. The user access rights within the  Acumatica ERP application instance are based on the internal list of roles. For more information about authentication in  Acumatica ERP, see  Managing User Access. For details                 about roles and access rights in  Acumatica ERP, see  Configuring User Roles. Access Rights of Domain Users Domain users inherit access rights from the AD groups that you mapped to  Acumatica ERP user roles. In addition, you can assign specific user roles to each domain user                 if the access rights for this user should differ from the AD group rights. New domain users automatically get the rights to sign in to  Acumatica ERP when they join a domain. The membership of these users in  Acumatica ERP roles is then automatically updated to comply with the membership of the users in                 the domain groups. The user type functionality, described in   User Access: Linked Entity and User Type,                 cannot be applied to domain users.   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201005|SM201005]) ]]></column>

))){br}{TOC}
==Requirements==
Before you integrate Acumatica ERP with Azure AD, your company must be signed up for a Microsoft cloud service, such as Azure or Office 365, with the Azure Active Directory instance configured. For more information, see [http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/|Azure Active Directory] on the Microsoft Azure Portal.
==Configuration Steps==
You can configure integration with Azure AD when you implement Acumatica ERP or at any later time. To integrate an instance of Acumatica ERP with Azure AD, you will perform the following general steps:[anchor|#ol_hfn_dbq_z4]
#You perform the needed configuration actions on the Azure AD instance (that is, you register your Acumatica ERP instance with the Azure AD instance and you obtain the needed credentials, as described in [HelpRoot_Integration\US__how_AzureAD_Registering_with_Azure|To Configure Microsoft Azure for Integration with Your Acumatica ERP Instance ]).
#You perform the required configuration actions in the <tt>web.config</tt> file of the application instance, as described in [HelpRoot_Integration\US__how_AzureAD_Enable|To Configure the Web.Config File for Integration with Azure Active Directory].
#:((({S:Danger}When you save changes to the <tt>web.config</tt> file, the website is automatically restarted. Make sure that all users are warned about the restart so that they can save their documents in advance.
)))
#You map the Azure AD groups to Acumatica ERP roles, as described in [HelpRoot_Integration\US__how_AzureAD_Integration_Map_Roles|To Map Azure Active Directory Groups to Roles in Acumatica ERP].
#Optional: If required, you override the roles assigned to any user automatically by manually selecting the required roles. For details, see [HelpRoot_Integration\US__how_AzureAD_Groups_Override|To Set Up Role Assignment for Domain Users].
#Optional: If you want to use the Azure AD service as the default identity provider, you enable silent logon with Azure AD, as described in [HelpRoot_Integration\US__how_AzureAD_Silent_Logon_Enable|To Enable Silent Logon].
[anchor|#_a3035c48-b9bf-45cc-a9e1-a7695dd540e9]
==User Accounts of Domain Users in Acumatica ERP==
After you have enabled integration with the identity management system, user accounts for domain users are created automatically when the users sign in to your Acumatica ERP instance for the first time.{br}

The accounts of domain users in Acumatica ERP are based on their accounts in the domain. The password of a domain user in Acumatica ERP is the same as the domain account password. The email address and the first and last name of the user are populated from the domain account as well. However, the login, password, email address, and first and last name are managed through the domain and cannot be changed in Acumatica ERP.((({S:Warn}You cannot restore the passwords of domain users by using Acumatica ERP tools. You should restore users&rsquo; domain credentials by using tools of Active Directory (AD).
))){br}

To speed up authentication of users, the information about AD groups is automatically cashed by Acumatica ERP, if the count of the user groups is greater than or equals to the value of the {{ADGroupCacheLimit}} parameter, specified in the <tt>web.config</tt> file. To update the list of the user groups in Acumatica ERP with current information from AD, click the '''Reload AD Groups''' button on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_05|User Roles] (201005) form. {br}

The '''Reload AD Groups''' button appears only when you integrated Acumatica ERP instance with AD, AD FS or Azure AD and when the number of the user groups in AD, AD FS or Azure AD is greater than or equals to the value of the{{ADGroupCacheLimit}} parameter, specified in the <tt>web.config</tt> file. If the number of the users and groups in AD is less than the value of the {{ADGroupCacheLimit}} parameter, Acumatica ERP retrieves the lists of users and groups directly from AD.
==Domain User Authentication==
After the integration of Acumatica ERP with Azure AD has been set up, users use single sign-on (SSO) with the domain to sign in to Acumatica ERP. By default, each user performs the following steps:[anchor|#ol_u3b_wdk_ss]
#On the '''Welcome''' page of your Acumatica ERP instance, the user selects the Azure AD icon ([image:UserGuide/Images/AD_AzureAD.png|12px]) to open the Azure AD sign-in page.
#On the sign-in page, the user enters the domain credentials in the following format: <tt>&lt;User&#95;Name&gt;@&lt;Domain&#95;Name&gt;</tt>, where ''&lt;User&#95;Name&gt;'' is the user account name in the integrated domain and ''&lt;Domain&#95;Name&gt;'' is the UPN suffix, also known as the domain name.

To simplify the procedure, you can configure silent logon with Azure AD server. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Integration\US__how_AzureAD_Silent_Logon_Enable|To Enable Silent Logon].[anchor|#_8da48eea-e2d6-4e65-9981-92ad35221934]((({S:Warn}If you configured a multicompany instance and selected the '''Secure Company on Login''' option on the '''Company Setup''' page (see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Support_of_Multiple_Companies|Support of Multiple Tenants]), then users with access to several companies, who sign in to Acumatica ERP using single sign-on with an external identity provider, will be logged in to the first company with enabled single sign-on.
)))[anchor|#_06559fbd-8649-441e-ae0c-1d3718bdef96]
==Domain User Authorization==
 When a domain user tries to access Acumatica ERP, user authorization occurs as follows:[anchor|#_fc7bae28-69cb-420b-911c-68c84ed45e7a]
#The application instance sends an authentication request to the AD server to validate the user&rsquo;s credentials.
#When validation has completed successfully, the AD server sends Acumatica ERP the list of AD groups to which the user is assigned.
# Acumatica ERP compares the list of AD groups with the internal Acumatica ERP roles, based on the mapping rules defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_05|User Roles] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201005|SM201005]) form.
#The system finds any Acumatica ERP roles that are associated with AD groups to which the domain user account is assigned. If Acumatica ERP finds at least one role, the user is authenticated to sign in to the Acumatica ERP instance.
#:The user access rights within the Acumatica ERP application instance are based on the internal list of roles.

For more information about authentication in Acumatica ERP, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Managing_User_Access_Mapref|Managing User Access]. For details about roles and access rights in Acumatica ERP, see [HelpRoot_Administration\User_Roles_Mapref|Configuring User Roles].[anchor|#_c7bfb231-3550-4b7d-b5ab-e491e0490738]
==Access Rights of Domain Users==
Domain users inherit access rights from the AD groups that you mapped to Acumatica ERP user roles. In addition, you can assign specific user roles to each domain user if the access rights for this user should differ from the AD group rights.{br}

New domain users automatically get the rights to sign in to Acumatica ERP when they join a domain. The membership of these users in Acumatica ERP roles is then automatically updated to comply with the membership of the users in the domain groups.((({S:Warn}The user type functionality, described in [HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Managing_User_Access_User_Types_Usage_Concept|User Access: Linked Entity and User Type], cannot be applied to domain users.

Configuration Steps You can configure integration with Azure AD when you implement  Acumatica ERP or at any later time. To integrate an instance of  Acumatica ERP with Azure AD, you will perform the following general steps: You perform the needed configuration actions on the Azure AD instance (that is, you           register your  Acumatica ERP instance with the Azure AD instance and you obtain the needed credentials, as described           in  To Configure Microsoft Azure for Integration with Your Acumatica ERP Instance ). You perform the required configuration actions in the  web.config            file of the application instance, as described in  To Configure the Web.Config File for Integration with Azure Active Directory. When you save changes to the                  web.config  file, the website is automatically restarted. Make             sure that all users are warned about the restart so that they can save their documents             in advance. You map the Azure AD groups to  Acumatica ERP roles, as described in  To Map Azure Active Directory Groups to Roles in Acumatica ERP. Optional: If required, you override the roles assigned to any user automatically by           manually selecting the required roles. For details, see  To Set Up Role Assignment for Domain Users. Optional: If you want to use the Azure AD service as the default identity provider, you           enable silent logon with Azure AD, as described in  To Enable Silent Logon. User Accounts of Domain Users in  Acumatica ERPAfter you have enabled integration with the identity management system, user accounts                 for domain users are created automatically when the users sign in to your  Acumatica ERP instance for the first time. The accounts of domain users in  Acumatica ERP are based on their accounts in the domain. The password of a domain user in  Acumatica ERP is the same as the domain account password. The email address and the first and                 last name of the user are populated from the domain account as well. However, the                 login, password, email address, and first and last name are managed through the                 domain and cannot be changed in  Acumatica ERP. You cannot restore the passwords of domain users by                     using  Acumatica ERP tools. You should restore users' domain credentials by using tools of Active                     Directory (AD). To speed up authentication of users, the information about AD groups is automatically                 cashed by  Acumatica ERP, if the count of the user groups is greater than or equals to the value of the                      ADGroupCacheLimit  parameter, specified in the                      web.config  file. To update the list of the user groups in                 Acumatica ERP with current information from AD, click the  Reload AD Groups                  button on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201005|SM201005]) User                     Roles User Roles (201005) form.  The  Reload AD Groups  button appears only when you integrated  Acumatica ERP instance with AD, AD FS or Azure AD and when the number of the user groups in AD,                 AD FS or Azure AD is greater than or equals to the value of                     the ADGroupCacheLimit  parameter, specified in the                      web.config  file. If the number of the users and groups in                 AD is less than the value of the  ADGroupCacheLimit  parameter,  Acumatica ERP retrieves the lists of users and groups directly from AD. Domain User Authentication After the integration of  Acumatica ERP with Azure AD has been set up, users use single sign-on (SSO) with the domain to sign in         to  Acumatica ERP. By default, each user performs the following steps: On the  Welcome  page of your  Acumatica ERP instance, the user selects the Azure AD icon ( ) to open the Azure AD sign-in           page. On the sign-in page, the user enters the domain credentials in the following format:              <User_Name>@<Domain_Name> , where  <User_Name>  is           the user account name in the integrated domain and  <Domain_Name>  is the UPN           suffix, also known as the domain name. To simplify the procedure, you can configure silent logon with Azure AD server. For more         information, see  To Enable Silent Logon. If you configured a multicompany             instance and selected the  Secure Company on Login  option on the                  Company Setup  page (see  Support of Multiple Tenants), then users with             access to several companies, who sign in to  Acumatica ERP             using single sign-on with an external identity provider, will be logged in to the first             company with enabled single sign-on. Domain User Authorization  When a domain user tries to access  Acumatica ERP, user authorization occurs as follows: The application instance sends an authentication request to the AD server to validate the user's                     credentials. When validation has completed successfully, the AD server sends  Acumatica ERP the list of AD groups to which the user is assigned.  Acumatica ERP compares                     the list of AD groups with the internal  Acumatica ERP roles, based on the mapping rules defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201005|SM201005]) User Roles (SM201005) form. The system finds any  Acumatica ERP roles that are associated with AD groups to which the domain user account is                     assigned. If  Acumatica ERP finds at least one role, the user is authenticated to sign in to the  Acumatica ERP instance. The user access rights within the  Acumatica ERP application instance are based on the internal list of roles. For more information about authentication in  Acumatica ERP, see  Managing User Access. For details                 about roles and access rights in  Acumatica ERP, see  Configuring User Roles. Access Rights of Domain Users Domain users inherit access rights from the AD groups that you mapped to  Acumatica ERP user roles. In addition, you can assign specific user roles to each domain user                 if the access rights for this user should differ from the AD group rights. New domain users automatically get the rights to sign in to  Acumatica ERP when they join a domain. The membership of these users in  Acumatica ERP roles is then automatically updated to comply with the membership of the users in                 the domain groups. The user type functionality, described in   User Access: Linked Entity and User Type,                 cannot be applied to domain users.   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201005|SM201005]) ]]></column>

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[To Enable Silent Logon To make your users authenticate themselves with a selected identity provider, you enable the silent logon capability and select the identity provider to be used by default. This functionality is available only if the  Google and                         Microsoft SSO  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features form. Before You Proceed Before you enable silent logon, you need to configure your  Acumatica ERP instance to use the external identity provider with which you want to set up                     silent logon.  If you want to enable silent logon with Google or Microsoft Account, make sure that your users have registered their external accounts with the  Acumatica ERP instance, as described in   To Activate Your Google or Microsoft Account. To Enable Silent Logon Open the  web.config  file for the site instance.  Usually                             the file is located in  %Program Files%\ Acumatica ERP\<instance name> , where  <instance name>  is the                             name of the application instance website.  When you save changes to the                  web.config  file, the website is automatically restarted. Make             sure that all users are warned about the restart so that they can save their documents             in advance. Add the  Silentlogin  parameter to the  <externalAuth>                          section, as shown                         below. <externalAuth returnUrl="Main.aspx" authUrl="Frames/AuthDock.ashx"

In most cases, multifactor authentication involves two authentication mechanisms. By combining two authentication mechanisms, businesses can achieve two-factor authentication. Most two-factor mechanisms require something you know (password) plus either something you have (token, mobile phone, USB) or something you are (fingerprint or other biometric).{br}

The following list contains examples of existing authentication combination:[anchor|#_a5240cba-062a-4f68-bc0c-2423e87e431c]
*Username / Password
*:The most basic authentication mechanism which requires users to enter a username and password. Additional options such as IP address validation and strong password requirements can provide additional security.
*Token, FOB
*:The token displays a code that is regularly updated. The user types the code into the ERP system which verifies the code. RSA SecurID tokens are an example.
*Mobile Phones
*:The ERP system sends a text message to the user’s mobile phone. The user types the received code to verify login directly on the phone or by entering an access code in the application on the device that is used to access the ERP system. Another option is to install a secure application on the phone that behaves like a token.
*Email
*:During login, the system sends a code to the user’s email address. The user enters a code in the email to authenticate.
*Smart Card or USB Device
*:Hardware issued by the organization can be configured to grant access when a card is swiped, a USB device or chip is inserted.
*Fingerprint Reader or Biometric Device
*:Biometric devices work like smart cards. They require an initial setup but cannot be lost or stolen.
*VPNs
*:The VPN has its own authentication mechanism which provides a layer of security at the communication level. VPNs can be authenticated using passwords, tokens, mac addresses, and other methods.

==Adaptive (Smart) Multifactor Authentication==
Often there is a trade-off between security and usability. The additional security associated with multifactor authentication comes with the price of users logging in two times instead of once. {br}

To improve usability, some multifactor systems have been configured to select multiple authentication mechanisms only when the risk profile of system entry is high. The risk profile can be set based on information gathered about the user’s environment such as the machine MAC address, the IP address, browser cookies, time of day, and other patterns.  Some examples of risk profiles include:[anchor|#_81ad4534-712b-4e99-92da-67b5e3379f3e]
*Low risk: Login from an office IP address at 9am on weekdays using a browser with a stored cookie.
*Medium risk: Login from unfamiliar IP address
*High risk: Login from unfamiliar IP address, after hours, using an unfamiliar machine

Based on the risk level, multifactor authentication may not be required. Machine learning can be utilized to analyze failed logins and adjust risk levels.]]></column>

Implementing multifactor authentication in Acumatica ERP involves several steps, as this topic describes.
==To Implement Multifactor Authentication==[anchor|#_df19b0b6-f5b4-45f5-a27f-1a937f547dcf]
#Obtain a Multifactor Authentication Provider Account.
#:Get an account for each user who will login to Acumatica ERP. The account must include single sign-on capabilities as well as the multifactor authentication mechanism that you will utilize.
#Implement single sign-on.
#:Single sign on capabilities must be implemented at the authentication provider and inside Acumatica ERP. 
#:First you need to enable SSO for the Authentication Provider. Obtain information from the Authentication Provider on how to set this up.
#:Next you establish a secure mechanism to hand-off the authenticated users to Acumatica ERP. To provide a secure hand off, you must implement an HTTPS connection between the two systems. Microsoft and Google utilize OAuth 2.0, while OneLogin uses SAML 2.0 to communicate over the HTTPS connection. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__mng_Authorizing_with_OAuth2|Authorizing Client Applications to Work with Acumatica ERP]. 
#:Detailed instructions for Google and Microsoft are available in Acumatica ERP help, see [HelpRoot_Integration\US__mng_SSO_with_Google|Configuring Single Sign-On with Google] and [HelpRoot_Integration\US__mng_SSO_with_Microsoft_Account|Configuring Single Sign-On with Microsoft Account].
#:As a part of establishing a secure hand-off, each system will provide a certificate that can be entered into the other system. On Acumatica ERP [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_60|Security Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201060|SM201060]) form you can enter the certificate provided by the external providers.
#:Single sign on setup usually involves changes to the <tt>web.config</tt> and other system files. SaaS deployments will require assistance from you support provider.
#Modify the login page.
#:To prevent people from bypassing the multifactor authentication mechanism, remove the username and password option from the login page.
#Link External Accounts to Acumatica ERP Accounts.
#:When an identity is passed from an external Authentication Provider, Acumatica ERP needs to know which Acumatica ERP user this identity is associated with.
#:This linkage can be configured on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] (201010) form on the '''External Identities''' tab.

The configuration of single sign-on (SSO) with Google for your Acumatica ERP instance consists of the following steps:
#You register your Acumatica ERP instance with Google and obtain the OAuth 2.0 credentials, including the client ID and client secret. For details, see [HelpRoot_Integration\US__how_SSO_with_Google|To Register an Acumatica ERP Instance with Google].
#You enable SSO with Google in your Acumatica ERP instance by using the client ID and client secret you obtained in the previous step, as described in [HelpRoot_Integration\US__how_SSO_Enable_with_Google|To Enable SSO with Google].
#:((({S:Hint}You can enable and disable SSO with Google for your Acumatica ERP instance at any time because Acumatica ERP uses SSO with Google only for verifying user identities. Users can still authenticate themselves by using their Acumatica ERP credentials.
)))
#Optional: You activate SSO with Google on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) form for each user who will use his or her Google account for authorization in Acumatica ERP. Alternatively, each user can activate SSO with Google for himself or herself on the [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\SM_20_30_10|User Profile] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) form. For details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\SSO_register_external_account|To Activate Your Google or Microsoft Account].
#Users of your Acumatica ERP instance associate their Acumatica ERP accounts with their Google accounts. They can do this in either of the following ways:
#*Users click the '''Associate User''' button on the [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\SM_20_30_10|User Profile] form (for details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\SSO_register_external_account|To Activate Your Google or Microsoft Account]). The system registers the unique user key associated with the user&rsquo;s Google account with the user&rsquo;s Acumatica ERP account. This way can be used if users activate SSO with Google for their accounts on their own.
#*If the value of the {{selfAssociate}} parameter in the {{externalAuth}} section of the <tt>web.config</tt> file is <tt>true</tt> (which is the default value), users click the Google icon (
#*:[image:UserGuide/Images/US_Google_plus.png|12px]) on the '''Welcome''' page of Acumatica ERP, and the system suggests that they enter the credentials of an Acumatica ERP user that should be associated with the Google account. This way can be used when you activated SSO with Google for each user.
#Optional: You configure your Acumatica ERP instance to automatically redirect users to the Google sign-in page, as described in [HelpRoot_Integration\US__how_Google_Silent_Logon_Enable|To Enable Silent Logon].
#:((({S:Hint}Before you turn on silent logon with Google, ask your users if all of them can sign in to Acumatica ERP with their Google accounts.
)))

==User Authentication==
After you have integrated Acumatica ERP with Google account, users use SSO with Google services to sign in to Acumatica ERP. By default, each user follows these steps:[anchor|#ol_u3b_wdk_ss]
#On the '''Welcome''' page of the Acumatica ERP instance, the user clicks the Google icon (
#:[image:UserGuide/Images/US_Google_plus.png|12px]) to open the Google sign-in page.
#On the sign-in page, the user enters his or her Google account credentials.

To simplify the procedure, you can configure silent logon with Google. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Integration\US__how_Google_Silent_Logon_Enable|To Enable Silent Logon].[anchor|#_6c85956a-4c43-47be-b7a3-f6bfa255395b]((({S:Warn}If you configured a multicompany instance and selected the '''Secure Company on Login''' option on the '''Company Setup''' page (see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Support_of_Multiple_Companies|Support of Multiple Tenants]), then users with access to several companies, who sign in to Acumatica ERP using single sign-on with an external identity provider, will be logged in to the first company with enabled single sign-on.

You integrate Acumatica ERP with Microsoft Account if you want to allow employees of your organization to use their Microsoft Accounts to access your Acumatica ERP instance as well as Microsoft services. ((({S:Warn}This functionality is available only if the ''Google and Microsoft SSO'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form.
))){br}{TOC}
==Requirements==
If you plan to use this integration, we strongly recommend that you host your Acumatica ERP instance (or instances) over HTTPS. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Install\how__Enable_Https|Setting Up an HTTPS Service in Web Server (IIS)].
==Configuration Steps==
The configuration of SSO with Microsoft account for your Acumatica ERP instance consists of the following steps:
#You register your Acumatica ERP instance with Microsoft Account and obtain the OAuth 2.0 credentials, including the client ID and client secret. For details, see [HelpRoot_Integration\US__how_SSO_with_LiveID|To Register an Acumatica ERP Instance with Microsoft Account].
#You enable SSO with Microsoft Account in your Acumatica ERP instance by using the client ID and client secret you obtained in the previous step, as described in [HelpRoot_Integration\US__how_SSO_Enable_with_Microsoft_Account|To Enable SSO with Microsoft Account]. 
#:((({S:Hint}You can enable and disable SSO with Microsoft Account for your Acumatica ERP instance at any time because Acumatica ERP uses SSO with Microsoft Account only for verifying user identities. Users can still authenticate themselves by using their Acumatica ERP credentials.
)))
#Optional: You activate SSO with Microsoft Account on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) form for each user who will use his or her Microsoft Account credentials for authorization in Acumatica ERP. Alternatively, each user can activate SSO with Microsoft Account for himself or herself on the [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\SM_20_30_10|User Profile] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) form. For details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\SSO_register_external_account|To Activate Your Google or Microsoft Account].
#Users of your Acumatica ERP instance associate their Acumatica ERP accounts with their Microsoft Account credentials. They can do this in either of the following ways:
#*Users click the '''Associate User''' button on the [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\SM_20_30_10|User Profile] form (for details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\SSO_register_external_account|To Activate Your Google or Microsoft Account]). The system registers the unique user key associated with the user&rsquo;s Microsoft Account with the user&rsquo;s Acumatica ERP account. This way can be used if users activate SSO with Microsoft Account for their accounts on their own.
#*If the value of the {{selfAssociate}} parameter in the {{externalAuth}} section of the <tt>web.config</tt> file is <tt>true</tt> (which is the default value), users click the Microsoft icon (
#*:[image:UserGuide/Images/US_LiveID.png|12px]) on the '''Welcome''' page of Acumatica ERP, and the system suggests that they enter the credentials of an Acumatica ERP user that should be associated with the Microsoft Account. This way can be used when you activated SSO with Microsoft Account for each user.
#Optional: You can configure your Acumatica ERP instance to automatically redirect users to the Microsoft Account sign-in page, as described in [HelpRoot_Integration\US__how_Microsoft_Account_Silent_Logon_Enable|To Enable Silent Logon].
#:((({S:Hint}Before you turn on silent logon with Microsoft Account, ask your users if all of them can sign in to Acumatica ERP with their Microsoft Account credentials.
)))

==User Authentication==
After you have integrated Acumatica ERP with Microsoft Account, users use single sign-on (SSO) with Microsoft services to sign in to Acumatica ERP. By default, the users follow these steps:[anchor|#ol_u3b_wdk_ss]
#On the '''Welcome''' page of the Acumatica ERP instance, the user clicks the Microsoft icon (
#:[image:UserGuide/Images/US_LiveID.png|12px]) to open the Microsoft sign-in page.
#On the sign-in page, the user enters his or her Microsoft account credentials.

To simplify the procedure, you can configure silent logon with Microsoft account. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Integration\US__how_Microsoft_Account_Silent_Logon_Enable|To Enable Silent Logon].[anchor|#_986a7efe-40a8-4926-9428-32580b100d26]((({S:Warn}If you configured a multicompany instance and selected the '''Secure Company on Login''' option on the '''Company Setup''' page (see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Support_of_Multiple_Companies|Support of Multiple Tenants]), then users with access to several companies, who sign in to Acumatica ERP using single sign-on with an external identity provider, will be logged in to the first company with enabled single sign-on.

To upload data to and from Acumatica ERP, you can use ''import scenarios ''and'' export scenarios'', which define data import and data export instructions for the system. An import or export scenario is a sequence of actions to be executed for a data record as if the record is being manipulated by user through an Acumatica ERP form. When you enter data into the system manually, you perform a sequence of actions. You open the needed data entry form and start entering data. To add a new record, you use the UI elements one by one—that is, you type text, select values from combo boxes, clear or select check boxes, and click buttons. In the corresponding scenario, you compose exactly the same sequence of actions—you specify a command for each user action on the form. Because you cannot perform multiple actions simultaneously on the form, the scenario executes commands successively. To construct the scenario, you reflect the actions you make on the form in the sequence of commands for the scenario. [anchor|#_c77da5a6-6bdc-405d-bacc-a29ddd915c81]{br}

Because in these scenarios you either save data to an external system or file, or upload data from an external system or file to Acumatica ERP, you must define the format of the external system or file to the Acumatica ERP system. For this purpose, you set up a ''data provider'' in the system. A data provider is an entity that defines the structure of the external data source; Acumatica ERP then uses the data provider to transfer data from and to the external system or file.[anchor|#_bc104490-11f7-4556-aef1-dc60ce31dd64]{br}

Therefore, to use an integration scenario, you have to define the data provider and the needed import or export scenario, as illustrated in the diagram below. An integration scenario works as if the data is being manually processed on an Acumatica ERP form.[anchor|#_10983fca-74b4-4414-a40e-73aff02ea28a][anchor|#_250901c4-c4a9-4ec4-8fc8-422b27e952c4][image:Shared/Images/diag_IS_Overview_Idea.png|popup|450px][anchor|#_b140da59-4c3b-4d1b-a9c4-6d0285735537]{br}

When you are creating an integration scenario, you first create the needed data provider, which defines the type and schema of the data source. For example, the type can be an Excel file, and the schema of an Excel data source consists of the names of spreadsheets that should be used for data import or export and the list of columns on the spreadsheets. If the external data source has changed (for example, if a new column has been added to an Excel spreadsheet), you have to update the data provider in Acumatica ERP to be able to use the new column in scenarios for which the data provider is specified.[anchor|#_b882663a-ab9b-43e6-b616-f1daa714a344]{br}

After you have prepared the data provider, the second step is to define the scenario, including the scenario mapping. You can construct a scenario for any data entry form. In the scenario, you use internal fields, which are the fields of Acumatica ERP, and external fields, which are defined in the specified data provider. In the scenario, you map internal fields to external fields and specify commands. Integration scenarios are specific to the Acumatica ERP form and the external data schema.[anchor|#_129eab50-126e-46b7-a2d7-a799aff97820]{br}

After the scenario is ready, you can run the import or export for the scenario to get the result. You can also schedule scenarios to be run, so that you can import and export data on a regular basis.{br}

You can find examples of integration scenarios in the I100 Integration Scenarios training course.]]></column>

==Data Provider Types==
Excel spreadsheets or files in CSV format are generally used for data exchange between different ERP products, because most ERP products support exporting and importing data in these formats. Besides using files in an external format as a data source, you can import data from or export data to an external application directly. For example, you can connect to a Microsoft SQL Server and download data from it or upload data to it.{br}

 Acumatica ERP provides a number of built-in types of data providers through which the application can efficiently import data from external files or third-party software to Acumatica ERP, or export data from Acumatica ERP to external destinations. These types of data providers, which you use when you configure a provider on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_15|Data Providers] form, are listed below: [anchor|#ul_wpp_2fs_y3]
*File providers that you use to access data in external files:
**''CSV Provider'' (<tt>PX.DataSync.CSVSYProvider</tt>): For import from and export to files in CSV format
**''Excel Provider'' (<tt>PX.DataSync.ExcelSYProvider</tt>): For import from and export to Excel spreadsheets
**''XML Provider'' (<tt>PX.DataSync.XMLSYProvider</tt>): For import from and export to files in XML format
*Providers that are preconfigured for importing data from and exporting data to external systems:
**''Salesforce Provider'' (<tt>PX.DataSync.SFSYProvider</tt>): For import from and export to SalesForce CRM by using the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP).
**''Salesforce Sync Provider'' (<tt>PX.Salesforce.SalesforceProvider</tt>): For real-time synchronization of data between Acumatica ERP and Salesforce. For details, see [HelpRoot_Integration\SF_00_00_00|Synchronization with Salesforce].
**''MS SQL Provider'' (<tt>PX.DataSync.MSSqlSYProvider</tt>): For import from and export to Microsoft SQL Server.

)))To import data from other sources, you need to create a custom data provider by using the API provided by Acumatica ERP. [anchor|#_3a80b719-dd25-4324-82d1-f42f988fbb04]
==Provider Parameters==
To define a particular data source to be used for import or export, you define the parameters of the data provider on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_15|Data Providers] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206015|SM206015]) form. The set of parameters depends on the data provider type, as described below:[anchor|#_d362c027-9fe2-4222-85da-80ce917b46d5]
*'''Parameters of file providers:''' File providers generally have a simple set of parameters that specify the file properties necessary for accessing data in the file. Each of the file providers has the ''FileName'' parameter, which specifies the path to the file that should be used for data import or export. The path to the file is set automatically after you have uploaded an external file to the provider. The ''FileName'' parameter displays the path to the uploaded file in the internal format: {{Data Providers (<Data Provider Name>)\<File Name>}}, where {{<Data Provider Name>}} and {{<File Name>}} are replaced with the corresponding values.
*:Other parameters of a file provider depend on the provider type. You should specify these parameters so the system can correctly open the file and process the contents of the file. 
*'''Parameters of providers that connect to external data systems:''' For providers that connect to external data systems, such as SalesForce or MS SQL provider, you specify a set of parameters for connecting Acumatica ERP to the external system. Each of these providers has a parameter that you use to specify the location of the remote resource. This parameter is either the URL of a remote service or the path to a local server.
*:Other parameters are specific to each provider type. These parameters are necessary for authentication on the remote resource. 
[anchor|#_92ffbeb4-6154-4f16-9ac1-7505b6051193]
==External Data Schema==Data that you are going to transfer between an external data source and Acumatica ERP usually has a table structure. That is, the data includes a number of data records, and each record has a list of parameters specified. 
You specify the structure of an external data source for a data provider by defining the external data schema—that is, you specify the objects and fields of the data source. The object is usually the whole data source or a part of the data source that corresponds to a complete data table. For example, for an Excel file, objects correspond to spreadsheets. For the source objects that should be used for import or export, you should select the '''Active''' check box in the '''Source Objects''' table on the '''Schema''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_15|Data Providers] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206015|SM206015]) form. {br}

Source fields are defined by the list of attributes that are specified for each record. For an Excel file, source fields correspond to columns on a spreadsheet. For each field you want to use the field in a scenario, you should select the '''Active''' check box in the '''Source Fields''' table on the '''Schema''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_15|Data Providers] form.[anchor|#_ade34784-8d89-421d-807d-38f1db4f3e65]
==Data Provider Creation==
You create data providers on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_15|Data Providers] form. The process of creating a data provider consists of the following general steps:[anchor|#ol_jq2_psh_sr]
#'''Reviewing the structure of external data'''
#:Before you create the data provider, you review the external source to identify the needed provider type and the external data schema. If you are going to import data to Acumatica ERP, you review the source data to determine the needed provider type, to check that the data meets the requirements, and to see the external data schema. If you are going to export data from Acumatica ERP, you review the data schema in the target file or application to which you want to export the Acumatica ERP data, or create a file to hold the data to be exported and provide field names matching the intended use of the data.
#'''Creating a provider and setting its type'''
#:On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_15|Data Providers] form, you create the data provider. You specify the name of the provider, which usually describes the data you will transfer by using this provider. You also select the needed type of the provider. You can use built-in provider types or develop a custom data provider type. 
#'''Specifying the provider parameters'''
#:On the '''Parameters''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_15|Data Providers] form, you specify the particular data source. You attach a file or specify the location of the remote source. You also specify the source-dependent parameters, if necessary. 
#'''Filling in the source objects and fields of the provider'''
#:On the '''Schema''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_15|Data Providers] form, you fill in objects and fields from the attached file or remote resource to the data provider.

After that, the data provider is ready and can be edited as needed. For a file provider, you can upload the new version of an attached file and then update source objects and fields. For a provider connected to a remote system, you can reload the data schema from the server if you make any changes.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Data Providers You create data providers on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM206015|SM206015]) Data Providers         (SM206015) form. To create a provider, you specify its name and type, the access         parameters to the source, and the data schema.  Data Provider Types Excel spreadsheets or files in CSV format are generally used for data exchange between         different ERP products, because most ERP products support exporting and importing data in         these formats. Besides using files in an external format as a data source, you can import         data from or export data to an external application directly. For example, you can connect         to a Microsoft SQL Server and download data from it or upload data to it.  Acumatica ERP provides a number of built-in types of data providers through which the application can         efficiently import data from external files or third-party software to  Acumatica ERP, or export data from  Acumatica ERP to external destinations. These types of data providers, which you use when you configure         a provider on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM206015|SM206015]) Data Providers form, are listed below:  File providers that you use to access data in external files: CSV Provider  ( PX.DataSync.CSVSYProvider ): For import from and export               to files in CSV format Excel Provider  ( PX.DataSync.ExcelSYProvider ): For import from and               export to Excel spreadsheets XML Provider  ( PX.DataSync.XMLSYProvider ): For import from and export               to files in XML format Providers that are preconfigured for importing data from and exporting data to external             systems: Salesforce Provider  ( PX.DataSync.SFSYProvider ): For import from and               export to SalesForce CRM by using the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP). Salesforce Sync Provider  ( PX.Salesforce.SalesforceProvider ): For               real-time synchronization of data between  Acumatica ERP and Salesforce. For details, see   ([~/?ScreenId=SF000000|SF000000]) Synchronization with Salesforce. MS SQL Provider  ( PX.DataSync.MSSqlSYProvider ): For import from and               export to Microsoft SQL Server. HubSpot Provider  ( PX.DataSync.HubSpot.HSSYProvider ): For exporting               leads to HubSpot for nurturing and importing leads to  Acumatica ERP for processing. You can find more information in  Integration with HubSpot: General Information. HubSpot Enhanced  ( PX.DataSync.HubSpot.HubSpotProvider ):               For synchronization of data between  Acumatica ERP and HubSpot. This data provider supports the use of the OAuth protocol for               authorization in HubSpot. For details, see  Integration with HubSpot: Enhanced HubSpot Data Provider.

You can find more information               in  Processing ACH Payments. Giro Payment Provider  ( PX.DataSync.Banks.GIROPaymentProvider ): For               exporting data for processing in giro-based payment systems. Provider for importing data from generic inquiries:              PX.DataSync.GenericInquirySYDataProvider : The data provider type to use Generic           inquiry as data provider for import scenario. The  Tax Provider ,  Tax Provider CSV , and  Tax Zip Provider            built-in types are obsolete. They were used to import data from the Avalara data files,           but Avalara no longer supplies these files. Integration with Avalara is done through the           Avalara AvaTax SOAP API. To import data from other sources, you need to create a         custom data provider by using the API provided by  Acumatica ERP.  Provider Parameters To define a particular data source to be used for import or export, you define the parameters         of the data provider on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM206015|SM206015]) Data Providers (SM206015)         form. The set of parameters depends on the data provider type, as described below: Parameters of file providers:  File providers generally have a simple set of             parameters that specify the file properties necessary for accessing data in the file.             Each of the file providers has the  FileName  parameter, which specifies the path             to the file that should be used for data import or export. The path to the file is set             automatically after you have uploaded an external file to the provider. The                FileName  parameter displays the path to the uploaded file in the internal             format:  Data Providers (<Data Provider Name>)\<File Name> , where                <Data Provider Name>  and  <File Name>  are             replaced with the corresponding values. Other parameters of a file provider depend on               the provider type. You should specify these parameters so the system can correctly               open the file and process the contents of the file.  Parameters of providers that connect to external data systems:  For providers             that connect to external data systems, such as SalesForce or MS SQL provider, you             specify a set of parameters for connecting  Acumatica ERP to the external system. Each of these providers has a parameter that you use to             specify the location of the remote resource. This parameter is either the URL of a             remote service or the path to a local server. Other parameters are specific to each               provider type. These parameters are necessary for authentication on the remote               resource.  External Data Schema Data that       you are going to transfer between an external data source and  Acumatica ERP usually has a table structure. That is, the data includes a number of data records, and       each record has a list of parameters specified.  You specify the structure of an external         data source for a data provider by defining the external data schema—that is, you         specify the objects and fields of the data source. The object is usually the whole data         source or a part of the data source that corresponds to a complete data table. For example,         for an Excel file, objects correspond to spreadsheets. For the source objects that should be         used for import or export, you should select the  Active  check box in         the  Source Objects  table on the  Schema  tab of         the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM206015|SM206015]) Data Providers (SM206015) form.

You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_15|Data Providers] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206015|SM206015]) form to create a data provider that defines the structure of external data for Acumatica ERP during data import or data export. {br}

This procedure describes how to create a data provider that works with the records in a CSV file. 
==Before You Proceed==
Make sure the file for which you are going to create a data provider satisfies the following requirements:[anchor|#_10440bba-0f8a-404b-9aae-f884b58308d5]
*The first row in the file must contain column headers, and the first row is not imported. 
*The field delimiter in the file cannot be used within values. For example, if you use a comma as the delimiter, you cannot import values that contain commas, because they will not be recognized properly.
*The names of source fields can contain letters, numbers, spaces, and underscore (&#95;) symbols. Do not use periods in the names of source fields because the period is a reserved symbol for formulas in import and export scenarios. Thus, ''Invoice Reference Number'' is a valid name of a source field, but ''Invoice Ref. Number'' is invalid.
*The order of the columns in the source file is not important. It affects only the order of the fields in the '''Source Fields''' pane on the '''Schema''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_15|Data Providers] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206015|SM206015]) form.

You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_15|Data Providers] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206015|SM206015]) form to create a data provider that defines the structure of external data for Acumatica ERP during data import or data export. {br}

This procedure describes how to create a data provider that works with the records in an Excel file. 
==Before You Proceed==
Make sure the file for which you are going to create a data provider satisfies the following requirements:[anchor|#ul_oxl_jw1_rr]
*The file must be in XLSX format. XLS files are not supported.
*Column headers must be specified in the first row of the file.
*The names of source fields can contain letters, numbers, spaces, and underscore (&#95;) symbols. Do not use periods in these names because a period is a reserved symbol for formulas in import and export scenarios. Thus, ''Invoice Reference Number'' is a valid name of a source field, but ''Invoice Ref. Number'' is invalid.
*The order of the columns in the source file is not important. It affects only the order of the fields in the '''Source Fields''' pane on the '''Schema''' tab of the Data Providers form (SM206015).
{br}

Also, Acumatica ERP does not import values from calculated fields, such as {{=C2+D2}}. To import calculated fields, you can use formulas when you create import scenarios. Another way to import calculated fields is to add a column with values copied from a calculated column next to the column with the formula.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[To Create an Excel Data Provider You use the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM206015|SM206015]) Data Providers (SM206015) form to                 create a data provider that defines the structure of external data for  Acumatica ERP during data import or data export.  This procedure describes how to create a data provider that works with the records in                 an Excel file.  Before You Proceed Make sure the file for which you are going to create a data provider satisfies the                 following requirements: The file must be in XLSX format. XLS files are not supported. Column headers must be specified in the first row of the file. The names of source fields can contain letters, numbers, spaces, and                         underscore (_) symbols. Do not use periods in these names because a period                         is a reserved symbol for formulas in import and export scenarios. Thus,                              Invoice Reference Number  is a valid name of a source field, but                              Invoice Ref. Number  is invalid. The order of the columns in the source file is not important. It affects                         only the order of the fields in the  Source Fields                          pane on the  Schema  tab of the Data Providers form                         (SM206015). Also,  Acumatica ERP does not import values from calculated fields, such as  =C2+D2 .                 To import calculated fields, you can use formulas when you create import scenarios.                 Another way to import calculated fields is to add a column with values copied from a                 calculated column next to the column with the formula. To Create an Excel Data Provider Review the data file for which you need to create the data provider to                         identify the external data schema. Open the file and review the available                         columns. Make sure that you understand how the names of the columns match                         the contents. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM206015|SM206015]) Data Providers (SM206015) form, create                         a provider with the following settings: Name : The name of the provider, which usually                                 describes the data you will transfer by using this provider, such as                                      Import/Export AR Invoices Data Type :  Excel Provider                                      ( PX.DataSync.ExcelSYProvider ) The list of provider parameters becomes available on the                                  Parameters  tab, which contains one parameter:                                  FileName .  On the form toolbar, click  Save . You need to save the provider before you upload the file. Drag the file to the form, and refresh the form in your browser. The file is uploaded to the form.  As an alternative to this step, to upload the source file to the form, on the title bar, click  Files . In the  Files  dialog box, which opens, click  Browse  to locate the source file. Select the file, and click  Open . In the dialog box, click  Upload  to upload the file to the website; then close the dialog box. On the toolbar of the  Source Objects  pane of the                              Schema  tab, select the                              Active  check box for the needed object (which                         corresponds to a spreadsheet) to make the object available in integration                         scenarios.

    &lt;/Row&gt;
  &lt;/Rows&gt;
&lt;/Root&gt;
}}}}
*Flat format, in which the values of the source fields are placed in attributes of tags in the source XML file. The structure must be similar to that shown in the following code.{{{{&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="us-ascii"?&gt;

If you need to use another XML format, you should develop a custom data provider by using the API provided by Acumatica ERP or use the contract-based API to import or export the data.

You can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_15|Data Providers] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206015|SM206015]) form to modify existing data providers.{br}

If the data source has changed—for example, if you have added a column to the Excel file—you have to update the data provider. To update the data provider, you have to replace the file attached to the provider on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_15|Data Providers] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206015|SM206015]) form and update the provider schema.

#In the '''Files''' dialog box, click '''Edit''' to the right of the file name.
#:Clicking '''Edit''' opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_10|File Maintenance] form ([~/?ScreenId=SM202510|SM202510]), which displays the details of the file attachment. 
#On the form toolbar, click '''Check Out''' to make the file unavailable to other users for editing while you are updating it. You may skip this step if no other users can work with this file simultaneously.
#Click '''Get Latest Version''' on the form toolbar, and download the file. Open the file and modify it. Save the edited version to your computer.
#:((({S:Warn}You do not necessarily have to download the file first; you can just upload a new version and skip this step.
)))
#On the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_10|File Maintenance] form, click '''Upload New Version''' to open the '''File Upload''' dialog box, and upload the edited version of the file into the system.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
You create import scenarios on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) form. The creation of the import scenario consists of the following general steps:[anchor|#ol_xb1_hgj_js]
#'''Analyzing the sequence of actions on the form'''
#:Before you start creating an import scenario on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] form, you should create a data provider, as described in [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__con_Data_Providers|Data Providers], and learn how a data record is entered on the target Acumatica ERP form. 
#:When reviewing the Acumatica ERP form for which you will compose the import scenario, pay attention to the required fields on the form. All these fields must be filled in when you create a new record. Some fields on the form can get default values, which can also be used during import. For example, you can configure customer classes before you import customer records so that when these records are imported, the system gets most of settings from the customer class specified for the customer. You can provide the values of the fields that have default values during import and override these default values. Make sure all required data fields either are included in the imported data or are filled with default values.
#:Before you start creating a scenario, we strongly recommend that you manually enter one record of the imported data (or a test record) on the target Acumatica ERP form. (If you enter a record of the imported data, during import, you can exclude this record from processing to avoid duplication of records in the system.) 
#:As you manually enter the record, make a note of the sequence of actions you perform: the order in which you specify values in the fields on the form, and the actions you perform for the entered record, such as adding a new row and saving your changes. 
#'''Specifying scenario parameters'''
#:The parameters of an import scenario define the name of the scenario, the Acumatica ERP form to which data will be imported, and the data provider and source object, which together specify the data source. You can also set other import scenario parameters that define the mode of import and the properties of the data being imported.
#'''Creating mapping of the scenario '''
#:Mapping is the process of creating one-way relations between the fields of an external data source and the fields of an Acumatica ERP form. To provide mapping for a particular field on an Acumatica ERP form, you perform the following steps on the '''Mapping''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) form:[anchor|#ol_ic2_qfd_mh]
##Add a row for the field you want to map.
##In the '''Target Object''' box, specify the Acumatica ERP object that includes the target field. An object represents a group of fields on an Acumatica ERP form, such as a summary area or a detail tab.
##In the '''Field/Action Name''' column, select the appropriate internal field or action. An internal field is a field of the Acumatica ERP object selected in the '''Target Object''' box.
##In the '''Source Field/Value''' column, select the matching external field, internal field, or combination of internal and external fields, functions, and constants. An external field is a field of the object from the data provider specified in the scenario.
#:When you are mapping fields, you should first map the key fields: the fields that the system uses to distinguish records that belong to different documents. For example, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form, there are two key fields: '''Type''' and '''Reference Nbr'''. You should map these fields before you map the other fields, because you fill in these fields first on the form when you manually enter an invoice. After you have mapped key fields, you should map other fields in the order in which you would fill them in on the form.
#:You can deactivate some rows of the scenario mapping by clearing the '''Active''' check box for corresponding rows. This will exclude the corresponding instruction from the scenario mapping, and this instruction will not be executed during the import process.
#:At the end of the mapping of the scenario that imports or updates data in the system, to save the imported record to the database, you have to insert a row with the ''&lt;Action: Save&gt;'' action.
#'''Configuring source and target restrictions'''
#:To import only some records from the data source or update only the records that satisfy some condition, you can configure source and target restrictions for an import scenario on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) form. 
#:You can find detailed descriptions and examples of the use of source and target restrictions in the following topics:[anchor|#ul_owr_241_ss]
#*[HelpRoot_Integration\IS__con_Source_Restrictions_in_Import_Scenarios|Source Restrictions in Import Scenarios]
#*[HelpRoot_Integration\IS__con_Target_Restrictions_in_Import_Scenarios|Target Restrictions in Import Scenarios]

After these steps have been performed, the scenario is ready, and you can use it for data processing.]]></column>

In the  Field/Action Name  column, select the appropriate internal field or                 action. An internal field is a field of the  Acumatica ERP object selected in the  Target Object  box.

When you are mapping fields, you should first map the key fields: the fields             that the system uses to distinguish records that belong to different documents. For             example, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form, there are two key             fields:  Type  and  Reference Nbr . You should             map these fields before you map the other fields, because you fill in these fields first             on the form when you manually enter an invoice. After you have mapped key fields, you             should map other fields in the order in which you would fill them in on the             form. You can deactivate some rows of the scenario mapping by clearing the                Active  check box for corresponding rows. This will exclude the             corresponding instruction from the scenario mapping, and this instruction will not be             executed during the import process. At the end of the mapping of the scenario that             imports or updates data in the system, to save the imported record to the database, you             have to insert a row with the  <Action: Save>  action. Configuring source and target restrictions To import only some records from the             data source or update only the records that satisfy some condition, you can configure             source and target restrictions for an import scenario on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) Import Scenarios (SM206025) form.  You can find detailed descriptions             and examples of the use of source and target restrictions in the following topics: Source Restrictions in Import ScenariosTarget Restrictions in Import ScenariosAfter these steps have been performed, the scenario is ready, and you can use it for data         processing. ]]></column>

When you are performing mapping on the '''Mapping''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) form, you have to select the target object and field. {br}{TOC}
==Target Objects and Fields==
In the '''Target Object''' column, you have to select the object of the Acumatica ERP form into which you want to insert the value. The object names that appear in this drop-down box are the names of the UI elements that you see on the form. Custom UI elements that you add to the system by means of customization are also available for mapping in the same way as the original ones.{br}

For example, to be able to select the '''Statement Cycle ID''' field that is located in the '''Financial Settings''' group on the '''General Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form (shown in the following screenshot), you would select {{General Info -> Financial Settings}} as the target object for mapping.{br}

Each field or action on an Acumatica ERP form (such as a text box, combo box, table column, or button) is associated with a particular target object and becomes available for selection in the '''Field / Action Name''' column once you select the target object in the '''Target Object''' column. The field name has the same name as the corresponding box on the form, such as {{Statement Cycle ID}}, as the following screenshot shows. [anchor|#fig_ymf_n2k_js][anchor|#image_sx5_r2k_js][image:UserGuide/Images/IS_Import_TargetObject.png|popup|Target object and field|450px]{br}

Multiple objects support the functionality of each Acumatica ERP form: a summary object, detail objects, and related objects. These types of objects are described in the following sections.
==Summary Object==
The summary object is the main object on the form; it contains the keys that identify the record in the system. {br}

You can use the fields of the summary object to do the following: [anchor|#ul_dys_1pr_js]
*Set the values of the corresponding fields on the form.
*Search for a record in the system. That is, you can create custom keys from these fields to search for a particular record. For example, you can find a needed customer record in the system by using the value of the '''Customer Name''' field on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form. 
*Filter imported records by these fields by using target restrictions. For example, you can select for processing only the customer records that have the ''Inactive'' status in the '''Status''' field on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form. 
{br}

Generally, you can identify the fields that belong to the summary object on the form as the fields of the summary area of the form. More precisely, these are the data fields of the data access class (DAC) underlying the summary object. (In Acumatica Framework, this DAC is called the main DAC of the primary data view.) To use the summary object in scenario mapping, select the first object in the '''Target Object''' drop-down box in the '''Mapping''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) form.{br}

For example, the summary object on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form is {{Customer Summary}}. It includes the key '''Customer ID''' field. The object and field are shown in the following screenshot.{br}

[anchor|#fig_rq4_qy1_2s][anchor|#image_z5s_xy1_2s][image:UserGuide/Images/IS_Import_PrimaryObject.png|popup|Summary object and key field |450px]{br}

The summary object on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form is {{Invoice Summary}}. It includes two key fields: '''Type''' and '''Reference Nbr'''. (See the following screenshot.)[anchor|#fig_fjd_4jk_js][anchor|#image_dj4_rjk_js][image:UserGuide/Images/IS_Import_PrimaryObject2.png|popup|Summary object and key fields |450px]
==Detail Objects==
Detail objects correspond to the tabs that include lists of detail records. The fields of a detail object correspond to the columns of the detail tab. {br}

You can use the fields of the detail object to do the following: [anchor|#ul_rnp_tqr_js]
*Set the values of corresponding fields of a detail line.
*Search for a detail line in the document. That is, you can create custom keys from these fields to search for a particular detail line in the document. For example, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] form, you can find a needed detail line of an Accounts Receivable invoice by using the value in the '''Transaction Descr.''' column. 
{br}

To use the detail object in the scenario mapping, in the '''Target Object''' column in the '''Mapping''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) form, select the object with the same name as the name of the detail tab.{br}

For example, [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form has the '''Contacts''' tab, shown in the following screenshot, which includes a list of contacts. The corresponding detail object has the {{Contacts}} name.[anchor|#fig_vsd_cz1_2s][anchor|#image_l2l_dz1_2s][image:UserGuide/Images/IS_Import_DetailsObject.png|popup|Detail object |450px]{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form, the {{Document Details}} object (shown in the following screenshot) contains a list of invoice lines. [anchor|#fig_xty_qlk_js][anchor|#image_e1s_5lk_js][image:UserGuide/Images/IS_Import_DetailsObject2.png|popup|Detail object |450px]
==Related Objects==
Related objects support the functionality of other tabs and groups of fields on the form. {br}

You can use the fields of these objects only to set the values of the corresponding fields on the form. You cannot use the fields of these objects to search for records by using customer keys or to filter imported records by using target restrictions. For example, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form, you cannot search for the needed customer record by using the value of the '''Email''' field of the '''Main Contact''' group of the '''General Info''' tab as a custom key, and you cannot filter records by using the '''Country''' field of the '''Main Address''' group of the '''General Info''' tab by using target restrictions.{br}

To use a related object in the scenario mapping, in the '''Target Object''' column in the '''Mapping''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) form, select the object with the name of corresponding tab or group of fields on the form. The related objects that correspond to tabs on the form have the names of the tabs. The related objects that correspond to groups of fields on the form have names in one of the following formats: {{Summary Name -> Group of Fields Name}} or {{Tab Name -> Group of Fields Name}}.{br}

For example, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form, the '''Main Contact''' and '''Main Address''' groups of elements on the '''General Info''' tab are represented by related objects, as the following screenshot illustrates. These objects are listed in the '''Target Object''' column as {{General Info -> Main Contact}} and {{General Info -> Main Address}}.[anchor|#fig_sqy_nz1_2s][anchor|#image_tnm_pz1_2s][image:UserGuide/Images/IS_Import_RelatedObject.png|popup|Related objects |450px]

When you are performing mapping on the '''Mapping''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) form, you have to select in the '''Source Field / Value''' column the source field from which the system takes the value to be inserted into the target field. You can use the following as source fields: [anchor|#ul_mzk_4nk_js]
*The fields defined in the data provider
*The fields of an Acumatica ERP form, from which we can take the value that already exists in the system or the default value
*Any combination of the fields defined in the data provider, the fields of an Acumatica ERP form, constants, and functions

==Relationships Between Source Fields and Target Objects and Fields==
Source data includes a set of master records, such as customer account records. Each master record has a set of fields that are mapped to the fields of the summary object and related objects. For customer accounts, these fields can include '''Customer ID''' and '''Email'''. There may be only one value of such field for each summary object or related object.{br}

A master record can have a set of detail lines that are mapped to the fields of detail objects. For example, a customer account can have multiple contact details. There may be many detail lines for each detail object. Therefore, for these detail lines to be imported to Acumatica ERP, external data should include the identifier of the master record for each detail line. That is, each detail line should have the key fields of the summary object specified. {br}

For example, suppose that you have a customer account with two contact details. In this case, the external data that you are going to import to Acumatica ERP should include two records—one record with the customer ID and contact information for each contact detail. Such records should include a key field that the system uses to distinguish lines that belong to different records. The relationships between the external data and Acumatica ERP objects on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form are shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#fig_wfb_mrn_wr][anchor|#image_an4_prn_wr][image:UserGuide/Images/IS_Import_Mapping.png|popup|Relationships Between External Data and Acumatica ERP Objects|450px]

The relationships between the external data and  Acumatica ERP     objects on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000) form are shown in the     following screenshot.

You can specify target restrictions that apply to records after they have been processed by the import scenario. For example, suppose that you have imported customer records to Acumatica ERP and then manually changed the status of some of these records to ''Inactive'' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form, and now you want to update only imported customer records that have the ''Inactive'' status. Because you do not have the status in the source file, you cannot use source restrictions to select needed records. You can, however, specify a target restriction that makes the system save the results of import for only the records that have ''Inactive'' status on the form. {br}

To configure restrictions that apply to records after they have been processed by the import scenario, you specify conditions for the target fields on the '''Target Restrictions''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) form. If you have specified target restrictions, after a record is imported, the system checks the conditions for the imported record. If a record satisfies the conditions, the system saves the result of processing the record during import. If a record violates the target restrictions, the resulting record is not saved; by default, the system stops processing records and displays an error. To make the system skip errors for the records that do not meet the restrictions and proceed with processing other records, you should set the system to not break on an incorrect target. In this case, the system will continue to process subsequent records after an error has occurred for a record. {br}

For example, suppose that you want to delete customer records that have an ''Inactive'' status on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form. To do this, you can add to the target restrictions the condition that the imported customer records should have the ''Inactive'' status. During import, the system will check whether each imported record has the ''Inactive'' status, and delete the record only if it has this status. {br}

To determine target restrictions, you can use only the fields of the summary object. For example, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form, you can filter records by the '''Customer ID''', '''Customer Name''', and '''Status''' fields. You cannot use columns of '''Select''' dialog boxes, fields of related objects, and fields of detail objects to filter records. For example, for this form, you can filter customer records neither by the value of the '''Country''' field of the '''Main Contact''' group on the '''General Info''' tab, nor by the '''Country''' column of the Selector dialog box of the '''Customer ID''' field.]]></column>

This topic describes how to import records with an attribute for which a user can specify multiple values at the same time.
==Task Description==
Suppose that you want to import information about the required products for certain leads. The '''REQPROD''' attribute, for which you want to import the data, is of the ''Multi Select Combo'' type, which means that multiple values can be selected for the attribute at the same time.{br}

The information about the required products is available in the <tt>Leads Multiple Attributes.xlsx</tt> file, which you can find in the [https://github.com/Acumatica/Help-and-Training-Examples/tree/2020R2/IntegrationDevelopment/Help|Help-and-Training-Examples] repository on GitHub. The ''Attribute ID'' column of the file contains the IDs of the attribute values as they are used by the system. The '''Value''' column contains the values that are displayed on the '''Attributes''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form for the attribute in the row, as the following screenshot shows.[anchor|#_2ee0f2f5-b891-4cd0-877a-ec4f5cdb3269][anchor|#_44d42d95-e487-4b41-b870-7f93ddc4f0c8][image:UserGuide/Images/IS_Import_Attributes_LeadsForm.png|Attributes tab of the Leads form|450px]
The following screenshot shows the value IDs of the '''REQPROD''' attribute and their descriptions on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_50_00|Attributes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) form.

==Implementation==
To import leads with multi-value attributes, perform the following steps:[anchor|#_fbf3ee90-ab90-4c0f-9e02-5666b9ee5455]

[anchor|#_e644bca5-4cf4-43fd-9e29-6c3062f15165]
==1. Creating a new data provider==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_15|Data Providers] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206015|SM206015]) form, create an Excel data provider for the <tt>Leads Multiple Attributes.xlsx</tt> file with the name ''Import Leads Multiple'', as shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_a97869dc-6f97-4bdb-bc24-7c00cea9e8c1][anchor|#_a344933d-936a-48c1-8f32-7febf6bd0d8e][image:UserGuide/Images/IS_Import_Attributes_DataProvider.png|The Import Leads Multiple data provider|450px][anchor|#_3cb0f7ec-9172-476a-a78c-dad83bfdf116]
==2. Creating an import scenario==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) form, create an import scenario that uses the data provider you have created in the previous step. The mapping of the scenario is shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_9b906744-d633-4ffc-a4be-5de7b58d8f09][anchor|#_90a22276-f4b4-46a8-a807-b46640f399c5][image:UserGuide/Images/IS_Import_Attributes_ImportScenario.png|The Import Leads Multiple import scenario|450px][anchor|#_d824237b-0d7b-4948-8752-4f7a5dec3b8d]
==3. Running the scenario==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_36|Import by Scenario] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206036|SM206036]) form, select the ''Import Leads Multiple'' scenario in the Summary area, and click '''Prepare & Import''' on the form toolbar. The records from the Excel file are imported into the system.[anchor|#_bdc70c44-f29d-46b0-9199-3b5c9ac940d4]
==4. Reviewing the imported records==
Review the results of the import on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form. Select ''Woodrow, Harrison'' in the Summary area; then on the '''Attributes''' tab, make sure the '''Required products''' attribute has multiple values selected, as the following screenshot shows.[anchor|#_578218de-01d8-43b7-b2f3-a0126bf711b2][anchor|#_8351f01b-dd29-47f4-a7f1-db29248dbcff][image:UserGuide/Images/IS_Import_Attributes_LeadsAttributes.png|'''Required products''' attribute with multiple values selected|450px]
==Summary==
To import attributes that have multiple values, you use the Excel file, which contains the IDs of the attribute values (not their descriptions). The value IDs for a lead are added to a single cell and are separated by commas without spaces. In the scenario, you map the '''Attribute ID''' column of the source file to the '''Attribute ID''' field of the '''Attributes''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form. You do not need to specify each of the values from the '''Value''' column of the Excel file. The system parses the values automatically.
==Examples==
For an example on how to import leads with attributes, see Lesson 2.6, Example 2.6.1 of the I100 Integration Scenarios Training Guide.

This topic describes how to import new records and assign each record an ID according to the numbering system currently used by the system.
==Task Description==
Suppose that you want to import into Acumatica ERP vendor records from the <tt>Import&#95;Vendors.xlsx</tt> file, which you can find in the [https://github.com/Acumatica/Help-and-Training-Examples/tree/2020R2/IntegrationDevelopment/Help|Help-and-Training-Examples] repository on GitHub. Vendor accounts in the system, which are created and maintained on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form, have IDs that range from ''V000000001'' to ''V000000092''. (The vendor IDs are entered in the Vendor ID box.) Vendor accounts in the Excel file have IDs that use a different naming system. You want to assign new IDs that start with ''V000000093'' to the records that you are importing.{br}

In the import scenario, you will map the IDs from the ''Vendor ID'' column of the Excel file (that is, the old IDs) to the {{Ext Ref Nbr.}} field so that the applicable ID appears in the'''Ext Ref Nbr.''' box of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] form, which is shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_ccfec8e4-0caa-4d04-8d45-092ebaed39df][anchor|#_e0392e22-d903-439c-8b95-ba0be97aba49][image:UserGuide/Images/IS_Import_Vendors_VendorForm.png|The Vendors form|450px]
==Implementation==
To import vendor accounts and assign them new IDs while maintaining the old IDs as external identifiers, perform the following steps, which are described in detail below:[anchor|#_503c7478-39b9-44f8-8049-3b623b041f2f]

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_36|Import by Scenario] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206036|SM206036]) form, select the ''Vendor Documents'' scenario in the Summary area, and click '''Prepare & Import''' on the form toolbar. The records from the Excel file are imported into the system.[anchor|#_037d26be-6e95-4df5-9aec-44497b588739]
==5. Reviewing the imported records==
Review the result of the importing on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] form. You can see that five records have been added to the system. They have been assigned IDs according to the numbering sequence used by the system, as shown in the screenshot below. Each record has been added for the appropriate vendor as specified in the source file. The status of the imported records has been changed to ''On Hold''.[anchor|#_b3562ea4-911b-4c97-872d-0e7f88690bcf][anchor|#_50b7699c-8563-4a33-8089-0fac80987910][image:UserGuide/Images/IS__Import_VendorDocumentsImportedRecords.png|The imported records on the Bills and Adjustments form|450px]
==Summary==
To import vendor documents, you enable the auto-numbering of records to assign the documents the IDs according to the numbering sequence currently in use.{br}

In the import scenario, you map the external reference number to the {{Reference Nbr.}} field on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] form. You also map vendor ID from the source file to the {{Vendor ID}} field on this form.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Importing Documents (Vendors) This section describes how to import vendor documents (bills, adjustments, or         prepayments). Task Description Suppose that you want import vendor documents from the  Vendor           Details.xlsx  file, which you can find in the  Help-and-Training- Examples Help-and-Training-Examples         repository on GitHub. The file contains several bills for vendors with IDs          V000000103 ,  V000000107 , and  V000000108 . The IDs of the documents in the            Reference Nbr.  column are the external IDs used by the vendor. The  Vendor           Invoice Nbr./Payment Nbr.  column contains invoice IDs specified by the vendor. You         will use values from the  Vendor ID  column to identify vendors in the system. You can see the documents of a vendor on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP402000|AP402000]) Vendor Details (AP402000)         form, as the following screenshot shows. The Vendor Details form To import documents for several vendors, you will use the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments         (AP301000) form. During import,  Acumatica ERP automatically assigns each document an ID according to the numbering system currently         used in the system. If you want to use external numbering system, disable Auto-numbering for the bills and         adjustments on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) Numbering Sequences (CS201010) form. Implementation To import vendor documents, perform the following steps, which are described in detail           below: Configuring auto-numbering of records in the system Configuring auto-numbering of records in the systemCreating a data provider Creating a data providerCreating an import scenario Creating an import scenarioRunning the scenario Running the scenarioReviewing the imported records Reviewing the imported records1. Configuring auto-numbering of records in         the system On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) Numbering Sequences (CS201010) form, create the  APBILL  numbering         sequence and clear the  Manual Numbering  field for it, as shown in the         following screenshot. Numbering Sequence for bills and adjustments 2. Creating a data provider On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM206015|SM206015]) Data Providers (SM206015) form, create an Excel data provider for         the  Vendor Details.xlsx  file with the name  Import Vendor           Documents , as the following screenshot shows. The Import Vendor Documents data provider 3. Creating an import scenario On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) Import Scenarios (SM206025) form, create an import scenario that uses         the data provider you have created in the previous step. The mapping of the scenario is         shown in the following screenshot. The Import Vendor Documents import scenario 4. Running the scenario On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM206036|SM206036]) Import by Scenario (SM206036) form, select the  Vendor Documents          scenario in the Summary area, and click  Prepare & Import  on the         form toolbar. The records from the Excel file are imported into the system. 5. Reviewing the imported records Review the result of the importing on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments form. You can see         that five records have been added to the system. They have been assigned IDs according to         the numbering sequence used by the system, as shown in the screenshot below.

You create export scenarios on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_70_25|Export Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM207025|SM207025]) form. The creation of the export scenario consists of the following general steps:[anchor|#ol_d3s_gpl_ls]
#'''Analyzing the sequence of actions on the form for data export'''
#:Before you start creating an export scenario on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_70_25|Export Scenarios] form, you create a data provider and learn how to retrieve the needed data records from the corresponding Acumatica ERP form. You can find more information on data providers in [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__con_Data_Providers|Data Providers].
#:If needed, you could use the same data provider for import and export of data in the same format. However, a data provider and the scenarios that use this provider share the same external data source. Therefore, if you do not want to confuse the input and output data sources, you should create separate data providers for importing and exporting data. 
#:Before you start creating a scenario, we strongly recommend that you open a record of the exported data on the source form by selecting the values of the key fields (which gives you an understanding of how a record is retrieved on the form and which fields you need to export). As you open the record on the form, make a note of the sequence of actions you perform: the order in which you specify the values in the key field (or fields) on the form, the actions you perform, and the list of fields you need to export.
#'''Specifying scenario parameters'''
#:You specify the following parameters of an export scenario: the name of the scenario, the Acumatica ERP form that should be used for export, and the data provider and the object, which together specify the target data source. You can also specify other export scenario parameters that define the mode of export and the properties of the data resulting from the export.
#'''Creating scenario mapping'''
#:Mapping is the process of creating one-way relations between the fields of the Acumatica ERP form and the fields of the external data source. To provide mapping for a particular field on an Acumatica ERP form, you perform the following steps on the '''Mapping''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_70_25|Export Scenarios] form:[anchor|#ol_xnb_kql_ls]
##In the '''Source Object''' box, you specify the Acumatica ERP object that includes the source field. An object represents a group of fields on an Acumatica ERP form, such as a summary area or a detail tab. (These are the same objects that are used in import scenario mapping. You can find the description of these objects in [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__con_Target_Objects_and_Fields_in_Import_Scenarios|Target Objects and Fields in Import Scenarios].)
##In the '''Field/Action Name''' column, you select the appropriate internal field or action. An internal field is a field of the Acumatica ERP object selected in the '''Source Object''' box. (These are the same internal fields that are used in import scenario mapping. You can find the description of these fields in [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__con_Target_Objects_and_Fields_in_Import_Scenarios|Target Objects and Fields in Import Scenarios].)
##In the '''Target Field/Value''' column, you select the matching external field or type a formula the system will use to determine the value. An external field is a field of the object from the data provider specified in the scenario.
#:You first map the key fields that identify the records you want to export. After you have mapped the key fields, you should map the other needed fields.
#:You can deactivate some steps of a scenario by clearing the '''Active''' check box for the corresponding rows.
#'''Configuring source restrictions'''
#:To export only some records from the Acumatica ERP database, you can configure source restrictions for an export scenario on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_70_25|Export Scenarios] form. 
#:You can find a detailed description of source restrictions and an example of their use in [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__con_Source_Restrictions_in_Export_Scenarios|Source Restrictions in Export Scenarios].

In source restrictions, you can use only the fields of the summary object or detail objects of         the form from which you are exporting data. You cannot use columns of            Select  dialog boxes and fields of related objects to filter records         or detail lines.  ]]></column>

In this topic, you will find general recommendations for data import, including its limitations.{br}{TOC}
==General Recommendations for Importing Accounts and Subaccounts==
When you import accounts and subaccounts to Acumatica ERP, consider the following general recommendations: [anchor|#ul_ad2_qfd_mh]
*In your new Acumatica ERP implementation, the chart of accounts may differ from the chart of accounts in the legacy application from which you are going to import the data. When the company switches to newer software, the length of the account identifier is usually extended to include more characters; in many cases, several zeros are added in the middle of or at the end of the account identifier. In such a simple case, consider inserting these additional characters during the import process by using a formula.
*In Acumatica ERP, subaccount identifiers are segmented, but the separator characters are not part of the subaccount identifier as it is saved in the database. If subaccount identifiers in the external file have segments separated by a character, use a formula such as the following to remove this character from the external data during import.{{{{replace([Sales Subaccount],'-','')
}}}}
*If you import subaccounts from your subsidiary or parent company, consider the differences in their segment structures. You may need to add a segment when you&rsquo;re importing from a subsidiary or remove a segment when you&rsquo;re importing from a parent company.

==General Recommendations for Importing Vendor and Customer Data==
Here are some general recommendations for importing vendor and customer data to Acumatica ERP: [anchor|#ul_ed2_qfd_mh]
*In Acumatica ERP, vendor and customer IDs may be segmented. You can create a formula to insert any missing segments into the imported IDs.
*If the external file contains fields with vendor or customer data that is not tracked in Acumatica ERP in built-in fields, you can create and use attributes to store this vendor or customer data in Acumatica ERP. Attributes are created for vendor or customer classes, and then can be entered and tracked for individual vendors and customers. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Attributes_and_User_Defined_Fields|Managing Attributes and User-Defined Fields].
*If customer and vendor records have numerical IDs in the source and you want to retain these IDs in the new implementation, perform the following steps: 
**On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form, configure the ''VENDOR'' and ''CUSTOMER'' segmented keys as alphanumeric one-segment keys.
**Import the records with their IDs unchanged.
**On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_10_10|Numbering Sequences] ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) form, assign appropriate numbering sequences to the ''VENDOR'' and ''CUSTOMER'' segmented keys with the appropriately adjusted last-used numbers (equal to the largest number used in the imported data for vendors and customers, respectively) to assign numeric IDs to new customers and vendors.

When an Acumatica ERP user creates a new vendor or customer account in the standard way, by filling out the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form, some fields are populated automatically with values provided by the default vendor or customer class or the vendor or customer class the user has selected instead. {br}

To use the functionality of classes while you are importing vendor or customer data, before import, analyze the source data and create as many classes as there are groups of customers or vendors in the source (or source file) that would need accounts, subaccounts, and other common information you can specify among the class settings. When you create classes, take one of the following approaches: [anchor|#ul_md2_qfd_mh]
*If one group of settings can fit all customers or vendors, use just one default class. To use default values from the default vendor or customer class, you don&rsquo;t even need to do anything specific, such as mapping the '''Vendor Class''' field or '''Customer Class''' field to any data.
*To use default values from a particular class, in the '''Field/Action Name''' box of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) form, you can assign the class to the '''Vendor Class''' field (when you are importing vendor records) or to the '''Customer Class''' field (when you are importing customer records) directly as a literal or assign a class conditionally, by using appropriate formulas that are based on customer or vendor properties. Filling in the class ID field requires a commit to the database and a form refresh.

==General Recommendations for Importing Documents and Batches==
When you&rsquo;re importing batches, Accounts Payable documents, or Accounts Receivable documents, consider the following recommendations regarding the mapping: [anchor|#ul_pd2_qfd_mh]
*'''Batch or Document IDs''': By default, Acumatica ERP automatically generates identifiers for General Ledger batches and Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable documents. For example, when importing batches to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_30_10_00|Journal Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=GL301000|GL301000]) form, even if you map the '''Batch Number''' field to an external field holding batch IDs, when the record is saved, the original batch ID will be overwritten by an automatically generated ID. If you plan to update the imported batches later, you will not be able to recognize the imported records by their new IDs. To make updating of the imported records possible, you need to save the original ID to another field to be able to recognize the previously imported records. You can use the '''Description''' field for this purpose. As an alternative to this approach, you can configure manual numbering of batches or documents on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_10_10|Numbering Sequences] ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) form, import them with their IDs defined in the source, and then configure the system to use auto-numbering again.
*'''Batch Control Totals''': When importing batches to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_30_10_00|Journal Transactions] form, if you are mapping the '''Control Total''' field, take into account whether the '''Validate Batch Control Totals on Entry''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_10_20_00|General Ledger Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=GL102000|GL102000]) form. If it is selected and you map the '''Control Total''' field to the source field, during data import until all batch entries are imported, the system will display the error, indicating that the control total does not match the credit total or debit total. In this case, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] form, select the '''Ignore Error''' check box for the row that maps the '''Control Total''' field to force the system to ignore such errors during the import process.
*'''Document Amounts''': When importing documents to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) or the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form, if you are mapping the '''Amount''' field, take into account whether the '''Validate Document Totals on Entry''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_10_10_00|Accounts Payable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AP101000|AP101000]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) form. If it is selected and you map the '''Amount''' field to the source field, during data import until all document details are imported, the system will display the error, indicating that the document is out of balance. In this case, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] form, select the '''Ignore Error''' check box for the row that maps the '''Amount''' field to force the system to ignore such errors during the import process.
*'''Mapping Statuses''': The possible batch and document statuses in the source may be different from those in Acumatica ERP. To manage this discrepancy, you might want to exclude the '''Status''' field of the applicable form from mapping. In this case, the imported batch or document will get one of the following statuses: 
**''On Hold'', if the '''Hold Batches on Entry''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_10_20_00|General Ledger Preferences] form or the '''Hold Documents on Entry''' selected is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_10_10_00|Accounts Payable Preferences] form
**''Open'', if the '''Hold Batches on Entry''' or '''Hold Documents on Entry''' check box is not selected on the appropriate form

==General Recommendations for Importing Attributes==
Attributes in Acumatica ERP make it possible for users to specify additional properties (those not already defined on the applicable Acumatica ERP form) of entities, such as stock items, leads, opportunities, customers. The list of attributes is specified for an entity class, so that entities assigned to different classes may have different sets of attributes. To import data with attributes, you have to create a scenario for each class if the applicable classes have different sets of attributes. In the mapping of the scenario created to import entities of a particular class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) form, you should specify the name of the attribute as the source field for the '''Attribute''' target field and the value of this attribute as the source field for the '''Value''' target field. 
==General Recommendations for Importing Project Budgets==
For the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_90_00|Project Budget] ([~/?ScreenId=PM309000|PM309000]) form, the system allows to import records by the project budget compound key, which is the project identifier, project task identifier, inventory identifier, and account group identifier. After records are imported to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_90_00|Project Budget] form, to restructure budget records according to the revenue budget level of projects, you should run the validation process on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_50_40_00|Validate Project Balances] ([~/?ScreenId=PM504000|PM504000]) form.
==Limitations of Data Import==
By using import scenarios, you can perform the same commands on the form as you do during manual input, with the following exceptions:[anchor|#_458efb7e-ac4d-4e85-9969-8fdb55c303a4]
*For the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form, {{<Action: Auto Apply>}} (which corresponds to the '''Auto Apply''' button on the '''Applications''' tab) does not work because Acumatica ERP does not load applications during data import.
*The system does not validate the values specified for the attributes, such as the values of attributes with ''Combo'' control type. To verify a value of an attribute, you can define a validation formula in the scenario mapping. For details on formulas, see [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__con_Formulas_in_Mapping|Formulas in the Mapping].

You can create a formula to insert any           missing segments into the imported IDs. If the external file contains fields with vendor or customer data that is not tracked in  Acumatica ERP in built-in fields, you can create and use attributes to store this vendor or customer           data in  Acumatica ERP. Attributes are created for vendor or customer classes, and then can be entered and           tracked for individual vendors and customers. For details, see  Managing Attributes and User-Defined Fields. If customer and vendor records have numerical IDs in the source and you want to retain these      IDs in the new implementation, perform the following steps:  On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) Segmented Keys (CS202000)               form, configure the  VENDOR  and  CUSTOMER  segmented keys as alphanumeric               one-segment keys. Import the records with their IDs unchanged. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) Numbering Sequences (CS201010)               form, assign appropriate numbering sequences to the  VENDOR  and  CUSTOMER                segmented keys with the appropriately adjusted last-used numbers (equal to the largest               number used in the imported data for vendors and customers, respectively) to assign               numeric IDs to new customers and vendors. When an  Acumatica ERP user creates a new vendor or customer account in the standard way, by filling out the             ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors (AP303000) or             ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000) form,         some fields are populated automatically with values provided by the default vendor or         customer class or the vendor or customer class the user has selected instead.   To use the functionality of classes while you are importing vendor or customer data, before         import, analyze the source data and create as many classes as there are groups of customers         or vendors in the source (or source file) that would need accounts, subaccounts, and other         common information you can specify among the class settings.

To use default values from a particular class, in the  Field/Action Name  box of the               ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) Import Scenarios (SM206025) form, you can assign the class to the              Vendor Class  field (when you are importing vendor records) or to the              Customer Class  field (when you are importing customer records)           directly as a literal or assign a class conditionally, by using appropriate formulas that           are based on customer or vendor properties. Filling in the class ID field requires a           commit to the database and a form refresh. General Recommendations for Importing Documents and Batches When you're importing batches, Accounts Payable documents, or Accounts Receivable documents,         consider the following recommendations regarding the mapping:  Batch or Document IDs : By default,  Acumatica ERP automatically generates identifiers for General Ledger batches and Accounts Payable and           Accounts Receivable documents. For example, when importing batches to the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL301000|GL301000]) Journal Transactions (GL301000) form, even           if you map the  Batch Number  field to an external field holding batch IDs, when the           record is saved, the original batch ID will be overwritten by an automatically generated           ID. If you plan to update the imported batches later, you will not be able to recognize           the imported records by their new IDs. To make updating of the imported records possible,           you need to save the original ID to another field to be able to recognize the previously           imported records. You can use the  Description  field for this purpose. As an           alternative to this approach, you can configure manual numbering of batches or documents           on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) Numbering Sequences (CS201010)           form, import them with their IDs defined in the source, and then configure the system to           use auto-numbering again. Batch Control Totals : When importing batches to the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL301000|GL301000]) Journal Transactions form, if you are mapping           the  Control Total  field, take into account whether the  Validate Batch             Control Totals on Entry  check box is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL102000|GL102000]) General Ledger Preferences (GL102000) form. If it is selected and you           map the  Control Total  field to the source field, during data import           until all batch entries are imported, the system will display the error, indicating that           the control total does not match the credit total or debit total. In this case, on the               ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) Import Scenarios form, select the  Ignore Error            check box for the row that maps the  Control Total  field to force           the system to ignore such errors during the import process. Document Amounts : When importing documents to the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) or the                 ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000)             form, if you are mapping the  Amount  field, take into account whether the                Validate Document Totals on Entry  check box is selected on the                 ([~/?ScreenId=AP101000|AP101000]) Accounts Payable Preferences (AP101000) or   ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) Accounts Receivable Preferences (AR101000) form. If it is selected and you             map the  Amount  field to the source field, during data import until all document             details are imported, the system will display the error, indicating that the document is             out of balance. In this case, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) Import Scenarios form, select the                Ignore Error  check box for the row that maps the  Amount              field to force the system to ignore such errors during the import process. Mapping Statuses : The possible batch and document statuses in the source may be           different from those in  Acumatica ERP. To manage this discrepancy, you might want to exclude the  Status  field of the           applicable form from mapping. In this case, the imported batch or document will get one of           the following statuses:  On Hold , if the  Hold Batches on Entry  check box is selected on the                   ([~/?ScreenId=GL102000|GL102000]) General Ledger Preferences form or the  Hold Documents on                 Entry  selected is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) Accounts Receivable Preferences               or   ([~/?ScreenId=AP101000|AP101000]) Accounts Payable Preferences form Open , if the  Hold Batches on Entry  or  Hold Documents on Entry                check box is not selected on the appropriate form General Recommendations for Importing Attributes Attributes in  Acumatica ERP make it possible for users to specify additional properties (those not already defined on         the applicable  Acumatica ERP form) of entities, such as stock items, leads, opportunities, customers. The list of         attributes is specified for an entity class, so that entities assigned to different classes         may have different sets of attributes. To import data with attributes, you have to create a         scenario for each class if the applicable classes have different sets of attributes. In the         mapping of the scenario created to import entities of a particular class on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) Import Scenarios (SM206025) form, you should specify the name of the attribute         as the source field for the  Attribute  target field and the value of this attribute as         the source field for the  Value  target field.  General Recommendations for Importing Project Budgets For the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM309000|PM309000]) Project Budget (PM309000) form, the system allows to import         records by the project budget compound key, which is the project identifier, project task         identifier, inventory identifier, and account group identifier. After records are imported         to the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM309000|PM309000]) Project Budget form, to restructure budget records according to the         revenue budget level of projects, you should run the validation process on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM504000|PM504000]) Validate Project Balances (PM504000) form. Limitations of Data Import By using import scenarios, you can perform the same commands on the form as you do during         manual input, with the following exceptions: For the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form,  <Action: Auto               Apply>  (which corresponds to the  Auto Apply  button on             the  Applications  tab) does not work because  Acumatica ERP does not load applications during data import. The system does not validate the values specified for the attributes, such as the             values of attributes with  Combo  control type. To verify a value of an attribute,             you can define a validation formula in the scenario mapping. For details on formulas,             see  Formulas in the Mapping. ]]></column>

You perform mapping of an import scenario on the '''Mapping''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) form. For each target field on an Acumatica ERP form, you need to know the type of the target field and be sure the source field values have the appropriate format for the type, so that the system can insert the value of the field correctly. The type of the target field, which depends on the type of UI element that represents it on the form to which you are importing data, might be a text box of several types, a date picker, a check box, a drop-down list, a radio button, or an action or menu on the toolbar. Also, the target field might be on a dialog box or pop-up panel rather than on the form itself.{br}

((({S:Warn} In most cases, it is clear which format of the value you need for the mapping. However, if you are not sure which format of the value you need, you can create one record manually in Acumatica ERP, specify the needed value of a field of this record, compose an export scenario, and export the value of this field. Make sure the export scenario has output the value in the appropriate format. For more information on export scenarios, see [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__mng_Configuring_Export_Scenarios|Configuring Export Scenarios]. 
))){br}{TOC}
==Text Box with Text==The target field on the Acumatica ERP form may be a text box into which a user types text. For example, the '''Email''' box on the '''General Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form is a text box in which the user types an email address. 
A text box can have a mask, which is denoted by the (&#95;) symbol. If the text box has a mask, you cannot insert the underscore symbol (&#95;) because this symbol is reserved for masked input in the system. If the text box has no mask, you can insert any characters into the box, including any letters and symbols. The length of the string that you insert into a text box should not exceed the maximum length of the underlying target element. (To check the maximum length, find the maximum string that can be manually inserted into the box on the form.) {br}

For some text boxes, you can type text in multiple languages. (For the list of these text boxes, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__CON_Boxes_MultiLanguage|Boxes that Have Multi-Language Support].) To import the values of a text box in multiple languages, you should specify a string in JSON format that contains values in the needed languages. For details, see [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__con_IS_Multi-Language_Fields|Multi-Language Fields in Import and Export Scenarios].
==Text Box with Currency Amount==
The target field on the Acumatica ERP form may be a text box that holds a currency amount. For example, the '''Amount''' box in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form is a text box with a currency amount. {br}

You have to provide currency amounts in the format that you specified for the import scenario in the '''Format Locale''' box in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) form. For example, if you specified the English (United States) locale for a import scenario, you have to provide amounts where the decimal part is separated by a decimal point: ''12.34''. ((({S:Warn} By default, Acumatica ERP imports currency amounts with a decimal precision of 2, which is specified in the '''Decimal Precision''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_20_00|Branches] ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) form. When you import the currency amounts of Account Payable or Account Receivable documents, make sure that the sum of imported lines is equal the imported document total, taking into account the rounding accuracy as follows:[anchor|#_55c624e8-d789-4b98-bae2-633c4a73763c]
*The decimal precision of line amounts must be equal to the decimal precision of document total.
*The decimal precision of all amounts must be less than or equal to the decimal precision that is specified in Acumatica ERP. For example, if the decimal precision in Acumatica ERP is 2 and you import an amount with a decimal precision of 3, such as ''10.345'', the imported value will be rounded by arithmetical rules to ''10.35''.
If you import data from an Excel file, you can use the ''Round(x,y)'' function to round the amounts, and then you can copy the values to a column from which you will import data.
)))
==Text Box with a Key Value==
The target field on the Acumatica ERP form may be a text box that holds a key value. Two examples of key fields are '''Customer ID''' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form, and '''Reference Nbr''' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form. {br}

The way you specify the value for key fields depends on your goal and the auto-numbering settings of the records that you are importing. For more information and examples of mapping key fields, see [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__con_Key_Fields_and_Search_in_Import_Scenarios|Key Fields and Search in Import Scenarios].
==Date Picker==
The target field on the Acumatica ERP form may be a date picker that is used to select the date. For example, the '''Date''' element in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] form is a date picker. {br}

You have to provide date values in the format that you specified for the import scenario in the '''Format Locale''' box in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] form ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]). For example, if you specified the English (United States) locale for the import scenario, you have to provide dates in the format ''MM/DD/YYYY''. Thus, the September 1, 2014 will be ''09/01/2014''. 
==Check Box==
The target field on the Acumatica ERP form may be a check box the user can select or clear. For example, the '''Hold''' element in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form is a check box. To select a check box, map the corresponding target field to the value ''True''. To clear a check box, map the target field to the value ''False''. 
==Drop-Down List==
The target field on the Acumatica ERP form may be a drop-down list from which the user selects an option. For example, the '''Type''' element in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] form is a drop-down list. {br}

To insert a value into a drop-down list, you have to specify the value as it is displayed in the list. For example, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] form, you can insert the value ''Invoice'' into the '''Type''' field. 
==Radio Buttons==
The target field on the Acumatica ERP form may be a group of radio buttons. For example, a group of radio buttons is in the '''Additional Processing''' group of the '''Settings for Use in AP''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_40_00|Payment Methods] ([~/?ScreenId=CA204000|CA204000]) form. {br}

In the system, a group of radio buttons is treated as one field, which can have as the values the names of the radio buttons. Therefore, to select a radio button by using an import scenario, you should select the name of the group that contains the radio button in the '''Field / Action Name''' column of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] form ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]), and specify the name of the radio button in the '''Source Field / Value''' column. For example, to select the '''Print Checks''' radio button in the '''Additional Processing''' group of the '''Settings for Use in AP''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_40_00|Payment Methods] form, you should select the ''Settings for Use in AP'' target object and the ''APAdditionalProcessing'' field, and specify the source value <tt>=&rsquo;Print Checks&rsquo;</tt>.
==Buttons and Menu Items on the Toolbar==
The action on the Acumatica ERP form may be a button or menu item on the toolbar. For example, the '''Release''' button is on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form. {br}

To reflect a user clicking a button in the scenario mapping, you have to insert the corresponding action in the proper position in the mapping, and you don&rsquo;t have to map the action to any value. For more information and examples, see [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__con_Actions_in_Import_Scenarios|Actions in Import Scenarios].
==Dialog Box==
The target field may be on a dialog box invoked by a user action on the Acumatica ERP form. Dialog boxes usually appear on a form to request confirmation from the user. For example, when you update the '''Customer Class''' value on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form for an existing customer, the system displays a '''Warning''' dialog box. {br}

For more information on handling dialog boxes in import scenarios, see [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__con_PopUp_Dialog_Boxes_in_Import_Scenarios|Pop-Up Dialog Boxes in Import Scenarios]. 
==Pop-up Panel==
The target field may be on a pop-up panel invoked by a user action on the Acumatica ERP form. For example, the '''Add Sales Order''' pop-up panel appears when the user clicks '''Add Order''' on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form. {br}

In a similar way as you specify values for fields on forms and invoke actions, you can specify values and click buttons in pop-up panels that users can invoke.

The way you specify the value for key fields depends on your goal and the auto-numbering 				settings of the records that you are importing. For more information and examples of 				mapping key fields, see  Key Fields and Search in Import Scenarios. Date Picker The target field on the  Acumatica ERP form may be a date picker that is used to select the date. For example, the 					 Date  element in the Summary area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos form is a date picker.  You have to provide date values in the format that you specified for the import 				scenario in the  Format Locale  box in the Summary area of the 					  ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) Import Scenarios form (SM206025).

For example, the 					 Hold  element in the Summary area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form is a check box. To 				select a check box, map the corresponding target field to the value  True . To 				clear a check box, map the target field to the value  False .  Drop-Down List The target field on the  Acumatica ERP form may be a drop-down list from which the user selects an option. For example, 				the  Type  element in the Summary area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos form is a drop-down list.  To insert a value into a drop-down list, you have to specify the value as it is displayed in 				the list. For example, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos form, 				you can insert the value  Invoice  into the  Type  field.  Radio Buttons The target field on the  Acumatica ERP form may be a group of radio buttons. For example, a group of radio buttons is in 				the  Additional Processing  group of the  Settings 					for Use in AP  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA204000|CA204000]) Payment Methods (CA204000) form.  In the system, a group of radio buttons is treated as one field, which can have as the values 				the names of the radio buttons. Therefore, to select a radio button by using an 				import scenario, you should select the name of the group that contains the radio 				button in the  Field / Action Name  column of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) Import Scenarios form (SM206025), and specify the name of the radio 				button in the  Source Field / Value  column. For example, to 				select the  Print Checks  radio button in the 					 Additional Processing  group of the  Settings 					for Use in AP  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA204000|CA204000]) Payment Methods form, you should select the  Settings for Use in AP  target object and the 					 APAdditionalProcessing  field, and specify the source value 					 ='Print Checks' . Buttons and Menu Items on the Toolbar The action on the  Acumatica ERP form may be a button or menu item on the toolbar. For example, the 					 Release  button is on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form.  To reflect a user clicking a button in the scenario mapping, you have to insert the 				corresponding action in the proper position in the mapping, and you don't have to 				map the action to any value. For more information and examples, see  Actions in Import Scenarios. Dialog Box The target field may be on a dialog box invoked by a user action on the  Acumatica ERP form. Dialog boxes usually appear on a form to request confirmation from the 				user. For example, when you update the  Customer Class  value 				on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000) form for an 				existing customer, the system displays a  Warning  dialog box.  For more information on handling dialog boxes in import scenarios, see  Pop-Up Dialog Boxes in Import Scenarios.  Pop-up Panel The target field may be on a pop-up panel invoked by a user action on the  Acumatica ERP form. For example, the  Add Sales Order  pop-up panel 				appears when the user clicks  Add Order  on the 					 Document Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) form.  In a similar way as you specify values for fields on forms and invoke actions, you can specify 				values and click buttons in pop-up panels that users can invoke.  ]]></column>

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
There are two types of fields on Acumatica ERP forms: fields with commit, and fields without commit. A commit is an action initiated by the form that, when triggered, sends the data to the server. On the server, the commit causes all data on the form to be updated, including the insertion of default values and the recalculation of appropriate fields on the form.{br}

A commit is a costly operation that causes the browser to make requests to the server and takes server time. As such, a commit is invoked for only a limited number of fields: mainly the key fields and the fields on which the other fields depend. On the '''Mapping''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) form or the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_70_25|Export Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM207025|SM207025]) form, if you select a field for which the system performs a commit, the system automatically selects the '''Commit''' check box. {br}

If the '''Commit''' check box is cleared on this tab, the field is filled in with data, but no update of the form is invoked. If the '''Commit''' check box is selected, after the field is filled in, the commit is invoked on the server and the form is updated. {br}

For example, when you select a customer on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form, the system assigns values to fields related to customer settings, such as the customer terms, due date, and cash discount date. When you create an import scenario for this form, for fields such as '''Customer''', the system automatically selects the '''Commit''' check box on the '''Mapping''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] form.{br}

In most cases, when you compose the mapping of an import or export scenario, you can use the '''Commit''' check boxes as they are set by default. However, you may need to force the system to invoke a commit to the server—for example, when you need to commit the value of one field before entering another field value, or to indicate the beginning and the end of a record if you enter records without specifying the key field value. In such cases, you should manually select the '''Commit''' check box for the field or action. For more information on the situations when the '''Commit''' check box should be selected in export scenarios, see [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__con_Commit_and_Actions_in_Export_Scenarios|Data Modification During Export: Use of Commit and Actions].]]></column>

For key fields and the first field that has a commit among the fields of a detail table, the system adds ''service commands'' on the '''Mapping''' tab of the scenario you are creating on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) form or the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_70_25|Export Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM207025|SM207025]) form. Service commands are commands that invoke hidden actions in the system, such as searching for the record by the key field, refreshing the form, and adding a new line to the detail table.

You can replace service commands with your own commands to change the default behavior of the system. For example, if you map the first field that has a commit among the fields of a detail table, the system adds the {{<Line Number>=-1}} service command.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
In the mapping of an import scenario, you have to map the key fields first, mapping the target key fields in the system to the source key fields. (Key fields are the fields whose values uniquely identify a particular record and are used to find the record within the database.) The system uses the following keys: '''Customer ID''' for customers on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form, and '''Type''' and '''Reference Nbr.''' for documents on multiple forms, such as the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form. The order of key fields is important for mapping, so you should follow the order of key fields as they are displayed on Acumatica ERP forms. In particular, for documents, you have to assign first the '''Type''' field and then the '''Reference Nbr.''' field. {br}{TOC}
==Auto-Numbering of Records==
You can import records with their key values from the source, and the records will have the same key values in the system and the source. For example, suppose you are importing records to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form. If you have the customer ''CUST000001'' in the Excel file, you can import this customer to the system so that the customer record will have the same ID: ''CUST000001''. Later, you can update customer records by mapping the Excel column with the ID to the '''Customer ID''' field in the system.{br}

As an alternative to importing records with their key values from the source, you can import records and have the system automatically assign IDs. For example, you can import the customer records so that after the import, the customer will have an automatically assigned ID in the system that was not in the Excel file, such as ''C000000001''. You can import master records with automatically assigned IDs in several ways, which are described below:[anchor|#ul_vbf_p2v_ps]
*You can enable auto-numbering of records in the system and map the key fields to unique identifiers of records in the source.
*If there is just one line for each unique record in the data source, you can enable auto-numbering of records in the system and import each line from the source file as an unique record in the system with an automatically assigned ID. With this way of mapping, you do not map key fields in the import scenario and add the &lt;Action: Insert&gt; instruction at the beginning of the mapping. 
*You can map the key field to a formula that produces unique identifiers for each imported record in the needed format. For details on creating formulas, see [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__con_Formulas_in_Mapping|Formulas in the Mapping].
{br}

Auto-numbering of master records is configured in the corresponding segmented keys on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form. Documents are usually automatically assigned a reference number in the system. During the initial implementation, you can disable auto-numbering of documents in the system, import the documents with their IDs, and then turn on auto-numbering starting from the last imported ID. Auto-numbering of documents is configured in the numbering sequences that are specified for the corresponding document types in module preferences. For example, the ''ARINVOICE'' sequence is specified for the auto-numbering of invoices on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) form. {br}

You can update records imported with automatically generated IDs by searching for them in the system by using their unique fields available in the source. For example, you can identify customers by email addresses or phone numbers in the Excel file. To search for a record, you have to declare a custom key or use a column of a '''Select''' dialog box. Both of these methods are described below.
==Custom Key==
To specify a custom key, you have to define the key by using the {{@@}} notation; directly after the notation, assign the custom key field a value. On the '''Mapping''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) form, you should select the '''Commit''' check box for this field to make the system update the form after the key is specified. Below is an example of the settings for a mapping instruction that declares the '''Customer Name''' as the custom key for customer records you are importing to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form. In this example, we suppose that the Excel file doesn't contain the customer ID, and you are using the ''CUSTOMER NAME ''value from the Excel file to find the customer record in the system.[anchor|#table_ccy_4wy_js]

|}{br}

You can specify custom keys to search for a record or a detail line. You can use the fields of the summary object and the detail objects, but not the fields of related objects, as custom key fields. For example, you can find the needed customer record in the system by using the '''Customer Name''' field of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form as the custom key, but you cannot find the record by using the '''Email''' field of the '''Main Contact''' group of the '''General Info''' tab as the custom key.
==Selector Column==
Selector columns on an Acumatica ERP form appear when a user clicks the Magnifier icon of a key field of the form to bring up the '''Select''' dialog box. When you are performing mapping for an import scenario, you can use any selector columns that are available on the form for the key field. To use a selector column for a search in an import scenario, you have to map the selector column to the matching external field. Selector column names start with the key field name, followed by {{->}} and then the name of the selector column on the form, such as {{Customer ID -> Email}}. For example, the instruction with the following settings maps the '''Email''' selector column of the '''Customer ID''' field on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form to the EMAIL field available in the source.[anchor|#table_vkk_3yy_js]

In this example, we suppose that the Excel file doesn't contain the customer     ID, and you are using the  CUSTOMER NAME  value from the Excel file to find the customer     record in the system.

You can change the values of some fields or apply an action to a record during export. For example, you can change a description field of a record or delete a record as you are exporting it. 
==Changing the Value of a Field==
If you need to change the values of some fields during export, you must perform a commit of these fields to the server. That is, on the '''Mapping''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_70_25|Export Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM207025|SM207025]) form, you must select the '''Commit''' check box for each internal field whose data is modified. If you change the values of some fields during export, you also need to insert the {{<Action: Save>}} command at the end of the scenario to save the changes to Acumatica ERP. {br}

If you specified specific field values on the form during export only in order to select the data for exporting, however, you don&rsquo;t need to insert the {{<Action: Save>}} command at the end of the scenario.{br}

If you configured the scenario to change the values of some fields in Acumatica ERP, the system prepares the specified records in the source and tries to apply modifications to them during the preparation process. (If modification of the specified field is not allowed in the system, the field remains unchanged.) Then the system exports all prepared records to the external system. {br}

For example, suppose that you create a scenario that exports AR invoices from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form and adds the string ''Exported on 18.05.2015'' to their descriptions in Acumatica ERP. As a result of the processing of this scenario, all invoices are exported, and only the invoices with the ''Balanced'' and ''On Hold'' statuses are modified. Modification of documents with other statuses is not allowed in the system, so these documents are exported without any change to their descriptions in Acumatica ERP. 
==Applying an Action==
As you perform mapping for an export scenario, when you need to reflect the clicking of a button on a form, you should use the corresponding action. You can use the same actions in export scenarios as in import scenarios. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__con_Actions_in_Import_Scenarios|Actions in Import Scenarios].{br}

If you are going to delete records or apply another action to records by using an export scenario, you have to specify precise source restrictions that select only those records that can be processed; otherwise, no records will be processed. {br}

For example, suppose that you want to delete Accounts Receivable invoices that have ''X'' as the value of the '''Project''' element on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] form. To select only invoices that can be deleted, in the source restrictions of the export scenario, you have to specify not only the condition ''Project = X'' but also the condition ''Status = On Hold or Status = Balanced''. If you do not specify filtering by status and there are invoices with the ''Open'' status in the system, no records will be deleted.]]></column>

For some text boxes on Acumatica ERP forms, users can type values in multiple languages if multiple locales are configured in Acumatica ERP. For example, if your Acumatica ERP instance has English and French locales activated and multilingual user input configured, you can specify the value of the '''Description''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form in English and French. For the list of elements that support multiple languages, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__CON_Boxes_MultiLanguage|Boxes that Have Multi-Language Support]. For details on how to turn on multilingual user input, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__CON_Locales_and_Languages#section_lqy_4c2_jw|Enabling Multilingual User Input].
==Import of Localized Field Values==
As you perform mapping for an import scenario on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) form, when you need to import localized values of a field, you map this field to a source field that contains a string in JSON format with the localized values. In this string, you use the two-letter ISO code of the language with which the value should be associated.{br}

In the example that is mentioned at the beginning of the topic, if you need to import the values in English and French to the '''Description''' element of stock item records on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form, you map the '''Description''' field to a source field that contains data in the following format: {{[{en:English description},{fr:French description}]}}. The mapping example below presumes that the ''DescriptionsInJSONFormat'' source field contains a string in JSON format.[anchor|#_c99ff51d-68cc-45d3-bfaa-a886be6bb29d]

If you specify the values of the field in particular languages, the values of the field in other languages configured for multilingual user input become empty. For example, suppose that in your instance of Acumatica ERP, multi-language fields can have values in English and French. If you pass the value of a field in the following format {{[{en:English description}]}}, the French value of the field becomes empty.
)))
If a source field that you map to a multi-language field contains plain text, this text is saved as the value of the field in the current language of Acumatica ERP (that is, the language that you selected on the Sign-In page of Acumatica ERP).
==Export of Localized Field Values==
Each text field that supports multiple input languages has a corresponding field with the suffix ''Translations'' in its native name. This corresponding field contains all localized values of the text field. For example, the '''Description''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form corresponds to the field with native name ''Descr''. The ''Descr'' field has the ''DescrTranslations'' corresponding field, which contains the localized descriptions of a stock item. {br}

If you want to export localized values of a text box, on the '''Mapping''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_70_25|Export Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM207025|SM207025]) form, you map the needed ''Translations'' field, which contains localized values, to a target field. The ''Translations'' fields are not available in the list of fields in the '''Field / Action Name''' column on the '''Mapping''' tab; you should type the needed name manually.{br}

For example, suppose that you need to export the localized values of the '''Description''' element of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form. You should find out the native name of the '''Description''' field, which is ''Descr'', and map the ''DescrTranslations'' field to the target field, as shown in the following mapping example. ((({S:Warn}To find out the native name of a field, on the title bar of the target Acumatica ERP form, click '''Customization''' > '''Inspect Element''', and then click the target element on the form. In the '''Element Properties''' dialog box, which opens, find the value of the '''Data Field''' element, which is the native name of the field.

As a result of the export of localized field values, the target field contains a string in JSON format with the available localized values of the field. The language to which the value belongs is identified by the two-letter ISO code of the language. For example, suppose that the '''Description''' element of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form has value ''Item'' in English and ''Pièce'' in French. In this case, the target field contains the following string: {{[{en:Item},{fr:Pièce}]}}.

A workflow is a process of changing the state of an entity as a result of a user performing an action. A workflow action changes the state of an entity. For example, the status of an opportunity can be changed based on the actions a user has performed on the opportunity. For an Acumatica ERP form, a predefined workflow or a custom workflow can be defined in the system. For more information about workflows and workflow actions, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Customization\CG_GL_items_ConfigureActions|To Configure Actions] in the Customization Guide.{br}

To specify the particular state of an entity by using an import or export scenario, you need to use workflow actions in the scenarios. In this topic, you can find information about the use of workflow actions in import and export scenarios.((({S:Warn}Simplified import scenarios cannot use workflow actions.

==Workflow Actions in a Mapping==
To specify a workflow action in a mapping on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_70_25|Export Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM207025|SM207025]) form, you can choose from either of the following approaches:[anchor|#_04239e20-cd63-4c4d-ab88-b00839459e54]
*Select the summary object as the target object (in an import scenario) or the source object (in an export scenario), and specify the action name in the '''Field / Action Name''' column. This is the standard way to call actions in import and export scenarios. For details, see [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__con_Actions_in_Import_Scenarios|Actions in Import Scenarios].
*Select the summary object as the target object (in an import scenario) or the source object (in an export scenario), select the {{<Action: Transition>}} action in the '''Field / Action Name''' column, and specify the type of transition that corresponds to the workflow action in the '''Source Field / Value''' column (for an import scenario) or the '''Target Field / Value''' column (for an export scenario). With this approach, the user can use a formula to specify the type of transition.

==Workflow Actions with Dialog Boxes==
If a workflow action displays a workflow dialog box with the parameters of the action, you can specify these parameters by using the {{Transition Parameters}} object as the target object in an import scenario. The parameters must be specified before the workflow action. The {{Transition Parameters}} object is not available in export scenarios.{br}

For example, to execute the '''Accept''' action on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form for a qualified lead, you would enter the following settings in the two rows on the '''Mapping''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) form. The first row specifies the value in the '''Details''' dialog box, which opens when a user clicks the '''Accept''' action.[anchor|#table_wxf_zrm_js]

In this topic, you can find information about the use     of workflow actions in import and export scenarios. Simplified import scenarios cannot use workflow actions. For details about simplified     import scenarios, see  Simplified Scenarios for Data Import Simplified Scenarios for Data Import. Workflow Actions in a Mapping To specify a workflow action in a mapping on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) Import Scenarios     (SM206025) or   ([~/?ScreenId=SM207025|SM207025]) Export Scenarios (SM207025) form, you can choose from     either of the following approaches: Select the summary object as the target object (in an import scenario) or the source object       (in an export scenario), and specify the action name in the  Field / Action        Name  column. This is the standard way to call actions in import and export       scenarios. For details, see  Actions in Import Scenarios. Select the summary object as the target object (in an import scenario) or the source object       (in an export scenario), select the  <Action: Transition>  action in the         Field / Action Name  column, and specify the type of transition that       corresponds to the workflow action in the  Source Field / Value  column       (for an import scenario) or the  Target Field / Value  column (for an       export scenario). With this approach, the user can use a formula to specify the type of       transition. Workflow Actions with Dialog Boxes If a workflow action displays a workflow dialog box with the parameters of the action, you can     specify these parameters by using the  Transition Parameters  object as the     target object in an import scenario. The parameters must be specified before the workflow     action. The  Transition Parameters  object is not available in export     scenarios. For example, to execute the  Accept  action on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) Leads (CR301000) form for a qualified lead, you would enter the following     settings in the two rows on the  Mapping  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) Import Scenarios (SM206025) form. The first row specifies the value in     the  Details  dialog box, which opens when a user clicks the       Accept  action.

If you need to convert data into a different format during data import or export, you can map an internal field to a formula. You can define formulas by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_70_25|Export Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM207025|SM207025]) form. {br}{TOC}
==Components of a Formula==
A formula can include the following components: [anchor|#ul_glp_qlw_3y]
*'''Digital and text literals''': Literals are constants within the formula that you don&rsquo;t want to be modified: 
**Type digital literals as they are, such as 2, 8.25, or 13.84.
**Enclose text literals within single quotation marks—for example, &rsquo;DEF&#95;CLASS&rsquo; and &rsquo;FOB&rsquo;.
*'''Operators''': The following types of operators are available: 
**Arithmetic operators take numerical values and return a numerical value.
**Logical operators evaluate one or two Boolean expressions and return a Boolean result.
**Comparison operators compare two expressions and return a Boolean value that represents the result.
*'''Functions''': Functions, which perform specific tasks and return results, include the following types: 
**Text functions perform operations on text strings.
**Math functions perform calculations.
**Conversion functions convert data from one type to another.
**Date/time functions perform functions related to the date, the time, or both.
*'''Fields''': External or internal fields (elements) can be used in a formula as operands or function arguments.

==Assigning a Formula==
To assign a formula to a field, do the following on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_70_25|Export Scenarios] form: [anchor|#ol_wkv_ynz_y3]
#Click the pen icon in the field where you want to insert a formula. This invokes the Formula Editor dialog box, which can be used to create the formula you want. See [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM__ref_IS_Formula_Editor_Dialog|Formula Editor Dialog Box] for details on using the dialog box, as well as descriptions of components. 
#:[image:UserGuide/Images/Formula_Editor_panes.png|popup|300px]
#Click any of the types in the Component Types pane (on the upper left of the dialog box) to open the list of related components in the right pane.
#Double-click a component from the list of components. Note that all components are added to the right of the formula text.
#Repeat Steps 2–3 to add all the needed components.
#In the Formula Text pane (at the bottom of the dialog box), manually edit the text to construct a correct formula: Move the function argument or arguments within a function&rsquo;s parentheses, correctly arrange operands and operations, and add any needed brackets to ensure the proper order of operations.
#Click '''Validate''' to check the syntax of the formula and make necessary corrections if required.
#Click '''OK''' to save the formula. 

Once it&rsquo;s inserted, a formula is preceded by an equal sign (=). 
==Formulas in Export Scenarios==
When you map the data in Acumatica ERP to the external fields, you will usually need field-to-field mapping. In some cases, however, you may need to add values from multiple internal fields to export the resulting value to an external one, to extract only a part of the internal field&rsquo;s value, or to perform another transformation or conversion for the data to be exported. {br}

If you map an internal field to a formula instead of an external field, the resulting value will be assigned back to the Acumatica ERP field. This functionality can be used, for example, to set criteria on inquiry forms to export only filtered data or to mark exported records as exported. 
==Formulas in Import Scenarios==
When you map Acumatica ERP fields to the external data, you will usually need field-to-field mapping. For some fields, however, you may need to add values from multiple external fields to an internal one, to extract only a part of the external field&rsquo;s value, or to perform another transformation or conversion. {br}

As you map an Acumatica ERP field to the external data, the system checks the functionality of the mapped field and automatically adds, if necessary, a line that contains the system action (hidden by default) required for the field, such as a refresh of the form or a commit to the database. ((({S:Warn}The formulas that contain locale-specific data are calculated according to the locale specified in the '''Format Locale''' box of the import scenario. If no locale is specified, the default ''English (United States)'' locale is used.
)))
==Formula Examples==
Here are some examples illustrating the use of formulas:
*This formula is used for assigning a literal: {{ClassID ='Imported Vendors'}}. 
*This formula assigns a concatenated string: {{VendorID = 'X'+[VendID]}}. 
*This formula is used for assigning a value to a check box: {{IsAddressSameAsMain = true}}. 
*If the internal field is required, it&rsquo;s important to check that the field value is not blank. To do this, use the <tt>Iif(str, truestatement, falsestatement)</tt> function, as in the following example: {{CountryID =iif(trim[Country]='','US',[Country])}}. Then the internal field will get the <tt>US</tt> value if the external field is blank.
*If the customer IDs from the source cannot be used in your implementation, create new IDs for them. For example, in the demo data, customer and vendor IDs are short versions (up to 15 characters) of their names converted to uppercase. To do this, remove any spaces from the name by using the <tt>trim(arg)</tt> function, convert it to uppercase with the <tt>UCase(arg)</tt> function, and remove any characters in excess of 10 by using the <tt>Left(arg)</tt> function: {{Customer ID =Left( trim(UCase([Name])),10)}}.

Operators are used in formulas that you create on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM__ref_IS_Formula_Editor_Dialog|Formula Editor Dialog Box], which is called from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_70_25|Export Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM207025|SM207025]) forms. {br}

To add operators to the formula, you can enter them directly in the Formula Text pane of the dialog box or select them from the list of formula components available within the dialog box. (Select an operator type to view the list of operators of the type, and then select an operator.) To specify the operands for operators, you can type them in the Formula Text pane or select them from the list of external or internal fields provided within the Formula Editor dialog box. {br}

This article describes and provides examples of the operators you can use in formulas, broken down by operator type. {br}{TOC}
==Overview of Operators==
There are two types of operators: unary and binary. Unary operators are applicable to only one operand, while binary operators require two operands. {br}

In general, expressions are evaluated from left to right with the following order of precedence: 
*Logical Operators: <tt>Not</tt>, <tt>And</tt>, <tt>Or</tt>
*Comparison Operators: =, &lt;&gt;, , &lt;=, &gt;=
*Arithmetic Operators: -, &#42;, /, <tt>Mod</tt>, +, -

==Arithmetic Operators==
Arithmetic operators, which are listed below, take numerical values as their operands and return a single numerical value. 
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="20%" ! Operator
!width="80%" ! Description and Example
|- 
| '''+'''
| 
Adds the two operands and returns the result. If at least one operand is a string, this operator returns a concatenated string. {br}

'''Example:'''{{=[Amount]+[Tax Amount]}}{br}

In this example, the {{[Amount]}} and {{[Tax Amount]}} values are used as operands.
|- 
| '''-'''
| 
 Subtracts the second operand from the first. {br}

'''Example:'''{{=[Amount]-[Cash Discount]}}{br}

In this example, the {{[Amount]}} and {{[Cash Discount]}} values act as operands.
|- 
| '''&#42;'''
| 
 Multiplies the two operands. {br}

'''Example:'''{{=[Chargeable Amount]*0.03}}{br}

In this example, the {{[Chargeable Amount]}} value and the number 0.03 serve as operands.
|- 
| '''/'''
| 
Yields the quotient of the operands, which is the first operand divided by the second. {br}

'''Example:'''{{=[Amount]/[Rate Reciprocal]}}{br}

In this example, the {{[Amount]}} and {{[Rate Reciprocal]}} values are the first and second operands.
|- 
| '''Mod (Modulus)'''
| 
Divides the first integer operand by the second integer operand and returns the remainder, rounded to the nearest integer. {br}

'''Example:'''{{=[Volume] Mod [Conversion Factor]}}{br}

In this example, the {{[Volume]}} and {{[Conversion Factor]}} values are used as operands.
|}
==Logical operators==
Logical operators evaluate one or two Boolean expressions and return a Boolean result (<tt>True</tt> or <tt>False</tt>). Because these operators evaluate only Boolean expressions, you must use elements whose only values are <tt>True</tt> and <tt>False</tt> (typically check boxes and radio buttons). The logical operators are listed below. 
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="20%" ! Operator
!width="80%" ! Description and Example
|- 
| '''And'''
| 
Performs logical conjunction on two Boolean expressions: returns <tt>True</tt> if and only if both expressions evaluate to <tt>True</tt>; in other cases, returns <tt>False</tt>. {br}

'''Example:'''{{=[Hold] And [Validate Control Totals on Entry]}}{br}

In this example, the {{[Hold]}} and {{[Validate Control Totals on Entry]}} check boxes are used as operands.
|- 
| '''Or'''
| 
Performs logical disjunction on two Boolean expressions: returns <tt>True</tt> if at least one expression evaluates to <tt>True</tt>; returns <tt>False</tt> if neither expression evaluates to ''True''. {br}

'''Example:'''{{=[Hold] Or [Validate Control Totals on Entry]}} In this example, the {{[Hold]}} and {{[Validate Control Totals on Entry]}} check boxes act as operands.
|- 
| '''Not'''
| 
Performs logical negation on a Boolean expression: returns <tt>True</tt> if and only if the operand is <tt>False</tt>. Logical negation is an unary operator. {br}

'''Example:'''{{=Not [Hold Documents on Entry]}}{br}

In this example, the {{[Hold Documents on Entry]}} check box is used as the single operand.
|}
==Comparison Operators==
Comparison operators compare two expressions and return a Boolean value (<tt>True</tt> or <tt>False</tt>) that represents the result of the comparison. This group of operators includes the following operators. 
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="20%" ! Operator
!width="80%" ! Description and Example
|- 
| '''='''
| 
Returns <tt>True</tt> if operands are equal. {br}

'''Example:'''{{=([Credit Total] = [Control Total])}}{br}

In this example, the {{[Credit Total]}} and {{[Control Total]}} values are used as operands.
|- 
| '''&lt;&gt;'''
| 
Returns <tt>True</tt> if operands are not equal. {br}

'''Example:'''{{=([Credit Total] <> [Debit Total])}}{br}

In this example, the {{[Credit Total]}} and {{[Debit Total]}} values act as operands.
|- 
| '''&lt;'''
| 
Returns <tt>True</tt> if the first operand is less than the second one. {br}

'''Example:'''{{=([DocDate] < [DueDate])}}{br}

In this example, the {{[DocDate]}} and {{[DueDate]}} values act as operands.
|- 
| '''&gt;'''
| 
Returns <tt>True</tt> if the first operand is greater than the second one. {br}

'''Example:'''{{=([CrLmt] > 1000])}}{br}

In this example, the {{[CrLmt]}} value is used as the first operand, and the number 1000 acts as the second operand.
|- 
| '''&lt;='''
| 
Returns <tt>True</tt> if the first operand is less than or equal to the second operand. {br}

'''Example:'''{{=(([DueDate]-[CashDiscountDate]) <= [LeadTime])}}{br}

In this example, {{[DueDate] - [CashDiscountDate]}} is the first operand, and the {{[LeadTime]}} value is used as the second operand.
|- 
| '''&gt;='''
| 
Returns <tt>True</tt> if the first operand is greater than or equal to the second operand. {br}

'''Example:'''{{=([Balance] => [Amount])}}{br}

In this example, the {{[Balance]}} and {{[Amount]}} values are used as operands.
|}
==Other Operators==
This miscellaneous group of operators includes the following operators and constants. 
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="20%" ! Operator
!width="80%" ! Description and Example
|- 
| '''In'''
| 
An operator that returns <tt>True</tt> if the second operand (a string) contains the first operand (which is also a string). {br}

'''Example:'''{{=('Inc.' In [Vendor Name])}}{br}

In this example, the {{[Vendor Name]}} value is used as an operand, and the formula returns <tt>True</tt> if the name of the vendor contains Inc. 
|- 
| '''True'''
| 
A binary constant used as an operand in logical expressions. {br}

'''Example:'''{{=True}}
|- 
| '''False'''
| 
A binary constant used as an operand in logical expressions. {br}

'''Example:'''{{=False}}
|- 
| '''Null'''
| 
A special value used as an operand in logical expressions; designates an undefined value. {br}

'''Example:'''{{=Null}}
|}

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Functions Functions are used in formulas that you create on the  Formula Editor Dialog Box, which you can 				invoke from the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) Import Scenarios (SM206025) and 					  ([~/?ScreenId=SM207025|SM207025]) Export Scenarios (SM207025) forms.  To add functions to a formula, you can type them in the Formula Text pane of the 				dialog box or select them from the list of formula components available within the 				dialog box. (Select a function type to view the list of functions of the type, and 				then select a function.)  This topic describes and provides examples of the functions you can use in formulas, 				broken down by type.  Conversion Functions The available conversion functions, which are used to convert data from one data type 				to another, are listed below.  Function Description and Example CBool(x) Converts the expression used as the function argument into a 									Boolean expression. Returns  False  if the Boolean value 									is zero; otherwise, returns  True . Example:  =CBool([CashDiscountAmount] Here  [CashDiscountAmount]  is used as the 									function argument. CDate(x) Converts the expression used as the function argument into a 									value of the  Date  type. The argument should be a valid 									date expression according to the locale selected for the import 									or export scenario. Example:  =CDate('24/12/2011') Here a string is used as the function argument. CStr(x) Converts the expression used as the function argument into a 									string. If the argument is  Null , the function returns a 									run-time error; otherwise, it returns a string. Example:  ='(' 										+CStr([AreaCode])+')'+CStr([Phone]) Here  [AreaCode]  and  [Phone]  are 									used in the function argument. CDbl(x) Converts the expression defined in the function argument into a 									value of the  Double  type. Example:  =CDbl(1.0/[ExchangeRate]) Here  [ExchangeRate]  is used in the function 									argument. CSng(x) Converts the expression used as the function argument into a 									value of the  Single  type. If the expression has 									a value outside the acceptable range for the 										 Single  type, this function returns an 									error. Example:  =CSng([CashDiscountAmount]/[DocAmount]) Here  [CashDiscountAmount]  and 										 [DocAmount]  are used in the function 									argument. CDec(x) Converts the expression used as the function argument into a 									value of the  Decimal  type. Example:  =CDec([DocAmount]*0.015) Here  [DocAmount]  is used in the function 									argument. CInt(x) Converts the expression used as the function argument into a 									value of the  Integer  type. Example:  =CInt('2012')-Year([DocDate]) Here  [DocDate]  is used in the function argument. 								 CShort(x) Converts a numeric value to a value of the  Short  									type. Example:  =CShort([CashDiscountAmount]) Here  [CashDiscountAmount]  is used as the 									function argument. CLong(x) Converts a numeric value to a value of the  Long  									type. Example:  =CLong([CashDiscountAmount]) Here  [CashDiscountAmount]  is used as the 									function argument. Text Functions Text functions are used to perform operations on text strings. The group of text 				functions includes the functions described below.

Example:  =LTrim(CStr([Phone])) Here  [Phone]  is used as the function argument. RTrim(string) Removes all trailing spaces or parsing characters from the 									specified character expression, or all trailing zero (0) bytes 									from the specified binary expression. Example:  =RTrim(CStr([AreaCode])) Here  [AreaCode]  is used as the function argument. Trim(string) Removes all leading and trailing spaces or parsing characters 									from the specified character expression, or all trailing zero 									(0) bytes from the specified binary expression. Example:  =Iif(Trim([Country]) Here  [Country]  is used in the function argument. Format(format, argument(s)) Replaces the format item in a specified formatting string 										( format ) with the text equivalent of the arguments 										( arguments ). Example:  =Format('Currency: . . . . . . . . {0:C}; Account: . . . . . . . . 										{1:N}', [Currency], [AccountBalance]) Here  [Currency]  and  [AccountBalance]  are used in the 									function argument; 0 and 1 are the specifiers indicating where 									the arguments will be inserted,  C  is the  currency  									format specifier, and  N  is the  number  format 									specifier. UCase(string) Returns a string that has been converted to uppercase. The 										 string  argument can be any valid string expression. 									If  string  contains  Null ,  Null  is 									returned. Example:  =UCase([CustomerName])  Here  [CustomerName]  is used as the function argument. LCase(string) Returns a string that has been converted to lowercase. The 										 string  argument can be any valid string expression. 									If  string  contains  Null ,  Null  is 									returned. Example:  =LCase(CStr([CustomerID]) Here  [CustomerID]  is used in the function argument. InStr(string, findString) Returns the position of the first occurrence of one string 										( findString ) within another ( string ). Example:  =InStr([CustomerName], 'Inc') Here  [CustomerName]  is used in the function argument. InStrRev(string, findString) Returns the position of the last occurrence of one string 										( findString ) within another ( string ). Example:  =InStrRev([CustomerName], 'Inc') Here  [CustomerName]  is used in the function argument. Len(string) Returns an integer containing either the number of characters in 									the string or the nominal number of bytes required to store a 									variable.  Example:  =Len([CustomerName]) Here  [CustomerName]  is used as the function argument.

PadLeft(string, width, paddingChar) Right-aligns the characters in a specified string 									( string ), padding with the specified character 										( paddingChar ) on the left up to the specified total 									width ( width ). If the actual length of the  string  									is less than the specified  width , returns the original 									string. Example:  =PadLeft(CStr(Phone), 12, '_') Here  [Phone]  is used in the function argument. If the actual length of 									the  string  is less than the specified  width , 									returns the original string. PadRight(string, width, paddingChar) Left-aligns the characters in a specified string ( string ), 									padding with the specified character ( paddingChar ) on the 									right up to the specified total width ( width ). Example:  =PadRight(CStr([City]), 25, '_') Here  [City]  is used in the function argument.

The data to be imported to Acumatica ERP or exported from Acumatica ERP may contain values that cannot be inserted into the database of Acumatica ERP or the external system as they are. These values require a simple modification before they can be inserted into the respective database. For example, suppose that the data for import contains country codes that are different from the country codes registered in Acumatica ERP. The country codes in the data must be replaced with the country codes registered in Acumatica ERP before the data import.{br}

To handle such data, you define substitution lists, which consist of pairs of source values and their corresponding substitution values, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_26|Substitution Lists] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206026|SM206026]) form. You then use these substitution lists in formulas in the mappings of import or export scenarios on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_70_25|Export Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM207025|SM207025]) form, respectively.
==To Substitute Values by Using a Formula==[anchor|#_c504d1d1-2438-4b41-bf5a-ba602a55a121]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_70_25|Export Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM207025|SM207025]) form, select a scenario in which you want to substitute values.
#On the table toolbar of the '''Mapping''' tab, click '''Substitution Lists'''.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_26|Substitution Lists] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206026|SM206026]) form, which opens, do the following:
##In the '''Substitution List''' box, type the name of the list, such as <tt>Countries for import</tt>.
##On the table toolbar, click '''Add Row'''.
##For each value that you want to replace with a new value, do the following:
###In the '''Original Value''' box, type the value that you want to replace in the data prepared for import or export.
###In the '''Substitution Value''' box, type the value that will replace the value specified in the '''Original Value''' box.
###:For example, the country code of the United States of America in Acumatica ERP is US. Suppose that in the data that you want to import to Acumatica ERP, the United States code is USA. In this case, you will type <tt>USA</tt> in '''Original Value''' column and <tt>US</tt> in '''Substitution Value''' column.
##On the form toolbar, click '''Save & Close'''.

The [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM__ref_IS_Formula_Editor_Dialog|Formula Editor Dialog Box] opens.
#In the dialog box, do the following:
##Click ''Other'' in the ''Functions'' node, and double-click one of the following items in the list of available functions: 
##*''SubstituteListed (sourceField, substitutionList)'': The function replaces the values of the {{sourceField}} field with the values from the {{substitutionList}} substitution list if a substitution value is defined for a particular value of the field.
##*''SubstituteAll (sourceField, substitutionList)'': The function replaces all values of the {{sourceField}} field with the values from the {{substitutionList}} substitution list. If no substitution value is defined for a particular value of the field, the system displays an error.The function is added to the Formula Text pane of the dialog box.
##Modify the function as follows:
###Replace ''sourceField'' with the name of the field whose value you want to replace. You can search for the needed field in ''Fields &gt; External'' if you are configuring the mapping for an import scenario, or in ''Fields &gt; Internal'' if you are configuring the mapping for an export scenario.
###Replace ''substitutionList'' with the name of the substitution list that you have created in Step 3 above. You can search for the name of the needed substitution list in ''Substitution Lists'' in the Formula Editor.
##Click '''OK'''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save''' to save your changes to the scenario mapping.

During the data import or the preparation of the data for export, the system will search for the original values from the substitution list and replace them with the corresponding substitution values according to the formula.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[To Substitute Values During Data Import or Data Export The data to be imported to  Acumatica ERP or exported from  Acumatica ERP may contain values that cannot be inserted into the database of  Acumatica ERP or the external system as they are. These values require a simple modification                 before they can be inserted into the respective database. For example, suppose that                 the data for import contains country codes that are different from the country codes                 registered in  Acumatica ERP. The country codes in the data must be replaced with the country codes registered                 in  Acumatica ERP before the data import. To handle such data, you define substitution lists, which consist of pairs of source                 values and their corresponding substitution values, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM206026|SM206026]) Substitution Lists (SM206026) form. You then use these                 substitution lists in formulas in the mappings of import or export scenarios on the                       ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) Import Scenarios (SM206025) or   ([~/?ScreenId=SM207025|SM207025]) Export Scenarios (SM207025) form, respectively. To Substitute Values by Using a Formula On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) Import Scenarios (SM206025) or   ([~/?ScreenId=SM207025|SM207025]) Export Scenarios (SM207025) form, select a scenario in                     which you want to substitute values. On the table toolbar of the  Mapping  tab, click                          Substitution Lists . On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM206026|SM206026]) Substitution Lists (SM206026) form, which                     opens, do the following: In the  Substitution List  box, type the name of                             the list, such as  Countries for import . On the table toolbar, click  Add Row . For each value that you want to replace with a new value, do the                                 following: In the  Original Value  box, type the value                                     that you want to replace in the data prepared for import or                                     export. In the  Substitution Value  box, type the                                     value that will replace the value specified in the                                          Original Value  box. For example,                                         the country code of the United States of America in  Acumatica ERP is US. Suppose that in the data that you want to import                                         to  Acumatica ERP, the United States code is USA. In this case, you will                                         type  USA  in  Original                                             Value  column and  US                                          in  Substitution Value                                      column. On the form toolbar, click  Save & Close . On the  Mapping  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) Import Scenarios or   ([~/?ScreenId=SM207025|SM207025]) Export Scenarios form, double-click the                          Source Field/Value  (for an import scenario) or                          Field/Action Name  (for an export scenario) column in                     the row for which you want to substitute values and click the Edit button. The                          Formula Editor Dialog Box                     opens. In the dialog box, do the following: Click  Other  in the  Functions  node, and double-click one of                             the following items in the list of available functions:  SubstituteListed (sourceField, substitutionList) : The                                     function replaces the values of the  sourceField                                      field with the values from the  substitutionList                                      substitution list if a substitution value is defined for a                                     particular value of the field. SubstituteAll (sourceField, substitutionList) : The                                     function replaces all values of the  sourceField                                      field with the values from the  substitutionList                                      substitution list. If no substitution value is defined for a                                     particular value of the field, the system displays an                                     error.

After you have created an import scenario, you should test it on one record. If the scenario is not working as you expected, the first way to troubleshoot the scenario is to reproduce the mapping instructions manually on the form to which you want to import the data. In most cases, this troubleshooting step helps you quickly identify the reason the scenario is not working, so that you can fix the scenario and continue.{br}

After you have tested an import scenario, you can use it to import data on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_36|Import by Scenario] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206036|SM206036]) form. To import external data to Acumatica ERP by using a scenario that has already been created, you should perform the steps that are described in this topic.{br}{TOC}[anchor|#section_gq4_lnl_2s]
==1. Selecting an Import Scenario==On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_36|Import by Scenario] form, you first select the name of the scenario that has been created for data import. ((({S:Warn}You can select a scenario from only the scenarios that work with forms on which you can enter data. If you do not have the access rights to enter data on a particular form, you cannot use a scenario that imports data to this form either. If you do not have access rights to a particular form, you will not see any scenarios for this form listed among the other scenarios. You can view the access rights to particular forms on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_20|Access Rights by Screen] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201020|SM201020]) form.
)))[anchor|#section_dbx_lnl_2s]
==2. Uploading a New File Version==
If you are not using a file for importing data, skip this step.{br}

If you are importing data from a file, decide whether you need to upload a new version of the file. The file that is used for data import is attached to the form; you can click '''Files''' on the title bar to view the file. This file is attached to each of the following forms: [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_15|Data Providers] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206015|SM206015]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]), and [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_36|Import by Scenario] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206036|SM206036]).{br}

If you need to use a new version of the file when importing data, you can upload the new file to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_36|Import by Scenario] form by clicking '''Upload File Version''' on the form toolbar. The schema of the uploaded file must match the schema defined in the data provider and used in the import scenario. If you have changed the file structure, you have to update the data provider and the import scenario; only then can you use the new file to import the data.((({S:Warn}If there is no file attached to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_36|Import by Scenario] form, you have to upload the file either by dragging the file to the form or by using the '''Files''' menu. Do not use the '''Upload File Version''' button to upload the file. After the file is uploaded to the form, you can update the version of the file by clicking '''Upload File Version'''.
)))[anchor|#section_vkh_mnl_2s]
==3. Preparing the Data for Import==
You prepare records by uploading them on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_36|Import by Scenario] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206036|SM206036]) form. To prepare the data for import, you click the '''Prepare''' button on the form toolbar. The data is displayed on the '''Prepared Data''' tab; no data is yet imported into the system.[anchor|#section_yqq_mnl_2s]
==4. Importing the Prepared Data==
To import data to the system, you click the '''Import''' button on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_36|Import by Scenario] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206036|SM206036]) form. The system tries to import the records with the '''Active''' check box selected one by one. After a record has been successfully processed, the system selects the '''Processed''' check box for this record. If an error occurs during the processing of a record, the process stops on the record that caused the error.[anchor|#section_w2y_mnl_2s]
==5. Correcting Any Errors==
If an error has occurred during the import process, you have to review the error. You then do one of the following: correct the record that caused the error, exclude the problematic record from import, or modify the import scenario. Then you have to run the import process again to process the remaining records. {br}

You can correct the records directly on the '''Prepare Data''' tab. If you need to replace the values of particular fields with other values, you can click the '''Replace''' button on the form toolbar of the '''Prepared Data''' tab and specify the replacement value in the dialog box that opens. You can exclude any incorrect record by clearing the '''Active''' check box for it. After you have made all needed corrections, on the form toolbar, you click '''Save''' and click '''Import''' again.{br}

If you need to correct a large number of records or all records and it is too difficult to make these modifications on the '''Prepare Data''' tab, you can correct the records in the source, upload a new file version if you are importing data from a file, and prepare and import the data again.{br}

If you need to correct the import scenario itself, make changes to the scenario on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) form, and prepare and import the data again on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_36|Import by Scenario] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206036|SM206036]) form. You can clear both the prepared data and the history of scenario execution by clicking '''Clear Data''' on toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_36|Import by Scenario] form. The '''Clear Data''' action doesn&rsquo;t reverse records that have already been imported.
==Summary of Data Import==After you have imported data, open the destination form and make sure that the imported records appear among the records. 
The following diagram shows the process of importing records to Acumatica ERP by using an import scenario.[anchor|#fig_ksc_tkl_2s][anchor|#image_pcc_vkl_2s][image:UserGuide/Images/IS_Import_ImportProcess.png|popup|Data import process|450px]

With simplified scenarios, you skip the step of creating the data provider before you create the import scenario. You compose the mapping directly on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_36|Import by Scenario] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206036|SM206036]) form and then you immediately run the import procedure on the form. {br}

Simplified scenarios are appropriate for one-time import, such as during data migration. For data migration, you can prepare all data in the source file in the format needed for import and use a straightforward mapping of the source fields to the target fields. If you need to compose a complex scenario—which might involve using custom keys, searching for records, and modifying service commands—you have to use regular import scenarios that you compose by creating the data provider and then defining the mapping on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) form.{br}

To import data by using a simplified scenario, you have to complete the following steps:[anchor|#ol_bth_gfv_fs]
#'''Upload the file'''
#:You first upload the file with data that you want to import to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_36|Import by Scenario] form. You can upload an Excel, CSV, or XML file. The following criteria should be met for the source files for a simplified scenario:[anchor|#ul_xsg_zd1_3s]

#*A CSV file should use a comma (,) as the delimiter and have US-ASCII encoding. These default parameters are used for data provider creation.
#*An XML file should have US-ASCII encoding and a tree structure. These default parameters are used for data provider creation.
#'''Specify the parameters of the import scenario'''
#:Also on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_36|Import by Scenario] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206036|SM206036]) form, you specify the Acumatica ERP form to which you want to import data. The system suggests the scenario name depending on the selected form, but you can change the name. The system automatically detects the type of the data provider based on the extension of the uploaded file. When you click '''Save''', the system automatically creates an import scenario (with default parameters and the specified name) and a data provider of the specified type for the simplified import procedure.
#'''Configure mapping'''
#:You configure mapping between the fields of the external file and the fields of the Acumatica ERP form on the '''Mapping''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_36|Import by Scenario] form. You should select the source field and the corresponding target object and field. You use the same target objects and fields that are used in regular import scenarios that you create on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) form. However, in simplified scenarios, you cannot use service commands and actions. 
#:You should select the '''Key''' check box for the fields that should be used as key fields to distinguish records that belong to different documents. You can use as keys only the fields that are mapped to the fields of the summary object.
#:You can map the fields of the source file in any order. After you have saved the mapping, the system places the fields in the correct order and creates the import scenario mapping. The system adds all actions (including {{<Action: Save>}}) and service commands to the import scenario automatically.
#'''Prepare and import data'''
#:After you have specified the scenario mapping, you can prepare and import data in the same way as you do with regular import scenarios.

Simplified scenarios are not available for editing on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) form, and you cannot edit the data provider that was automatically created for the simplified import scenario. If the simplified scenario is not working, you should convert the simplified scenario to a regular scenario by clicking '''Convert to Manual Scenario''' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_36|Import by Scenario] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206036|SM206036]) form.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Simplified Scenarios for Data Import With simplified scenarios, you skip the step of creating the data provider before you         create the import scenario. You compose the mapping directly on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM206036|SM206036]) Import by Scenario (SM206036) form and then you immediately run the         import procedure on the form.  Simplified scenarios are appropriate for one-time import, such as during data migration.         For data migration, you can prepare all data in the source file in the format needed for         import and use a straightforward mapping of the source fields to the target fields. If you         need to compose a complex scenario—which might involve using custom keys, searching         for records, and modifying service commands—you have to use regular import scenarios         that you compose by creating the data provider and then defining the mapping on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) Import Scenarios (SM206025) form. To import data by using a simplified scenario, you have to complete the following steps: Upload the file You first upload the file with data that you want to import               to the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM206036|SM206036]) Import by Scenario form. You can upload an Excel,               CSV, or XML file. The following criteria should be met for the source files for a               simplified scenario: Only the data from the first sheet of an Excel file is imported. A CSV file should use a comma (,) as the delimiter and have US-ASCII encoding.                   These default parameters are used for data provider creation. An XML file should have US-ASCII encoding and a tree structure. These default                   parameters are used for data provider creation. Specify the parameters of the import scenario Also on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM206036|SM206036]) Import by Scenario (SM206036) form, you specify the  Acumatica ERP form to which you want to import data. The system suggests the scenario name               depending on the selected form, but you can change the name. The system automatically               detects the type of the data provider based on the extension of the uploaded file.               When you click  Save , the system automatically creates an import               scenario (with default parameters and the specified name) and a data provider of the               specified type for the simplified import procedure. Configure mapping You configure mapping between the fields of the external               file and the fields of the  Acumatica ERP form on the  Mapping  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM206036|SM206036]) Import by Scenario form. You should select the source field and the corresponding               target object and field. You use the same target objects and fields that are used in               regular import scenarios that you create on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) Import Scenarios               (SM206025) form. However, in simplified scenarios, you cannot use service commands and               actions.  You should select the  Key  check box for the               fields that should be used as key fields to distinguish records that belong to               different documents. You can use as keys only the fields that are mapped to the fields               of the summary object. You can map the fields of the source file in any order.

You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_70_36|Export by Scenario] ([~/?ScreenId=SM207036|SM207036]) form for data export. To export data from Acumatica ERP to an external source, you perform the steps, which are described in this topic.{br}{TOC}[anchor|#_ef359124-17a3-41ae-bc2a-9237c8869f0b]
==1. Select an Export Scenario==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_70_36|Export by Scenario] form, you select the name of the scenario created for data export.[anchor|#_f65a743b-8e81-429a-92fe-fbaac7085ebd]
==2. Prepare the Data for Export==
You prepare records by uploading them on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_70_36|Export by Scenario] form. The system performs all modifications defined by the scenario and uploads the modified data on the form. To prepare the data for export, you click the '''Prepare''' button on the form toolbar. You can view the data on the '''Prepared Data''' tab of this form.[anchor|#_4469282d-55b4-41cd-b4e5-d91e396dbfc7]
==3. Export Prepared Data==
To run the export process, you should click '''Export''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_70_36|Export by Scenario] form. The system tries to export the records that have the '''Active''' check box selected.[anchor|#_ca661bef-445a-4bf4-ad6e-f17df804a47d]((({S:Warn}The characters that are forbidden in XML are omitted during the data export to XML files.
)))[anchor|#_00300856-986c-487a-8d3d-49f65086c545]
==4. Correct Any Errors==
Make sure each record has the check box in the '''Processed''' column on the '''Prepared Data''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_70_36|Export by Scenario] form selected, which means that this record has been successfully exported. The result of export may include errors, which are indicated by the icon on the form toolbar.[anchor|#_2ae47bc7-0397-4f5b-a3f2-53d782eed86c]
==5. Download the Results of the Export==
If you are exporting data to a file, during export, the system creates a new version of the file attached to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_70_36|Export by Scenario] form. This file has the same structure as the file that was used for data provider creation. You can download the result of export by clicking the '''Get Latest Version''' button on the form toolbar.{br}

Internal data is exported to the external data source in a table form. That means that the values of the fields of detail objects are translated to multiple rows of this table. The number of rows is equal to the number of detail lines of the source record. Each of these rows has the values of the fields of the summary object and related objects specified. {br}

For example, suppose that on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form, an AR invoice has three detail lines. If you export this AR invoice with the detail lines, the data prepared for export will include three records for this invoice—one record for each detail line. These records will include identical values of the fields of the invoice summary, such as type and reference number, and different values of the detail line fields.

When you are importing or exporting a large number of records by using an import scenario, data processing can take a rather long time. You can use the ways described in this topic to speed up the processing of import and export scenarios.{br}{TOC}
==Parallel Processing of Import Scenarios==
In Acumatica ERP, data import by using an import scenario can be sped up if you turn on parallel execution of the scenario. The parallel processing of an import scenario by the system can be especially useful for data migration during the initial implementation of the system.{br}

To turn on parallel processing of an import scenario, you select the '''Parallel Processing''' check box in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) form.{br}

If parallel processing is turned on for an import scenario, during the execution of the scenario, the system divides the whole list of records to process into batches of records. The lines of a particular document (that is, the records that have the same key fields specified) are always included in the same batch. The system executes the import scenario for these batches in parallel threads.((({S:Warn}The '''Break on Error''' and '''Break on Incorrect Target''' check boxes become unavailable if the '''Parallel Processing''' check box is selected.
)))
==Removal of Unnecessary Commits in Import Scenarios==
When the system imports records to Acumatica ERP, it performs a commit to the server for all fields with the '''Commit''' check box selected on the '''Mapping''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_25|Import Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206025|SM206025]) form; these commits take excessive server time. When you create the mapping of an import scenario, the system selects the '''Commit''' check box automatically for the key fields and the fields other fields depend on.{br}

To optimize the performance of an import scenario, you can clear the '''Commit''' check box for some of these fields. You can perform the following steps when you are optimizing the performance of an import scenario by removing unnecessary commits:[anchor|#_d14a1d74-53a7-4309-b51f-ba8d33b09a12]
#Create an import scenario in which you leave the default settings for the '''Commit''' check box for all fields. Test the scenario, make sure it works correctly, and note the processing time. If you need to decrease the time, proceed with the next step.
#Try to clear the '''Commit''' check box for each appropriate field of the scenario (using the following guidelines), one by one, testing the scenario after each change and reviewing the processing time. However, do not clear the '''Commit''' check box for any of the following fields:
#*Key fields: For example, '''Type''' and '''Reference Nbr.''' fields are key fields on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form.
#*The last field of a detail line: For example, suppose that you are importing the values of the '''Transaction Descr.''', '''Ext. Price''', '''Account''', and '''Subaccount''' columns on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form. You should not clear the '''Commit''' check box for the '''Subaccount''' field, because it is the last field in the row that you specify.
#*The '''Value''' field of an attribute. 
#*All fields whose values must be entered to make certain elements available: For example, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, you have to specify the value of the '''Vendor''' element to make the '''Add Row''' button on the toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab available.
#:You can clear the '''Commit''' check box for the fields that cause other fields on the form to be updated; in this case, the system will perform an update of these fields when it saves the imported record.

==Ways to Speed Export Scenarios==
To speed data export, you can perform the following steps, which are listed in the order in which we recommend you try them:[anchor|#_55ba96b4-6c6d-4402-a196-f5fb90dfe558]
#On the '''Mapping''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_70_25|Export Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM207025|SM207025]) form for the export scenario, make sure the '''Commit''' check box is selected for the minimum number of fields. 
#:The '''Commit''' check box must be selected for the key fields that specify the records that should be exported (for example, the key fields that are mapped to the {{=Every}} instruction) and for the fields that you modify during export. In some other situations, the system selects the '''Commit''' check box automatically (for example, for the {{<Dialog Answer>}} command); leave these check boxes selected. For fields whose values you do not need to modify during the export, you do not need to select the '''Commit''' check box. 
#Remove the {{=Every}} instruction from the mapping of the export scenario if this scenario satisfies all of the following requirements:
#*You are exporting summary data and data from the related objects, and you are not exporting data from detail objects.
#*You are not modifying the values of any fields during data export.
#*You are not applying actions to the records during data export.
#:If you remove the {{=Every}} instruction from the scenario, during data export, the system generates a generic inquiry internally that retrieves the data being exported from the system in one request instead of retrieving information for each record one by one, which significantly increases the speed of data export.
#Configure a generic inquiry that retrieves the data that you need to export, create a scenario that exports data from this generic inquiry, and export data by using this scenario. 
#:((({S:Warn}You can find information on how to create a generic inquiry in the  training course.

All fields whose values must be entered to make certain elements                                     available: For example, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form, you                                     have to specify the value of the  Vendor                                      element to make the  Add Row  button on the                                     toolbar of the  Document Details  tab                                     available. You can clear the  Commit  check box for                                 the fields that cause other fields on the form to be updated; in                                 this case, the system will perform an update of these fields when it                                 saves the imported record. Ways to Speed Export Scenarios To speed data export, you can perform the following steps, which are listed in                     the order in which we recommend you try them: On the  Mapping  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM207025|SM207025]) Export Scenarios (SM207025) form for the                             export scenario, make sure the  Commit  check box                             is selected for the minimum number of fields.  The                                      Commit  check box must be selected for the                                 key fields that specify the records that should be exported (for                                 example, the key fields that are mapped to the                                      =Every  instruction) and for the fields that you                                 modify during export. In some other situations, the system selects                                 the  Commit  check box automatically (for                                 example, for the  <Dialog Answer>  command); leave                                 these check boxes selected. For fields whose values you do not need                                 to modify during the export, you do not need to select the                                      Commit  check box.  Remove the  =Every  instruction from the mapping of the                             export scenario if this scenario satisfies all of the following                                 requirements: You are exporting summary data and data from the related                                     objects, and you are not exporting data from detail                                     objects. You are not modifying the values of any fields during data                                     export. You are not applying actions to the records during data                                     export. If you remove the  =Every  instruction from the                                 scenario, during data export, the system generates a generic inquiry                                 internally that retrieves the data being exported from the system in                                 one request instead of retrieving information for each record one by                                 one, which significantly increases the speed of data                             export. Configure a generic inquiry that retrieves the data that you need to                             export, create a scenario that exports data from this generic inquiry,                             and export data by using this scenario.  You can find information                                 on how to create a generic inquiry in the   training course.  ]]></column>

The synchronization solution provided by Acumatica is designed for companies that use Salesforce as their primary CRM system and Acumatica ERP as their primary ERP system. In most cases, a company can use this solution as follows:[anchor|#ul_vtp_jtw_mbb]
*All marketing and sales operations are managed through the CRM system, which is the source system for customer and partner accounts, contacts, and sales opportunities.
*Distribution and financial operations are managed through the ERP system, which is the source system for inventory items and their prices.
*The data of customer and partner accounts and contacts can be modified or new business accounts and contacts can be created in either of these systems.

==Typical Solution==
The use of CRM and ERP systems described above could be supported by one of the many integration solutions available on the market as long as it meets the following requirements:[anchor|#ul_gqr_dvw_mbb]
*It should track changes in both involved systems.
*It should control the synchronization process.
*It should reflect changes in both systems by using an API.
*It should allow the resolution of conflicts and recovery from connectivity failures.

However, this solution would be expensive, and a small or medium-sized business may not be able to afford it.
== Acumatica Solution==
The synchronization solution implemented in Acumatica ERP has been designed to meet the following criteria:[anchor|#ul_o2s_ycw_mbb]
*The users should be able to continue using Salesforce as a CRM system.
*The synchronization process should be performed as close to real time as possible. Ideally, a change introduced in one system should be immediately reflected in the other system.
*CRM-related data that originates in Salesforce should be available for various financial operations in Acumatica ERP.
*CRM-related data that originates in Acumatica ERP should be available for sales and marketing operations managed in Salesforce.
*The effort required for the development and administration of Salesforce at the client sites should be minimal because many Acumatica partners and customers do not know how to configure and administer Salesforce or how to develop and deploy code for it.

Because Acumatica ERP provides built-in integration scenarios and a data provider that has been configured to work with basic installations of Acumatica ERP and Salesforce, you can quickly configure the integration of these systems. Immediately after configuration, you can start synchronizing the data between the two products.{br}

However, an Acumatica ERP administrator may need to additionally configure the built-in integration scenarios and modify the mapping rules between Salesforce object data fields and Acumatica ERP data fields of Acumatica ERP entities. The synchronization solution uses this map to convert data from the format recognized by one system to the format recognized by the other system.{br}

In Salesforce, an administrator should configure authentication and create the custom fields that are required to maintain data synchronization.{br}

For details on the configuration process, see [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__con_Configuration_of_Integration|Quick Configuration Steps].
==Salesforce Sync Data Provider==
 Acumatica ERP uses the ''Salesforce Sync'' data provider in the following cases:[anchor|#ul_wjj_dtd_3db]
*For real-time synchronization of data between Acumatica ERP and Salesforce. Data related to an entity listed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SF_20_50_20|Salesforce Sync] ([~/?ScreenId=SF205020|SF205020]) form can be synchronized between the systems in real time. Synchronization of this type does not depend on the '''Sync Type''' setting of the involved integration scenario.
*For synchronization of data through integration scenarios. Data related to an entity that is not listed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SF_20_50_20|Salesforce Sync] ([~/?ScreenId=SF205020|SF205020]) form can be synchronized between the systems through an integration scenario that uses the ''Salesforce Sync'' data provider.

In the case of synchronization through an integration scenario, a proper type of synchronization should be selected for the integration scenario in the '''Sync Type''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_36|Import by Scenario] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206036|SM206036]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_70_36|Export by Scenario] ([~/?ScreenId=SM207036|SM207036]) form; the following options are available:[anchor|#ul_rrc_3sd_3db]
*''Full'' (default): Any record for which a matching record has been found in the other system becomes updated accordingly. Any record without a match is deleted.
*''Incremental - All Records'': Any record for which a matching record has been found in the other system becomes updated accordingly. For a record without a match, a matching record is created.
*''Incremental - New Only'': For any record for which no matching record has been found in the other system, such a matching record is created.

==Bi-Directional Synchronization in Real Time==
Synchronization between Acumatica ERP and Salesforce gives users the ability to create, modify, or delete the following entities in either of the systems, with the changes reflected in both systems: [anchor|#ul_hgk_hyj_p1b]
*Leads and contacts
*Business accounts
*Opportunities
*Cases
*Stock and non-stock inventory items
*Users
{br}{TOC}
==One-Way Synchronization==
Changes made to inventory items in Acumatica ERP can be synchronized with Salesforce, but this synchronization cannot be performed in the opposite direction.{br}

User data can be synchronized also in only one direction, from Salesforce to Acumatica ERP.
==Additional Considerations==
In Salesforce, a case record cannot be saved if it has no owner specified. In Acumatica ERP, only a user that is linked to an employee can be assigned to a case as its owner. Thus, before synchronization of case records starts, user records should be synchronized between the systems and then verified for association with employees. For more information about synchronization of cases, see [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__con_Case_Sync|Synchronization of Case Records].{br}

For correct synchronization of inventory items and opportunities between the systems, sales prices in Acumatica ERP should be synchronized with product prices in Salesforce. Real-time synchronization is not available for sales prices, but Acumatica ERP supports the export of sales prices through specific export scenarios. For details, see [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__con_Sales_Price_Export|Export of Sales Prices].]]></column>

This topic describes how you can prepare CRM-related data for real-time synchronization between Acumatica ERP and Salesforce and how you can initiate and maintain the synchronization process.
==Preparation for Real-Time Data Synchronization{collapsable}==
If one of the systems, Salesforce or Acumatica ERP, is used in your company as the primary CRM system, the data should be initially synchronized between the systems, which the administrator can do by initiating the synchronization process on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SF_20_50_35|Salesforce Data Resync] ([~/?ScreenId=SF205035|SF205035]) form with ''Full Data Resync'' selected in the '''Sync to Start''' box.
==Real-Time Synchronization of Data{collapsable}==
You initiate the bi-directional real-time synchronization process on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SF_20_50_30|Salesforce Sync] ([~/?ScreenId=SF205030|SF205030]) form. This process monitors data changes in both systems. If any change has been detected, it gets synchronized between the systems.{br}

At the end of the synchronization process, each record is assigned a status that indicates whether the data has been synchronized. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SF_20_50_40|Salesforce Sync State] ([~/?ScreenId=SF205040|SF205040]) form, you can review the statuses of the processed records and any errors the system generated when processing failed for records. {br}

If data synchronization fails for any record, the record is assigned the internal status ''Modified'', which indicates that the record data is out of sync. An administrator or a user with access to the record can analyze the cause of the failure and eliminate it, and then another attempt to synchronize the record data can be made. To resynchronize the out-of-sync records, you can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SF_20_50_35|Salesforce Data Resync] ([~/?ScreenId=SF205035|SF205035]) form or the '''Sync State''' tabs on the applicable entry forms for the corresponding records.{br}

You can stop bi-directional real-time synchronization of data between the systems by clearing the '''Active''' check box for the ''Salesforce Sync'' data provider on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_15|Data Providers] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206015|SM206015]) form.{br}

To stop real-time synchronization of records of particular types from Salesforce to Acumatica ERP, you need to open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SF_20_50_30|Salesforce Sync] ([~/?ScreenId=SF205030|SF205030]) form, select unlabeled check boxes for the corresponding types of records, and then click '''Stop''' on the form toolbar. If you click '''Stop All''' on the form toolbar of that form, records of all listed types will stop being synchronized from Salesforce to Acumatica ERP.{br}

To stop real-time synchronization of records of particular types from Acumatica ERP to Salesforce, you need to open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SF_20_50_20|Salesforce Sync] ([~/?ScreenId=SF205020|SF205020]) form and delete from the table the export scenarios for the needed types of records.
==Scheduled Jobs for Synchronization{collapsable}==
In Acumatica ERP, the following recurrent jobs related to the synchronization process can be scheduled to run at any frequency.[anchor|#ul_fqy_kh2_nbb]
*''Salesforce Sync'': This job is used for the real-time synchronization of data from Salesforce to Acumatica ERP. You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SF_20_50_30|Salesforce Sync] ([~/?ScreenId=SF205030|SF205030]) form to configure this job.
*:When this job starts, Acumatica ERP requests that Salesforce notify it about all changes of the data for the particular type of record (for instance, business account) for which the job has been started. Then the job starts a background process that monitors the data stream and receives notifications about changes for the object data in Salesforce. As soon as each notification is received, the job finds the changed record in the Acumatica ERP database by using the identifier of the corresponding Salesforce record and writes the changes according to the mapping rules specified in the relevant integration scenario. If no corresponding record is found in Acumatica ERP, then a new record is created.
*:We recommend that you schedule an automatic restart of this job in case a network failure occurs or Acumatica ERP is taken down for maintenance.
*''Failed & Missed Data Resync'': This job is used to compensate for possible synchronization failures. You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SF_20_50_35|Salesforce Data Resync] ([~/?ScreenId=SF205035|SF205035]) form to configure this job.
*:Normally, records are synchronized bi-directionally in real time. Occasionally, however, a record may not be submitted to a system due to various reasons, such as a network connection failure or specific configuration of validation rules that prevent a record from being saved if validation fails. When this job is started, it selects records that previously failed to synchronize and tries to resubmit them. If an attempt is unsuccessful, on the next run of the job, the job selects the record again and makes another attempt to submit the record. The maximum number of times the system attempts to submit the record is determined by the solution configuration.
*:We recommend that you schedule this job to run every five to ten minutes.
*''Full Data Resync'': This job is used after a long system outage or a Salesforce system failure has occurred. It also can be used for initial data synchronization. You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SF_20_50_35|Salesforce Data Resync] form to configure this job.
*:Salesforce keeps notifications about record data changes in the data stream for 24 hours, after which it discards them. It is unlikely (although possible) that the two systems would stay disconnected for more than 24 hours. It is also unlikely (although possible) that for some reason, a record modified in Salesforce would not be pushed to the data stream. When this job is started, it searches in both systems for any record that has been modified, created, or deleted since the last time the job was run. If any record is found, the job synchronizes its data.
*:We recommend that you run this job once a day.

==Data Flow{collapsable}==
The following diagrams provide a simplified illustration of synchronization data flow.{br}

When a user modifies, creates, or deletes a record in Salesforce, the system pushes the record into the data stream. Acumatica ERP picks up the record from the data stream and searches for the same record in Acumatica ERP database by using the Salesforce record identifier. If a record is found, the synchronization solution updates the data or deletes the record. If no record is found, the synchronization solution creates a new record.[anchor|#fig_acc_ypx_mbb][anchor|#image_ksn_wpx_mbb][image:UserGuide/Images/SFDC_Sync_Salesfore_to_Acumatica.png|popup|Salesforce to Acumatica ERP data flow|450px]
When a user modifies or deletes a record in Acumatica ERP, the system uses the API to search for the record in Salesforce by using the Salesforce record identifier. If a record has been found, the synchronization solution updates or deletes it. If a record has been modified in Acumatica ERP but no corresponding record has been found in Salesforce, the synchronization solution creates a new record. When a user creates a record in Acumatica ERP, the synchronization solution creates a record in Salesforce.[anchor|#fig_bky_hqx_mbb][anchor|#image_od2_sqx_mbb][image:UserGuide/Images/SFDC_Sync_Acumatica_to_Saleforce.png|popup| Acumatica ERP to Salesforce data flow|450px]]]></column>

Salesforce keeps             notifications about record data changes in the data stream for 24 hours, after which it             discards them. It is unlikely (although possible) that the two systems would stay             disconnected for more than 24 hours. It is also unlikely (although possible) that for             some reason, a record modified in Salesforce would not be pushed to the data stream.             When this job is started, it searches in both systems for any record that has been             modified, created, or deleted since the last time the job was run. If any record is             found, the job synchronizes its data. We recommend that you run this job once a             day. Data Flow The following diagrams provide a simplified illustration of synchronization data flow. When a user modifies, creates, or deletes a record in Salesforce, the system pushes the         record into the data stream.  Acumatica ERP picks up the record from the data stream and searches for the same record in  Acumatica ERP database by using the Salesforce record identifier. If a record is found, the         synchronization solution updates the data or deletes the record. If no record is found, the         synchronization solution creates a new record. Salesforce to  Acumatica ERP data flow When a user modifies or deletes a record in  Acumatica ERP, the system uses the API to search for the record in Salesforce by using the Salesforce         record identifier. If a record has been found, the synchronization solution updates or         deletes it. If a record has been modified in  Acumatica ERP but no corresponding record has been found in Salesforce, the synchronization solution         creates a new record. When a user creates a record in  Acumatica ERP, the synchronization solution creates a record in Salesforce.  Acumatica ERP to Salesforce data flow ]]></column>

Inventory items and opportunities can be synchronized between Acumatica ERP and Salesforce in real time, but for correct and complete synchronization of the data, sales prices in Acumatica ERP should be separately synchronized with product prices in Salesforce.{br}

Real-time synchronization is not available for sales prices. Sales prices can be exported from Acumatica ERP to Salesforce through the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_70_36|Export by Scenario] ([~/?ScreenId=SM207036|SM207036]) form. Prices may be exported in various currencies, and price classes used in Acumatica ERP may be exported as price books to Salesforce.{br}

Before an administrator can start configuring the export of sales prices, integration between the systems should be properly configured (for details, see [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__con_Configuration|Configuration]). Then the following steps, each of which is described in detail below, should be completed:[anchor|#_d7742ce7-b9a6-476e-9e0d-e7e68716e251]

==Synchronization of Inventory Items==
Stock and non-stock inventory items in Acumatica ERP should be synchronized with products in Salesforce. For that purpose, the ''Full Data Resync'' job should be run for stock and non-stock inventory items on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SF_20_50_35|Salesforce Data Resync] ([~/?ScreenId=SF205035|SF205035]) form, and then all conflicts (if any) should be resolved on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SF_20_50_40|Salesforce Sync State] ([~/?ScreenId=SF205040|SF205040]) form.[anchor|#_ecf660c0-90f0-4961-b34d-86b95c3b3210]
==Review and Update of the Built-In Generic Inquiry Forms==
The ''Default Prices for Export to Salesforce (SF000001)'' and ''Base Sales Prices for Export to Salesforce (SF000002)'' forms, which are hidden generic inquiry forms, are used in Acumatica ERP to support the export of sales prices through the ''Export Default Prices to Salesforce'' and ''Export Base Sales Prices to Salesforce'' export scenarios.{br}

The generic inquiry forms may be additionally configured to match your company&rsquo;s policies regarding sales prices. For information about the limitations on the export of sales prices, see [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__con_Limitations#_a429d61b-d2b9-4fe9-be68-d10ecdf2cc2d|Synchronizing Sales Prices].[anchor|#_e0a5da75-be3d-4682-9a9f-775b829b6da8]
==Review and Update of the Built-In Export Scenarios==
On the '''Mapping''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_70_25|Export Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM207025|SM207025]) form, the value of the ''Pricebook2Id'' field should be updated for the involved export scenarios as follows:[anchor|#_e1d7170c-1479-4d7e-a61d-f1a8b1463749]
*The ''Pricebook2Id'' of the standard price book should be specified for the ''Export Default Prices to Salesforce'' export scenario.

==Configuration of the Support of Multiple Currencies==
The identifiers of currencies used in Acumatica ERP should exactly match the currency codes used in Salesforce.{br}

In Acumatica ERP, a currency identifier may be configured on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) form for the base currency or on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CM_20_20_00|Currencies] ([~/?ScreenId=CM202000|CM202000]) form if multiple currencies are supported.{br}

In Salesforce, a currency code may be configured in the '''Active Currencies''' list at '''Setup''' > '''Administer''' > '''Company Profile''' > '''Manage Currencies'''.((({S:Warn}If your company does not use multiple currencies, default prices always appear in Salesforce in their base currency.
)))
If the use of multiple currencies is enabled both systems, an Acumatica ERP administrator should do the following:[anchor|#_8407cf09-abd9-4e17-8f15-cee92b08ea24]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_60_15|Data Providers] ([~/?ScreenId=SM206015|SM206015]) form, select the ''Salesforce Sync'' data provider and then, on the '''Schema''' tab, select the ''PricebookEntry'' source object, click '''Fill Schema Fields''', and select the '''Key''' check box for the ''Pricebook2Id'', ''Product2Id'', and ''CurrencyIsoCode'' fields; for all the other listed fields, this check box should be cleared.
#On the '''Mapping''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_70_25|Export Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM207025|SM207025]) form, for the ''Export Default Prices to Salesforce'' and ''Export Base Sales Prices to Salesforce'' export scenarios, the ''Active'' check box should be selected for the ''CurrencyIsoCode'' field. The administrator can specify the base currency in the '''Field''' column if it differs from the default value. 
[anchor|#_98a8e341-fc69-44c1-97f7-53411c98c840]
==Configuration of Custom Generic Inquiries and Export Scenarios==
To match your company&rsquo;s sales process, you can create custom generic inquiries and integration scenarios.{br}

For example, you can do the following to prepare for the export of customer price classes or customer prices:[anchor|#_c7790d34-34d2-4968-92bb-20a8d15fe63c]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_80_00|Generic Inquiry] ([~/?ScreenId=SM208000|SM208000]) form, create a generic inquiry that collects customer price classes or customer prices.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_70_25|Export Scenarios] ([~/?ScreenId=SM207025|SM207025]) form, create an export scenario based on the new generic inquiry. 
#:You can copy the mapping data from the ''Export Base Sales Prices to Salesforce'' export scenario and specify the ''Pricebook2Id'' that corresponds to customer price classes or customer prices in Salesforce. You can define different price books by using nested {{=IIF()}} formulas. Also, you may need to set up the support of multiple currencies.
[anchor|#_a42ea918-6753-43da-ace5-3f1d5a6fc801]
==Export of Sales Prices==
Before starting the export of sales prices from Acumatica ERP to Salesforce, an administrator should make sure that the corresponding generic inquiries and export scenarios match the company&rsquo;s sales policies.{br}

Then, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_70_36|Export by Scenario] ([~/?ScreenId=SM207036|SM207036]) form, a corresponding export scenario should be executed as many times as needed until all the prices appear in Salesforce.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
The solution for the synchronization of data between Acumatica ERP and Salesforce has the following limitations:[anchor|#ul_urz_fn5_x1b]
*If the '''Clone''' action is initiated in Salesforce, a duplicate of the ''Acumatica&#95;NoteID'' custom property is created, which may cause the failure of the synchronization process. We recommend that users either avoid using the '''Clone''' action or clear the ''Acumatica&#95;NoteID'' value for each clone record.
*If a lead is converted to a contact in Acumatica ERP, the changes are not synchronized with Salesforce. As a workaround, we recommend that you restrict the ability to convert leads in Acumatica ERP. For instance, you can do this on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_20|Access Rights by Screen] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201020|SM201020]) form by restricting access rights to the '''Convert to Contact''', '''Create Opportunity''', and '''Create Business Account''' actions, which are available on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_10_00|Leads] ([~/?ScreenId=CR301000|CR301000]) form. For information about how you can manage user access rights, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SA_Managing_User_Access_Mapref|Managing User Access].
*If a lead is converted to a contact in Salesforce, the resynchronization process should be performed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SF_20_50_35|Salesforce Data Resync] ([~/?ScreenId=SF205035|SF205035]) form for the changes to be synchronized with Acumatica ERP. The changes may be synchronized automatically if a schedule for the ''Failed & Missed Data Resync'' process is activated. As a result, an inactive lead record and an active contact record appear in Acumatica ERP. This happens because in Salesforce, a lead and the related contact are stored as two separate records, whereas in Acumatica ERP, a single record having different statuses holds the lead and contact data.

==Using Source and Target Restrictions in Integration Scenarios==
Source and target restrictions may be specified for an integration scenario that uses the ''Salesforce Sync'' data provider. However, if these restrictions are modified after bi-directional synchronization of data between Salesforce and Acumatica ERP has been initiated, the changes will be ignored by the running synchronization process.{br}

To make the changes in source and target restrictions effective, you need to do the following:[anchor|#ol_kqj_rc2_3db]
#Restart the bi-directional real-time synchronization process on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SF_20_50_30|Salesforce Sync] ([~/?ScreenId=SF205030|SF205030]) form.
#Clear the <tt>LastFullSyncDateTime</tt> field in the <tt>SFEntitySetup</tt> table in the database.
#Run the ''Full Data Resync'' job on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SF_20_50_35|Salesforce Data Resync] form.

Source and target restrictions do not apply when a record is deleted in one of the systems. That is, if a record that meets the conditions of the source or target restrictions has been synchronized and the status of the record has changed to ''Skipped'', deletion of the record in the source system will result in deletion of the matching record in the target system.[anchor|#_a429d61b-d2b9-4fe9-be68-d10ecdf2cc2d]
==Synchronizing Sales Prices==
Synchronization of sales prices between the systems works with the following limitations:[anchor|#ul_ypy_kyl_3db]
*Promotional prices cannot be exported to Salesforce because Salesforce does not support this type of price.
*If the ''Default Prices for Export to Salesforce (SF000001)'' or ''Base Sales Prices for Export to Salesforce (SF000002)'' generic inquiry form includes a row with '''Break Qty.''' set to a value other than ''0'', this row is not processed because Salesforce does not support this type of property.

However, if these restrictions are modified after     bi-directional synchronization of data between Salesforce and  Acumatica ERP     has been initiated, the changes will be ignored by the running synchronization process. To make the changes in source and target restrictions effective, you need to do the     following: Restart the bi-directional real-time synchronization process on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SF205030|SF205030]) Salesforce Sync (SF205030) form. Clear the  LastFullSyncDateTime  field in the  SFEntitySetup  table in the      database. Run the  Full Data Resync  job on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SF205035|SF205035]) Salesforce Data Resync form. Source and target restrictions do not apply when a record is deleted in one of the systems.     That is, if a record that meets the conditions of the source or target restrictions has been     synchronized and the status of the record has changed to  Skipped , deletion of the record     in the source system will result in deletion of the matching record in the target system. Synchronizing Sales Prices Synchronization of sales prices between the systems works with the following         limitations: Promotional prices cannot be exported to Salesforce because Salesforce does not support           this type of price. If the  Default Prices for Export to Salesforce (SF000001)  or  Base Sales Prices             for Export to Salesforce (SF000002)  generic inquiry form includes a row with              Break Qty.  set to a value other than  0 , this row is not           processed because Salesforce does not support this type of property. ]]></column>

In the integration scenarios that you are going to use, verify the mapping in the following cases:[anchor|#ul_ck2_3zh_fbb]
*Your company uses custom values, such as statuses or stages.
*You need to synchronize custom fields, particular class IDs, or attributes. You may also need to make sure that you have specified default values for all required attributes.
*You want to apply auto-numbering to imported records. 
*:For instance, in the ''Import Business Account from Salesforce'' scenario, you may need to replace the value in the '''Source Field/Value''' column for the ''Business Account'' field with the following string:{{{{=IsNull(AccountNumber, BAccount.AcctCD)
