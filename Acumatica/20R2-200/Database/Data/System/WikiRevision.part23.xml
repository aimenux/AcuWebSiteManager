The Acumatica Self-Service                         Portal provides a solution for you to more efficiently work and communicate with your customers. Self-Service Portal is specifically designed to be the site where your customers can view all the relevant information about their interactions with you as a vendor and perform needed activities online.{br}{TOC}
==Customer Self-Service Capability==
By using Self-Service Portal, your customers can access their account information, create and manage support cases, and create and track online orders—all without picking up the phone or sending an email. All of these services are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
==Self-Update of Customer Information==
By using Self-Service Portal, customers can view and promptly update their company address and contact information, to keep the data in the system up to date at all times. You can view the updated information about the customer business account on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_30_00|Business Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR303000|CR303000]) form.
==Financial Overview==
Within the Self-Service Portal, customers have the ability to see all historical documents, balances, due dates, payments received, and amount due. 
==Case Management==
Customers can use Self-Service Portal to submit new cases, which seamlessly flow into Acumatica ERP. You can view the new cases by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_00|Cases] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306000|CR306000]) form. The customers can view the cases they submitted, track the statuses of these cases, provide additional information when required, and reopen closed cases. ((({S:Warn}You can set up a period during which users can reopen the case by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_60_00|Case Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR206000|CR206000]) form.
)))
For more information, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CR__MNG_Cases|Managing Cases].
==Online Ordering==
With online ordering in Acumatica Self-Service                         Portal, you give your customers access to the products you sell. You use your Acumatica ERP instance to build the catalog and manage the product descriptions and images. {br}

Your customers can use Self-Service Portal to browse the list of available items, view item details, and then order the items online. The sales order is automatically generated and you can further process it. The customer tracks the status of the order and the shipments online. Also, the customer can view the invoice after you release the document. For more information, see [HelpRoot_SS_Portal_Admin\SP__mng_Online_Ordering|Managing Online Orders].((({S:Warn}This feature is inaccessible if the ''Inventory and Order Management'' group of features is disabled.
)))
==Delegated User Management==
You can assign a user or multiple users of each customer as delegated administrators and give these users the rights to add new contacts or users to the customer&rsquo;s business account by using Self-Service Portal. The delegated administrators can also assign the users one or more of the roles you have provided. All the added contacts are immediately visible on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_20_00|Contacts] ([~/?ScreenId=CR302000|CR302000]) form in Acumatica ERP.
==Document Sharing==
 Self-Service Portal provides a secure location to share with customers important content, such as marketing and informational documents, as well as corporate policies—all without the need to build a separate webpage. For more information, see [HelpRoot_SS_Portal_Admin\SP__mng_Wiki_Overview|Managing Self-Service Portal Wikis].
==Knowledge Base==
The Knowledge Base (KB) wiki is designed to host support references, such as information on specific solutions, frequently asked questions (FAQ), and common troubleshooting issues and their resolutions. The KB articles, created and published by your company&rsquo;s support professionals, ensure that your customers can search the knowledge base to find answers to their questions whenever they want. For more information, see [HelpRoot_SS_Portal_Admin\SP__mng_Wiki_Overview|Managing Self-Service Portal Wikis].
==Localization==
You can localize the user interface of Self-Service Portal and wiki articles to multiple languages. You can translate the strings of the application&rsquo;s user interface directly in the application or by exporting the application strings to a third-party product, performing the translation in that product, and importing the translated strings back. For details, see [HelpRoot_SS_Portal_Admin\SP__mng_Translation|Managing Localization of Self-Service Portal].
==Customization of the User Interface==
In Acumatica ERP, you can flexibly customize the user interface (in particular, main menu items and workspace links) that all users will see so that it fits the business processes of your organization. Your customization of the user interface will make it easier for users to find and begin working with required forms, speeding document processing in the system. For example, you can add generic inquiry forms or dashboards to a Self-Service Portal site map on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_21|Portal Map] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200521|SM200521]) form, so that the forms are available for quick access.

==Knowledge Base Management Module==
You use the Knowledge Base Management module of the Self-Service Portal Configuration suite to configure the Self-Service Portal wikis, including the predefined and custom wikis. For more information, see [HelpRoot_SS_Portal_Admin\SP__mng_Wiki_Overview|Managing Self-Service Portal Wikis].
==Roles for Self-Service Portal Management==
In Acumatica ERP, you configure all access including access to the wiki, by using roles. For the internal users to perform configuration and management tasks on Self-Service Portal, the users must have sufficient access rights to Self-Service Portal. Generally, the users who work with Self-Service Portal must have the following access rights:[anchor|#ul_ald_xs4_ds]
*To configure and manage the Self-Service Portal instance, you assign users ''Portal Admin'' role. This role has been specifically designed to allow users to configure and manage Self-Service Portal by using the Administrator module.

With online ordering on Acumatica Self-Service                         Portal, you provide your customers with access to the products you sell. You use your Acumatica ERP instance to form the catalog and manage the product descriptions and images. Your customers can then use Self-Service Portal to browse the catalog and place orders online.{br}{TOC}
==Overall Configuration Process==
You form the catalog that is to be available to your customers on the Self-Service Portal directly from your Acumatica ERP instance by using the functionality of the Inventory module. By assigning an item sales category to an inventory item, you both categorize the item and include the item in the online catalog. For more information on managing inventory items, see the [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN_00_00_00|Inventory Management] part of the Acumatica ERP Inventory Management Guide.{br}

Managing the online catalog includes the following tasks, which you perform by using your Acumatica ERP instance:[anchor|#ol_vx2_lsy_vp]
#Configuring inventory items before you present the items in the online catalog, including adding extended descriptions for the items and uploading item images
#Forming the catalog structure by adding, deleting, and organizing sales categories
#Assigning sales categories to inventory items, thus adding the inventory items to the catalog
#:((({S:Warn}Inventory items without a sales category assigned do not appear in the catalog.
)))

==Inventory Item Descriptions and Images==
In Acumatica ERP, every inventory item, both stock and non-stock, has a basic set of item properties. These properties include the item’s identifier, description, images, price, cost, units of measure, default warehouse, and default vendor information. Your customers can view the descriptions and images you provide for your inventory items. ((({S:Warn}On Self-Service Portal, the images you provide in the descriptions are displayed only in the '''Description''' section. To make the images available in the '''Images''' section, you have to add images to the images collection of the inventory item.
)))
For details on adding descriptions and images to inventory items, see [HelpRoot_SS_Portal_Admin\IN__how_Add_Item_Description|To Add Descriptions and Images to Inventory Items].
==Item Sales Categories==
The hierarchy of sales categories form the catalog structure. You add new categories and subcategories, and move and delete old ones to make the catalog structure easy to manage and to navigate. For detailed procedures on adding, deleting, and managing sales categories, see [HelpRoot_SS_Portal_Admin\IN__how_OnlineOrder_Add_sales_Category|To Add a New Item Sales Category] and [HelpRoot_SS_Portal_Admin\IN__how_OnlineOrder_Manage_Sales_Categories|To Organize Item Sales Categories].{br}

You assign your inventory items the sales categories to form the online catalog. You can add items to a sales category one by one, in bulk by item class, or all items specified in the system, as described in [HelpRoot_SS_Portal_Admin\IN__how_Online_Order_Add_to_Catalog|To Add Inventory Items to the Catalog]. Also, you can delete items from the sales categories, as described in [HelpRoot_SS_Portal_Admin\IN__how_OnlineOrder_Delete_from_Catalog|To Remove an Item from the Catalog].

On  Self-Service Portal, the images you provide in the descriptions are displayed only in the                      Description  section. To make the images available in the                      Images  section, you have to add images to the images                 collection of the inventory item. For details on adding descriptions and images to inventory items, see  To Add Descriptions and Images to Inventory Items. Item Sales Categories The hierarchy of sales categories form the catalog structure. You add new categories                 and subcategories, and move and delete old ones to make the catalog structure easy                 to manage and to navigate. For detailed procedures on adding, deleting, and managing                 sales categories, see  To Add a New Item Sales Category and                      To Organize Item Sales Categories. You assign your inventory items the sales categories to form the online catalog. You                 can add items to a sales category one by one, in bulk by item class, or all items                 specified in the system, as described in  To Add Inventory Items to the Catalog. Also, you can delete items                 from the sales categories, as described in  To Remove an Item from the Catalog. ]]></column>

The Orders suite of the Acumatica Self-Service                         Portal gives your customers the ability to order products online: They can browse the list of products, view the detailed product information, place orders, and monitor their progress. This topic describes the general steps in online order processing and the flow of data between your Self-Service Portal and Acumatica ERP instances. The specific procedures of this process depend on your company&rsquo;s requirements.{br}{TOC}
==Using the Catalog==
In Acumatica ERP, you form the catalog and provide product descriptions and images. Your customer signs in to the Self-Service Portal instance and browses the catalog. For every item in the catalog, the customer can see the description, images, price, and availability in different warehouses. 
==Placing Orders==
After your customer decides which items to purchase, the customer does the following:[anchor|#ol_tr2_vg1_yp]
#Places an order through Self-Service Portal, selecting the items to buy and specifying the item quantities
#Specifies shipping instructions, including the warehouses the items should be shipped from, the desired delivery date, the shipping location, and the carrier to be used for shipping the ordered goods

This topic describes the general steps in online order processing and the flow of data         between your  Self-Service Portal and            Acumatica ERP instances. The specific procedures of this process depend on your company's         requirements. Using the Catalog In  Acumatica ERP, you form the catalog and provide product descriptions and images. Your customer signs in         to the  Self-Service Portal         instance and browses the catalog. For every item in the catalog, the customer can see the         description, images, price, and availability in different warehouses.  Placing Orders After your customer decides which items to purchase, the customer does the following: Places an order through  Self-Service Portal,           selecting the items to buy and specifying the item quantities Specifies shipping instructions, including the warehouses the items should be shipped           from, the desired delivery date, the shipping location, and the carrier to be used for           shipping the ordered goods Prints the order Processing Orders This order immediately becomes available on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000)         form of your  Acumatica ERP instance, thus helping you plan the fulfillment of the order.

For more information on case management in Acumatica ERP, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CR__MNG_Cases|Managing Cases].{br}{TOC}
==Case Settings in Acumatica ERP==
With Self-Service Portal, your customers take part of the case processing: They can submit new cases, add new information to the cases, and then close the resolved cases. The customer&rsquo;s input is seamlessly incorporated into the case processing. In addition to your general case processing, you only have to have case classes that can be used to submit cases through Self-Service Portal.((({S:Hint}You must configure at least one case class through Self-Service Portal (that is, a case class with the '''Internal''' check box cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_60_00|Case Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR206000|CR206000]) form).
)))
The case management setup in Acumatica ERP is described in detail in [HelpRoot_CRM\CR__MNG_Cases|Managing Cases]. 
==Case Settings in Self-Service Portal==
You select the following default settings for Self-Service Portal:[anchor|#ul_p1z_5yb_xp]
*The default case class 
*The default case priority

The customers can change the defaults when they submit new cases.{br}

The detailed procedure is described in [HelpRoot_SS_Portal_Admin\SP__how_Cases_Configuration|To Set Up Defaults for Case Management on Self-Service Portal].
==Case Visibility on Self-Service Portal==
A case may be visible on Self-Service Portal only if the following conditions are met:[anchor|#_364ddf7e-ac26-4ba4-9812-aebbfe896456]
*The case belongs to a case class with the '''Internal''' check box cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_60_00|Case Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR206000|CR206000]) form.
*If the case is assigned to an employee, the contact that is linked to the employee belongs to a contact class with the '''Internal''' check box cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_20_50_00|Contact Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR205000|CR205000]) form.

==Case Processing==
Case processing starts when a customer submits a new case. The new case immediately becomes available in Acumatica ERP, where you process it according to your company&rsquo;s workflow. {br}

Customers can track cases by the changes in the case status, which can be any of the following:[anchor|#ul_rl4_z1c_xp]
*''New'': The customer submitted a new case.
*''Open'': The case is processed. 
*:((({S:Warn}When a case is resolved and the customer closes it, the case status is set to ''Open'' with the reason ''Pending Closure''. You must add any required information to the case and close the case yourself.
)))
*''Pending Customer'': The case requires customer input; the details are available in the case details.
*''Closed'': The case is resolved and closed.

When the case status is changed, the customer gets a email notification.
==Case Notifications==
To help case owners monitor the cases created by user through Self-Service Portal, you can set up notifications on changes in such cases. With the notification enabled, case owners get emails when customers make changes in case records on Self-Service Portal. For details on setting up notifications on changes in cases, see [HelpRoot_SS_Portal_Admin\SP__how_Notifications_on_cases|To Set Up Notifications About Comments in Cases].

With Acumatica Self-Service                         Portal wikis, you can share content with your customers, including marketing and informational materials, frequently asked questions (FAQ), and other information you want to give your customers easy access to. Typically, Self-Service Portal wikis are displayed in the Self-Service Portal instance and hidden in the corresponding Acumatica ERP instance. You can perform all tasks related to Self-Service Portal wikis by using the Knowledge Base Management module of the Self-Service Portal Configuration suite.{br}

This topic describes the main details of configuring, managing, adding content, and maintaining Self-Service Portal wikis.{br}

For more information on wikis in Acumatica ERP, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Wiki_Management|Wiki Overview].{br}{TOC}
==Process of Managing Self-Service Portal Wikis==
The process of managing Self-Service Portal wikis includes the following tasks:[anchor|#_608d46bc-1548-428e-afa8-070ac7d80004]
*''Creating wikis'': You can add a new wiki when you want to publish information specific to the business processes of your organization for users of the Self-Service Portal. Otherwise, you can add articles in a predefined wiki. (For information on predefined Self-Service Portal wikis, see [[#_c0700d69-2e38-41e1-b639-7cbf33f8c9d9|Predefined Wikis].) You can add wikis and configure access to wikis down to the wiki article level by using the forms in the Knowledge Base Management module of the Self-Service Portal Configuration suite. For details about adding a wiki, see [HelpRoot_SS_Portal_Admin\SP__how_Add_new_wiki_from_ERP|To Create a Wiki in Self-Service Portal].
*''Managing wiki content'': You can add and publish new articles, edit existing articles, and remove outdated wiki articles. For more information on wiki content management tasks, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__mng_Wiki_How_To|Wiki Content Procedures]. 
*''Providing access rights to wikis'': You can set up access rights for users to view entire wikis or certain wiki articles and to edit wiki content. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Wiki_Access_Setup|Wiki Access Management].
*''Configuring the predefined Welcome article'': You can edit the Welcome article when you want to place important information for portal users there. The Welcome article is used as the default Self-Service Portal home page. For details, see [HelpRoot_SS_Portal_Admin\SP__How_Editing_Home_page|To Configure the Default Self-Service Portal Welcome Page].
*''Using a wiki as a home page'': You can replace the Self-Service Portal home page with a selected wiki page when information on this page should be at hand for most of portal users. For more information, see [HelpRoot_SS_Portal_Admin\SP__mng_Home_Page|Managing the Self-Service Portal Home Page]. 
*''Locating wiki on both Self-Service Portal and Acumatica ERP'': You can configure a wiki that was created in Acumatica ERP to be visible on Self-Service Portal when you need particular articles to be visible to external users. For details, see [[#_d3a03957-53e4-4c26-a36c-1a0f1bd673ab|Visibility in of a Wiki Article Created in].
[anchor|#_c0700d69-2e38-41e1-b639-7cbf33f8c9d9]
==Predefined Self-Service Portal Wikis==
By default, Self-Service Portal includes the Self-Service Portal Guide, the Home page wiki, and the Knowledge Base wiki. {br}

The Self-Service Portal Guide provides an overview of the Self-Service Portal functionality and forms, the website user interface, and the navigation options provided specifically for customers. ((({S:Hint}We strongly recommend that you restrict the ability to modify this guide.
)))
The Self-Service Portal Home Page wiki is a service wiki; it contains the Welcome article that is used as the default Self-Service Portal home page. By default, the Welcome article contains links to the most useful Self-Service Portal forms; you can edit the contents of the article. For details, see [HelpRoot_SS_Portal_Admin\SP__How_Editing_Home_page|To Configure the Default Self-Service Portal Welcome Page].((({S:Warn}You can select another article or create a dashboard to be used as the Self-Service Portal home page. But if the selected article or dashboard becomes unavailable for any reason, the system reverts to the default wiki article. For more information, see [HelpRoot_SS_Portal_Admin\SP__mng_Home_Page|Managing the Self-Service Portal Home Page].
)))
The Knowledge Base (KB) wiki is designed to host support references, such as information on specific solutions, frequently asked questions (FAQ), and common troubleshooting issues and their resolutions. The KB articles are to be created and published by your company&rsquo;s support professionals to ensure that your customers can search the knowledge base to find answers to their questions whenever they want.[anchor|#_d3a03957-53e4-4c26-a36c-1a0f1bd673ab]
==Visibility in Self-Service Portal of a Wiki Article Created in Acumatica ERP==
You can create a wiki article in Acumatica ERP and display it on Self-Service Portal. For example, suppose that the support engineers of your organization have added a FAQ article in Acumatica ERP, and they want to publish it in the knowledge base on Self-Service Portal for partners as well. {br}

To make a wiki article created in Acumatica ERP visible on Self-Service Portal, you do the following:[anchor|#_2da12317-1682-4ca2-82a5-f15a4e0ecf04]

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Management of  Self-Service Portal   Wikis With  Acumatica Self-Service                         Portal wikis, you can share content with your customers, including marketing and informational         materials, frequently asked questions (FAQ), and other information you want to give your         customers easy access to. Typically,  Self-Service Portal wikis         are displayed in the  Self-Service Portal         instance and hidden in the corresponding  Acumatica ERP instance. You can perform all tasks related to  Self-Service Portal wikis         by using the Knowledge Base Management module of the  Self-Service Portal         Configuration suite. This topic describes the main details of configuring, managing, adding content, and         maintaining  Self-Service Portal         wikis. For more information on wikis in  Acumatica ERP, see  Wiki Overview. Process of Managing  Self-Service Portal         Wikis The process of managing  Self-Service Portal wikis         includes the following tasks: Creating wikis : You can add a new wiki when you want to publish information           specific to the business processes of your organization for users of the  Self-Service Portal.           Otherwise, you can add articles in a predefined wiki. (For information on predefined  Self-Service Portal           wikis, see  Predefined          Wikis Predefined Wikis.) You can add wikis and configure access to wikis down to the wiki           article level by using the forms in the Knowledge Base Management module of the  Self-Service Portal           Configuration suite. For details about adding a wiki, see  To Create a Wiki in Self-Service Portal. Managing wiki content : You can add and publish new articles, edit existing           articles, and remove outdated wiki articles. For more information on wiki content           management tasks, see  Wiki Content Procedures.  Providing access rights to wikis : You can set up access rights for users to view           entire wikis or certain wiki articles and to edit wiki content. For more information, see              Wiki Access Management. Configuring the predefined Welcome article : You can edit the Welcome article when           you want to place important information for portal users there. The Welcome article is           used as the default  Self-Service Portal           home page. For details, see  To Configure the Default Self-Service Portal Welcome Page. Using a wiki as a home page : You can replace the  Self-Service Portal           home page with a selected wiki page when information on this page should be at hand for           most of portal users. For more information, see  Managing the Self-Service Portal Home Page.  Locating wiki on both  Self-Service Portal             and  Acumatica ERP: You can configure a wiki that was created in  Acumatica ERP to be visible on  Self-Service Portal           when you need particular articles to be visible to external users. For details, see  Visibility in  of a         Wiki Article Created in Visibility in of a Wiki Article Created in. Predefined  Self-Service Portal         Wikis By default,  Self-Service Portal         includes the  Self-Service Portal         Guide, the Home page wiki, and the Knowledge Base wiki.  The  Self-Service Portal Guide provides an overview of the  Self-Service Portal         functionality and forms, the website user interface, and the navigation options provided         specifically for customers.  We strongly recommend that you restrict the ability to modify this         guide. The  Self-Service Portal Home Page wiki is a service wiki; it contains the Welcome article that is used as the         default  Self-Service Portal home         page. By default, the Welcome article contains links to the most useful  Self-Service Portal         forms; you can edit the contents of the article. For details, see  To Configure the Default Self-Service Portal Welcome Page. You can select another article or create a dashboard to be used as the  Self-Service Portal home         page. But if the selected article or dashboard becomes unavailable for any reason, the         system reverts to the default wiki article. For more information, see  Managing the Self-Service Portal Home Page. The Knowledge Base (KB) wiki is designed to host support references, such as information on         specific solutions, frequently asked questions (FAQ), and common troubleshooting issues and         their resolutions. The KB articles are to be created and published by your company's support         professionals to ensure that your customers can search the knowledge base to find answers to         their questions whenever they want. Visibility in  Self-Service Portal of a         Wiki Article Created in  Acumatica ERPYou can create a wiki article in  Acumatica ERP and display it on  Self-Service Portal. For         example, suppose that the support engineers of your organization have added a FAQ article in            Acumatica ERP, and they want to publish it in the knowledge base on  Self-Service Portal for         partners as well.  To make a wiki article created in  Acumatica ERP visible on  Self-Service Portal, you         do the following: Select the wiki that contains the article you want to display on  Self-Service Portal. Add the wiki to the  Self-Service Portal             site map. Set up the access rights to the wiki and the article for users who may need to view             them during their work.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[The steps below describe how to create a wiki in Self-Service Portal (The procedure is the same as that for creating a wiki in Acumatica ERP). For details on managing wikis on Self-Service Portal, see [HelpRoot_SS_Portal_Admin\SP__con_Portal_wiki_managementi|Management of Self-Service Portal Wikis].[anchor|#_f31de09c-78fd-4e13-b3df-b7a74c529e57]
==Before You Proceed==
Before you create a new wiki, you need to plan its use, usually in cooperation with other affected parties. You probably have already considered the most basic questions:[anchor|#_2ec4c15a-8f6e-4406-9aa6-3d26113ec674]
*Who will use the wiki?
*How will these employees use it?
*What kind of information will it contain?
*Who will perform the writing, reviewing, and administering?

Before you begin setting up the wiki, you need to consider other questions as well, including the following: [anchor|#_0d840a02-4adf-4a01-8ce5-e3adb428a207]
*What type of articles will the wiki consist of? In Acumatica Wiki, a wiki can consist of basic wiki articles or web pages.
*What categories will the wiki articles be placed into? Categories designate the type of content.
*What products will the wiki articles be applied to?
*What roles will have access rights for approving and publishing the wiki?
*What roles will have access rights for the wiki? What access rights should they have?
*Do you want the system to save versions of articles, either globally or for only particular articles?

Also, you will need to define the style (that is, the look and formatting) that will be used for all articles in the wiki. The style is defined by a file with the <tt>.css</tt> extension. For examples of styles, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Style_Examples|Wiki Style Examples].[anchor|#_0b990c7f-70fc-4c9f-82c3-b7f7288e0ec9]
==To Add a Wiki==
To create a wiki, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_20_05|Wiki] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202005|SM202005]) form. You can complete the setup of a wiki all at once or in stages, skipping the optional steps. To add a wiki and specify the required settings for it, do the following:[anchor|#_51417133-15b5-490c-b661-3477259dd855]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_20_05|Wiki] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202005|SM202005]) form.
#In the '''ID''' box of the '''General''' section, enter the unique identifier of the wiki, and in the '''Name''' box, enter a name for the wiki.
#In the '''Approval''' section, do the following:
##Use the '''Hold on Edit''' check box to specify whether created articles should have the ''Hold'' status by default: 
##*Clear the check box (the default setting) to have the ''Published'' status assigned to new articles and to published articles each time they are edited, whether or not an article is versioned. 
##*Select the check box to have the ''Hold'' status assigned to new articles as well as to published articles each time they are edited. If the article is versioned, once it is saved with the '''Hold''' check box selected, a new version with the ''Hold'' status is created and the published version is still available to users with ''View Only'' access rights. If the article is not versioned, the published article is overwritten by a new version with the ''Hold'' status and is not available to users with ''View Only'' access rights.
##Use the '''Require Approval''' check box to specify the necessity of the approval of the selected wiki by the approval group:
##*Clear the '''Require Approval''' check box, which is selected by default, if the selected wiki is not subject to approval. 
##*Select the '''Require Approval''' check box if the selected wiki is subject to approval. In the '''Approval Group''' box, select the wiki approval group, and in the '''Approver ID''' box, select the user in this group who is responsible for approving the articles. 
##*:For more information about wiki approvals, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__con_Wiki_Configuring_Approval_Procedures|Wiki Approval Procedures].
#In the '''Modern UI''' section, do the following:
##Select the '''Show on Help Dashboard''' check box to display a card for the selected wiki on the Help dashboard.
##In the '''Sequence''' box, specify the whole or decimal number that defines the sequential position of the wiki on the Help dashboard.

)))
##Optional: In the '''Default Article''' box, select the article to be displayed by default when a user clicks '''Explore''' on the wiki card on the Help dashboard. If no article is selected here, the first article of the selected wiki is displayed by default.
## On the '''Wiki Settings''' tab, in the '''Dashboard Description''' box, type an explanation of the content of the wiki, which will be used on the wiki card on the Help dashboard. In the description box, you can enter 255 characters, but we recommend that you enter no more than 160 characters so that your description fits the wiki card displayed on the Help dashboard.
#In the '''Classic UI''' section, do the following:
##In the '''Site Map Location''' box, select the node of the site map in which the wiki will be located.
##In the '''Site Map Title''' box, type the title of wiki on the site map.
#On the '''Wiki Settings''' tab, apply the appropriate style options for the wiki by doing the following:
##In the '''Style''' box of the '''Look and Feel''' section, select the prepared file with the CSS styles intended for displaying the articles of the wiki in a browser. If you specify no file, the browser-specific default styles will be used.
##In the '''Print Style''' box, select the prepared file with the CSS styles that define how a printed article of the wiki should look. If no file is specified, the browser-specific default styles will be used.
##In the '''Article Type''' box, select the type of articles that will make up the content of the wiki. The following options are available: 
##*''Article'': The basic type of articles. This type of articles may contain various content (text, tables, graphics, and links). Usually this type is used for Help articles.
##*''KB Article'': The type of article especially designed for Knowledge Base articles. This type of articles may contain the same content as basic articles. Additionally, users can rate the articles and leave their feedback for a particular article, which gives you the ability to collect statistics and information on how helpful the articles are.
# Skip the '''Template''', '''Print Template''', '''Header''', and '''Footer''' boxes until you create wiki templates.
#:((({S:Warn} You can apply templates to the wiki only after you create them for the selected wiki. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__how_Wiki_Creating_Template|To Create a Wiki Template] and [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__how_Wiki_Adding_Template|To Apply Templates to a Wiki].
)))
#Optional: In the '''Miscellaneous''' section of the '''Wiki Settings''' tab, do the following:
##In the '''Default Site Map Tag''' box, select the tag to be used by default for new articles. (This step can be performed later, when at least one tag has been created.)
## In the '''Public Virtual Path''' box, specify the web address of the wiki on a local website to be used for access outside of your local network.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save''' to save the settings you&rsquo;ve specified for the wiki so far.
#Only if you have selected the node of the site map in which the wiki will be located in the '''Site Map Location''' box (which causes the system to generate user roles and access rights for the selected wiki), on the '''Access Rights''' tab, configure the access rights for the wiki by doing the following in the table:
##In the '''Access Rights''' column of the first row, select the proper option for the selected role. The following options, listed from the most restrictive access rights to the broadest ones, are available: 
##:((({S:Warn}These access rights apply to all items (folders and articles) within the wiki unless you set different access rights for particular items within it; for more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Wiki_Access_Setup|Wiki Access Management]. 
)))
##*''Revoked'': For users with the role, doesn&rsquo;t allow any access to the wiki and the articles and folders within it, including viewing these items.
##*''View Only'': Allows users with the role to view all published articles and folders within the wiki.
##*''Edit'': Allows users with the role to edit the articles and folders in the wiki.
##*''Insert'': Allows users with the role to edit and create new articles and folders in the wiki.
##*''Publish'': Allows users with the role to edit, create, and directly publish articles and folders (or initiate the approval process for publishing, if this approval is required for the wiki) in the wiki.
##*''Delete'': Allows users with the role to delete articles and folders within the wiki, in addition to the rights at lower levels of access.
##Repeat the previous substep for each additional row with a role listed.
##On the form toolbar, click '''Save''' to change the access rights for the roles.
#Optional: On the '''Tags''' tab, create the list of tags to be used to mark the versions of articles in the wiki. To create the tags, do the following:
#:((({S:Warn}Tags can be created at any time and are not required for initial wiki setup.
)))
##In the table toolbar, click '''Add Row''' to add a new blank row to the table.
##In the '''Description''' box, type a descriptive name for the tag.
##Repeat the two previous substeps for each tag you want to add.
##On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

KB Article : The type of article especially designed for Knowledge Base articles. This type of articles may contain the same content as basic articles. Additionally, users can rate the articles and leave their feedback for a particular article, which gives you the ability to collect statistics and information on how helpful the articles are.  Skip the  Template ,  Print                     Template ,  Header , and                          Footer  boxes until you create wiki templates.                          You can apply templates to the wiki only after you create them for the                         selected wiki. For more information, see  To Create a Wiki Template and  To Apply Templates to a Wiki. Optional: In the  Miscellaneous  section of the                          Wiki Settings  tab, do the following: In the  Default Site Map Tag  box, select the tag                             to be used by default for new articles. (This step can be performed                             later, when at least one tag has been created.)  In the  Public Virtual Path  box, specify the web                             address of the wiki on a local website to be used for access outside of                             your local network.

 Acumatica Self-Service                         Portal provides functionality that you can use to localize the system in multiple languages. You can maintain the user interface and wikis in multiple languages if you have multiple locales in Acumatica ERP. The default locale of Self-Service Portal is U.S. English.{br}

Localization includes the use of locale-specific settings and the translation of the strings used in the application interface. In addition, you can translate user input and wiki articles to multiple languages.{br}

In this topic, you will read about how you can localize Self-Service Portal.{br}{TOC}
==Localizing Self-Service Portal==
You can localize Self-Service Portal in the following ways:[anchor|#_17839a35-4f58-4c33-a267-82a99e1021e8]
*You translate the strings used in the application interface. For details, see [[#_e75f0cf7-a06b-4f37-a393-414baac0635c|Translating the User Interface].
*You translate the user input in the boxes with multi-language support. For more information, see [[#_26987cd4-e466-46cf-aafc-8b135221c98e|Translating User Input].
*You translate wiki articles. For details, see [[#_34e839ac-990e-4e24-9b54-6122a8badaf2|Translating Wiki Articles].
[anchor|#_e75f0cf7-a06b-4f37-a393-414baac0635c]
==Translating the User Interface==
You can translate into multiple languages the strings used in the portal interface, such as box and column labels, error messages, and warnings. Before you start localizing the user interface of Self-Service Portal in a particular language you should make sure that a corresponding locale has been added to Acumatica ERP. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__CON_Locales_and_Languages|Locales and Languages].{br}

The translation process includes the collection and translation of the strings. For more information, see [HelpRoot_SS_Portal_Admin\SP__con_Translation_Process|Translation Process].[anchor|#_26987cd4-e466-46cf-aafc-8b135221c98e]
==Translating User Input==
When users log in to Self-Service Portal with a particular locale, they see values in the following text boxes and table columns in the language of the locale (if the values have been translated in Acumatica ERP):[anchor|#_33e2fdd6-3179-4fed-ad70-a7b7c054d882]
*The '''Description''' column on the '''Catalog''' (SP700000) form of the Orders suite
*The Description box in the '''Item Details''' dialog box of the Orders suite
*The '''Category''' box on the '''Catalog''' (SP700000) form of the Orders suite
*The '''Type''' column on the '''My Orders''' (SP700003) form of the Orders suite
*The '''Country''' box, which is on multiple forms of Self-Service Portal (such as the '''Company Profile''' (SP408030) form in the Support suite)

If the portal users do not see translated values in these form elements, you should check whether the values in the required locale language were added in Acumatica ERP. For details, see [HelpRoot_SS_Portal_Admin\SP__con_Boxes_Multilanguage|Boxes that Display Translated Values].[anchor|#_34e839ac-990e-4e24-9b54-6122a8badaf2]
==Translating Wiki Articles==
The Help wiki is created in the base language of Self-Service Portal, U.S. English. For a newly added locale, all articles will be displayed in the base language of the locale until you create locale-specific versions of the articles. For the detailed procedure, see [HelpRoot_SS_Portal_Admin\SP__how_Translate_Wiki_Article|To Create a Localized Version of a Wiki Article].{br}

After you have translated an article, only the versions of the article created in the selected locale will be listed on the '''History''' tab when you open the article in [HelpRoot_FormReference\DM__con_Wiki_Wiki_Editor_Form_for_Articles|Wiki Editor Form for Articles].{br}

 Acumatica Self-Service                         Portal provides built-in localization functionality, so you can easily translate Self-Service Portal into any language without using third-party products. You can collect the strings used in the whole system and translate them for any locale available in Acumatica ERP.{br}

This topic explains how to translate interface strings by using the built-in localization functionality of Self-Service Portal.{br}{TOC}
==Overview of Translation Tasks==
On Self-Service Portal, various strings that are used in the portal interface—such as element and column labels, error messages, and warnings—are stored within the code. When you initially translate the portal interface, you need to perform the following tasks:[anchor|#_9638bf96-d1ee-4c23-be5f-720c2c292e90]
#Collect strings: You collect the strings that correspond to the application resources from the code that you want to translate. For details, see [[#_3212a459-3f53-43e8-bac3-b6eb15ab4df3|Collection of the Strings for Translation].
#Translate strings: You translate the collected strings on Self-Service Portal or by using an Excel file. For more information, see [[#_204573b2-bd04-49c5-9324-41c4c8fd6785|String Translation].
#Optionally, handle multiple occurrences of the same string: You check whether the translations of the strings that appear multiple times in the portal interface are appropriate on all forms. For details, see [[#_bfbbd09d-0b01-4d4a-b9b8-e770b70ae480|Multiple Occurrences of the Same String].
#Review the translations on forms: You review the forms to check whether all strings have been translated. For more information, see [[#_4e9f8b73-929a-4957-a4fc-848a09b572e1|Review of the Translations on Forms].

After you finish translating the strings on the interface, when a user signs in to the portal and selects a local language for which you have translated strings, the application will use the translated strings. For the strings that are not translated, the system will display the string value in the default language (U.S. English).{br}

To keep the translated resources up to date, you can perform the following maintenance tasks as needed:[anchor|#_631bbc85-0840-4d57-8147-46935fb68a0b]
*Correct translations: When you or other person finds a mistake in the translation of an interface string, you can correct the translation right away. For details, see [[#_afd8b477-b0e7-4020-9984-1a1da3a6f5a4|Translation Correction].
*Update translations: After an update of Self-Service Portal you may need to update translations of the interface strings because some UI elements on forms may be changed. For more information, see [[#_7bcd3ae4-961c-435d-a76c-986be1ea62a8|Translation Update].
[anchor|#_3212a459-3f53-43e8-bac3-b6eb15ab4df3]
==Collection of the Strings for Translation==
During the string collection process, the system gathers all strings used on the portal (including the strings in customized system elements, such as forms) and prepares a string collection for translation. The collection process is resource- and time-consuming, and we recommend that you perform string collection only after you have installed the portal and after updates to collect the new and updated strings.{br}

Source strings include element labels, toolbar and menu items, drop-down list options, error messages, dialog box captions, and form names. When you localize the system for the first time or after you update your instance, you should collect all the strings used in the system for translation by clicking '''Collect Strings''' on the form toolbar on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) form.{br}

If you are collecting strings that were previously translated and if any of these strings has not been found during the new collection process, the system marks these strings as obsolete and displays them on the '''Obsolete''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] form.[anchor|#_204573b2-bd04-49c5-9324-41c4c8fd6785]
==String Translation==
Translation of the collected strings from U.S. English to any other language can be performed directly on Self-Service Portal. Alternatively, the filtered list of strings may be exported to an Excel file, and imported back after being translated by a third-party system (for details, see [[#_bbe747ca-15d6-466b-97c2-3379db022541|Export and Import of Strings]).{br}

Translating strings on Self-Service Portal is a straightforward process:[anchor|#_cd406a7e-e736-4988-bba3-3b494ceb960a]
#In the '''Default Values''' table of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) form, you type the translation for each string that must be translated in the ''&lt;Target Language&gt;'' column.
#For each string that does not require translation, you select the '''Do Not Translate''' check box.
#You save your changes.

For the detailed procedures that describe translating strings and excluding particular strings, see [HelpRoot_SS_Portal_Admin\SP__how_Translate_Bound_Strings|To Translate Bound Strings], [HelpRoot_SS_Portal_Admin\SP__how_Translate_Unbound_Strings|To Translate Unbound Strings], and [HelpRoot_SS_Portal_Admin\SP__how_Translate_Exclude|To Exclude Strings from Translation].{br}

After you add translations for a string in all the languages defined in the system or mark a string as not requiring translation and save the result, the string is removed from the work area. You can see the fully translated strings and the excluded strings by selecting the '''Show Localized''' and '''Show Excluded''' check boxes, respectively, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] form.{br}

We recommend that you pay attention to the following things when you translate the strings: how you filter strings to be translated, which special formatting you should use, and which strings you translate or do not translate. For more information, see [[#_4bc970dd-6caf-4aa5-b221-04fc019940b4|String Filter], [[#_8852a4c5-4361-4f93-b7e1-6282a42596d7|Special Formatting in Strings], and [[#_f3af1db4-2f5e-46c5-881d-a320005807da|Not Translated Strings].[anchor|#_bbe747ca-15d6-466b-97c2-3379db022541]
==Export and Import of Strings==
You can export strings, translate them by using third-party applications, and import them back into Self-Service Portal. Translated strings are loaded into the system as a locale dictionary and are immediately applied to the user interface once a user signs into the system by using a specific locale.{br}

You can also import the file with the translations into a new instance to speed up the translation process. The new instance should have the locale translations that you want to import.((({S:Warn}If the imported file includes strings that were not collected in the instance, these strings will be imported as unbound strings. This happens because the system cannot match the forms and the system resources associated with the imported strings. These strings are displayed on the interface similarly to the way other unbound strings are displayed, and you won&rsquo;t be able to use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40#_825716f3-f92e-47d2-9731-0cb4eb6c25a7|Usage Details Dialog Box] on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) form to quickly view the forms the strings are used on.
)))
To export and import strings, you use the corresponding buttons on the table toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] form.((({S:Warn}The exported file includes only the strings displayed in the table, based on the filtering applied on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] form.
)))[anchor|#_4bc970dd-6caf-4aa5-b221-04fc019940b4]
==String Filter==
The strings you see on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) form are filtered: You can see either ''bound'' or ''unbound'' strings. Bound strings are the strings associated with system resources bound to forms, such as table names. Unbound strings are the strings associated with resources that are not bound to forms, such as prompts. To translate all the strings on the interface, you should translate both the bound and unbound strings. The type of strings displayed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] form depends on whether the '''Show Only Unbound''' check box is selected in the Selection area of this form as follows:[anchor|#ul_x1p_gz3_5s]
*If the check box is cleared, the system displays only bound strings. For any bound string, you can get the context of the string: By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40#_825716f3-f92e-47d2-9731-0cb4eb6c25a7|Usage Details Dialog Box] dialog box, you can view the list of forms on which you can find the string and quickly navigate to any form in the list.
*:((({S:Warn}On Self-Service Portal, the contents of a form may be content-related and may depend on the system configuration and on the selections on the form itself. If you don&rsquo;t see the string immediately, you can check if this string is described in the reference topic for the form in help.
)))
*:Additionally, you can select a form in the '''Show Used in UI''' box in the Selection area of the form to view and translate only strings that are associated with the resources of the selected form.
*If the check box is selected, the system displays only unbound strings. Additionally, you can select which type (or types) of the unbound resources you want to view and translate.

To further narrow the displayed strings, you can use table filtering. For details, see the '''Filters''' topic in the Portal Interface Guide.[anchor|#_8852a4c5-4361-4f93-b7e1-6282a42596d7]
==Special Formatting in Strings==
If you open the list of collected strings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) form, you will see that the strings include the text itself and may include special formatting. The examples of the special formatting include the following:[anchor|#ul_zwy_ltd_vs]
*The ''-&gt;'' character: For commands in lists, the ''-&gt;'' character separates the name of the list from the command (for example, with ''State -&gt; Completed'', the ''State -&gt;'' part of the string is for informational purposes only). You should translate only the text after the ''-&gt;'' sign.
*HTML tags: Strings may include HTML tags that define the formatting of the string. For example, ''&lt;B&gt;'' and ''&lt;/B&gt;'' tags indicate that the enclosed text should be in bold type. You should keep these tags in the translated text in their respective places to keep the formatting.
*Placeholders that use the ''&rsquo;&#0123;&lt;number&gt;&#0125;&rsquo;'' format: These placeholders are replaced with the text when a user who works with the document gets the message. You must copy the placeholders without changes in the respective places in the translation.
*The ~ (tilde) character: When a message that you want to translate contains multiline text, the end of each line is indicated by the ~ character. You should use the tilde in the translated multiline text to mark the ends of lines.
*:((({S:Warn}If you do not mark the ends of lines with tildes in the translated text, the message will be displayed as one line for messages translated directly on Self-Service Portal, or the translation of this text will not be imported for messages translated in an external file (for example, in a Microsoft Excel workbook).
)))
[anchor|#_f3af1db4-2f5e-46c5-881d-a320005807da]
==Not Translated Strings==
In terms of the effect on the UI, there is no difference between a string with the '''Do Not Translate''' check box selected and a string left untranslated and with the '''Do Not Translate''' check box cleared: Either way, the user will see the value of the string in the default language. However, based on whether you select this check box, these strings are processed differently:[anchor|#_b1b40b1b-7b8d-4ddb-9881-7b6ff0f2faca]
*A string with the '''Do Not Translate''' check box selected is hidden from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) form until you select the '''Show Excluded''' check box. This string is considered valid when the system validates translation of strings on forms.
*A string that is not translated and for which the '''Do Not Translate''' check box is cleared appears on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] form when you select a language for translation. These strings are considered invalid, and warnings about these strings appear on the form when the system validates string translation on forms. 
*:((({S:Warn}For more information on the validation of translation of strings, see [[#_4e9f8b73-929a-4957-a4fc-848a09b572e1|Review of the Translations on Forms].
)))
[anchor|#_bfbbd09d-0b01-4d4a-b9b8-e770b70ae480]
==Multiple Occurrences of the Same String==
A string—such as an element label or a drop-down list option that is available on multiple forms—may be used in the interface multiple times. Depending on the context, the same string may require different translation. To address this situation, Self-Service Portal shows the resource or resources the string is associated with for each string listed in the '''Default Values''' table of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) form. These resources, which are displayed in the '''Key-Specific Values''' table, indicate the entities in which the specific string is used. You can provide correct translations for each occurrence of the string, depending on its context. ((({S:Warn}If you want to provide specific translations for different occurrences of a string, you must provide a generic translation in the '''Default Values''' table.
)))
The translation you specify in the '''Default Values''' table is generally applied to all occurrences of the string automatically. But if you type specific translations for certain occurrences in the '''Key-Specific Values''' table, the system will use the specific translations.[anchor|#_4e9f8b73-929a-4957-a4fc-848a09b572e1]
==Review of the Translations on Forms==
To check whether all the strings on a form are translated into a language defined in the system, you can turn on the validation of translations on forms for the language on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_50|System Locales] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200550|SM200550]) form in Acumatica ERP. For the detailed procedure, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Activate_Validation|To Turn On Validation of Translations].{br}

With the validation active, when you sign in with the language and open a form that has untranslated strings, you see a warning appear at the top of the form with the quantity of the untranslated strings. ((({S:Warn}The warnings appear for all users of the system who sign in with the language.
)))
You can click the warning to expand the list. Each warning includes the type and the details of the resource with which the untranslated string is associated and a link to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) form. You can click the link to quickly open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] form with the locale of the untranslated string selected, and then find and translate the string. ((({S:Warn}The strings with the '''Do Not Translate''' check box selected on the '''Collected''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] form are considered valid and are not listed in the warning.
)))
After you translate all strings into a language and validate the translations, you can turn off the validation of translations in Acumatica ERP, as described in [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__how_Deactivate_Validation|To Turn Off Validation of Translations].[anchor|#_afd8b477-b0e7-4020-9984-1a1da3a6f5a4]
==Translation Correction==
At any time during the translation process you may need to change the translation of a string—for example, to correct a typo. You can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) form to correct the translation. The steps to find and correct the translation depend on the string whose translation you want to correct:[anchor|#ul_vhj_rkj_5s]
*If the string has not been fully translated, you use the filtering options to find it and correct the translation.
*If the string has been fully translated and is hidden on the form, select the '''Show Localized''' check box to make the fully translated strings appear on the '''Collected''' tab, and then find the string and correct the translation.
*If the string has been wrongly marked as not requiring translation, you need to do the following:
**You select the '''Show Excluded''' check box to make the strings that do not require translation appear on the '''Collected''' tab.
**You find the string and clear the '''Do Not Translate''' check box for the string.
**In the '''Default Values''' table, you type the translation for each string that must be translated in the '''&#91;Target language&#93;''' column and save your changes.
**You clear the '''Show Excluded''' check box.

If you know when the translation has been added or modified, you can use filtering to view only strings with translations added and modified after the date by specifying the dates in the '''Created Since''' and '''Modified After''' boxes, respectively.[anchor|#_7bcd3ae4-961c-435d-a76c-986be1ea62a8]
==Translation Update==
Sometimes the values of particular strings change. For example, this may happen if the functionality of a form is changed during an update of Self-Service Portal or if a customization has been applied to a form by the customizers in-house. When you collect strings, if any of the previously translated strings have not been found during the new collection process, these strings are considered obsolete and are displayed on the '''Obsolete''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) form. Strings with new values appear on the '''Collected''' tab as untranslated strings.((({S:Warn}We recommend that you collect all strings in the system by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_40|Translation Dictionaries] form after every update of Self-Service Portal.
)))

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Translation Process  Acumatica Self-Service                         Portal     provides built-in localization functionality, so you can easily translate  Self-Service Portal into any     language without using third-party products. You can collect the strings used in the whole     system and translate them for any locale available in  Acumatica ERP. This topic explains how to translate interface strings by using the built-in localization     functionality of  Self-Service Portal. Overview of Translation Tasks On  Self-Service Portal,     various strings that are used in the portal interface—such as element and column labels, error     messages, and warnings—are stored within the code. When you initially translate the portal     interface, you need to perform the following tasks: Collect strings: You collect the strings that correspond to the application resources from      the code that you want to translate. For details, see  Collection of the Strings for Translation Collection of the Strings for Translation. Translate strings: You translate the collected strings on  Self-Service Portal or by      using an Excel file. For more information, see  String Translation String Translation. Optionally, handle multiple occurrences of the same string: You check whether the      translations of the strings that appear multiple times in the portal interface are appropriate      on all forms. For details, see  Multiple Occurrences of the Same String Multiple Occurrences of the Same String. Review the translations on forms: You review the forms to check whether all strings have      been translated. For more information, see  Review of the Translations on Forms Review of the Translations on Forms. After you finish translating the strings on the interface, when a user signs in to the portal     and selects a local language for which you have translated strings, the application will use the     translated strings. For the strings that are not translated, the system will display the string     value in the default language (U.S. English). To keep the translated resources up to date, you can perform the following maintenance tasks     as needed: Correct translations: When you or other person finds a mistake in the translation of an       interface string, you can correct the translation right away. For details, see  Translation Correction Translation Correction. Update translations: After an update of  Self-Service Portal you may       need to update translations of the interface strings because some UI elements on forms may be       changed. For more information, see  Translation Update Translation Update. Collection of the Strings for Translation During the string collection process, the system gathers all strings used on the portal     (including the strings in customized system elements, such as forms) and prepares a string     collection for translation. The collection process is resource- and time-consuming, and we     recommend that you perform string collection only after you have installed the portal and after     updates to collect the new and updated strings. Source strings include element labels, toolbar and menu items, drop-down list options, error     messages, dialog box captions, and form names. When you localize the system for the first time     or after you update your instance, you should collect all the strings used in the system for     translation by clicking  Collect Strings  on the form toolbar on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries (SM200540) form. If you are collecting strings that were previously translated and if any of these strings has     not been found during the new collection process, the system marks these strings as obsolete and     displays them on the  Obsolete  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries     form. String Translation Translation of the collected strings from U.S. English to any other language can be performed     directly on  Self-Service Portal.     Alternatively, the filtered list of strings may be exported to an Excel file, and imported back     after being translated by a third-party system (for details, see  Export and Import of Strings Export and Import of Strings). Translating strings on  Self-Service Portal is a     straightforward process: In the  Default Values  table of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries (SM200540) form, you type the translation for each string that must be      translated in the  <Target Language>  column. For each string that does not require translation, you select the  Do Not       Translate  check box. You save your changes. For the detailed procedures that describe translating strings and excluding particular     strings, see  To Translate Bound Strings,  To Translate Unbound Strings, and  To Exclude Strings from Translation. After you add translations for a string in all the languages defined in the system or mark a     string as not requiring translation and save the result, the string is removed from the work     area. You can see the fully translated strings and the excluded strings by selecting the       Show Localized  and  Show Excluded  check boxes,     respectively, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries form. We recommend that you pay attention to the following things when you translate the strings:     how you filter strings to be translated, which special formatting you should use, and which     strings you translate or do not translate. For more information, see  String Filter String Filter,  Special Formatting in Strings Special Formatting in Strings, and  Not Translated Strings Not Translated Strings. Export and Import of Strings You can export strings, translate them by using third-party applications, and import them back     into  Self-Service Portal.     Translated strings are loaded into the system as a locale dictionary and are immediately applied     to the user interface once a user signs into the system by using a specific locale. You can also import the file with the translations into a new instance to speed up the     translation process. The new instance should have the locale translations that you want to     import. If the imported file includes strings that were not collected in the instance, these     strings will be imported as unbound strings. This happens because the system cannot match the     forms and the system resources associated with the imported strings. These strings are displayed     on the interface similarly to the way other unbound strings are displayed, and you won't be able     to use the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Usage Details Dialog Box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries (SM200540) form to quickly view the forms the     strings are used on. To export and import strings, you use the corresponding buttons on the table toolbar of the        ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries form. The exported file includes only the strings displayed in the table, based on the filtering     applied on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries form. String Filter The strings you see on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries (SM200540) form are filtered:     You can see either  bound  or  unbound  strings. Bound strings are the strings     associated with system resources bound to forms, such as table names. Unbound strings are the     strings associated with resources that are not bound to forms, such as prompts. To translate all     the strings on the interface, you should translate both the bound and unbound strings. The type     of strings displayed on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries form depends on whether the       Show Only Unbound  check box is selected in the Selection area of this     form as follows: If the check box is cleared, the system displays only bound strings. For any bound string,      you can get the context of the string: By using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Usage Details Dialog Box dialog box, you can view the list of forms on which you can find the string and quickly      navigate to any form in the list. On  Self-Service Portal, the       contents of a form may be content-related and may depend on the system configuration and on       the selections on the form itself. If you don't see the string immediately, you can check if       this string is described in the reference topic for the form in help. Additionally,       you can select a form in the  Show Used in UI  box in the Selection area       of the form to view and translate only strings that are associated with the resources of the       selected form. If the check box is selected, the system displays only unbound strings. Additionally, you      can select which type (or types) of the unbound resources you want to view and translate. To further narrow the displayed strings, you can use table filtering. For details, see the       Filters  topic in the Portal Interface Guide. Special Formatting in Strings If you open the list of collected strings on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries (SM200540)     form, you will see that the strings include the text itself and may include special formatting.     The examples of the special formatting include the following: The  ->  character: For commands in lists, the  ->  character separates the name      of the list from the command (for example, with  State -> Completed , the  State       ->  part of the string is for informational purposes only). You should translate only      the text after the  ->  sign. HTML tags: Strings may include HTML tags that define the formatting of the string. For      example,  <B>  and  </B>  tags indicate that the enclosed text should be in      bold type. You should keep these tags in the translated text in their respective places to keep      the formatting. Placeholders that use the  '{<number>}'  format: These placeholders are replaced      with the text when a user who works with the document gets the message. You must copy the      placeholders without changes in the respective places in the translation. The ~ (tilde) character: When a message that you want to translate contains multiline text,      the end of each line is indicated by the ~ character. You should use the tilde in the      translated multiline text to mark the ends of lines. If you do not mark the ends of lines       with tildes in the translated text, the message will be displayed as one line for messages       translated directly on  Self-Service Portal, or the       translation of this text will not be imported for messages translated in an external file (for       example, in a Microsoft Excel workbook). Not Translated Strings In terms of the effect on the UI, there is no difference between a string with the       Do Not Translate  check box selected and a string left untranslated and     with the  Do Not Translate  check box cleared: Either way, the user will     see the value of the string in the default language. However, based on whether you select this     check box, these strings are processed differently: A string with the  Do Not Translate  check box selected is hidden from      the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries (SM200540) form until you select the  Show       Excluded  check box. This string is considered valid when the system validates      translation of strings on forms. A string that is not translated and for which the  Do Not Translate       check box is cleared appears on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries form when you select a      language for translation. These strings are considered invalid, and warnings about these      strings appear on the form when the system validates string translation on forms.  For       more information on the validation of translation of strings, see  Review of the Translations on Forms Review of the Translations on Forms. Multiple Occurrences of the Same String A string—such as an element label or a drop-down list option that is available on     multiple forms—may be used in the interface multiple times. Depending on the context, the     same string may require different translation. To address this situation,  Self-Service Portal shows the     resource or resources the string is associated with for each string listed in the       Default Values  table of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries     (SM200540) form. These resources, which are displayed in the  Key-Specific      Values  table, indicate the entities in which the specific string is used. You can     provide correct translations for each occurrence of the string, depending on its context.  If you want to provide specific translations for different occurrences of a string, you     must provide a generic translation in the  Default Values  table. The translation you specify in the  Default Values  table is generally     applied to all occurrences of the string automatically. But if you type specific translations     for certain occurrences in the  Key-Specific Values  table, the system will     use the specific translations. Review of the Translations on Forms To check whether all the strings on a form are translated into a language defined in the     system, you can turn on the validation of translations on forms for the language on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200550|SM200550]) System Locales (SM200550) form in  Acumatica ERP.     For the detailed procedure, see  To Turn On Validation of Translations. With the validation active, when you sign in with the language and open a form that has     untranslated strings, you see a warning appear at the top of the form with the quantity of the     untranslated strings.  The warnings appear for all users of the system who sign in with the language. You can click the warning to expand the list. Each warning includes the type and the details     of the resource with which the untranslated string is associated and a link to the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries (SM200540) form. You can click the link to quickly open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries form with the locale of the untranslated string selected, and then     find and translate the string.  The strings with the  Do Not Translate  check box selected on the       Collected  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries form are considered     valid and are not listed in the warning. After you translate all strings into a language and validate the translations, you can turn     off the validation of translations in  Acumatica ERP,     as described in   To Turn Off Validation of Translations. Translation Correction At any time during the translation process you may need to change the translation of a     string—for example, to correct a typo. You can use the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries     (SM200540) form to correct the translation. The steps to find and correct the translation     depend on the string whose translation you want to correct: If the string has not been fully translated, you use the filtering options to find it and      correct the translation. If the string has been fully translated and is hidden on the form, select the        Show Localized  check box to make the fully translated strings appear on      the  Collected  tab, and then find the string and correct the      translation. If the string has been wrongly marked as not requiring translation, you need to do the       following: You select the  Show Excluded  check box to make the strings that do        not require translation appear on the  Collected  tab. You find the string and clear the  Do Not Translate  check box for        the string. In the  Default Values  table, you type the translation for each        string that must be translated in the  [Target language]  column and        save your changes. You clear the  Show Excluded  check box. If you know when the translation has been added or modified, you can use filtering to view     only strings with translations added and modified after the date by specifying the dates in the       Created Since  and  Modified After  boxes,     respectively. Translation Update Sometimes the values of particular strings change. For example, this may happen if the     functionality of a form is changed during an update of  Self-Service Portal or if a     customization has been applied to a form by the customizers in-house. When you collect strings,     if any of the previously translated strings have not been found during the new collection     process, these strings are considered obsolete and are displayed on the       Obsolete  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries (SM200540) form.     Strings with new values appear on the  Collected  tab as untranslated     strings. We recommend that you collect all strings in the system by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200540|SM200540]) Translation Dictionaries form after every update of  Self-Service Portal.

==Descriptions of Inventory Items==
The descriptions of inventory items are displayed in the following elements on Self-Service Portal:[anchor|#_01f6b4d1-5b68-47c9-a2da-4beff12fc6ce]
*The '''Description''' column on the '''Catalog''' (SP700000) form: In this column, the system displays the values from the '''Description''' box of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) forms for the items defined in Acumatica ERP. (To open the forms, you navigate to '''Distribution''' > '''Inventory''' > '''Work Area''' > '''Manage'''.)
*The Description box in the '''Item Details''' dialog box: This column displays text added on the '''Description''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) forms in Acumatica ERP.

==Sales Categories==
In the '''Category''' box on the '''Catalog''' (SP700000) form of Self-Service Portal, users can select a sales category to filter inventory items. The categories are managed in the '''Description''' box, in the Summary area of the right pane of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_60|Item Sales Categories] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204060|IN204060]) form in Acumatica ERP. (To open the form, you navigate to '''Distribution''' > '''Inventory''' > '''Configuration''' > '''Manage'''.)
==Order Types==
The order types are displayed in the '''Type''' column on the '''My Orders''' (SP700003) form of Self-Service Portal. This column displays the values from the '''Description''' box of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form for order typed defined in Acumatica ERP. (To open the form, you navigate to '''Distribution''' > '''Sales Orders''' > '''Configuration''' > '''Setup'''.)
==Countries and States==
The system displays the list of countries in the '''Country''' box on multiple forms of Self-Service Portal, such as '''Company Profile''' (SP408030). This box displays one of the values from the '''Country''' box of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_40_00|Countries/States] ([~/?ScreenId=CS204000|CS204000]) form in Acumatica ERP.

The user interface of Self-Service Portal provides predefined user interface elements, such as workspaces and workspace tiles and links, which you can configure to adjust the user interface to the business processes of your organization. Because portal users can locate the forms they use most right away, they can perform their working tasks related to Self-Service Portal more easily.{br}

If your user account is assigned the ''Administrator'' or ''Portal Admin'' role, you customize the user interface in the special Menu Editing mode. The changes you make in this mode are applied to all users of Acumatica ERP.{br}

For the description of the user interface elements, see Self-Service Portal Interface in the Self-Service Portal Guide.{br}

In this topic, you will read about the capabilities in the system for customizing the user interface.{br}{TOC}
==Customization of the User Interface==
You can customize the user interface as follows:[anchor|#_60b6fc42-9307-4431-a8e8-bb30a142e528]
*Adjust the list of workspaces that are items on the main menu: You can keep in the user interface only the workspaces that correspond to the business processes of your organization. To perform this task, you can add new workspaces and populate them with items (tiles and links that provide access to forms), delete existing menu items for workspaces that do not comply with your business processes, and rename existing workspaces. For details, see [[#_ce60a6f0-56e6-44fb-b20f-3a0063d8ec39|Management of the Workspaces Listed on the Main Menu].
*Change the items of a workspace: You can customize a workspace so that only the items that portal users need to solve their tasks are displayed there. You can change the list of forms and dashboards in a workspace, regroup the links to forms in a workspace, reorder the links to forms in a category, remove unnecessary tiles and links to forms and dashboards from a workspace, and reorder tiles in a workspace. For more information, see [[#_c9acebc5-df19-4c66-8e09-4b123380478a|Management of Workspace Tiles and Links].

By using Menu Editing mode, you can customize the user interface in a variety of ways. To switch to this mode, on the main menu, you click the configuration menu button ([anchor|#_55f9375f-7fbb-4a10-a2f2-cdbb78a3972d][image:UserGuide/Images/Main_Menu_Dots.png|25px]) and then click '''Edit Menu'''.((({S:Warn}The '''Edit Menu''' item is available for only users with the ''Administrator'' or ''Portal Admin'' role.
)))
If you customize the user interface in this mode and then decide to return the initial state of the main menu and all workspaces, you can reset the menu settings to default. Changes in the following menu elements will be reset: [anchor|#_2857f336-086f-46e8-934e-9315ddc8785c]
*The list of workspaces that are items on the main menu and the '''More Items''' menu
*Items in each workspace, including categories, tiles, and links to forms and dashboards
*Items in quick menu of each workspace for all users of the system
*Workspaces pinned to the main menu and unpinned from the main menu for all users of the system

For details, see [HelpRoot_SS_Portal_Admin\SP__how_Reset_Menu_Settings|To Reset Menu Settings].[anchor|#_ce60a6f0-56e6-44fb-b20f-3a0063d8ec39]
==Management of the Workspaces Listed on the Main Menu==
The main menu is the primary navigation tool that you and portal use when you start working in Self-Service Portal. The system provides you with predefined workspaces list that is displayed in the main menu. The list of workspaces that a user sees by default is determined by the features enabled based on your Acumatica ERP license and the access rights of the user roles assigned to the particular user account.((({S:Warn}You must configure access rights for users to each form that belongs to a workspace. For details, see [HelpRoot_SS_Portal_Admin\SP__mng_Access|Managing Access to Self-Service Portal].
)))
If the default list of workspaces (that is, the items on the main menu) does not correspond to the business processes of your organization, you can configure the list as follows:[anchor|#_8aa21377-c78c-41aa-b793-7188779a49df]
*Rename existing workspaces: If a title of any existing workspace is not optimal for portal users, you can change the title to help users easily find the forms they need. For the steps you need to perform to rename a workspace, see [HelpRoot_SS_Portal_Admin\SP__how_Rename_Workspace|To Rename a Workspace].
*Delete existing workspaces: If a predefined workspace does not fit the business processes of your organization and will not be needed by portal users, you can completely delete it from the portal. When you delete a workspace, the system completely deletes tiles that belonged to the workspace, but forms and dashboards that belonged to the workspace remain in the system; you can add to other workspaces links to these forms and dashboards. For the procedure that describes how to delete a workspace, see [HelpRoot_SS_Portal_Admin\SP__how_Delete_Workspace|To Delete a Workspace].
*Add new workspaces: If your organization has a specific business process that requires forms and dashboards from different functional areas to be gathered on one menu for users&rsquo; convenience, you can create a custom workspace and pin it to the main menu panel. For details, see [HelpRoot_SS_Portal_Admin\SP__how_Add_Configure_Workspace|To Add and Configure a Workspace].
[anchor|#_c9acebc5-df19-4c66-8e09-4b123380478a]
==Management of Workspace Tiles and Links==
Workspaces are used in the system to organize links to forms and dashboards in a way that is convenient to users. By default, each workspace contains tiles (buttons that provide users with quick access to frequently used forms) and links to forms and dashboards grouped by categories (such as '''Profiles''' and '''Preferences'''). Each organization has its own business processes and uses sets of Self-Service Portal forms and dashboards based on these processes.{br}

To make a workspace convenient for portal users, you can do the following:[anchor|#_ca8ce07c-2db6-4669-bf80-122b539f3ed4]
*Change the default list of links to forms and dashboards displayed in a workspace: If you need different forms and dashboards to be displayed in a workspace, you can change the default list by showing the items that are hidden by default and hiding the items that are displayed by default. For details, see [HelpRoot_SS_Portal_Admin\SP__how_Display_Hide_Forms_in_Workspace_Menu|To Display and Hide Forms in a Workspace].
*Add new links to forms and dashboards to a workspace: If a link to a form and dashboard is not on a workspace by default but portal users want to have it in this workspace, you can add the required link to any Self-Service Portal form or dashboard to the workspace. For more information, see [HelpRoot_SS_Portal_Admin\SP__how_Add_Form_to_Workspace_Menu|To Add a Link to a Workspace].
*:((({S:Warn}If a link to a form is not added to any of workspaces you cannot find this form by using the '''Search''' box on the top pane of the Self-Service Portal screen.
)))
*Regroup links to forms and dashboards in a workspace: If the default grouping of links to forms and dashboards in a workspace is inconvenient for portal users, you can move these links to other existing categories, or create a category that fits the terminology used by portal users. Changes to grouping settings affect only the workspace in which they are changed. For details, see [HelpRoot_SS_Portal_Admin\SP__how_Regroup_Items_in_Workspace_Menu|To Regroup Forms in a Workspace ].
*:((({S:Warn}If you need to move a link to an existing category, which is displayed in a workspace, in the Menu Editing mode, you can simply drag the link to the category.
)))
*Reorder links to forms and dashboards in a category: In the Menu Editing mode, you can reorder links to forms and dashboards in a category by dragging each link to a necessary position.
*Remove links to forms and dashboards from a workspace: If you are sure that users will not need a particular link to a form or dashboard in a workspace, you can remove this link from the workspace. (The form or dashboard will remain in the system.) For more information, see [HelpRoot_SS_Portal_Admin\SP__how_Remove_Form_from_Workspace_Menu|To Remove a Form from a Workspace ].
*Delete preconfigured tiles: If portal users do not use functions preconfigured in tiles, you can delete the tiles from a workspace to have more space in the workspace. For details, see [HelpRoot_SS_Portal_Admin\SP__how_Delete_Tile_from_Workpace_Menu|To Delete a Tile from a Workspace ].
*:((({S:Hint}After you delete a tile, you will be able to restore it only when restoring menu settings to default.
)))
*Reorder tiles in a workspace: In the Menu Editing mode, you can reorder tiles in a workspace by dragging each tile to a necessary position.
