Before you can start using the e-commerce functionality of Acumatica ERP Commerce                         Edition, you need to set up a BigCommerce store, establish a connection between the Acumatica ERP instance and the BigCommerce store, and perform the initial configuration of the connection.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this section, you will learn what general steps are involved in establishing a connection between Acumatica ERP and the BigCommerce store and in performing the initial configuration of these systems.
==Steps for Establishing the Store Connection and Performing the Initial Configuration==
In order to connect the Acumatica ERP instance to the BigCommerce store, you perform the following general steps:[anchor|#_f1e4ba01-4f26-4ea3-b55b-38fe9ee31328]
#Set up a BigCommerce store.
#Obtain the BigCommerce API keys and WebDAV information.
#Prepare the Acumatica ERP instance.
#Establish the connection to the BigCommerce store.
#Perform the initial configuration of the store connection.
#Configure the entities enabled for synchronization.
#Start synchronizing data.

Each of these steps is described in greater detail below.
==Setup of a BigCommerce Store==
Before you can connect Acumatica ERP to a BigCommerce store, you need to set up the store. For a test implementation, we recommend that you sign up for a BigCommerce trial site. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_BigCommerce_Initial_Configuration_Set_Up_BC_Store_Activity|Initial Configuration: To Set Up a BigCommerce Store].
==Obtaining of the BigCommerce API Keys and WebDAV Information==
When you create a BigCommerce store in Acumatica ERP, you need to specify the following details:[anchor|#_fa13f27f-4025-4670-ab18-84bf5a081205]
*Store admin path, which is the URL of the BigCommerce store followed by ''/manage''
*API credentials (API path, client ID, and access token)
*WebDAV settings (WebDAV path, username, and password)

For details on obtaining API and WebDAV information, see [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_BigCommerce_Initial_Configuration_Implem_Activity|Initial Configuration: To Establish and Configure the Store Connection].
==Preparation of the Acumatica ERP Instance==
During the configuration of the connection to the BigCommerce store, you need to specify certain values coming from the Acumatica ERP instance, such as the numbering sequence to be used for generating the identifiers of customers imported from the BigCommerce store, and the payment methods that will be mapped to the payment methods configured in the BigCommerce store. Some of these values can be created on the fly. However, we recommend that the Acumatica ERP instance be prepared in advance. {br}

For more information, see [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_BigCommerce_Initial_Configuration_To_Prepare_Instance|Initial Configuration: To Prepare the Acumatica ERP Instance].
==Establishing of the Connection to the BigCommerce Store==
Once you have captured the API account details for your BigCommerce store, you proceed to set up the connection on the '''Connection Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_00|BigCommerce Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) form. You specify the store name, the admin path to the store, the API account details, and the WebDAV credentials to use for file transfer (that is, for uploading product images). Once you have specified these settings, you click '''Test Connection''' on the form toolbar to ensure that the data has been specified correctly.
==Initial Configuration of the Store Connection==
After you have successfully established a connection to the BigCommerce store, you can perform the basic required configuration. This step involves the following substeps:[anchor|#_72840e55-ef30-4adf-8fb1-9fb8800bb905]
#On the '''Entity Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_00|BigCommerce Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) form, you activate the needed entities—that is, you select the '''Active''' check box in the row of each entity whose records you want to synchronize between Acumatica ERP and the BigCommerce store. 
#:The synchronization of a particular entity may require that some other entities also be synchronized as a prerequisite. When you select the '''Active''' check box for such an entity, the system automatically selects it for all other required entities required as a prerequisite. Similarly, when you clear the '''Active''' check box for an entity that is a required entity for other entities, the check box becomes cleared for all dependent entities.
#:In this substep, you also review the following default synchronization settings for each entity for which the '''Active''' check box is selected, and make sure the default settings are appropriate for your configuration needs:
#*'''Sync Direction''': The direction of the synchronization, which can be ''Import'' (data is imported to Acumatica ERP), ''Export'' (data is exported to the BigCommerce store), and ''Bidirectional'' (data is both exported to the BigCommerce store and imported to Acumatica ERP).
#*'''Primary System''': The system, ''Local'' (Acumatica ERP) or ''External'' (the BigCommerce store), whose data takes precedence if conflicts occur during the synchronization.
#*'''Real-Time Import''': The status of the real-time import process. At the time of the initial configuration, this status is either ''Stopped''(that is, real-time synchronization is currently not running in the ''Import'' direction) or ''Not Supported'' (that is, real-time synchronization cannot be started in the ''Import'' direction).
#*'''Real-Time Export''': The status of the real-time export process. At the time of the initial configuration, this status is either ''Stopped'' (that is, real-time synchronization is currently not running in the ''Export'' direction) or ''Not Supported'' (that is, real-time synchronization cannot be started in the ''Export'' direction). 
#*'''Real-Time Mode''': The mode of the processing of the synchronization records, which can be either of the following:
#**''Prepare'': As soon as a push notification about a change to data is received, the corresponding synchronization record is placed in the processing queue.
#**''Prepare & Process'': As soon as a push notification about a change to data is received, the corresponding synchronization record is placed in the processing queue, and the data synchronization process is immediately started for the synchronization record.
#*'''Max. Number of Failed Attempts''': The maximum number of errors that are allowed during the import or export before the record is automatically skipped. By default, 5 attempts are allowed.
#:Although all settings except ''Real-Time Import'' and ''Real-Time Export'' can be changed, we recommend that you leave the default values during the initial configuration. For more information about configuring synchronization, see [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_BigCommerce_Data_Sync_GeneralInfo|Data Synchronization: General Information].
#On the '''Customer Settings''' tab, you specify the following settings, which will be applied to customers and customer locations imported from the BigCommerce store to Acumatica ERP:
#*'''Customer Class''': The customer class from which default customer settings will be populated for new customers that are imported from the BigCommerce store.
#*'''Customer Autonumbering''': The numbering sequence the system will use to automatically generate the identifiers of the customers that are imported from the BigCommerce store.
#*'''Location Autonumbering''': The numbering sequence the system will use to automatically generate identifiers of the customer locations (that is, addresses) that are imported from the BigCommerce store.
#*'''Generic Guest Customer''': The customer account to be used in orders placed in the BigCommerce store by non-registered customers. This customer account is used only if guest orders are allowed in the BigCommerce store.
#:If your company uses segmented keys that consist of multiple segments for customers and customer locations, you also need to specify the numbering templates in the '''Customer Numbering Template''' and '''Location Numbering Template''' boxes.
#On the '''Inventory Settings''' tab, you specify the following settings that apply to inventory items:
#*'''Default Stock Categories''' and '''Default Non-Stock Categories''': The sales item categories that are assigned to stock and non-stock items, respectively, when the items are exported to the BigCommerce store, if these items are not assigned any item sales category in Acumatica ERP.
#*'''Related Items''': The types of related items information about which can be exported to the BigCommerce store. In the drop-down list, you select the check box of each type of related items to be exported, and the system displays the selected categories in the box, separated by commas. You can select any of the following types:
#**''Cross-Sell''
#** ''Related''
#** ''Up-Sell''
#*:If an item is specified as a related item of any of the selected types for a stock item, non-stock item, or a template item on the '''Related Items''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]), or the[HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_30_00|Template Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN203000|IN203000]) form, information about this item is exported to the BigCommerce store during the synchronization of the ''Stock Item'', ''Non-Stock Item'', or ''Template Item'' entity, respectively.
#*'''Default Availability''': The default availability assigned to stock and non-stockitems exportedfromAcumatica ERP. You can select any of the following options:
#**''Available - Track Qty'': The exported items will be available in the store, and their quantity will be tracked.
#**''Available - Don&rsquo;t Track Qty'': The exported items will be available in the store, and their quantity will not be tracked.
#**''Pre-Order'': The exported items will be available for pre-order—that is, the '''Purchasability''' of the items in BigCommerce will be set to ''This product is coming soon but I want to take pre-orders''.
#**''Disabled'': The exported items will not be available for purchase—that is, the '''Purchasability''' setting of the items in BigCommerce will be set to ''This product cannot be purchased in my online store''.
#*:((({S:Warn}The default availability can be overridden for each particular item on the '''eCommerce''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form.
)))
#*:If you select ''Available - Track Qty'', in the '''When Qty Unavailable''' box, you also need to select the action to be taken ifafter the synchronization of the ''Product Availability'' entity, the item&rsquo;s available quantity becomes zero. You can select one of the following actions:
#**''Do Nothing'': The system should perform no action.
#**''Set as Disabled'': The system should make the item unavailable for purchase.
#**''Set as Pre-Order'': The system should make the item unavailable for purchase but available for pre-order.
#*'''Availability Mode''': You select which item quantities need to be synchronized with the BigCommerce store: all available items, items available for shipping, or items on hand.
#*'''Warehouse Mode''': You specify if you want to use all warehouses or only specific warehouses for quantity calculations. In the latter case, you need to specify the warehouses whose quantities are to be included in calculations.
#*:((({S:Warn}If ''Multiple Warehouse Locations'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can specify warehouse locations whose item quantities should be used for calculating the items' available quantities in the BigCommerce store.
)))
#On the '''Order Settings''' tab, you define default settings for the BigCommerce store as follows:
#*In the '''General''' section, you select the branch that will appear on sales orders imported from the BigCommerce store.
#*In the '''Order''' section, you select the order types for e-commerce orders and e-commerce returns, and you specify if discounts should be aggregated on the level of the entire document or for particular items in the order (if discounts are provided). Here you also select the non-stock item that will represent gift certificates that you can sell in the BigCommerce store and accept as payment.
#*In the '''Taxes''' section, you specify if taxes need to be synchronized with the BigCommerce store. If synchronization of taxes is enabled—that is, if the ''Synchronize Automatically'' or ''Synchronize Manually'' option is selected—you must also select the IDs of the primary tax zone and default tax zone. The primary tax zone, if specified, has precedence over the tax zone passed to Acumatica ERP through the API or calculated based on the customer&rsquo;s location or postal code and always applies to order lines in the imported sales orders. The default tax zone applies if no primary tax zone is specified and the tax zone can be calculated based on the customer&rsquo;s location or postal code.. In this section, you can also select the substitution lists that you will use to map tax codes and tax categories between Acumatica ERP and the BigCommerce store.
#*In the '''Shipping Option Mapping''' section, you specify the '''Ship Via''' options for the combinations of the shipping zone and shipping method configured in the BigCommerce store. For each combination of the store shipping zone and store shipping method, you can optionally specify the shipping zone and shipping terms to make the mapping more granular. The values specified in this table appear on the '''Shipping Settings''' tab of orders imported to Acumatica ERP from the BigCommerce store.
#On the '''Payment Settings''' tab, you map the payment methods defined in the BigCommerce store (that is, the values in the '''Store Payment Methods''' column) to the combination of the payment method and cash account defined in Acumatica ERP (that is, with the values in the '''Payment Method ID''' and '''Cash Account''' columns, respectively). You can indicate that payments by a specific payment method should be processed in Acumatica ERP by selecting the '''Active''' check box for a particular store payment method; you can also indicate that payments based on a specific payment method that are imported from the BigCommerce store should be released on import automatically by selecting the check box in the '''Release Payments''' column.
#On the form toolbar, you click '''Save''' to save the settings.

==Configuration of the Entities Enabled for Synchronization==
For each entity that you want to synchronize between Acumatica ERP and the BigCommerce store and that you have activated on the '''Entity Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_00|BigCommerce Stores] form, you can also set up the mapping of custom fields for synchronization and synchronization filtering settings on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) form.{br}

For more information about defining filtering and mapping settings for the needed entities, see [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_BigCommerce_Preparing_Entities_MapRef|Preparing Entities for Synchronization].
==Synchronization of Data==
After you have performed the initial configuration, you can start to synchronize data between Acumatica ERP and the BigCommerce store. First, you perform manual synchronization for entities in a specific order. Then you set up synchronization to run automatically, either in real-time or according to a specific schedule. For information about synchronization, see [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_BigCommerce_Data_Sync_GeneralInfo|Data Synchronization: General Information].]]></column>

Primary System : The system,  Local  ( Acumatica ERP) or  External  (the BigCommerce store), whose data takes precedence if               conflicts occur during the synchronization. Real-Time                  Import :               The status of the real-time import process. At the time of the initial configuration,               this status is either  Stopped (that               is, real-time synchronization is currently not running in the  Import  direction)                or  Not               Supported                (that is, real-time synchronization cannot be started in the  Import                direction) . Real-Time                  Export :               The status of the real-time export process. At the time of the initial configuration,               this status is either  Stopped  (that               is, real-time synchronization is currently not running in the  Export  direction)                or  Not               Supported                (that is, real-time synchronization cannot be started in the  Export                direction) .  Real-Time                 Mode :                The               mode of the processing of the synchronization records, which can be either of the                 following: Prepare : As soon as a push notification about a change to data is                   received, the corresponding synchronization record is placed in the processing                   queue. Prepare & Process : As soon as a push notification about a change to                   data is received, the corresponding synchronization record is placed in the                   processing queue, and the data synchronization process is immediately started for                   the synchronization record. Max.                 Number of Failed Attempts : The maximum number of               errors that are allowed during the import or export before the record is automatically               skipped. By default, 5 attempts are allowed.

For more information about configuring synchronization, see  Data Synchronization: General Information. On the  Customer Settings  tab, you specify the following settings,           which will be applied to customers and customer locations imported from the BigCommerce           store to  Acumatica ERP: Customer Class : The customer class from which default               customer settings will be populated for new customers that are imported from the               BigCommerce store. Customer Autonumbering : The numbering sequence the system               will use to automatically generate the identifiers of the customers that are imported               from the BigCommerce store. Location Autonumbering : The numbering sequence the system               will use to automatically generate identifiers of the customer locations (that is,               addresses) that are imported from the BigCommerce store. Generic Guest Customer : The customer account to be used in               orders placed in the BigCommerce store by non-registered customers. This customer               account is used only if guest orders are allowed in the BigCommerce store. If your company uses segmented keys that consist of multiple segments for             customers and customer locations, you also need to specify the numbering templates in             the  Customer Numbering Template  and  Location Numbering               Template  boxes. On the  Inventory Settings  tab, you specify the following settings           that apply to inventory items: Default Stock Categories  and  Default Non-Stock                 Categories : The sales item categories that are assigned to stock and               non-stock items, respectively, when the items are exported to the BigCommerce store,               if these items are not assigned any item sales category in  Acumatica ERP. Related Items : The types of related items information about               which can be exported to the BigCommerce store.

You can select any of the               following types: Cross-Sell Related Up-Sell If an item is specified as a related item of any of the selected types for a                 stock item, non-stock item, or a template item on the  Related                   Items  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500),   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000), or the  ([~/?ScreenId=IN203000|IN203000]) Template Items                 (IN203000) form, information about this item is exported to the BigCommerce store                 during the synchronization of the  Stock Item ,  Non-Stock Item , or                    Template Item  entity, respectively. Default Availability : The default availability assigned to                stock                and non-stock items  exported from Acumatica ERP. You can select any of the following                 options: Available - Track Qty : The exported items will be available in the store,                   and their quantity will be tracked. Available - Don't Track Qty : The exported items will be available in the                   store, and their quantity will not be tracked. Pre-Order : The exported items will be available for pre-order—that is,                   the  Purchasability  of the items in BigCommerce will be set                   to  This product is coming soon but I want to take pre-orders . Disabled : The exported items will not be available for purchase—that is,                   the  Purchasability  setting of the items in BigCommerce will                   be set to  This product cannot be purchased in my online store . The                 default availability can be overridden for each particular item on the                    eCommerce  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items or                     ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items                 form. If                 you select  Available - Track Qty , in the  When Qty                   Unavailable  box, you also need to select the action to be taken  if after                 the synchronization of the  Product Availability  entity,  the                 item 's                 available quantity becomes                 zero .                  You can select one of the following                 actions: Do Nothing : The system should perform no action. Set as Disabled : The system should make the item unavailable for                   purchase. Set as Pre-Order : The system should make the item unavailable for                   purchase but available for pre-order. Availability Mode : You select which item quantities need to               be synchronized with the BigCommerce store: all available items, items available for               shipping, or items on hand. Warehouse Mode : You specify if you want to use all warehouses               or only specific warehouses for quantity calculations. In the latter case, you need to               specify the warehouses whose quantities are to be included in                 calculations. If                    Multiple Warehouse Locations  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS101000) form, you can specify warehouse locations                 whose item quantities should be used for calculating the items' available quantities                 in the BigCommerce store. On the  Order Settings  tab, you define default settings for the           BigCommerce store as follows: In the  General  section, you select the branch that will               appear on                sales                orders                imported               from the BigCommerce               store . In the  Order  section, you select the order types for               e-commerce orders and e-commerce returns, and you specify if discounts should be               aggregated on the level of the entire document or for particular items in the order               (if discounts are provided). Here you also select the non-stock item that will               represent gift               certificates                that you can sell in the BigCommerce store and accept as               payment . In the  Taxes  section, you specify if taxes need to be               synchronized with the BigCommerce store. If synchronization of taxes is enabled—that               is, if the  Synchronize Automatically  or  Synchronize Manually  option is               selected—you must also                select                the               ID s                of the                primary               tax zone and  default tax zone.                The               primary tax zone, if specified, has precedence over the tax zone passed to  Acumatica ERP through the API or calculated based on the customer's location or postal code and               always applies to order lines in the imported sales orders. The default tax zone               applies if no primary tax zone is specified and the tax zone can be calculated based               on the customer's location or postal               code. .                In this section, you can also select the substitution lists that you will use to map               tax codes and tax categories between  Acumatica ERP and the BigCommerce store. In the  Shipping                  Option                  Mapping  section, you specify the  Ship Via  options               for the combinations of the shipping zone and shipping method configured in the               BigCommerce store. For each combination of the store shipping zone and store shipping               method, you can optionally specify the shipping zone and shipping terms to make the               mapping more granular. The values specified in this table appear on the                  Shipping Settings  tab of orders imported to  Acumatica ERP from the BigCommerce store. On the  Payment Settings  tab, you map the payment methods defined           in the BigCommerce store (that is, the values in the  Store Payment             Methods  column) to the combination of the payment method and cash account           defined in  Acumatica ERP (that is, with the values in the  Payment Method ID  and              Cash Account  columns, respectively). You can indicate that           payments by a specific payment method should be processed in  Acumatica ERP by selecting the              Active            check box for a particular store payment method; you can also indicate that payments based           on a specific payment method that are imported from the BigCommerce store should be           released on import automatically by selecting the check box in the  Release             Payments  column. On the form toolbar, you click  Save  to save the settings. Configuration of the Entities Enabled for Synchronization For each entity that you want to synchronize between  Acumatica ERP and the BigCommerce store and that you have activated on the  Entity           Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) BigCommerce Stores form, you can also set up         the mapping of custom fields for synchronization and synchronization filtering settings on         the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) Entities (BC202000) form. For more information about defining filtering and mapping settings for the needed entities,         see  Preparing Entities for Synchronization. Synchronization of Data After you have performed the initial configuration, you can start to synchronize data         between  Acumatica ERP and the BigCommerce store.          First,         you perform manual synchronization for entities in a specific order.  Then         you set up synchronization to run automatically, either in real-time or according to a         specific schedule. For information about synchronization, see  Data Synchronization: General Information. ]]></column>

))){br}{TOC}
==Setting Up a BigCommerce Store==
You use the control panel in BigCommerce to initially set up and configure your store, as well as to perform ongoing management of products, customers, and orders. By using the control panel, you set up the BigCommerce store by performing the following general steps:[anchor|#_62c4dfce-ced2-481f-9d18-7205751abb9b]
#Signing up for a BigCommerce account
#Completing the store profile
#Setting up the currencies in which goods will be available for purchase and the payment methods that you will accept
#Setting up taxes
#Configuring the shipping zones and shipping rules

==Signing Up for a BigCommerce Trial Account==
Before you implement the integration with Acumatica ERP on the production BigCommerce store, we recommend that you test your desired configuration in a test environment. To do that, you need a free BigCommerce trial account, which you can sign up for on the [https://www.bigcommerce.com/essentials/free-trial/|BigCommerce Essentials Trial] page. The registration requires that you provide a valid email address, the name of your store (which you can change at any time), your name and contact details, and your admin password. {br}

For information about the detailed steps that you need to complete to create a trial account, see the [https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Starting-a-Bigcommerce-Triall#creating|BigCommerce documentation].
==Completing the Store Profile==
After you have created a new BigCommerce store, you need to set it up so that you can accept and process orders. The first thing you should do is complete the store&rsquo;s profile on the '''Store Profile''' page, which you access by clicking '''Store Setup''' > ''' Store Profile''' in the left pane. Here you can specify such settings as the store name, store address, store country, contact email address, and contact phone. It is important to specify the store country early in the setup process because this setting determines which payment gateways or shipping providers are available for use in your store.
==Setting Up Currencies and Payment Methods==
You set up the currencies that your store’s customers will see and can be charged in on the '''Currencies''' page, which you open by clicking '''Store Setup''' > ''' Currencies''' in the left pane. {br}

You can configure multiple currencies to be used as display currencies and transaction currencies in your store. The default currency is determined based on the store&rsquo;s general settings; however, it can be changed. For each currency that you want to use as a transactional currency in your store, at least one acceptable payment method must be configured. {br}

You should check and, if necessary, update the display settings of the default currency, and then configure at least one payment method for this currency on the '''Payment Methods''' page, which you can open by clicking '''Store Setup''' > ''' Payments''' in the left pane. {br}

For more information about working with currencies in BigCommerce, see [https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Managing-Currencies|Managing Currencies] in the BigCommerce documentation. For details on payment methods, see [https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Offline-Payment-Methods|Payment Methods].
==Configuring Taxes==
You set up tax zones, tax calculation rules, the way of displaying taxes in the storefront, and the way of specifying prices for products (that is, whether prices are entered inclusive or exclusive of tax) on the '''Tax''' page, which you can open by clicking '''Store Setup''' > ''' Tax''' in the left pane.{br}

For more information about configuring taxes, see [https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Tax-Overview|Tax Overview] in the BigCommerce documentation.
==Configuring Shipping==
BigCommerce provides a wide range of shipping options that you can flexibly configure to your needs. On the '''Shipping Setup''' page, which you open by clicking '''Store Setup''' > ''' Shipping''' in the left pane, you specify the place where you will ship your products from, as well as the shipping zones and shipping rules. {br}

For information about configuring shipping, see [https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Shipping-Setup|Shipping Setup] in the BigCommerce documentation.
==Deleting Existing Orders, Products, Product Categories, Customers, and Customer Groups==
When you first create a BigCommerce store, it might contain some pre-populated data to help you get started. Before you begin implementing the BigCommerce integration with Acumatica ERP, you might want to delete customers, customer groups, products, product categories, and orders that already exist in the store. Deleting these entities from the store will reduce the amount of data that needs to be synchronized; thus, you can more easily see which data comes from which system when you configure synchronization between Acumatica ERP and the BigCommerce store. {br}

You delete customers, products, product categories, and orders as follows:[anchor|#_f1debb68-3f54-41f8-b46d-707dfd261d2f]

*To delete product categories and products in them, you click '''Products''' > ''' Product Categories''' in the left pane to open the '''Product Categories''' page. On this page, you select the unlabeled check box for all product categories in the list and then click the Delete button. In the '''Reassign Products in Categories Marked for Deletion''' dialog box, which opens, you select the '''Delete products in these categories''' option button and click '''OK'''.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
In this activity, you will go through the settings that need to be specified in the Acumatica ERP instance before you set up the connection to the BigCommerce store.
==Story==
The SweetLife company is planning on opening an online store built on the BigCommerce platform. The warehouse from which the goods will be shipped is based in New York. The company maintains the prices of its products in United States dollars and delivers products across New York by using the company&rsquo;s own vehicles. As an implementation consultant helping SweetLife to implement the integration between BigCommerce and Acumatica ERP, you want to make sure that the features required for the e-commerce functionality are enabled and the necessary entities are created and configured in the Acumatica ERP instance.
==Process Overview==
The Acumatica ERP instance with the ''U100'' dataset already contains most of the settings and data that you will need to specify when you start configuring the store connection. In this activity, you will review the following settings or entities on the following forms of the Acumatica ERP instance:[anchor|#_1e592139-d036-4db8-a531-ee951aab1d05]
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form: The features that have been enabled to support e-commerce functionality
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_10_00|Customer Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR201000|AR201000]) form: The customer class for the customers imported from the BigCommerce store
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_10_10|Numbering Sequences] ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) form: The numbering sequences to be used for generating the identifiers for new customers and customer locations imported from the BigCommerce store
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form: The customer account to be used for guest orders (orders placed by unregistered users) in the online store
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_60|Item Sales Categories] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204060|IN204060]) form: The item sales category to be used as the default sales category; items that have no item sales category in Acumatica ERP will be displayed under this category in the online store
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form: The order type to be used for orders imported from the BigCommerce store, and the order type to be used for handling returns of online purchases
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_75_00|Ship via Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]): The carrier to be used for handling shipping
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_20_00|Cash Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CA202000|CA202000]): The cash account to be used for e-commerce orders
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_40_00|Payment Methods] ([~/?ScreenId=CA204000|CA204000]): The payment method to which payment methods from the BigCommerce store will be mapped

==System Preparation==
Sign in to the Acumatica ERP instance with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded by using the ''gibbs''username and the ''123'' password.
==Step 1: Enabling the Needed Features==
To make sure the needed features for e-commerce functionality have been enabled, do the following:[anchor|#_7ed2d626-e797-4a7d-b611-2db60feedc15]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
#Make sure that the following features are enabled:
#*''Inventory''
#* ''Business Account Locations''
#* ''Commerce Integration''
#* ''BigCommerce Connector''
#:If any of these features is not enabled, click '''Modify''' on the table toolbar, select the check box that activates the feature, and click '''Enable''' on the form toolbar.
#:((({S:Warn}Depending on the setup of your BigCommerce store and the inventory and order management processes in your company, you might need to enable additional features. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_BigCommerce_Initial_Configuration_Implem_Checklist|Initial Configuration: Implementation Checklist].
)))

==Step 2: Reviewing the Customer Class for Customers Imported from BigCommerce==
During the process of establishing and configuring the connection between Acumatica ERP and the BigCommerce store, you will need to specify the customer class that will be used for creating customer records for customers imported from BigCommerce. You can use an existing customer class or create a new one with a different set of default settings to be used specifically for online customers. In the instance with the ''U100'' data preloaded, a dedicated customer class for online customers has already been created. {br}

To review the customer class that will be used for customers imported from BigCommerce, do the following:[anchor|#_0a625ccf-14f4-4a21-8588-ed843aaec26a]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_10_00|Customer Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR201000|AR201000]) form.
#In the '''Class ID''' box, select ''ECCUSTOMER''.
#:The system will use the settings of this customer class to populate customer records for new customers that will be imported from the BigCommerce store to Acumatica ERP.

==Step 3: Reviewing the Numbering Sequences for Customers and Customer Locations==
To review the numbering sequences that Acumatica ERP will use to assign identifiers to customers and customer addresses imported from the BigCommerce store, do the following:[anchor|#_5892801f-292e-4336-9315-ba924470abb2]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_10_10|Numbering Sequences] ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) form.
#In the '''Numbering ID''' box, select ''ECCUSTOMER''.
#:Review the settings of the numbering sequence that will be used to automatically generate the identifiers of the customers imported from the BigCommerce store to Acumatica ERP. With these settings, these customers will be assigned identifiers that start with the letter ''C'' followed by a numerical portion.
#In the '''Numbering ID''' box, select ''ECLOCATION''.
#:Review the settings of the numbering sequence that will be used to automatically generate the identifiers of the customer locations imported from the BigCommerce store to Acumatica ERP. With these settings, these customer locations will be assigned identifiers that start with the letter ''L'' followed by a numerical portion.

==Step 4: Reviewing the Customer Record to be Used for Guest Orders==
SweetLife&rsquo;s online store is going to accept guest orders: orders from customers who are not registered in the store. During the configuration of the store connection, you will need to select the customer record in Acumatica ERP that will appear in orders that are placed as guest orders in the BigCommerce store. In the instance with the ''U100'' data preloaded, the generic online customer account has already been created.{br}

To review the customer account that will be used for guest orders, do the following:[anchor|#_3c680e7e-ac8a-40fb-970d-e7d158053640]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form.
#In the Summary area, in the '''Customer ID''' box, select ''ECOMGUEST''.
#:This customer will appear on all orders imported from the BigCommerce store that were placed in the store by non-registered customers.

==Step 5: Reviewing the Item Sales Categories==
To review the inventory-related settings that you will need to specify during the configuration of the store connection, do the following:[anchor|#_9d15e8b2-63a6-42cc-8a20-681fb569b9b4]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_60|Item Sales Categories] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204060|IN204060]) form.
#In the tree on the left, select ''Other''.
#:Notice that the '''Category Members''' table does not contain any stock or non-stock items assigned to it. You will select this category in a subsequent activity to make stock and non-stock items that do not have their own categories appear under the ''Other'' category after they are imported to the BigCommerce store.

==Step 6: Reviewing the Order Settings==
In order to review the order types created for the orders coming from the BigCommerce store, do the following:[anchor|#_791c1a70-e014-4bf4-81ff-e007654de055]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form.
#In the '''Order Type''' box, select ''EO - eCommerce Order''.
#Review the order type settings.
#:In a subsequent activity, you will configure the system to assign this order type to all orders imported from the BigCommerce store.
#In the '''Order Type''' box, select ''ER - eCommerce CR Order''.
#:In the '''Order Template''' box notice that this order type is based on the ''CR'' order template. In a subsequent activity, you will specify this order type to be used for all returns of products purchased in the BigCommerce store.

==Step 7: Reviewing the Shipping Settings==
To review the Acumatica ERP shipping settings that you will need to specify during the configuration of the store connection, do the following:[anchor|#_394cd533-8041-427c-ab82-9f351bb6dfae]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_75_00|Ship via Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]) form.
#In the '''Ship Via''' box, select ''LOCAL''.
#:Because SweetLife is going to deliver the products by using only its own fleet of vehicles, you will specify this shipping option when you configure the store connection.

==Step 8: Reviewing the Cash Account and Payment Method Settings==
To review the payment method in Acumatica ERP that will be mapped to the BigCommerce payment methods configured in the online store, do the following:[anchor|#_2d933a19-8207-4744-af16-3fc0d97bf8d8]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_40_00|Payment Methods] ([~/?ScreenId=CA204000|CA204000]) form.
#In the '''Payment Method ID''' box, select ''ONLINE''.
#:For simplicity, this payment method will be mapped to all payment methods configured in the BigCommerce store. On the '''Allowed Cash Accounts''' tab, notice that the table contains only one cash account, ''10250ST - Company Merchant Account''.
#In the '''Cash Account''' column, click the link with the cash account name.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_20_00|Cash Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CA202000|CA202000]) form, which opens in a pop-up window, review the cash account settings.
#:In the Summary area, notice that the ''10250ST'' cash account has been configured for the ''USD'' currency and the ''RETAIL'' branch.

Next, you should proceed to the next activity, [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_BigCommerce_Initial_Configuration_To_Capture_Connection_Info|Initial Configuration: To Capture Store Connection Information]. In this activity, you will learn how to capture the store&rsquo;s API and WebDAV information required for establishing the connection between your instance of Acumatica ERP and the BigCommerce store.]]></column>

Depending on the setup of your BigCommerce store and the                         inventory and order management processes in your company, you might need to                         enable additional                         features.                          For more information, see  Initial Configuration: Implementation Checklist. Step 2: Reviewing the Customer Class for Customers Imported from                 BigCommerce During the process of establishing and configuring the connection between  Acumatica ERP and the BigCommerce store, you will need to specify the customer class that will                 be used for creating customer records for customers imported from BigCommerce. You                 can use an existing customer class or create a new one with a different set of                 default settings to be used specifically for online customers.

To review the customer account that will be used for guest orders, do the                 following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000) form. In the Summary area, in the  Customer ID  box, select                          ECOMGUEST . This customer will appear on all orders imported from                         the BigCommerce store that were placed in the store by non-registered customers. Step 5: Reviewing the Item Sales Categories To review the inventory-related settings that you will need to specify during the                 configuration of the store connection, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204060|IN204060]) Item Sales Categories (IN204060) form. In the tree on the left, select  Other . Notice that the                              Category Members  table does not contain any stock                         or non-stock items assigned to it. You will select this category in a                         subsequent activity to make stock and non-stock items that do not have their                         own categories appear under the  Other  category after they are                         imported to the BigCommerce store. Step 6: Reviewing the Order Settings In order to review the order types created for the orders coming from the BigCommerce                 store, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form. In the  Order Type  box, select  EO - eCommerce                     Order . Review                     the order type settings. In a                         subsequent activity, you will configure the system to assign this order type                         to all orders imported from the BigCommerce store. In the  Order Type  box, select  ER - eCommerce                          CR                          Order . In                         the  Order Template  box notice that this order type is                         based on the  CR  order template.  In a subsequent                         activity, you will specify this order type to be used for all returns of                         products purchased in the BigCommerce store. Step 7: Reviewing the Shipping Settings To review the  Acumatica ERP shipping settings that you will need to specify during the configuration of the                 store connection, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]) Ship via Codes (CS207500) form. In the  Ship Via  box, select  LOCAL . Because                         SweetLife is going to deliver the products by using only its own fleet of                         vehicles, you will specify this shipping option when you configure the store                         connection. Step 8: Reviewing the Cash Account and Payment Method Settings To review the payment method in  Acumatica ERP that will be mapped to the BigCommerce payment methods configured in the online                 store, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA204000|CA204000]) Payment Methods (CA204000) form. In the  Payment Method ID  box, select  ONLINE . For                         simplicity, this payment method will be mapped to all payment methods                         configured in the BigCommerce store. On the  Allowed Cash                             Accounts  tab, notice that the table contains only one cash                         account,  10250ST - Company Merchant Account . In the  Cash Account  column, click the link with the cash                     account name. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA202000|CA202000]) Cash Accounts (CA202000) form, which opens in a pop-up                     window, review the cash account settings. In the Summary area, notice that the                              10250ST  cash account has been configured for the  USD                          currency and the  RETAIL  branch. Next, you should proceed to the next activity,  Initial Configuration: To Capture Store Connection Information. In this activity, you will learn how to capture the store's API and WebDAV                 information required for establishing the connection between your instance of  Acumatica ERP and the BigCommerce store. ]]></column>

==Step 3: Specifying the Customer Settings==
To specify the settings that will be used by default for importing customers from the BigCommerce store to Acumatica ERP, do the following:[anchor|#_35bd6c0e-f09e-4762-897f-3f824cd03c17]
#While you are still on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_00|BigCommerce Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) form, open the '''Customer Settings''' tab.
#In the '''Customer''' section, select the following values:
#*'''Customer Class''': ''ECCUSTOMER''
#*:This is the default customer class based on which customer records will be created in Acumatica ERP for customers imported from the online store.
#*'''Customer Autonumbering''': ''ECCUSTOMER''
#*:This numbering sequence has been configured in Acumatica ERP to automatically generate identifiers for customer records imported from the BigCommerce store.
#*'''Location Autonumbering''': ''ECLOCATION''
#*:This numbering sequence has been configured in Acumatica ERP to automatically generate identifiers for customer location records in orders imported from the BigCommerce store.
#*'''Generic Guest Customer''': ''ECOMGUEST''
#*:This customer account, which has been created in Acumatica ERP, will appear on orders imported from the BigCommerce stores and placed by non-registered users. This account will be used only if placing guest orders is allowed in the BigCommerce store.

==Step 4: Specifying the Inventory Settings==
To specify the inventory-related settings, do the following:[anchor|#_676c7f4c-4763-4e00-a539-606757c414bb]
#While you are still on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_00|BigCommerce Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) form, open the '''Inventory Settings''' tab.
#In the '''Inventory Settings''' section, specify the following settings:
#*'''Default Stock Categories''': ''Other''
#*:Here you select the check box or check boxes corresponding to the sales categories that will be assigned by default to stock items exported to the online store if no sales category has been assigned to them in Acumatica ERP.
#*'''Default Non-Stock Categories''': ''Other''
#*:In this box, too, you select the check box or check boxes corresponding to the sales category or sales categories that will be assigned to non-stock items exported to the online store if no sales category has been assigned to them in Acumatica ERP.
#*'''Default Availability''': ''Available - Don&rsquo;t Track Qty''
#*:This availability option will be assigned by default to stock items and non-stock items if no other availability option has been selected for these items on the'''eCommerce''' tab of the[HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) forms, respectively.
#*'''Availability Mode''': ''Available for Shipping''
#*:This setting controls how the system calculates inventory levels. ''Available for Shipping'' means that the availability of an item is calculated based on only units that are available for shipping. For the purposes of this activity, you can leave this setting as it is.
#*'''Warehouse Mode''': ''All''
#*:This setting controls which warehouses are used for calculations of item quantities. ''All'' means that item quantities are calculated based on the items in all warehouses. For the purposes of this activity, you can leave this setting as it is.

==Step 5: Specifying the Order Settings==
To specify the order-related settings, do the following:[anchor|#_9a0a5ff1-e1d0-4532-a5e3-8630f46cbaa6]
#While you are still on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_00|BigCommerce Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) form, open the '''Order Settings''' tab.
#In the '''General''' section, in the '''Branch''' box, select ''RETAIL''.
#:This branch will be inserted by default in sales orders imported from the BigCommerce store.

#*'''Order Type''': ''EO - eCommerce Order''
#*:This order type has been configured specifically for sales orders imported from BigCommerce stores.
#*'''Return Order Type''': ''ER - eCommerce CR Order''
#*:This order type will be used for creating return orders for returns initiated in the BigCommerce store.
#In the '''Taxes''' section, in the '''Synchronize Taxes''' box, select ''Do Not Synchronize''.
#:For simplicity, during the initial setup of the BigCommerce store, configuration of taxes has been skipped. Hence, you do not need to configure the synchronization of taxes at this point.
#In the '''Shipping Option Mapping''' section, map the shipping methods configured in BigCommerce with the Ship Via options in Acumatica ERP as follows.
#:{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="20%" ! Store Shipping Zone
!width="20%" ! Store Shipping Method
!width="20%" ! Ship Via
!width="20%" ! Shipping Zone
!width="20%" ! Ship Terms
|- 
| ''United States''
|  ''Free Shipping''
|  ''LOCAL''
| Empty
| Empty
|}
#:For the purposes of this activity, leave the '''Shipping Zone''' and '''Ship Terms''' columns empty.

==Step 6: Configuring the Payment Method Mapping==If you want to import payments based on a particular payment method configured in the store to Acumatica ERP, you need to map the payment method to a corresponding payment method configured in Acumatica ERP. To configure the payment method mapping, do the following:[anchor|#_02c971a0-9806-424a-a969-35a0c594c393]
#While you are still on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_00|BigCommerce Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) form, open the '''Payment Settings''' tab.
#In the '''Payment Methods''' section, in the '''Base Currency Payment Methods''' table, map the payment method set up in BigCommerce with the payment method configured in Acumatica ERP as follows.

|- 
!width="16%" ! Active
!width="16%" ! Store Payment Method
!width="16%" ! Payment Method ID
!width="16%" ! Cash Account
!width="16%" ! Currency
!width="16%" ! Release Payments
|- 
| Selected
| ''Pay in Store''
| ONLINE
| 10250ST
| USD
| Cleared
|}
#:With these settings, the payments made with the ''Pay in Store'' payment method in the BigCommerce store will be imported to Acumatica ERP for further processing. On imported sales orders and payments made with this payment method, the mapped payment method, ''ONLINE'', will be displayed.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save''' to save your changes.
#:Now that the initial configuration is complete, you can move on to synchronize your data for the first time. For information on data synchronization, see [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_BigCommerce_Data_Sync_GeneralInfo|Data Synchronization: General Information] and [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_BigCommerce_Data_Sync_First_Sync|Data Synchronization: To Perform the First Synchronization].

On the  Connection Settings  tab, use the information that                     you have captured while completing  Initial Configuration: To Capture Store Connection Information to specify the settings as follows: In the  Store Admin Path  box, enter the path of                             your BigCommerce store followed by  /manage . In the  REST Settings  section, specify                                  API Path ,  Client ID ,                             and  Access Token . You need to specify the                                 API path without the API version. In the  WebDAV Settings  section, specify                                  WebDAV Path ,  WebDAV                                 Username , and  WebDAV                             Password . Click  Save  to save your changes. On the form toolbar, click  Test Connection  to check if                     you have specified the connection settings correctly. If the connection test                         is successful, you can proceed to specifying the required settings for                         entities, customers, inventory, orders, and payments. Step 2: Specifying the Entity Settings Steps 2 through 6 must be completed together. You will not be                 able to save the changes until all required boxes on these tabs of the form are                 filled in. Do the following to specify the entity settings: While you are still on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) BigCommerce Stores (BC201000) form, open                     the  Entity Settings  tab. In the table, select the check box in the  Active  column                     for all entities. The table displays all entities that are supported by the                         BigCommerce connector and their default settings (such as, the                         synchronization direction and primary system). For the purposes of this                         activity, you can leave the default settings as they are. Step 3: Specifying the Customer Settings To specify the settings that will be used by default for importing customers from the                 BigCommerce store to  Acumatica ERP, do the following: While you are still on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) BigCommerce Stores (BC201000) form, open                     the  Customer Settings  tab. In the  Customer  section, select the following values: Customer Class :  ECCUSTOMER This is the                                 default customer class based on which customer records will be                                 created in  Acumatica ERP for customers imported from the online store. Customer Autonumbering :  ECCUSTOMER This                                 numbering sequence has been configured in  Acumatica ERP to automatically generate identifiers for customer records                                 imported from the BigCommerce store. Location Autonumbering :  ECLOCATION This                                 numbering sequence has been configured in  Acumatica ERP to automatically generate identifiers for customer location                                 records in orders imported from the BigCommerce store. Generic Guest Customer :  ECOMGUEST This                                 customer account, which has been created in  Acumatica ERP, will appear on orders imported from the BigCommerce stores and                                 placed by non-registered users. This account will be used only if                                 placing guest orders is allowed in the BigCommerce store. Step 4: Specifying the Inventory Settings To specify the inventory-related settings, do the following: While you are still on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) BigCommerce Stores (BC201000) form, open                     the  Inventory Settings  tab. In the  Inventory Settings  section, specify the following                         settings: Default Stock Categories :  Other Here you                                 select the check box or check boxes corresponding to the sales                                 categories that will be assigned by default to stock items exported                                 to the online store if no sales category has been assigned to them                                 in  Acumatica ERP. Default Non-Stock Categories :  Other In                                 this box, too, you select the check box or check boxes corresponding                                 to the sales category or sales categories that will be assigned to                                 non-stock items exported to the online store if no sales category                                 has been assigned to them in  Acumatica ERP. Default Availability :  Available - Don't Track                                 Qty This availability option will be assigned by default to                                 stock items and non-stock items if no other availability option has                                 been selected for these items                                  on the eCommerce  tab of the  ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) and   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) forms,                                 respectively . Availability Mode :  Available for                                 Shipping This setting controls how the system calculates                                 inventory levels.  Available for Shipping  means that the                                 availability of an item is calculated based on only units that are                                 available for shipping. For the purposes of this activity, you can                                 leave this setting as it is. Warehouse Mode :  All This setting                                 controls which warehouses are used for calculations of item                                 quantities.  All  means that item quantities are calculated                                 based on the items in all warehouses. For the purposes of this                                 activity, you can leave this setting as it is. Step 5: Specifying the Order Settings To specify the order-related settings, do the following: While you are still on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) BigCommerce Stores (BC201000) form, open                     the  Order Settings  tab. In the  General  section, in the                          Branch  box, select  RETAIL . This branch will                         be inserted by default in sales orders imported from the BigCommerce                         store. In the  Order  section, select the following values: Order Type :  EO - eCommerce Order This                                 order type has been configured specifically for sales orders                                 imported from BigCommerce stores. Return Order Type :  ER - eCommerce CR                                 Order This order type will be                                  used                                 for creating return orders for returns                                  initiated                                 in the BigCommerce store. In the  Taxes  section, in the  Synchronize                         Taxes  box, select  Do Not Synchronize . For simplicity,                         during the initial setup of the BigCommerce store, configuration of taxes                         has been skipped. Hence, you do not need to configure the synchronization of                         taxes at this point. In the  Shipping Option Mapping  section, map the shipping                     methods configured in BigCommerce with the Ship Via options in  Acumatica ERP as follows. Store Shipping Zone Store Shipping Method Ship Via Shipping Zone Ship Terms United States Free Shipping LOCAL Empty Empty For the purposes of this activity, leave the  Shipping                             Zone  and  Ship Terms  columns                         empty. Step 6: Configuring the Payment Method             Mapping If             you want to import payments based on a particular payment method configured in the store             to  Acumatica ERP, you need to map the payment method to a corresponding payment method configured in                  Acumatica ERP. To configure the payment method mapping, do the following: While you are still on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) BigCommerce Stores (BC201000) form, open                     the  Payment Settings  tab. In the  Payment Methods  section, in the  Base                         Currency Payment Methods  table, map the payment method set up in                     BigCommerce with the payment method configured in  Acumatica ERP as follows. Active Store Payment Method Payment Method ID Cash Account Currency Release Payments Selected Pay in Store ONLINE 10250ST USD Cleared With these settings, the payments made with the  Pay in Store                          payment method in the BigCommerce store will be imported to  Acumatica ERP for further processing. On imported sales orders and payments made with                         this payment method, the mapped payment method,  ONLINE , will be                         displayed. On the form toolbar, click  Save  to save your                         changes. Now that the initial configuration is complete, you can move on                         to synchronize your data for the first time. For information on data                         synchronization, see  Data Synchronization: General Information and  Data Synchronization: To Perform the First Synchronization. ]]></column>

==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how data synchronization works and how to synchronize data manually.
==Stages of the Synchronization Process==
The process of the synchronization of data between Acumatica ERP and the e-commerce consists of the following stages (which are shown in the diagram below):[anchor|#_b3bfe445-1fb6-4b86-bb86-3889766b6d40]
*Preparing out-of-sync data for synchronization. For details, see the [[#_8186e13a-c817-4924-91ea-1d6a17d67733|Preparation of Out-of-Sync Data for Synchronization] section below.
*Processing out-of-sync data, as described in the [[#_a9afd843-28dd-41af-97e2-3d5f509403a7|Synchronization of Out-of-Sync Data] section below.
[anchor|#_b0eaa664-f342-4759-8016-33868050b7ee][anchor|#_f92af971-168b-4e2d-af6d-1c75dac9b3c4][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_COM_Data_Sync_Stages.png|popup|Stages of data synchronization|350px][anchor|#_8186e13a-c817-4924-91ea-1d6a17d67733]
==Preparation of Out-of-Sync Data for Synchronization==
During the preparation of data for synchronization, the system receives the data that needs to be synchronized in Acumatica ERP and the e-commerce system and puts it in the processing queue. The following mechanisms can be used for obtaining data:[anchor|#_6275c4fa-d935-4997-b3d7-9d2cbe3c6b38]
*''Data preparation process.'': The data preparation process pulls the data to be synchronized from Acumatica ERP and the e-commerce system through API calls and puts it in the processing queue. It can be performed in the following modes:
**''Full'' mode: In this mode, all records of the entity that have been created or modified during the specified date range are pulled from Acumatica ERP and the e-commerce system and put in the processing queue, regardless of whether they have been processed previously or not.
**''Incremental'' mode: In this mode, only the records that have been modified since the date of the last successful data preparation are pulled.
**''Reconciliation'' mode: In this mode, only records that have been modified during the specified date range and that have not yet been processed are pulled.
*:The pulled data is then filtered according to the filtering criteria defined on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) form and saved in the processing queue as synchronization records with the ''Pending'' status, which indicates that these synchronization records have not yet been processed. The synchronization records are then processed as described in the [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_Shopify_Data_Sync_GeneralInfo#_a9afd843-28dd-41af-97e2-3d5f509403a7|Processing of Out-of-Sync Data].
*:The data preparation process can be started in the following ways:
**Manually, on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_50_10_00|Prepare Data] ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) form. For information on manual synchronization, see the [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_BigCommerce_Data_Sync_GeneralInfo|Data Synchronization: General Information] section further in this topic.
**By an automation schedule.
*''Push notifications'': If real-time synchronization is enabled for an entity on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) form, whenever a record is changed in the source system, the e-commerce connector is immediately notified about the change, and the corresponding synchronization record is created or updated in the processing queue.
*:This synchronization record is saved with the ''Pending'' status and remains in the processing queue until it is processed.
[anchor|#_a9afd843-28dd-41af-97e2-3d5f509403a7]
==Synchronization of Out-of-Sync Data==
During the data processing stage, the system processes the synchronization records in the processing queue according to the synchronization settings defined for the corresponding entity on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) form or on the '''Entity Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_00|BigCommerce Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) form, and the synchronized data is saved in Acumatica ERP, in the BigCommerce store, or in both systems.{br}

During the processing of out-of-syncdata, the system performs the following operations for each synchronization record:[anchor|#_4021b00c-0867-44ec-97ed-c5513e67226d]
#Pulling the record details from Acumatica ERP and the e-commerce system.
#Determining the direction of the synchronization.
#Determining if any other records should be synchronized as a prerequisite for the synchronization of the current record, and attempting to synchronize the prerequisite records.
#Applying the standard field mapping for the entity.
#:The default field mapping for each entity is detailed in [HelpRoot_Commerce\COM_Mapping_Reference|Commerce Edition Entity Reference].
#Applying the field mapping configured for the entity on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) form.
#Saving the synchronized data in the destination system or systems.
#Changing the status of the synchronization record to ''Synchronized''.

The processing of out-of-sync data can be started as follows: [anchor|#_23b86480-5cde-4a35-ba99-507af972ff6d]
*You can start  data processing manually, as described in the [[#_72658190-e13f-4267-9905-3680a3fb8b05|Manual Synchronization] section of this topic.
*You can configure an automation schedule that will start data processing at regular intervals, as described in .
*You can configure the system to immediately start data processing for each synchronization record created or updated as a result of the real-time synchronization process. To do this, on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) form, you set '''Real-Time Mode''' for an entity to ''Prepare & Process''. For more information about real-time synchronization, see [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_BigCommerce_Scheduled_Sync_GeneralInfo#_9b769bc9-42e8-45e7-9c28-7bd0cf3fa739|Real-Time Synchronization].
[anchor|#_17940280-ee01-430b-ae29-c9b1c99f9a4b]
==Statuses of the Synchronization Records==
When a synchronization record is prepared and processed, the system assigns it one of the statuses described in the following table. You can review the synchronization status of any synchronization record on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_30_10_00|Sync History] ([~/?ScreenId=BC301000|BC301000]) form.[anchor|#_028ed99c-e2ce-4e18-a37b-4739b531b62e]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="50%" ! Status
!width="50%" ! Description
|- 
| ''Pending''
| The synchronization record has been created or updated, but out-of-sync data has not been saved in the destination system or systems.
|-

| The entity has been filtered out on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) form.
|}[anchor|#_72658190-e13f-4267-9905-3680a3fb8b05]
==Manual Synchronization==
Manual synchronization might be useful when you need to synchronize data during the initial configuration or when data has not been synchronized for some reason and manual troubleshooting is needed.{br}

To manually start the data preparation process, you perform the following general steps:[anchor|#_5b24af74-0141-470c-bdde-90894113620e]
#You open the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_50_10_00|Prepare Data] ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) form.
#In the Selection area of the form, in the '''Store''' box, you select the online store with which you are synchronizing data.
#In the '''Prepare Mode''' box, you select one of the following options:
#*''Incremental'': You select this mode to prepare for processing only the synchronization records that have changed since the last successful data preparation.
#*''Full'': You select this mode to prepare for processing all records of the selected entity, even if they have been synchronized previously.
#*''Reconciliation'': You select this mode to prepare for processing only records that have been modified during the specified date range and that have not yet been processed.
#:If you are starting the data preparation process for an entity for the first time, ''Full'' mode is used, regardless of the mode selected in the '''Prepare Mode''' box.
#In the table, you select the unlabeled check box in the rows of the needed entities, and on the form toolbar, you click '''Prepare'''.

To manually start data processing, you perform the following general steps:[anchor|#_9494ee40-4f45-4c36-9fa4-573975b48ec3]

Stages of data synchronization Preparation of Out-of-Sync Data for Synchronization During the preparation of data for synchronization, the system receives the data that needs         to be synchronized in  Acumatica ERP and the e-commerce system and puts it in the processing queue. The following mechanisms         can be used for obtaining data: Data preparation process. : The data preparation process pulls the data to be           synchronized from  Acumatica ERP and the e-commerce system through API calls and puts it in the processing queue. It can           be performed in the following modes: Full  mode: In this mode, all records of the entity that have been created or               modified during the specified date range are pulled from  Acumatica ERP and the e-commerce system and put in the processing queue, regardless of whether               they have been processed previously or not. Incremental  mode: In this mode, only the records that have been modified               since the date of the last successful data preparation are pulled. Reconciliation  mode: In this mode, only records that have been modified               during the specified date range and that have not yet been processed are pulled. The pulled data is then filtered according to the filtering criteria defined on             the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) Entities (BC202000) form and saved in the processing queue as             synchronization records with the  Pending  status, which indicates that these             synchronization records have not yet been processed. The synchronization records are             then processed as described in the  Processing of Out-of-Sync Data. The data preparation process can be started in the following             ways: Manually, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) Prepare Data (BC501000) form. For information on               manual synchronization, see the                  Data Synchronization: General Information               section further in this topic. By an automation               schedule. Push notifications : If real-time synchronization is enabled for an entity on the               ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) Entities (BC202000) form, whenever a record is changed in the           source system, the e-commerce connector is immediately notified about the change, and the           corresponding synchronization record is created or updated in the processing queue. This             synchronization record is saved with the  Pending  status and remains in the             processing queue until it is processed. Synchronization of Out-of-Sync Data During the data          processing          stage, the system processes the synchronization records in the processing queue according to         the synchronization settings defined for the corresponding entity on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) Entities (BC202000) form or on the  Entity Settings          tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) BigCommerce Stores (BC201000) form, and the synchronized data is         saved in  Acumatica ERP, in the BigCommerce store, or in both systems. During the          processing         of out-of-sync data ,         the system performs the following operations for each synchronization record: Pulling the record details from  Acumatica ERP and the e-commerce system. Determining the direction of the synchronization. Determining if any other records should be synchronized as a prerequisite for the synchronization of the current record, and attempting to synchronize the prerequisite records. Applying the standard field mapping for the entity. The default field mapping for each entity is detailed in  Commerce Edition Entity Reference. Applying the field mapping configured for the entity on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) Entities (BC202000) form. Saving the synchronized data in the destination system or systems. Changing the status of the synchronization record to  Synchronized . The          processing         of out-of-sync data  can be started as follows:  You can start                       data processing  manually, as described in the  Manual Synchronization Manual Synchronization section of this topic. You can configure an automation schedule that will start            data           processing  at regular intervals, as described in . You can configure the system to immediately start            data           processing  for each synchronization record created or updated as a           result of the real-time synchronization           process .            To           do this, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) Entities (BC202000) form, you set              Real-Time Mode  for an entity to  Prepare & Process .            For more information about real-time synchronization, see  Real-Time Synchronization. Statuses of the Synchronization Records When a synchronization record                  is prepared and                 processed , the system assigns it one of the statuses described in                 the following table. You can review the synchronization status of any                 synchronization record on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC301000|BC301000]) Sync History                 (BC301000) form. Status Description Pending The synchronization record has been created or updated, but                                 out-of-sync data has not been saved in the destination system or                                 systems. Synchronized The synchronization record has been processed, and data has been                                 recorded to the destination system or systems according to the                                 synchronization settings configured for the entity. Failed The processing of the synchronization record has failed and data                                 could not be recorded to the destination system or systems. Aborted The synchronization record was excluded from synchronization by                                     the system.  The system automatically assigns the  Skipped  status to a                                     synchronization record if the processing of the synchronization                                     record has failed the number of times specified for the entity                                     in the  Max. Number of Failed Attempts  box                                     on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) Entities (BC202000)                                     form.

Skipped The synchronization record was manually excluded from                                     synchronization by a user. Deleted The record in the synchronization record has been deleted in one                                 system or both systems. Invalid The synchronization record cannot be processed because the its                                 synchronization is not supported. Filtered  The entity has been filtered out on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) Entities (BC202000) form. Manual Synchronization Manual synchronization might be useful when you need to synchronize data during the initial         configuration or when data has not been synchronized for some reason and manual         troubleshooting is needed. To manually start the data preparation process, you perform the following general         steps: You open the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) Prepare Data (BC501000) form. In the Selection area of the form, in the  Store  box, you select           the online store with which you are synchronizing data. In the  Prepare Mode  box, you select one of the following             options: Incremental : You select this mode to prepare for processing only the               synchronization records that have changed since the last successful data               preparation. Full : You select this mode to prepare for processing all records of the               selected entity, even if they have been synchronized previously. Reconciliation : You select this mode to prepare for processing only records               that have been modified during the specified date range and that have not yet been               processed. If             you are starting the data preparation process for an entity for the first time,                Full  mode is used, regardless of the mode selected in the  Prepare               Mode  box. In the table, you select the unlabeled check box in the rows of the needed entities, and           on the form toolbar, you click  Prepare . To manually start data processing, you perform the following general steps: You open the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501500|BC501500]) Process Data (BC501500) form. In the Selection area, in the  Store  box, you select the online           store with which you are synchronizing data. The table shows only the synchronization             records that have not been synchronized yet (that is, the synchronization records with             the  Pending  and  Failed  status). In the  Entity  box, you select the entity for which you want to           display synchronization records in the table. If you want to process out-of-sync             synchronization records for all entities, leave the box empty. In the table, you select the unlabeled check box in the rows of the synchronization           records that you need to process. On the form toolbar, you click  Process  to synchronize the           selected synchronization records. If you want to process all synchronization records in             the table, you click  Process All  on the form toolbar. ]]></column>

==Story==
Suppose that you are an implementation consultant helping the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company to set up an online store. You have completed the minimum initial configuration of the integration with BigCommerce and now want to explore how synchronization works. You will configure synchronization for and then synchronize a subset of stock items that are maintained in Acumatica ERP (stock items of the ''Jam'' item class) with the BigCommerce store, where the term ''products'' describes what are called ''items'' in Acumatica ERP. You will then perform a test purchase of one of the synchronized products and explore how the online order is processed in the BigCommerce store and in Acumatica ERP.
==Process Overview==
In this activity, you will perform the following steps:[anchor|#_298c3ce2-c7aa-40bb-b5db-f76e15ce7d4c]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form of Acumatica ERP, you will review the stock items that need to be exported to the BigCommerce store.
#On the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) form, you will configure the filtering options for the ''Stock Item'' entity to include in the synchronization only the stock items of the ''Jam'' item class.
#On the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_50_10_00|Prepare Data] ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) form, you will start the data preparation process for the ''Stock Item'' entity to prepare out-of-sync data for export.
#On the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_30_10_00|Sync History] ([~/?ScreenId=BC301000|BC301000]) form, you will review the result of the data preparation process.
#On the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_50_15_00|Process Data] ([~/?ScreenId=BC501500|BC501500]) form, you will start data processing for the ''Stock Item'' entity to save the synchronized product data in the BigCommerce store.
#On the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_30_10_00|Sync History] form, you will review the results of data processing.
#In the BigCommerce store, you will review the products that have been imported from Acumatica ERP.
#By using the storefront, you will purchase one of the products that have been imported from Acumatica ERP (a jar of jam) and place an order.
#In the control panel of the store, you will review the order details.
#On the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_50_10_00|Prepare Data] form of Acumatica ERP, you will start the data preparationprocess for the ''Sales Order'' entity to prepare out-of-sync order data for import.
#On the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_50_15_00|Process Data] form, you will synchronize the prepared sales order data.
#On the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_30_10_00|Sync History] form, you will review the results of data synchronization.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, you will review the details of the imported sales order.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form, you will create a shipment for the imported order.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form, you will confirm the shipment.
#On the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_50_10_00|Prepare Data] form, you will start both the data preparation process for the ''Shipment'' entity.
#In the control panel of the BigCommerce store, you will review the updated order details and the shipment exported from Acumatica ERP.

==System Preparation==
Do the following:
#Make sure that the following prerequisites have been met:
#*The BigCommerce store has been created and configured, as described in [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_BigCommerce_Initial_Configuration_Set_Up_BC_Store_Activity|Initial Configuration: To Set Up a BigCommerce Store].
#*The connection to the BigCommerce store has been established and the initial configuration has been performed, as described in [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_BigCommerce_Initial_Configuration_Implem_Activity|Initial Configuration: To Establish and Configure the Store Connection].
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as an administrator by using the ''gibbs''username and ''123'' password.

==Step 1: Finding and Reviewing the Stock Items to Be Sold Online==
To find and review the stock items that will be sold online, do the following:[anchor|#_986c59c0-4053-4f38-b9e8-4add2663d170]
#Open the Stock Items (IN2025PL) form.
#Filter the stock items to display only the items of the ''Jam'' item class as follows: 
##In the '''Item Class''' column, click the column header.
##In the menu that opens, select the ''Equals'' filter condition.
##In the box at the bottom of the menu, type <tt>Jam</tt>.
##Click '''OK''' to apply the filter.
#:Now all stock items of the ''Jam'' item class are displayed. Notice how many items are in the class; scan the list so you are familiar with the stock items that you need to export to the BigCommerce store.

==Step 2: Configuring the Export of a Subset of Stock Items==
To configure the ''Stock Item'' entity to export to the BigCommerce store only stock items of the ''Jam'' item class, do the following:[anchor|#_faa8d8c3-4e68-457d-819e-972b768e33d0]
#Open the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) form.
#In the '''Store''' box, select the BigCommerce store with which you want to synchronize data.
#In the '''Entity''' box, select ''Stock Item''.
#:Notice that this entity can only be exported to the BigCommerce store (that is, '''Sync Direction''' is set to ''Export''), and that only two tabs, '''Export Mapping''' and '''Export Filtering''', are displayed.
#To create a filtering condition for stock items, on the '''Export Filtering''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the row:
#*'''Active''': Selected
#*'''Field Name''': ''Item Class''
#* '''Condition''': ''Equals''
#* '''Value''': <tt>Jam</tt>
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save''' to save your changes.
#:Now when you synchronize the ''Stock Item'' entity, only the stock items of the ''Jam'' item class that you reviewed in Step 1 will be exported to the BigCommerce store.
#:((({S:Warn}Filtering rules are not applied to data that has already been synchronized. For example, if you synchronize the ''Stock Item'' entity without filters, apply the filter described above, and run the synchronization again, all previously synchronized stock items will remain synchronized.
)))

==Step 3: Preparing the Product Data for Synchronization==
To prepare product (item) data that needs to be synchronized to the BigCommerce store, do the following:[anchor|#_bb2a298b-b55e-4cb5-87ca-539bdcae5b6b]
#Open the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_50_10_00|Prepare Data] ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) form.
#In the '''Store''' box, select the BigCommerce store with which you want to synchronize data.
#In the '''Prepare Mode''' box, select ''Incremental''.
#:This setting controls which data will be loaded. ''Incremental'' indicates that the system will load only the data that has been modified since the previous data preparation. Because you start the preparation process for the first time, all data will be prepared.
#In the table, select the unlabeled check box in the row of the ''Stock Item'' entity, and on the form toolbar, click '''Prepare'''.
#In the '''Processing''' dialog box, which opens, review the results of the processing and click '''Close''' to close the dialog box.
#:Notice that the '''Prepared Records''' and '''Processed Records''' columns now show the number of records (stock items) that have been prepared and are ready to be synchronized, and the number of records that have been processed.

==Step 4: Reviewing the Results of Data Preparation==
To review the results of preparation of product data for synchronization, do the following:[anchor|#_87961b40-3c6d-4086-876d-a37114d61d55]
#Open the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_30_10_00|Sync History] ([~/?ScreenId=BC301000|BC301000]) form.
#In the Selection area of the form, select the following settings:
#*'''Connector''': ''BigCommerce'' (selected by default)
#*'''Store''': The BigCommerce store with which you are synchronizing data
#*'''Entity''': ''Stock Item''
#* '''Status''': ''All''
#:Notice that the table is displaying the list of stock item synchronization records with the ''Pending'' status, which means that the data for these items has been fetched but not yet synchronized. For each of these items, the '''Local ID''' column displays a link that you can click to open the item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. The text of the link corresponds to the description of the stock item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form. The '''External ID''' column, which corresponds to the identifier of the product in the BigCommerce store, however, does not display any values because the stock items have not yet been exported to the BigCommerce store.

==Step 5: Processing the Prepared Product Data==
To process the prepared product data (that is, to synchronize it with the BigCommerce store), do the following:[anchor|#_8d950996-3423-4178-b43f-f4d7ada4662a]
#Open the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_50_15_00|Process Data] ([~/?ScreenId=BC501500|BC501500]) form.
#In the Selection area, select the following settings:
#*'''Store''': The BigCommerce store with which you are syncing data
#*'''Entity''': ''Stock Item''
#:The table displays only the list of the out-of-sync stock items (that is, the items with the ''Pending'' status) that you reviewed in Step 4.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Process All''' to synchronize all records displayed on the form.
#In the '''Processing''' dialog box, review the results of the processing and click '''Close''' to close the dialog box.

==Step 6: Reviewing the Synchronization Status of the Product Data==
To again review the synchronization status of the product data, do the following:[anchor|#_1bf27433-4687-45b8-8f7d-6ae78eb72585]
#Open the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_30_10_00|Sync History] ([~/?ScreenId=BC301000|BC301000]) form.
#In the Selection area of the form, select the following settings:
#*'''Store''': The BigCommerce store with which you are syncing data
#*'''Entity''': ''Stock Item''
#Open the '''Synchronized''' tab.
#:The tab shows the list of items that have been synchronized with the BigCommerce store. For each item, there is now a product identifier in the '''External ID''' column. You can click the link in this column to open the product in the control panel of your BigCommerce store. In the table, the '''Last Operation''' value has changed to ''Inserted Externally'' and the time stamp in the '''Last Attempt''' column has changed to the date and time when you ran data processing on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_50_15_00|Process Data] ([~/?ScreenId=BC501500|BC501500]) form in Step 5.

==Step 7: Viewing an Exported Product in the BigCommerce Store==
To view the ''ORJAM32'' stock item (which has the description ''Orange jam 32 oz''), which has been exported, in the BigCommerce store, do the following:[anchor|#_e6a857be-9cc3-4e0d-bea9-a739a4cf7e9c]
#While you are still viewing the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_30_10_00|Sync History] ([~/?ScreenId=BC301000|BC301000]) form, click the link in the '''External ID''' column in the row of the synchronization record for the ''Orange jam 32 oz'' item.
#:The product management page for the ''Orange jam 32 oz'' item in the BigCommerce store opens in a new browser window. 
#Review the product details that have been exported to the BigCommerce store.

==Step 8: Purchasing a Jar of Orange Jam via the Storefront==
To purchase a 32-ounce jar of orange jam by using the storefront, do the following:[anchor|#_29871bec-e7ca-4f57-ab4e-7965be869515]
#While you are still viewing the product management page for the product with the ''ORJAM32'' SKU (that is, ''Orange jam 32 oz''), click '''View on Storefront''' at the top.
#:You will see the product listing page of the storefront as an anonymous visitor of your store would view it.
#On the product listing page, leave the quantity of ''1'' (specified by default), and click '''Add to Cart'''.
#In the pop-up window that opens, click '''Proceed to checkout'''.

##*'''Password''': <tt>!Q1233456</tt>
##*'''Confirm Password''': <tt>!Q123456</tt>
##Click '''Create Account'''.

==Step 9: Reviewing the Order in the Control Panel of the Store==
To review the order you have placed in Step 8, do the following:[anchor|#_02f10e9e-a40e-4479-9651-68e84f9af71f]
#Return to the control panel of the BigCommerce store.
#In the left pane, click '''Orders''' > ''' View'''.
#On the '''View Orders''' page, which opens, find the order you created in Step 8 and click the plus sign in the row with this order to review its details.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Data Synchronization: To Perform the First Synchronization In the following activity, you will walk through the process of manually exporting                 items from  Acumatica ERP to the BigCommerce store. You will also perform the instructions to place a test                 order online in the BigCommerce store and then synchronize the order with  Acumatica ERP. Finally, you will create a shipment for the order in  Acumatica ERP and synchronize the created shipment with the BigCommerce store.  The following activity is             based on the  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system             settings have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the             activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100              dataset to its initial state. Story Suppose that you are an implementation consultant helping the SweetLife Fruits &                 Jams company to set up an online store. You have completed the minimum initial                 configuration of the integration with BigCommerce and now want to explore how                 synchronization works. You will configure synchronization for and then synchronize a                 subset of stock items that are maintained in  Acumatica ERP (stock items of the  Jam  item class) with the BigCommerce store, where the                 term  products  describes what are called  items  in  Acumatica ERP. You will then perform a test purchase of one of the synchronized products and                 explore how the online order is processed in the BigCommerce store and in  Acumatica ERP. Process Overview In this activity, you will perform the following steps: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form of  Acumatica ERP, you will review the stock items that need to be exported to the BigCommerce                     store. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) Entities (BC202000) form, you will configure the                     filtering options for the  Stock Item  entity to include in the                     synchronization only the stock items of the  Jam  item class. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) Prepare Data (BC201000) form, you will start the data                      preparation                      process for the  Stock Item  entity to prepare out-of-sync data for                     export. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC301000|BC301000]) Sync History (BC301000) form, you will review the                     result of the data                      preparation                      process. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501500|BC501500]) Process Data (BC501500) form, you will start                      data                     processing  for the  Stock Item  entity to save the                     synchronized product data in the BigCommerce store. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC301000|BC301000]) Sync History form, you will review the results of                      data                     processing . In the BigCommerce store, you will review the products that have been imported                     from  Acumatica ERP. By using the storefront, you will purchase one of the products that have been                     imported from  Acumatica ERP                     ( a                     jar of jam ) and place an order. In the control panel of the store, you will review the order details. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) Prepare Data form of  Acumatica ERP, you will start the data  preparation process                      for the  Sales Order  entity to prepare out-of-sync order data for                     import . On the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501500|BC501500]) Process Data form, you will synchronize the prepared                     sales order data. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC301000|BC301000]) Sync History form, you will review the results                     of                      data                     synchronization . On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, you will review the                     details of the imported sales order. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders form, you will create a shipment for the                     imported order. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) form, you will confirm the                     shipment. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) Prepare Data form, you will start both the data                     preparation process for the  Shipment  entity. In the control panel of the BigCommerce store, you will review the updated order                     details and the shipment exported from  Acumatica ERP. System Preparation Do the following: Make sure that the following prerequisites have been met: The BigCommerce store has been created and configured, as described in                                  Initial Configuration: To Set Up a BigCommerce Store. The connection to the BigCommerce store has been established and the                             initial configuration has been performed, as described in  Initial Configuration: To Establish and Configure the Store Connection. Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as an administrator by using the                          gibbs username                     and  123  password . Step 1: Finding and Reviewing the Stock Items to Be Sold Online To find and review the stock items that will be sold online, do the following: Open the Stock Items (IN2025PL) form. Filter the stock items to display only the items of the  Jam  item class as                     follows:  In the  Item Class  column, click the column                             header. In the menu that opens, select the  Equals  filter condition. In the box at the bottom of the menu, type                              Jam . Click  OK  to apply the filter. Now all stock items of the  Jam  item class are displayed. Notice                         how many items are in the class; scan the list so you are familiar with the                         stock items that you need to export to the BigCommerce store. Step 2: Configuring the Export of a Subset of Stock Items To configure the  Stock Item  entity to export to the BigCommerce store only                 stock items of the  Jam  item class, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) Entities (BC202000) form. In the  Store  box, select the BigCommerce store with which                     you want to synchronize data. In the  Entity  box, select  Stock Item . Notice                         that this entity                          can                          only                          be                          exported to the BigCommerce store (that is,                              Sync                              Direction  is set to  Export ), and                         that only two tabs,  Export Mapping  and                              Export Filtering , are displayed. To create a filtering condition for stock items, on the  Export                         Filtering  tab, click  Add Row  on the table                     toolbar, and specify the following settings in the row: Active : Selected Field Name :  Item Class Condition :  Equals Value :  Jam On the form toolbar, click  Save  to save your                         changes. Now when you synchronize the  Stock Item  entity, only the                         stock items of the  Jam  item class that you reviewed in Step 1 will be                         exported to the BigCommerce store. Filtering rules are not applied                         to data that has already been synchronized. For example, if you synchronize                         the  Stock Item  entity without filters, apply the filter described                         above, and run the synchronization again, all previously synchronized stock                         items will remain synchronized. Step 3:                  Preparing                  the Product Data                  for                 Synchronization To                 prepare product (item) data that needs to be synchronized to the                  BigCommerce store, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) Prepare Data (BC201000) form. In the  Store  box, select the BigCommerce store with which                     you want to synchronize data. In the                          Prepare                          Mode  box, select  Incremental . This setting controls                         which data will be loaded.  Incremental  indicates that the system will                         load only the data that has been modified since the previous                          data                          preparation .                          Because you start the preparation process for the first time, all data will                         be prepared. In the table, select the unlabeled check box in the row of the  Stock Item                      entity, and on the form toolbar, click                          Prepare . In the  Processing  dialog box, which opens, review the                     results of the processing and click  Close  to close the                     dialog                         box. Notice                         that the  Prepared Records  and  Processed                             Records  columns now show the number of records (stock items)                         that have been prepared and are ready to be synchronized, and the number of                         records that have been processed. Step 4: Reviewing the                  Results                 of Data                 Preparation To                 review the results of preparation of product data for synchronization, do the                 following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC301000|BC301000]) Sync History (BC501500) form. In the Selection area of the form, select the following settings: Connector :  BigCommerce  (selected by                             default) Store : The BigCommerce store with which you are                             synchronizing data Entity :  Stock Item Status :  All Notice that the table is displaying the list of stock item                         synchronization records with the  Pending  status, which means that the                         data for these items has been fetched but not yet synchronized.                          For                         each of these items, the  Local ID  column displays a                         link that you can click to open the item on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form.  The text                         of the link corresponds to the description of the stock item on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form. The  External ID                          column, which corresponds to the identifier of the product in the                         BigCommerce store, however, does not display any values because the stock                         items have not yet been exported to the BigCommerce store. Step                 5: Processing the Prepared Product Data To process the prepared product data (that is, to synchronize it with the BigCommerce                 store), do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501500|BC501500]) Process Data (BC501500) form. In the Selection area, select the following settings: Store : The BigCommerce store with which you are                             syncing data Entity :  Stock Item The table displays only the list of the out-of-sync stock items (that                         is, the items with the  Pending  status) that you reviewed in Step                         4. On the form toolbar, click  Process All  to synchronize all                     records displayed on the form. In the  Processing  dialog box, review the results of the                     processing and click  Close  to close the dialog box. Step 6: Reviewing the                 Sync hronization                  Status of the Product Data To again review the synchronization status of the product data, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC301000|BC301000]) Sync History (BC501500) form. In the Selection area of the form, select the following settings: Store : The BigCommerce store with which you are                             syncing data Entity :  Stock Item Open                     the  Synchronized                          tab. The                         tab shows the list of items that have been synchronized with the BigCommerce                         store . For each item, there is now a product identifier in                         the  External ID  column. You can click the link in                         this column to open the product in the control panel of your BigCommerce                         store. In the table, the  Last Operation  value has                         changed to                              Inserted                              Externally  and the time stamp in the                              Last                             Attempt  column has changed to the date and                         time when you ran                          data                          process ing                          on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501500|BC501500]) Process Data (BC501500) form in Step 5. Step 7: Viewing                  an                  Exported                 Product                  in the BigCommerce Store To view the  ORJAM32  stock item (which has the description  Orange jam 32                     oz ), which has been exported, in the BigCommerce store, do the                 following: While you are still viewing the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC301000|BC301000]) Sync History (BC501500) form,                     click the link in the  External ID  column in the row of                     the synchronization record for the  Orange jam 32 oz  item.

In the  Payment  section, select the  Pay                                 in Store  option button, and click  Place                                 Order . Your order has been created, and on the                                 confirmation page, the order number is displayed. You will process                                 the order with this order number further in this activity. On the order confirmation page of the storefront, create a new customer                             account. For the purposes of this activity, you can set the following                                 password: Password :                                          !Q1233456 Confirm Password :                                          !Q123456 Click  Create Account . Step 9: Reviewing the Order in the Control Panel of the Store To review the order you have placed in Step 8, do the following: Return to the control panel of the BigCommerce store. In the left pane, click  Orders  View . On the  View Orders  page, which opens, find the order you                     created in Step 8 and click the plus sign in the row with this order to review                     its details. Notice that the order status is now  Awaiting                     Payment . Step 10: Importing the Sales Order Data to  Acumatica ERPTo import sales orders from the BigCommerce store to  Acumatica ERP, do the following: Sign in to  Acumatica ERP by using the                          gibbs                      login. Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) Prepare Data (BC201000) form. In the  Store  box, select the BigCommerce store with which                     you are synchronizing data. In the                          Prepare                          Mode  box, select  Incremental . In the table, select the unlabeled check box in the row of the  Sales                         Order  entity, and on the form toolbar, click                          Prepare . In the  Processing  dialog box, which opens, review the                     results of the processing, and click  Close  to close the                     dialog box.  Step 11: Reviewing the Synchronization Status of the Imported Sales Order To review the synchronization status of the order you imported in Step 10, do the                 following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC301000|BC301000]) Sync History (BC501500) form. In the Selection area of the form, select the following settings: Store : The BigCommerce store with which you are                             syncing data Entity : Leave                                  empty Notice                         that when the  Sales Order  entity was synchronized, the following data                         related to the order has been imported: Customer:  Danny Heady Customer Location: The address and contact details you specified in Step                             8 Payment: The payment created based on the cash account and payment                             method defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) BigCommerce Stores (BC201000)                             form Step 12: Reviewing the Imported Sales Order To review the details of the imported sales order, do the following: While you are still viewing the synchronization results on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC301000|BC301000]) Sync History (BC501500) form, click the link in the                          Local ID  column for the sales order you                     imported. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, which opens, review the                     details of the order. In the Summary area, notice the following: The imported order has the  EO  type, which is configured on the                                   ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) BigCommerce Stores (BC201000) form to be assigned to                             all sales orders imported from BigCommerce by default. In the                                  External                                 Reference                              box, the number of the order in the online store and the name of the                             store are displayed. The  Date  of the sales order is the same as the                             date on which the sales order was created in the BigCommerce store. In the  Description  box, the description of the                             order ( BigCommerce Order ) and the order number in the store are                             displayed. The  Customer  and  Location                              boxes display the information about the customer and customer location                             that were created in  Acumatica ERP during the import of the sales order in Step 10; both were created                             during the order placement in the BigCommerce store in Step 8. On the  Document Details  tab, review the only line                         in the table. Notice the following: The  Branch  is set to  RETAIL , which is the                             default                             branch                              configured for the BigCommerce store (that is, this branch was                             configured to appear on sales orders imported from the BigCommerce store                             on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) BigCommerce Stores form) . The inventory ID, quantity, unit price, and extended price of the item                             are exactly the same as the values on the order in the BigCommerce                             store. Step 13: Creating a Shipment for the Imported Order To create a shipment for the order, do the following: While you are still viewing the sales order that you imported from the                     BigCommerce store on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, on the                     form toolbar, click Create                     Shipment . In the  Specify Shipment Parameters  dialog box, which                     opens, make sure the current date and the  WHOLESALE  warehouse are                     selected, and click  OK . The system creates a shipment and                     opens it on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) form. Step 14: Confirming the Shipment for the Imported Order To confirm the shipment for the order, do the following: While you are still viewing the shipment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments                     (SO302000) form, review the line on the  Document Details                      tab. Make sure that the correct order line is included in the shipment and that                     the shipped quantity is equal to the ordered quantity. On the form toolbar, click  Actions  Confirm Shipment . The shipment is assigned the  Confirmed  status. Step 15: Synchronizing the Shipment with the BigCommerce Store To synchronize with the BigCommerce store the shipment that you created and confirmed                 in Steps 13 and 14, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) Prepare Data (BC501000) form, do the following: In the Selection area, select the following settings:  Store : The name of the BigCommerce store                                     with which you are synchronizing data Fetch Mode :  Incremental In the table, select the unlabeled check box for the  Shipment                              entity. On the form toolbar, click                                  Prepare . In the  Processing  dialog box, which opens, review                             the results of the processing, and click  Close                              when the processing has completed. Click the link in the  Prepared Records  (which shows                          1  because only one shipment has been created) in the row of the                          Shipment  entity. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501500|BC501500]) Process Data (BC501500) form, which opens with the                     BigCommerce store and the  Shipment  entity selected, in the only row of                     the table, select the unlabeled check box and on the form toolbar, click                          Process . In the  Processing  dialog box, which opens, review the                     results of the processing, and click  Close  to close the                     dialog box.  Step 16: Reviewing the Updated Order and Shipment in BigCommerce To check whether the shipment and the updated order have been imported to the                 BigCommerce store correctly, do the following: Sign in to the BigCommerce store as an administrator. In the left pane, select  Orders  View . On the  View Orders  page, which opens, find the order that                     you processed in the previous steps. Notice that the status of the order has changed to  Shipped . In the left pane, click  Orders  Shipments . On the  View Shipments  page, which opens, open the                     shipment created for  Danny Heady , and review its details. ]]></column>

 Acumatica ERP Commerce                         Edition provides flexible tools that you can use to prepare the data for synchronization with your BigCommerce store and configure the synchronization settings.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn the following:[anchor|#_c3b3e44e-5083-4e42-adcf-83f11b49a357]
*How to filter data that needs to be synchronized between Acumatica ERP and the BigCommerce store
*How to configure mapping of standard and custom fields that need to be synchronized
*How to update stock items and non-stock items with e-commerce-related data

==Applicable Scenarios==
You might want to configure additional mapping if you have defined custom fields in Acumatica ERP, in the BigCommerce store, or in both systems, and you want these fields to be synchronized between the two systems. For example, you might want to define an extra field on the customer registration form in the online store and map this field to a user-defined field or an attribute in a customer record in Acumatica ERP.{br}

Filtering is useful if you do not want to synchronize all data of a particular entity. For example, you might want to define a subset of items in Acumatica ERP (which are referred to as ''products'' in BigCommerce) that you want to export to the online store, or exclude from export the customers that have incomplete information in Acumatica ERP (that is, the customers that have the ''On Hold'' status).{br}

You might want to update e-commerce-related information about items in Acumatica ERP if you want to override default inventory settings related to export that have been configured for the store on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_00|BigCommerce Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) form or if you want to maintain all product data, e-commerce-related or otherwise, in one system.[anchor|#_50c53db5-087a-457f-be16-c28de249b07c]
==Configuration of Synchronization Preferences==
During the initial configuration of the connection between Acumatica ERP and the BigCommerce store, you determine which of the entities supported by the BigCommerce connector need to be synchronized between the two systems. To do this, you select the '''Active''' check box for each required entity on the '''Entity Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_00|BigCommerce Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) form. On this tab, you can also configure the following:[anchor|#_b4f99531-bd47-4b78-be8f-a603e1279e4a]
*The direction of the synchronization. For each entity, you specify whether data should be exported to BigCommerce, imported to Acumatica ERP, or synchronized in both directions.
*The primary system. You indicate which of the systems, ''Local'' (that is, Acumatica ERP) or ''External'' (that is, BigCommerce), should be used as the source of data if conflicts occur during the synchronization of a particular entity.
*The real-time synchronization mode. You indicate whether the synchronization records for a particular entity should be processed immediately after the data is prepared by selecting either of the following options:
**''Prepare'': As soon as a push notification about a change to data is received, the corresponding synchronization record is placed in the processing queue.
**''Prepare & Process'': As soon as a push notification about a change to data is received, the corresponding synchronization record is placed in the processing queue, and data processing is immediately started for the synchronization record.
*The number of attempts when an error occurs. You specify the number of times the system will try to process the synchronization records before excluding them from further synchronization attempts.

You can also change these settings for each particular entity by using the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) form.
==Filtering and Field Mapping for Export and Import==
For some of the entities supported by the e-commerce connector, on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) form, you can configure the additional synchronization settings—for example, define a filter to be applied during the synchronization of entity data, or define a new mapping between the fields in Acumatica ERP and the fields in BigCommerce. You define filters and mappings for the import and export processes on the following tabs:[anchor|#_1c822ccc-4c97-45b6-b1dd-9bc1248a8ddb]
*Filtering for import: '''Import Filtering''' tab
*Filtering for export: '''Export Filtering''' tab
*Mapping for import: '''Import Mapping''' tab
*Mapping for export: '''Export Mapping''' tab

The display of the listed tabs is determined by the entity selected in the Summary area. The table below shows the availability of filtering and mapping functionality for particular entities.[anchor|#_91956937-cd35-4125-91d1-fe8516c7108c]

For example, you might want to define an extra field         on the customer registration form in the online store and map this field to a user-defined         field or an attribute in a customer record in  Acumatica ERP. Filtering is useful if you do not want to synchronize all data of a particular entity. For         example, you might want to define a subset of items in  Acumatica ERP (which are referred to as  products  in BigCommerce) that you want to export to the         online store, or exclude from export the customers that have incomplete information in  Acumatica ERP (that is, the customers that have the  On Hold  status). You might want to update e-commerce-related information about items in  Acumatica ERP if you want to override default inventory settings related to export that have been         configured for the store on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) BigCommerce Stores (BC201000) form or if you         want to maintain all product data, e-commerce-related or otherwise, in one system. Configuration of Synchronization Preferences During the initial configuration of the connection between  Acumatica ERP and the BigCommerce store, you determine which of the entities supported by the         BigCommerce connector need to be synchronized between the two systems. To do this, you         select the  Active  check box for each required entity on the            Entity Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) BigCommerce Stores         (BC201000) form. On this tab, you can also configure the following: The direction of the synchronization. For each entity, you specify whether data should           be exported to BigCommerce, imported to  Acumatica ERP, or synchronized in both directions. The primary system. You indicate which of the systems,  Local  (that is,  Acumatica ERP) or  External  (that is, BigCommerce), should be used as the source of data if           conflicts occur during the synchronization of a particular entity. The real-time synchronization mode. You indicate whether the synchronization records for           a particular entity should be processed immediately after the data is prepared by           selecting either of the following options: Prepare : As soon as a push notification about a change to data is received,               the corresponding synchronization record is placed in the processing queue. Prepare & Process : As soon as a push notification about a change to data               is received, the corresponding synchronization record is placed in the processing               queue, and data processing is immediately started for the synchronization record. The number of attempts when an error occurs. You specify the number of times the system           will try to process the synchronization records before            excluding           them from further synchronization attempts . You can also change these settings for each particular entity by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) Entities (BC202000) form. Filtering and Field Mapping for Export and Import For some of the entities supported by the e-commerce connector, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) Entities (BC202000) form, you can configure the additional         synchronization settings—for example, define a filter to be applied during the         synchronization of entity data, or define a new mapping between the fields in  Acumatica ERP and the fields in BigCommerce. You define filters and mappings for the import and export         processes on the following tabs: Filtering for import:  Import Filtering  tab Filtering for export:  Export Filtering  tab Mapping for import:  Import Mapping  tab Mapping for export:  Export Mapping  tab The display of the listed tabs is determined by the entity selected in the Summary area.         The table below shows the availability of filtering and mapping functionality for particular         entities. Availability of Filtering and Mapping Options for Entities Entity in  Import Mapping Import Filtering Export Mapping Export Filtering Customer Yes Yes Yes Yes Customer Price Class Yes Yes Yes Yes Customer Location No Yes No Yes Sales Category Yes Yes Yes Yes Stock Item No No Yes Yes Non-Stock Item No No Yes Yes Template Item No No Yes Yes Base Sales Price No No No No Price List No No No No Product Image No No No No Product Availability No No No No Sales Order Yes Yes Yes Yes Payment Yes Yes No No Shipment No No Yes Yes For information about standard mapping of entities, see  Commerce Edition Entity Reference.

In this topic, you will learn how you can define export and import filtering settings.{br}{TOC}
==Export Filtering==
You can configure the rules according to which data from Acumatica ERP should or should not be exported to the online store by using the '''Export Filtering''' tab of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) form. {br}

To define a filter, you need to specify at least one filtering condition. Each condition includes the following components:[anchor|#_628eed0b-551f-497c-95b8-5dc36b6df3bb]
*'''Field Name''': The data field by which data needs to be filtered. The list of options you can select from depends on the selected entity.
*'''Condition''': The logical operation to apply to the value of the selected data field.
*'''Value''': The value you enter for the logical condition used to filter the data, if the selected condition requires a value.
*'''Value 2''': The second value for the logical condition, if the selected logical condition requires a second value. For example, the ''Is Between'' logical condition requires a second value. 

A filter may contain multiple simple conditions or lines combined into one logical expression with brackets and logical operators (''And'' and ''Or'').{br}

'''Example'''{br}

Suppose that you want to maintain customers of a particular customer class, ''INTL'', only in Acumatica ERP, and you want to exclude such customers from synchronization with the BigCommerce store. To do this, you select the ''Customer'' entity in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] form, and on the '''Export Filtering''' tab, you specify the condition corresponding to the settings shown in the following table.[anchor|#_dbeebe71-d3aa-4e47-8877-dfbda398c7a4]

|- 
| Selected
| -
| ''Customer Class''
|  ''Does Not Equal''
| <tt>INTL</tt>

The particular fields that you can select in the '''Field Name''' column depend on the selected entity.((({S:Warn}If you change the export filter settings after an export has been completed, the synchronization records that have been previously processed and are no longer included in the filter, will remain synchronized but will be assigned the ''Filtered'' status. 
)))
==Import Filtering==
You can configure the rules according to which data from the online store should or should not be imported into Acumatica ERP by using the '''Import Filtering''' tab of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) form.{br}

To define a filter, you need to specify at least one filtering condition. Each condition includes the following components:[anchor|#_521f408c-1288-4921-b036-d6653022e688]
*'''Field Name''': The data field by which data needs to be filtered. The list of options you can select from depends on the selected entity.
*'''Condition''': The logical operation to apply to the value of the selected data field.
*'''Value''': The value you enter for the logical condition used to filter the data, if the selected condition requires a value.
*'''Value 2''': The second value for the logical condition, if the selected logical condition requires a second value. For example, the ''Is Between'' logical condition requires a second value. 

A filter may contain multiple simple conditions or lines combined into one logical expression with brackets and logical operators (''And'' and ''Or'').{br}

'''Example'''{br}

Suppose that you do not want to import into Acumatica ERP orders placed in the online store by a particular customer, Morning Cafe. To do this, you select the ''Order'' entity in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] form, and on the '''Import Filtering''' tab, you specify the condition corresponding to the settings shown in the following table.[anchor|#_8c2ba6c9-5934-45c4-886c-a0a7101fdbe6]

In this topic, you will learn how you can map fields between Acumatica ERP and BigCommerce to override the standard field mapping or define an additional mapping to suit your synchronization requirements.{br}{TOC}
==Mapping of Fields for Export==
 Acumatica ERP Commerce                         Edition provides you with the ability to map fields, which are related to synchronized entities, in Acumatica ERP with fields in BigCommerce. You can define additional mappings of standard or custom fields as well as override the standard mappings provided with the BigCommerce integration.{br}

You define the mappings of fields that should be processed during the export of data from Acumatica ERP into BigCommerce on the '''Export Mapping''' tab of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) form. During the export process, data from the specified fields is fetched and processed according to the defined mappings.{br}

To map two fields that will be processed during the export process, you specify values in the following columns:[anchor|#_c119d62b-565d-4eec-8288-0549f3159dd6]
*'''Target Object''': An object in the e-commerce system, which is a related set of fields, for the entity. The list of objects available for selection depends on the entity selected in the Summary area.
*'''Target Field''': A field related to the selected target object. The fields that are displayed in the list depend on the selected object.
*'''Source Object''': An Acumatica ERP object, which is a related set of fields, for the entity. The list of objects available for selection depends on the entity selected in the Summary area.
*'''Source Field / Value''': A field related to the selected source object. The fields that are displayed in the list depend on the selected object. In this field, you can also define a particular value for the mapped field.

'''Example'''{br}

Suppose that you do not want inventory IDs of stock items maintained in Acumatica ERP to be publicly displayed as SKU names on the storefront of your BigCommerce store. Instead, you want to show alternate IDs. To map the alternate IDs of stock items in Acumatica ERP to stock keeping units (SKU) in BigCommerce, you do the following:[anchor|#_83a1ffef-064b-46fe-b0a9-faff0352331d]
#In Acumatica ERP, you make sure that an alternate ID is specified for each stock item on the '''Cross-Reference''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form.
#On the '''Export Mapping''' tab of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] form, you select the store and the ''Stock Item'' entity, and in the table row, you specify the following mapping settings.

|  ''Stock Items → Cross References''
|  ''Alternate ID''
|}

With this mapping, when you synchronize stock items with the BigCommerce store, the alternate ID of a stock item will be exported to the '''SKU''' field of the item in the BigCommerce store.
==Mapping of Fields for Import==
 Acumatica ERP Commerce                         Edition provides you with the ability to map fields, which are related to synchronized entities, in Acumatica ERP with fields in BigCommerce. You can define additional mappings of standard or custom fields, as well as override the standard mappings provided with the BigCommerce integration.{br}

You define the mappings of fields that should be processed during the import of data from BigCommerce into Acumatica ERP on the '''Import Mapping''' tab of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) form. During the import process, data from the specified fields is fetched and processed according to the defined mappings.{br}

To map two fields that will be processed during the import process, you specify values in the following columns:[anchor|#_f9891ad2-0f63-4ed3-acf1-63741bbd9692]
*'''Target Object''': An Acumatica ERP object, which is a related set of fields, for the entity. The list of objects available for selection depends on the entity selected in the Summary area.
*'''Target Field''': A field related to the selected target object. The fields that are displayed in the list depend on the selected object.
*'''Source Object''': An object in the e-commerce system, which is a related set of fields, for the entity. The list of objects available for selection depends on the entity selected in the Summary area.
*'''Source Field / Value''': A field related to the selected source object. The fields that are displayed in the list depend on the selected object. In this field, you can also define a particular value for the mapped field.

'''Example'''{br}

Suppose that you want to provide the customers of your BigCommerce store the ability to add a note when signing up for a new account. You also want this note to be imported into Acumatica ERP during the synchronization of customer data. The standard customer sign-up form available in the BigCommerce store does not contain a field for a note. To add a note field in BigCommerce and map it to an attribute field in Acumatica ERP, you need to perform the following steps:[anchor|#_552310a0-ffaf-4ddd-a1af-93d5ba96e08d]
#In the BigCommerce store, you open the '''Form Fields''' page by clicking '''Advanced Settings''' > ''' Account Signup Form''' in the left pane, and you create a new field of the text type, ''Message for Admin''.
#In Acumatica ERP, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_50_00|Attributes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) form, you define an attribute with the following settings: 
#*'''Attribute ID''': <tt>MESSAGE</tt>
#*'''Description''': <tt>Message for Admin</tt>
#*'''Control Type''': ''Text''
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_10_00|Customer Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR201000|AR201000]) form, you select a customer class based on which customer records are created when BigCommerce customers are imported to Acumatica ERP—that is, the customer class specified for the store in the '''Customer Class''' box on the '''Customer Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_00|BigCommerce Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) form—and on the '''Attributes''' tab, you add the created attribute.
#On the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] form, you select the store and the ''Customer'' entity, and on the '''Import Mapping''' tab, you specify the following settings.
#:{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="20%" ! Active
!width="20%" ! Target Object
!width="20%" ! Target Field
!width="20%" ! Source Object
!width="20%" ! Source Field / Value
|- 
| Selected
| ''Customer → Attributes''
|  ''Message to Admin''
|  ''Customer → Form Fields''
|  ''Message to Admin''
|}
#:With this mapping, the text that a customer enters in the '''Message to Admin''' field in the customer registration form in the BigCommerce store will be imported to Acumatica ERP during the synchronization of customer data, and will be displayed for the customer in the row of the ''Message for Admin'' attribute on the '''Attributes''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form.

For step-by-step instructions on mapping a nonstandard field for customers, see [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_BigCommerce_Preparing_Entities_Implem_Activity|Preparing Entities for Synchronization: Implementation Activity].[anchor|#_e8c25003-3ada-4ac1-bb35-2f6181ad8e45]
==Auto-Mapping of Fields==
When configuring the mapping of fields of the ''Stock Item'', ''Non-Stock Item'', and ''Template Item'' entities, instead of selecting a particular target field, you can type <tt>&lt;&lt;Auto&#95;Mapping&gt;&gt;</tt> in the '''Target Field''' column. During the synchronization process, the system looks for a field similar to the source field and does one of the following:[anchor|#_05f2eaef-c76e-474a-a5bf-c317fa85dcc2]
*If the field is found, maps it to the source field
*If the field is not found, creates a new text field in the e-commerce system with the same name as that of the source field
((({S:Warn}If ''&lt;&lt;Auto&#95;Mapping&gt;&gt;'' is entered in the target field, you cannot use a formula in the source field.
)))[anchor|#_02757b24-928a-4dc9-9b7c-10339136b05f]
==Removing Standard Mapping for a Field==
You can remove the mapping for fields that you do not want to be synchronized between Acumatica ERP and the external system. You perform the unmapping for import and export directions separately as follows:[anchor|#_c0e5629c-5437-4d7a-b018-841904e7e8fd]
#On the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) form, you select the store and the entity for which you want to modify field mapping.
#Depending on the synchronization direction, you do one of the following:
#*To remove the mapping from an Acumatica ERP field so that it is not used during the import, on the '''Import Mapping''' tab, you select the needed values in the '''Target Object''' and '''Target Field''' columns, and then in the '''Source Object''' column, you select ''&lt;&lt;Unmap&gt;&gt;''.
#*To remove the mapping from a field in the external e-commerce system so that it is not used during the export, on the '''Export Mapping''' tab, you select the needed values in the '''Target Object''' and '''Target Field''' columns, and then in the '''Source Object''' column, you select ''&lt;&lt;Unmap&gt;&gt;''.
#:During the synchronization, the system will not pull data from the unmapped fields or record data to these fields.

==Mappable Fields and Mapping Limitations==
You can define additional mapping or override default mapping for the following types of Acumatica ERP fields:[anchor|#_dd7f76d3-dd2c-494e-b90e-4261fb92727c]
*''Standard fields'': These fields are available in Acumatica ERP out of the box.
*''Custom fields'': These fields are not present in the out-of-the-box version of Acumatica ERP and are created when a customization project is published.
*:((({S:Warn}Only custom fields created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]), and [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) forms can be used for mapping with BigCommerce.
)))
*''Attribute fields'': You define an attribute (that is, additional properties) of customers on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_50_00|Attributes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) form. Then you add the attribute to a customer class on the '''Attributes''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_10_00|Customer Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR201000|AR201000]) form. After that, you specify the appropriate attribute values for particular customers on the '''Attributes''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form. Similarly, you add attributes of inventory items to an item class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form, and then specify the appropriate attribute values for particular stock items, non-stock items, and template items on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items], [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items], and [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_30_00|Template Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN203000|IN203000]) forms, respectively.
*:For more information about attributes, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Attributes|Attributes].
*''User-defined fields'': User-defined fields are similar to attribute fields but are represented differently on Acumatica ERP forms.
*:((({S:Warn}User-defined fields are not supported on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] and [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] forms but are supported on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] and [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_20|Customer Locations] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303020|AR303020]) forms. Thus, you can use in mappings only the user-defined fields created on these forms.
)))
*:For more information about user-defined fields, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_User_Defined_Fields|User-Defined Fields].

The table below lists the entities for which the mapping of nonstandard fields is supported, as well as the types of fields that are supported for each entity. The last column also displays the objects in BigCommerce to which the nonstandard Acumatica ERP fields can be mapped.[anchor|#_ac841a7d-3a8e-47ff-a4c6-db79f8b02503]

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Preparing Entities for Synchronization: Field Mapping In this topic, you will learn how you can map fields between  Acumatica ERP     and BigCommerce to override the standard field mapping or define an additional mapping to suit     your synchronization requirements. Mapping of Fields for Export  Acumatica ERP Commerce                         Edition     provides you with the ability to map fields, which are related to synchronized entities, in  Acumatica ERP     with fields in BigCommerce. You can define additional mappings of standard or custom fields as     well as override the standard mappings provided with the BigCommerce integration. You define the mappings of fields that should be processed during the export of data from  Acumatica ERP     into BigCommerce on the  Export Mapping  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) Entities (BC202000) form. During the export process, data from the specified     fields is fetched and processed according to the defined mappings. To map two fields that will be processed during the export process, you specify values in the     following columns: Target Object : An object in the e-commerce system, which is a                 related set of fields, for the entity. The list of objects available for selection                 depends on the entity selected in the Summary area. Target Field : A field related to the selected target object.                 The fields that are displayed in the list depend on the selected object. Source Object : An  Acumatica ERP object, which is a related set of fields, for the entity. The list of objects                 available for selection depends on the entity selected in the Summary area. Source Field / Value : A field related to the selected source                 object. The fields that are displayed in the list depend on the selected object. In                 this field, you can also define a particular value for the mapped field. Example Suppose that you do not want inventory IDs of stock items maintained in  Acumatica ERP     to be publicly displayed as SKU names on the storefront of your BigCommerce store. Instead, you     want to show alternate IDs. To map the alternate IDs of stock items in  Acumatica ERP     to      stock     keeping units  (SKU) in BigCommerce, you do the     following: In  Acumatica ERP,      you make sure that an alternate ID is specified for each stock item on the        Cross-Reference  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500)      form. On the  Export Mapping  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) Entities      form, you select the store and the  Stock Item  entity, and in the table row, you specify      the following mapping settings. Active Target Object Target Field Source Object Source Field / Value Selected Product Stock Keeping Unit Stock Items → Cross References Alternate ID With this mapping, when you synchronize stock items with the BigCommerce store, the alternate     ID of a stock item will be exported to the  SKU  field of the item in the     BigCommerce store.

On the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) Entities form, you select the store and the  Customer       entity, and on the  Import Mapping  tab, you specify the following       settings. Active Target Object Target Field Source Object Source Field / Value Selected Customer → Attributes Message to Admin Customer → Form Fields Message to Admin With this mapping, the text that a customer enters in the  Message to        Admin  field in the customer registration form in the BigCommerce store will be       imported to  Acumatica ERP       during the synchronization of customer data, and will be displayed for the customer in the row       of the  Message for Admin  attribute on the  Attributes  tab of the          ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000) form. For step-by-step instructions on mapping a nonstandard field for customers, see  Preparing Entities for Synchronization: Implementation Activity. Auto-Mapping of Fields When configuring the mapping of fields of the  Stock Item ,  Non-Stock                     Item , and  Template Item  entities, instead of selecting a particular                 target field, you can type  <<Auto_Mapping>>  in the                      Target Field  column. During the synchronization process,                 the system looks for a field similar to the source field and does one of the                 following: If the field is found, maps it to the source field If the field is not found, creates a new text field in the e-commerce system                     with the same name as that of the source field If  <<Auto_Mapping>>  is entered in the target field, you cannot use a                 formula in the source field. Removing Standard Mapping for a Field You can remove the mapping for fields that you do not want to be synchronized between                      Acumatica ERP and the external system. You perform the unmapping for import and export                 directions separately as follows: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) Entities (BC202000) form, you select                     the store and the entity for which you want to modify field mapping. Depending on the synchronization direction, you do one of the following: To remove the mapping from an  Acumatica ERP field so that it is not used during the import, on the                                  Import Mapping  tab, you select the needed                             values in the  Target Object  and  Target                                 Field  columns, and then in the  Source                                 Object  column, you select  <<Unmap>> . To remove the mapping from a field in the external e-commerce system so                             that it is not used during the export, on the  Export                                 Mapping  tab, you select the needed values in the                                  Target Object  and  Target                                 Field  columns, and then in the  Source                                 Object  column, you select  <<Unmap>> .

Only custom fields created on       the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000),   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000),       and   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) forms can be used for mapping with       BigCommerce. Attribute fields : You define an attribute (that is, additional properties) of      customers on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) Attributes (CS205000) form. Then you add the attribute to      a customer class on the  Attributes  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR201000|AR201000]) Customer Classes (AR201000) form. After that, you specify the appropriate attribute      values for particular customers on the  Attributes  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers form. Similarly, you add attributes of inventory items to an item      class on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN102000) form, and then specify the appropriate      attribute values for particular stock items, non-stock items, and template items on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items,   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items, and   ([~/?ScreenId=IN203000|IN203000]) Template Items (IN203000) forms, respectively.

In this activity, you will define a subset of stock items maintained in Acumatica ERP that should be synchronized with the BigCommerce store. You will also learn how to exclude a particular customer from synchronization, and map a custom field on the customer registration form in BigCommerce to the corresponding attribute form in Acumatica ERP.
==Story==
As an implementation consultant helping SweetLife to set up the integration between Acumatica ERP and the online store deployed on the BigCommerce platform, you need to configure the synchronization of only a subset of stock items that will be available for sale on the e-commerce website. The SweetLife store is going to sell jams, and all stock items that need to be prepared for synchronization belong to the ''Jam'' item class.{br}

You also need to configure the generic retail customer, ''RETSALE'', to be excluded (that is, skipped) from the synchronization processes.{br}

Additionally, you want to update the customer registration form in the BigCommerce store to have an additional field that you use to collect information about the size of your business customers. You want this information to be imported to Acumatica ERP along with the other customer data.
==Process Overview==
In this activity, you will first review the stock items that need to be exported to the BigCommerce store on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. Then on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) form, you will configure the filtering options for the ''Stock Item'' entity to include in the synchronization only stock items of the ''Jam'' item class. {br}

While remaining on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] form, you will set up the filtering options for the ''Customer'' entity to exclude the ''RETSALE'' customer from synchronization.{br}

Finally, you will create a custom field on the customer registration form in the BigCommerce store, add the ''ORGSIZE'' attribute to the customer class of e-commerce customers (that is, the ''ECCUSTOMER'' class) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_10_00|Customer Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR201000|AR201000]) form, and map the attribute to the BigCommerce organization size field on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] form.
==System Preparation==
Before you start the synchronization process, do the following:[anchor|#_fdaaccc6-0454-4347-a601-ce516fe76910]
*Make sure the connection to the BigCommerce store has been established and the minimum configuration has been performed, as described in [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_BigCommerce_Initial_Configuration_Implem_Activity|Initial Configuration: To Establish and Configure the Store Connection].
*Sign in to the Acumatica ERP instance with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded by using the ''gibbs'' username and the ''123'' password.

==Step 1: Reviewing the Stock Items to Be Sold Online==
To find the stock items that will be sold online, do the following:[anchor|#_986c59c0-4053-4f38-b9e8-4add2663d170]
#Open the Stock Items (IN2025PL) form.
#Filter the stock items to display only the items of the ''Jam'' item class as follows: 
##In the '''Item Class''' column, click the column header.
##In the menu that opens, select the ''Equals'' filter condition.
##In the box at the bottom of the menu, type <tt>Jam</tt>.
##Click '''OK''' to apply the filter.
#:Now all stock items of the ''Jam'' item class are displayed. These are the stock items that will need to be exported to the BigCommerce store.

==Step 2: Configuring the Stock Item Entity to Export a Subset of Stock Items==
To configure the ''Stock Item'' entity to export to the BigCommerce store only stock items of the ''Jam'' item class, do the following:[anchor|#_faa8d8c3-4e68-457d-819e-972b768e33d0]
#Open the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) form.
#In the '''Store''' box, select the BigCommerce store for which you are configuring the entities.
#In the '''Entity''' box, select ''Stock Item''.
#:Notice that this entity is configured to be only exported to the BigCommerce store (the '''Sync Direction''' is set to ''Export''), and only two tabs, '''Export Mapping''' and '''Export Filtering''', are displayed.
#On the '''Export Filtering''' tab, add a row to the table, and in the row, specify the following settings to define the filtering condition:
#*'''Active''': Selected
#*'''Field Name''': ''Item Class''
#* '''Condition''': ''Equals''
#* '''Value''': <tt>Jam</tt>
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save''' to save your changes.
#:Now when you synchronize the ''Stock Item'' entity, only the stock items of the ''Jam'' item class will be exported to the BigCommerce store.
#:((({S:Warn}Filtering rules do not affect data that has already been synchronized. For example, if you first synchronize the ''Stock Item'' entity without filters, apply the filter described above, and run the synchronization again, previously synchronized stock items will remain synchronized; however, they will be excluded from subsequent synchronizations.
)))

==Step 3: Configuring the Customer Entity to Not Sync a Particular Customer Record==
To configure the ''Customer'' entity to exclude the ''RETSALE'' customer from synchronization, do the following:[anchor|#_48641b0e-63a8-47bf-9dd1-6b8de986cbc2]
#Open the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) form.
#In the '''Store''' box, select the BigCommerce store for which you are configuring the entities.
#In the '''Entity''' box, select ''Customer''.
#:Notice that this entity is configured to be both imported and exported (that is, '''Sync Direction''' is set to ''Bidirectional''), so four tabs—'''Import Mapping''', '''Import Filtering''', '''Export Mapping''', and '''Export Filtering'''—are displayed on the form.
#On the '''Export Filtering''' tab, add a row to the table, and in the row, specify the following settings to define the filtering condition:
#*'''Active''': Selected
#*'''Field Name''': ''Customer ID''
#* '''Condition''': ''Does Not Equal''
#* '''Value''': <tt>RETSALE</tt>
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save''' to save your changes.
#:Now when you synchronize the ''Customer'' entity, the ''RETSALE'' customer will be skipped from the process.

==Step 4: Reviewing the Organization Size Attribute in Acumatica ERP==
To see how the ''ORGSIZE'' attribute has been set up in the Acumatica ERP instance, do the following:[anchor|#_fff9c38e-de08-481c-9cdc-46d8c7863e24]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_50_00|Attributes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) form, in the '''Attribute ID''' box, select ''ORGSIZE''.
#:Take note of the description of the attribute and the descriptions of the attribute values. You will use them for creating the corresponding custom field in BigCommerce.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_10_00|Customer Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR201000|AR201000]) form, in the '''Class ID''' box, select ''ECCUSTOMER''.
#On the '''Attributes''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar.
#In the '''Attribute ID''' column, select the ''ORGSIZE'' attribute.
#Click '''Save & Close''' on the form toolbar to save your changes.

==Step 5: Adding a Custom Field to the Customer Registration Form in BigCommerce==
To add a new field to the customer registration form in the BigCommerce store, do the following:[anchor|#_f128155a-8620-408c-bbdb-0caed547c61b]
#Sign in to the BigCommerce store by using the administrator credentials.
#In the left pane, click '''Advanced Settings''' > ''' Account Signup Form'''.
#On the '''Account Signup Fields''' tab of the '''Form Fields''' page, which opens, click '''Create a New Field''' > ''' Pick List'''.
#In the '''Create a Radio Buttons''' dialog box, specify the following settings:
#*'''Field Name''': <tt>Organization size</tt>
#*:This field name corresponds to the description of the ''ORGSIZE'' attribute in Acumatica ERP.
#*'''Instructional Text''': <tt>Tell us how large your company is</tt>
#*'''List of Values''':
#**1-100 employees
#**100-500 employees
#**Over 500 employees
#*:These values correspond to the descriptions of values of the ''ORGSIZE'' attribute in Acumatica ERP.
#Click '''Save''' to save the new field.

==Step 6: Mapping the ORGSIZE Customer Attribute in Acumatica ERP to the Custom Organization Size Field in BigCommerce==
To map the ''ORGSIZE'' customer attribute that you configured in Step 4 to the '''Organization Size''' field that you configured in Step 5, do the following:[anchor|#_edb4d273-bb9c-4620-9003-41d71e607b68]
#Open the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) form.
#In the Selection area, in the '''Entity''' box, select ''Customer''.
#On the '''Import Mapping''' tab, specify the following condition:
#*'''Active''': Selected
#*'''Target Object''': ''Customer → Attributes''
#* '''Target Field''': ''Organization size''
#* '''Source Object''': ''Customer → Form Fields''
#* '''Source Field / Value''': ''Organization size''
#Click '''Save''' on the form toolbar to save your changes.
#:Now if a customer selects a value in the '''Organization size''' drop-down box on the BigCommerce registration form, after the ''Customer'' entity is synchronized with Acumatica ERP, the selected option will appear on the '''Attributes''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form.

Now that you have configured the filtering and mapping settings for customers and stock items, you can proceed to the synchronization of these entities.]]></column>
			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Preparing Entities for Synchronization: Implementation Activity In this activity, you will define a subset of stock items maintained in  Acumatica ERP that should be synchronized with the BigCommerce store. You will also learn how                 to exclude a particular customer from synchronization, and map a custom field on the                 customer registration form in BigCommerce to the corresponding attribute form in  Acumatica ERP. Story As an implementation consultant helping SweetLife to set up the integration between                      Acumatica ERP and the online store deployed on the BigCommerce platform, you need to configure                 the synchronization of only a subset of stock items that will be available for sale                 on the e-commerce website. The SweetLife store is going to sell                 jams ,                 and all stock items that need to be prepared for synchronization belong to the                      Jam  item class. You also need to configure the generic retail customer,  RETSALE , to be                 excluded (that is, skipped) from the synchronization processes. Additionally, you want to update the customer registration form in the BigCommerce                 store to have an additional field that you use to collect information about the size                 of your business customers. You want this information to be imported to  Acumatica ERP along with the other customer data. Process Overview In this activity, you will first review the stock items that need to be exported to                 the BigCommerce store on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form. Then                 on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) Entities (BC202000) form, you will configure the                 filtering options for the  Stock Item  entity to include in the synchronization                 only stock items of the  Jam  item class.  While remaining on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) Entities form, you will set up the                 filtering options for the  Customer  entity to exclude the  RETSALE                  customer from synchronization. Finally, you will create a custom field on the customer registration form in the                 BigCommerce store, add the  ORGSIZE  attribute to the customer class of                 e-commerce customers (that is, the  ECCUSTOMER  class) on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR201000|AR201000]) Customer Classes (AR201000) form, and map the attribute to the                 BigCommerce organization size field on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) Entities form. System Preparation Before you start the synchronization process, do the following: Make sure the connection to the BigCommerce store has been established and the                     minimum configuration has been performed, as described in  Initial Configuration: To Establish and Configure the Store Connection. Sign in to the  Acumatica ERP instance with the  U100  dataset preloaded by using                      the                          gibbs  username and the  123  password. Step 1: Reviewing the Stock Items to Be Sold Online To find the stock items that will be sold online, do the following: Open the Stock Items (IN2025PL) form. Filter the stock items to display only the items of the  Jam  item class as                     follows:  In the  Item Class  column, click the column                             header. In the menu that opens, select the  Equals  filter condition. In the box at the bottom of the menu, type                              Jam . Click  OK  to apply the filter. Now                         all stock items of the  Jam  item class are displayed. These are the                         stock items that will need to be exported to the BigCommerce                     store. Step 2: Configuring the Stock Item Entity to Export a Subset of Stock                 Items To configure the  Stock Item  entity to export to the BigCommerce store only                 stock items of the  Jam  item class, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) Entities (BC202000) form. In the  Store  box, select the BigCommerce store for which                     you are configuring the entities. In the  Entity  box, select  Stock Item . Notice                         that this entity is configured to be only exported to the BigCommerce store                         (the                              Sync                              Direction  is set to  Export ), and                         only two tabs,  Export Mapping  and  Export                             Filtering , are displayed. On the  Export Filtering  tab, add a row to the table, and                     in the row, specify the following settings to define the filtering condition: Active : Selected Field Name :  Item Class Condition :  Equals Value :  Jam On the form toolbar, click  Save  to save your                         changes. Now when you synchronize the  Stock Item  entity, only the                         stock items of the  Jam  item class will be exported to the BigCommerce                         store. Filtering rules                          do                         not affect  data that has already been synchronized. For                         example, if you first synchronize the  Stock Item  entity without                         filters, apply the filter described above, and run the synchronization                         again, previously synchronized stock items will remain                         synchronized ;                         however, they will be excluded from subsequent                         synchronizations. Step 3: Configuring the Customer Entity to Not Sync a Particular Customer                 Record To configure the  Customer  entity to exclude the  RETSALE  customer from                 synchronization, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) Entities (BC202000) form. In the  Store  box, select the BigCommerce store for which                     you are configuring the entities. In the  Entity  box, select  Customer . Notice that                         this entity is configured to be both imported and exported (that is,                              Sync                              Direction  is set to  Bidirectional ),                         so four tabs— Import Mapping ,  Import                             Filtering ,  Export Mapping , and                              Export Filtering —are displayed on the                         form. On the  Export Filtering  tab, add a row to the table, and                     in the row, specify the following settings to define the filtering condition: Active : Selected Field Name :  Customer ID Condition :  Does Not Equal Value :  RETSALE On the form toolbar, click  Save  to save your                         changes. Now when you synchronize the  Customer  entity, the                              RETSALE  customer will be skipped from the process. Step 4: Reviewing the Organization Size Attribute in  Acumatica ERPTo see how the  ORGSIZE  attribute has been set up in the  Acumatica ERP instance, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) Attributes (CS205000) form, in the                              Attribute ID  box, select  ORGSIZE . Take                             note of the description of the attribute and the descriptions of the                             attribute values. You will use them for creating the corresponding                             custom field in BigCommerce. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR201000|AR201000]) Customer Classes (AR201000) form, in the                              Class ID  box, select  ECCUSTOMER . On the  Attributes  tab, click  Add                             Row  on the table toolbar. In the  Attribute ID  column, select the  ORGSIZE                          attribute. Click  Save & Close  on the form toolbar to save                         your changes. Step 5: Adding a Custom Field to the Customer Registration Form in                 BigCommerce To add a new field to the customer registration form in the BigCommerce store, do the                 following: Sign in to the BigCommerce store by using the administrator credentials. In the left pane, click  Advanced Settings  Account Signup Form . On the  Account Signup Fields  tab of the  Form                         Fields  page, which opens, click  Create a New Field  Pick List . In the  Create                          a                         Radio Buttons                      dialog box, specify the following settings: Field Name :  Organization                                 size This field name corresponds to the description of                                 the  ORGSIZE  attribute in  Acumatica ERP. Instructional Text :  Tell us how large                                 your company is List of Values : 1-100 employees 100-500 employees Over 500 employees These values correspond to the descriptions of values of the                                      ORGSIZE  attribute in  Acumatica ERP. Click  Save  to save the new field. Step 6: Mapping the ORGSIZE Customer Attribute in  Acumatica ERP to the Custom Organization Size Field in BigCommerce To map the  ORGSIZE  customer attribute that you configured in Step 4 to the                      Organization Size  field that you configured in Step 5, do                 the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) Entities (BC202000) form. In the Selection area, in the  Entity  box, select                          Customer . On the  Import Mapping  tab, specify the following                         condition: Active : Selected Target Object :  Customer → Attributes Target Field :  Organization size Source Object :  Customer → Form Fields Source Field / Value :  Organization                             size Click  Save  on the form toolbar to save your                         changes. Now if a customer selects a value in the  Organization                             size  drop-down box on the BigCommerce registration form,                         after the  Customer  entity is synchronized with  Acumatica ERP, the selected option will appear on the  Attributes                          tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000) form. Now that you have configured the filtering and mapping settings for customers and                 stock items, you can proceed to the synchronization of these entities. ]]></column>

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Scheduling Synchronization: General Information After you have completed the initial synchronization of the needed entities, you might want         some of the entities to continue to be synchronized in real time or at regular intervals.         For example, you might want sales orders, payments, and shipments to be imported from the         BigCommerce store into  Acumatica ERP as soon as the order is completed, whereas exporting price lists from  Acumatica ERP to the BigCommerce store might only be required once a month. Learning Objectives In this section, you will learn the following: How to set up automated synchronization of entities for standard and optimized           performance How to enable real-time synchronization of an entity How to schedule the synchronization of an entity Applicable Scenarios You set up the automated synchronization of entities to ensure that the entities are         automatically exported and imported to the appropriate system in a timely manner. The next section provides the recommended configuration for companies with a large volume         of orders. Recommended Synchronization Schedules Depending on the volume of orders processed by your company, we recommend that you         configure entities to be synchronized automatically as described in the following         tables. Recommended Synchronization Setup for Lower Volumes The schedules in these table are recommended for companies that process no more than a           thousand orders daily. Entity Real-Time Sync Data                 Preparation Data                  Processing Sales Order Start real-time synchronization; select the                        Prepare                       & Process  real-time mode Set up the schedule to enable real-time sync once a night Set up the schedule to                    prepare                   data  once a night Set up the schedule to                    process                   data  once a night Shipment Start real-time synchronization; select the                        Prepare                       & Process  real-time mode Set up the schedule to enable real-time sync once a night Set up the schedule to                    prepare                   data  once a night Set up the schedule to                    process                   data  once a night Product Availability Stop real-time synchronization Set up the schedule to                  prepare                 data  every 60 minutes Set up the schedule to                  process                 data  every 60 minutes Other entities Stop real-time synchronization Set up the schedule to                  prepare                 data  once a night Set up the schedule to                  process                 data  once a night We recommend that you not enable real-time synchronization if you plan to change             configuration settings or to perform mass-addition, mass-deletion, and mass-update             operations, including by means of import scenarios. We also recommend that you start             real-time synchronization only after you begin production use to avoid unnecessary             server traffic during the implementation. Recommended Synchronization Setup for Higher Volumes The schedules in this table are recommended for companies that process over a thousand           online orders daily.

If the  Sync Direction  is  Import , only real-time                   export is enabled for the entity. If the  Sync Direction  is  Bidirectional , both                   real-time export and real-time import are enabled for the entity. The direction of the synchronization is predefined by the system and can be                 changed only for some of the entities. Primary System : The system that will be used as the source of               data during the synchronization of an entity The primary system is determined based                 on the direction of the synchronization. For  Export , the  Local  system                 is set to be the primary system. For  Import , the  External  system is                 set to be the primary system. For  Bidirectional , you can select which system                 should be used as the primary system based on your processes. Real-Time Mode : The mode of the processing of the               synchronization records. You can select one of the following options:  Prepare : As soon as a push notification about a change to data is                   received, the corresponding synchronization record is placed in the processing                   queue. Prepare & Process : As soon as a push notification about a change to                   data is received, the corresponding synchronization record is placed in the                   processing queue, and the data synchronization process is immediately started for                   the synchronization record. On the form toolbar, you click  Start Real-Time Sync  to start the           real-time synchronization process. To stop real-time synchronization for an entity, you select the store and the entity in the         Selection area, and then click  Stop Real-Time Sync  on the form         toolbar.. The status of the real-time export and import processes for an entity are displayed in the            Real-Time Import  and  Real-Time Export  boxes         in the Selection area. For detailed instructions on how to enable real-time synchronization, see  Scheduling Synchronization: To Enable Real-Time Sync of Shipments. Scheduled Synchronization You set up a schedule according to which specific entities should be synchronized between         the two systems by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM205020|SM205020]) Automation Schedules (SM205020) form, which you can         open directly or by clicking  Schedule  Add  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) Prepare Data (BC501000) form or         on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501500|BC501500]) Process Data (BC501500) form.

In this activity, you will learn how to enable real-time synchronization of shipments.
==Story==
As an implementation consultant helping SweetLife to set up integration with BigCommerce, you want to configure continuous synchronization of particular entities. As part of the setup, you need to enable real-time synchronization of shipments so that shipments are exported to the BigCommerce website as soon as they are created or updated in Acumatica ERP.
==Process Overview==
In this activity, you will configure the system to immediately synchronize the changes in shipments with the BigCommerce store and then enable real-time synchronization for the ''Shipment'' entity by using the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) form. 
==System Preparation==
Before you enable real-time synchronization for the ''Shipment'' entity, do the following:[anchor|#_fdaaccc6-0454-4347-a601-ce516fe76910]
*Make sure that the following prerequisites have been met:
**The BigCommerce store has been created and configured, as described in [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_BigCommerce_Initial_Configuration_Set_Up_BC_Store_Activity|Initial Configuration: To Set Up a BigCommerce Store].
**The connection to the BigCommerce store has been established and the initial configuration has been performed, as described in [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_BigCommerce_Initial_Configuration_Implem_Activity|Initial Configuration: To Establish and Configure the Store Connection].
**The entities have been prepared for synchronization, as described in [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_BigCommerce_Preparing_Entities_Implem_Activity|Preparing Entities for Synchronization: Implementation Activity].
*Sign in to the Acumatica ERP instance with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded by using the ''gibbs''username and ''123'' password.

==Step: Enabling Real-Time Synchronization for Shipments==
Perform the following instructions to enable real-time synchronization for shipments:[anchor|#_a45d5e33-9bce-4732-a95c-86273b5253b7]
#Open the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) form.
#In the '''Store''' box, select the BigCommerce store for which you are configuring synchronization.
#In the '''Entity''' box, select the ''Shipment'' entity.
#In the '''Real-Time Mode''' box, select ''Prepare & Process''.
#:With this setting, when the real-time synchronization process creates or updates in the processing queue a synchronization record with changes in a shipment, it will also start processing this synchronization record so that out-of-sync data in the shipment are saved in the BigCommerce store.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Start Real-Time Sync'''.
#:Starting real-time synchronization can take a few seconds. After the real-time synchronization is turned on, the '''Real-Time Status''' will change from ''Stopped'' to ''Running''.
((({S:Hint}We recommend that you test the configuration by creating a new shipment for an existing sales order or updating an existing shipment in Acumatica ERP, and then reviewing the corresponding shipment record in the BigCommerce store. If for some reason the changes have not been synchronized, review the corresponding synchronization record on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_30_10_00|Sync History] ([~/?ScreenId=BC301000|BC301000]) form.

The following activity will walk you through the process of creating an automation schedule. You will create two automation schedules to gain greater familiarity with the process. The first schedule will pull changes in sales orders every 10 minutes. The second schedule will start the data processing for out-of-sync order data every 10 minutes.
==Story==
As an implementation consultant helping SweetLife to set up integration with BigCommerce, you want to configure continuous synchronization of entities. As part of the setup, you need to configure the system to capture new and changed sales orders in BigCommerce every 10 minutes and import these changes to Acumatica ERP. 
==Process Overview==
First, on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_50_10_00|Prepare Data] ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) form, you will configure the conditions for preparing data for the ''Sales Order'' entity. Then on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_20|Automation Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=SM205020|SM205020]) form, you will create an automation schedule that will start the data preparation process for the ''Sales Order'' entity every 10 minutes. After that, on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_50_15_00|Process Data] ([~/?ScreenId=BC501500|BC501500]) form, you will configure the conditions for processing data for the ''Sales Order'' entity. Then on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_20|Automation Schedules] form, you will create an automation schedule that will start data processing for the ''Sales Order'' entity every 10 minutes.
==System Preparation==
Before you start scheduling automated synchronization for an entity, do the following:[anchor|#_fdaaccc6-0454-4347-a601-ce516fe76910]

#**:This is the time between executions of the scheduled process.
#Review the settings on the '''Filter Values''' tab.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save & Close''' to save the changes to the automation schedule.

You have configured two automation schedules for the ''Sales Order'' entity. Now the first automation schedule will start the data preparation process every 10 minutes to retrieve the changed data in sales orders, if any changes have occurred in the BigCommerce store since the previous data preparation, and will place it in the processing queue. The second schedule will start data processing for the ''Sales Order'' entity to process the synchronization records that have not yet been synchronized. During data processing, the system will also attempt to synchronize the sales order synchronization records that could not be synchronized before (that is, the synchronization records that have the ''Failed'' status).((({S:Hint}We recommend that you test the schedule configuration by creating a new or updating an existing sales order in the BigCommerce store, waiting for 10 minutes to give the schedule enough time to be executed, and then reviewing the corresponding sales order record in Acumatica ERP. If for some reason the changes have not been synchronized, review the corresponding synchronization record on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_30_10_00|Sync History] ([~/?ScreenId=BC301000|BC301000]) form.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Scheduling Synchronization: To Configure a Synchronization Schedule for Sales         Orders The following activity will walk you through the process of creating                  an                  automation                 schedule .                  You                 will create two automation schedules to gain greater familiarity with the process.                  The first schedule will                  pull                  changes in sales orders every 10 minutes. The second schedule will start the                  data                 processing for  out-of-sync order data every 10 minutes. Story As an implementation consultant helping SweetLife to set up integration with                 BigCommerce, you want to configure continuous synchronization of entities. As part                 of the setup, you need to configure the system to capture new and changed sales                 orders in BigCommerce every 10 minutes and import these changes to  Acumatica ERP.  Process Overview First, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) Prepare Data (BC501000) form, you will configure the                 conditions for                  preparing                  data for the  Sales Order  entity. Then on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM205020|SM205020]) Automation Schedules                 (SM205020) form, you will create an automation schedule that will start the                  data                 preparation  process for the  Sales Order  entity every 10                 minutes. After that, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501500|BC501500]) Process Data (BC501500) form, you                 will configure the conditions for                  processing                  data for the  Sales Order  entity. Then on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM205020|SM205020]) Automation Schedules                 form, you will create an automation schedule that will start                  data                 processing  for the  Sales Order  entity every 10 minutes. System Preparation Before you start scheduling automated synchronization for an entity, do the                 following: Make sure that the following prerequisites have been met: The BigCommerce store has been created and configured, as described in                                  Initial Configuration: To Set Up a BigCommerce Store. The connection to the BigCommerce store has been established and the                             initial configuration has been performed, as detailed in the steps in                                  Initial Configuration: To Establish and Configure the Store Connection. The entities have been prepared for synchronization, as described in                                  Preparing Entities for Synchronization: Implementation Activity.

Step 1: Schedule the Automatic Data Fetch for Sales Orders To configure an automation schedule that will start the data                  preparation                  process for the  Sales Order  entity every 10 minutes, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) Prepare Data (BC501000) form. In the                      Selection                      area of the form, specify the following settings: Store : The name of the store for which you are                              synchronizing                             data Prepare                                  Mode :  Incremental With this option selected,                                 during the                                  data                                 preparation  process for the selected entities,                                 only records that have been modified since the previous                                  data                                 preparation  will be placed in the processing                                 queue. In the table, select the unlabeled check box in the row of the  Sales                         Order  entity. On the form toolbar, click  Schedules  Add . This opens the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM205020|SM205020]) Automation Schedules (SM205020) form                         in a pop-up window. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM205020|SM205020]) Automation Schedules form, in the                          Description  box, enter a description for the new                     schedule, for example,                          Prepare                         Data -  Sales Orders . Make sure that                          Prepare                          Data  is selected in the  Screen ID  box. In the  Action Name  box, select the                          Prepare                          action. This schedule will invoke the data                          preparation                          action for only the selected entities. On the  Details  tab, specify the additional settings of                     the schedule as follows: In the  Starts On  box, select the start date. By                             default, the schedule execution starts on the current business                             date. Select the  No Execution Limit  check box. On the  Schedule  tab, configure the execution dates and                     times as follows: In the  Schedule Type  section, select                              Daily . In the  Execution Time  section, specify the                             settings as follows: In the  Starts On  box, select  12:00                                         AM . This is the time when the schedule will be first                                         executed on a particular day. In the  Every  box, type                                          00:10 . This box holds the time in                                         hours and minutes ( hh:mm ) between                                         executions of the scheduled process. Review the settings on the  Conditions  and                          Filter Values  tabs. The system has inserted the                         selections you have made on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) Prepare Data form earlier                         in this step. On the form toolbar, click  Save & Close  to save the                     changes to the automation schedule. Now changes in sales orders in the                         BigCommerce store will be                          pulled                          every 10 minutes, and                          placed                         in the processing queue for synchronization. In the next step, you will                         configure an automation schedule that will start                          data processing for                         the  Sales Order  entity every 10 minutes. Step 2: Schedule Automatic Data Sync for Sales Orders To configure an automation schedule that will start                  data                 processing  for the  Sales Order  entity every 10 minutes, do                 the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501500|BC501500]) Process Data (BC501500) form. In the                      Selection                      area of the form, specify the following settings: Store : The name of the store for which you are                              synchronizing                              data Entity :  Sales Order On the form toolbar, click  Schedules  Add . This opens the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM205020|SM205020]) Automation Schedules (SM205020) form                         in a pop-up window. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM205020|SM205020]) Automation Schedules form, in the                          Description  box, enter a description for the new                     schedule, for example,                          Process                         Data -  Sales Orders . Make sure that                          Process                          Data  is selected in the  Screen ID  box. In the  Action Name  box, select the  Process All                          action. This schedule will start                          data                         processing  for all rows on the form that match the                         specified filtering conditions. On the  Details  tab, specify the additional settings of                     the schedule as follows: In the  Starts On  box, select the start date. By                             default, the schedule execution starts on the current business                             date. Select the  No Execution Limit  check box. On the  Schedule  tab, configure the execution dates and                     times as follows: In the  Schedule Type  section, select                              Daily . In the  Execution Time  section, specify the                             settings as follows: In the  Starts On  box, select  12:05                                         AM . This is the time when the schedule will be first                                         executed on a particular day. In the  Every  box, type                                          00:10 . This is the time between                                         executions of the scheduled process. Review the settings on the  Filter Values  tab. On the form toolbar, click  Save & Close  to save the                     changes to the automation schedule. You have configured two automation schedules for the  Sales Order  entity. Now                 the first automation schedule will start the                  data                 preparation  process every 10 minutes to retrieve the changed data                 in sales orders, if any changes have occurred in the BigCommerce store since the                 previous                  data                 preparation , and will place it in the processing queue. The second                 schedule will start                  data                 processing  for the  Sales Order  entity to process the                 synchronization records that have not yet been synchronized.                  During                 data processing, the system  will also attempt to synchronize the                 sales order synchronization records that could not be synchronized before (that is,                 the synchronization records that have the  Failed  status). We recommend that you test the schedule configuration by creating a new                 or updating an existing sales order in the BigCommerce store, waiting for 10 minutes                 to give the schedule enough time to be executed, and then reviewing the                 corresponding sales order record in  Acumatica ERP. If for some reason the changes have not been synchronized, review the                 corresponding synchronization record on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC301000|BC301000]) Sync History                 (BC301000) form. ]]></column>

 Acumatica ERP Commerce                         Edition provides flexible ways of managing sales prices. You can assign prices to stock and non-stock items, maintain specific prices for particular customers or groups of customers with similar buying habits, or assign discounted prices for customers buying in bulk. For more information about the types of prices supported in Acumatica ERP, see [HelpRoot_PricesAndDiscounts\PriceDiscount_Reviewing_Sales_Prices_GeneralInfo|Sales Prices: General Information].{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this section, you will learn how to synchronize sales price lists between Acumatica ERP and the BigCommerce store.
==Applicable Scenarios==
You might want to synchronize sales prices from Acumatica ERP with the BigCommerce store in the following cases:[anchor|#_e39d7ae8-50ad-4b09-a31c-27b0f84926b7]
*You maintain base prices of non-stock and stock items in Acumatica ERP and want to quickly update sales prices of the corresponding products in BigCommerce.
*You offer special prices to customers that are assigned to a particular customer price class and want to continue offering the same prices in the BigCommerce store.
[anchor|#_763fd053-6263-4006-9add-1319dfa039f3]
==Types of Sales Prices Synchronized with BigCommerce==
The following basic types of prices that you maintain in Acumatica ERP can be synchronized with the BigCommerce store:[anchor|#_c7eb6776-b9d2-43e6-bc06-9818f43c25ba]
*''Default prices'': The default price of a particular stock item is specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form and is exported to the BigCommerce store during the synchronization of the stock item. Similarly, the default price of a non-stock item is maintained on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form and is exported to the BigCommerce store when the non-stock item is synchronized.
*:In the BigCommerce store, the default prices of stock and non-stock items are displayed in the '''Default Price''' box in the '''Pricing''' subsection of the '''Product Information''' section on the '''View Products''' page for a particular stock or non-stock item.
*''Base prices'': Base prices—that is, the prices that are not specific to any customer—are maintained on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form or the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_10|Sales Price Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202010|AR202010]) form and are exported to the BigCommerce store as a separate entity, ''Base Sales Price''.
*:Sales prices of the ''Base'' type imported from Acumatica ERP are saved in BigCommerce in the '''Sale Price''' box in the '''Pricing''' subsection of the '''Product Information''' section on the '''View Products''' page for a particular stock or non-stock item.
*:In BigCommerce, the sales price has a higher priority than the default price. Therefore, when the '''Sale Price''' box is populated for an item, the price specified in this box is the effective price of the item.
*''Prices specific to a customer price class'': Prices that are effective for a particular group of customers—that is, prices that have the ''Customer Price Class'' type—are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form or the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_10|Sales Price Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202010|AR202010]) form and are exported to the BigCommerce store as a separate entity, ''Price List''.
*:''Customer Price Classes'' maintained in Acumatica ERP correspond to customer groups on the '''Customer Groups''' page, which you open by clicking '''Customers''' > ''' Customer Groups''' in the left pane. Prices of the ''Customer Price Class'' type defined for a particular price class imported from Acumatica ERP are saved in the BigCommerce store as a price list for the corresponding customer group on the '''View Price Lists''' page.
*:Prices in a price list are similar to sales prices but are created to be specific to a customer group in BigCommerce. The price of a product defined in a price list for a customer group has a higher priority than the default price or the sales price of the product specified on the product page. The price specific to a customer group is displayed to a customer on the product listing page on the storefront if the customer belongs to the customer group and is signed in.

==Synchronization of Volume-Based Prices==
In Acumatica ERP, if the ''Volume Pricing'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can define prices that are dependent on the quantity of the products being purchased by a customer. These prices can be defined for all customers (that is, they have the ''Base'' type) or for particular customer classes (that is, they have the ''Customer Price Class'' type). For more information on how volume-based pricing works in Acumatica ERP, see [HelpRoot_PricesAndDiscounts\PriceDiscount_Sales_Price_Selection_Volume_Activity|Automatic Price Selection: To Explore Volume-Based Prices].{br}

Volume prices are exported to the BigCommerce store according to their type, as described in the previous section.{br}

Imported volume-dependent prices of the ''Base'' type defined for a product appear in BigCommerce as a table under '''Bulk Pricing''' in the '''Pricing''' subsection on the '''View Products''' page of a particular product. This table contains the '''Min Quantity''' column (which corresponds to a quantity break point in Acumatica ERP) and the '''Unit Price''' column. These prices override the sales price when the quantity of the purchase is higher than the minimum quantity specified for the unit price in the table.{br}

Imported volume-dependent prices of the ''Customer Price Class'' defined for a product appear in BigCommerce in a price list for a particular customer group. To open the price list, you select '''Products''' > ''' Price Lists''' in the left pane to open the '''Price Lists''' page, and then click the name of the price list that corresponds to the customer group. To bring up a table for volume-dependent prices for a particular product, you click the cell in the '''New Bulk Pricing''' column for this product. The volume-dependent prices defined for a product in a price list for a particular group override all other prices when the right combination of the customer, product, and quantity is met (that is, when the customer belonging to the customer group is signed in, and buys the product in quantities corresponding to one of the quantity tiers for which volume-based prices have been defined).
==Limitations of Sales Price Synchronization==
The following price types maintained in Acumatica ERP can be exported to BigCommerce:[anchor|#_d9cf992e-a1c3-45eb-84b6-1cb124a3a802]
*''Prices specific to a customer price class'': Before you can export the list of prices specific to a customer price class (that is, to synchronize the ''Price List'' entity) from Acumatica ERP, you must first synchronize the ''Customer Price Class'' entity. For the price list specific to a customer group to be functional in BigCommerce, you must export customers (that is, synchronize the ''Customer'' entity) assigned to the corresponding customer price class in Acumatica ERP. 
*''Customer-specific prices'': Prices defined in Acumatica ERP for a particular customer—that is, prices that have the ''Customer'' type—cannot be exported to the BigCommerce store. If you want to provide a particular customer with the ability to purchase products at individual prices, create a separate customer price class for this customer. This way, the prices that you define for this customer price class will be available for only the customer that you add to this customer price class.
*''UOM-specific prices'': In Acumatica ERP, if the ''Multiple Units of Measure'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can define a sales price of an item for each of the units of measure in which your company sells this item. However, only prices defined for the base UOM can be exported to BigCommerce.
*''Warehouse-specific prices'': If the ''Multiple Warehouses'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form, prices that are defined to apply only when products are sold from a particular warehouse—that is, when a specific warehouse ID is selected in the '''Warehouse''' column for a particular price—are not exported to the BigCommerce store.
((({S:Warn}Only prices that are effective on the date of the synchronization are exported; historical prices and prices with an effective date in the future are not synchronized. If an item has multiple prices of the same type that are effective on the date of the synchronization, the price of the highest priority is imported. For example, if a regular base price of $5 and a promotional base price of $4.50 for the same item are effective on January 31, 2020, which is the date when you synchronize the ''Base Sales Price'' entity, the promotional price of $4.50 will be exported to the BigCommerce store. For more information about price priorities, see [HelpRoot_PricesAndDiscounts\PriceDiscount_Sales_Price_Selection_GeneralInfo|Automatic Price Selection: Rules of Price Selection] and [HelpRoot_PricesAndDiscounts\PriceDiscount_Sales_Price_Selection_Regular_Activity|Automatic Price Selection: To Explore Regular and Promotional Prices].

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Synchronizing Sales Prices: General Information  Acumatica ERP Commerce                         Edition         provides flexible ways of managing sales prices. You can assign prices to stock and         non-stock items, maintain specific prices for particular customers or groups of customers         with similar buying habits, or assign discounted prices for customers buying in bulk. For         more information about the types of prices supported in  Acumatica ERP, see  Sales Prices: General Information. Learning Objectives In this section, you will learn how to synchronize sales price lists between  Acumatica ERP and the BigCommerce store. Applicable Scenarios You might want to synchronize sales prices from  Acumatica ERP with the BigCommerce store in the following cases: You maintain base prices of non-stock and stock items in  Acumatica ERP and want to quickly update sales prices of the corresponding products in           BigCommerce. You offer special prices to customers that are assigned to a particular customer price           class and want to continue offering the same prices in the BigCommerce store. Types of Sales Prices Synchronized with BigCommerce The following basic types of prices that you maintain in  Acumatica ERP can be synchronized with the BigCommerce store: Default prices : The default price of a particular stock item is specified on the                 ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form and is exported to the BigCommerce             store during the synchronization of the stock item. Similarly, the default price of a             non-stock item is maintained on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form and             is exported to the BigCommerce store when the non-stock item is synchronized. In the BigCommerce store, the default prices of stock and non-stock items are displayed             in the  Default Price  box in the  Pricing              subsection of the  Product Information  section on the                View Products  page for a particular stock or non-stock             item. Base prices : Base prices—that is, the prices that are not specific to any             customer—are maintained on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) Sales Prices (AR202000) form or the                 ([~/?ScreenId=AR202010|AR202010]) Sales Price Worksheets (AR202010) form and are exported to the BigCommerce             store as a separate entity,  Base Sales Price . Sales prices of the  Base  type imported from  Acumatica ERP are saved in BigCommerce in the  Sale Price  box in the                Pricing  subsection of the  Product               Information  section on the  View Products  page for a             particular stock or non-stock item. In BigCommerce, the sales price has a higher priority than the default price.             Therefore, when the  Sale Price  box is populated for an item, the             price specified in this box is the effective price of the item. Prices specific to a customer price class : Prices that are effective for a             particular group of customers—that is, prices that have the  Customer Price Class              type—are defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) Sales Prices (AR202000) form or the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR202010|AR202010]) Sales Price Worksheets (AR202010) form and are exported to the BigCommerce store as             a separate entity,  Price List . Customer Price Classes  maintained in  Acumatica ERP correspond to customer groups on the  Customer Groups  page,             which you open by clicking  Customers  Customer Groups  in the left pane. Prices of the  Customer Price Class  type defined             for a particular price class imported from  Acumatica ERP are saved in the BigCommerce store as a price list for the corresponding customer             group on the  View Price Lists  page. Prices in a price list are similar to sales prices but are created to be specific to a             customer group in BigCommerce. The price of a product defined in a price list for a             customer group has a higher priority than the default price or the sales price of the             product specified on the product page. The price specific to a customer group is             displayed to a customer on the product listing page on the storefront if the customer             belongs to the customer group and is signed in. Synchronization of Volume-Based Prices In  Acumatica ERP, if the  Volume Pricing  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features         (CS100000) form, you can define prices that are dependent on the quantity of the products         being purchased by a customer. These prices can be defined for all customers (that is, they         have the  Base  type) or for particular customer classes (that is, they have the            Customer Price Class  type). For more information on how volume-based pricing works         in  Acumatica ERP, see  Automatic Price Selection: To Explore Volume-Based Prices. Volume prices are exported to the BigCommerce store according to their type, as described         in the previous section. Imported volume-dependent prices of the  Base  type defined for a product appear in         BigCommerce as a table under  Bulk Pricing  in the            Pricing  subsection on the  View Products  page         of a particular product. This table contains the            Min            Quantity  column (which corresponds to a quantity break point in  Acumatica ERP) and the  Unit Price  column. These prices override the sales price         when the quantity of the purchase is higher than the minimum quantity specified for the unit         price in the table. Imported volume-dependent prices of the  Customer Price Class  defined for a product         appear in BigCommerce in a price list for a particular customer group. To open the price         list, you select  Products  Price Lists  in the left pane to open the  Price Lists  page, and         then click the name of the price list that corresponds to the customer group. To bring up a         table for volume-dependent prices for a particular product, you click the cell in the            New Bulk Pricing  column for this product. The volume-dependent         prices defined for a product in a price list for a particular group override all other         prices when the right combination of the customer, product, and quantity is met (that is,         when the customer belonging to the customer group is signed in, and buys the product in         quantities corresponding to one of the quantity tiers for which volume-based prices have         been defined). Limitations of Sales Price Synchronization The following price types maintained in  Acumatica ERP can be exported to BigCommerce: Prices specific to a customer price class : Before you can export the list of           prices specific to a customer price class (that is, to synchronize the  Price List            entity) from  Acumatica ERP, you must first synchronize the  Customer Price Class  entity. For the price list           specific to a customer group to be functional in BigCommerce, you must export customers           (that is, synchronize the  Customer  entity) assigned to the corresponding customer           price class in  Acumatica ERP.  Customer-specific prices : Prices defined in  Acumatica ERP for a particular customer—that is, prices that have the  Customer            type—cannot be exported to the BigCommerce store. If you want to provide a           particular customer with the ability to purchase products at individual prices, create a           separate customer price class for this customer. This way, the prices that you define for           this customer price class will be available for only the customer that you add to this           customer price class. UOM-specific prices : In  Acumatica ERP, if the  Multiple Units of Measure  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, you can define a sales price of an item for           each of the units of measure in which your company sells this item. However, only prices           defined for the base UOM can be exported to BigCommerce. Warehouse-specific prices : If the  Multiple Warehouses  feature is enabled           on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features form, prices that are defined to apply only when           products are sold from a particular warehouse—that is, when a specific warehouse ID           is selected in the  Warehouse  column for a particular           price—are not exported to the BigCommerce store. Only prices that are effective on the date of the synchronization are exported;         historical prices and prices with an effective date in the future are not synchronized. If         an item has multiple prices of the same type that are effective on the date of the         synchronization, the price of the highest priority is imported. For example, if a regular         base price of $5 and a promotional base price of $4.50 for the same item are effective on         January 31, 2020, which is the date when you synchronize the  Base Sales Price  entity,         the promotional price of $4.50 will be exported to the BigCommerce store.

==Story==
Suppose that SweetLife Fruits & Jams wants to maintain all of its sales prices, including the prices of products sold in the BigCommerce online store, in Acumatica ERP. As an implementation consultant, you want to test how different types of prices are exported from Acumatica ERP to the BigCommerce store.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, the following features have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form:[anchor|#_9d6553f8-c1a4-47a7-a600-d91255983b8b]
*''Volume Pricing''
* ''Matrix Items''

The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in the system:[anchor|#_6657a5c9-70b9-446d-8f7d-4176e6c83129]
*The following stock items on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form: ''APJAM32'', ''BANJAM08''. ''PEARJAM96'', and ''BANJAM96''
*The ''LOCAL'' customer price class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_80_00|Customer Price Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR208000|AR208000]) form
*The ''COFFEESHOP'' customer, to which the ''LOCAL'' customer price class is assigned, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form

==Process Overview==
First, you will review the default prices and MSRP that have been specified for particular stock items on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. After that, you will review the sales prices of the ''Base'' and ''Customer Price Class'' types, including volume-dependent prices and prices assigned to some matrix items based on the ''JUICE'' template item, defined for particular items on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form. Then you will synchronize stock items, template items, base sales prices, and price lists with the BigCommerce store by using the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_50_10_00|Prepare Data] ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) and [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_50_15_00|Process Data] ([~/?ScreenId=BC501500|BC501500]) forms. Once the synchronization is complete, you will review the prices of the items in the control panel of the BigCommerce store.
==System Preparation==
Before you start this activity, do the following:[anchor|#_f811a610-8f11-49fe-9fd6-edb04d0e9b26]
#Make sure that the following prerequisites have been met:
#*The BigCommerce store has been created and configured, as described in [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_BigCommerce_Initial_Configuration_Set_Up_BC_Store_Activity|Initial Configuration: To Set Up a BigCommerce Store].
#*The connection to the BigCommerce store is established and the initial configuration has been performed, based on the steps described in [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_BigCommerce_Initial_Configuration_Implem_Activity|Initial Configuration: To Establish and Configure the Store Connection].
#*The entities are prepared for synchronization, as described in [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_BigCommerce_Preparing_Entities_Implem_Activity|Preparing Entities for Synchronization: Implementation Activity].
#Sign in to the Acumatica ERP instance with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded by using the ''admin'' login.

==Step 1: Reviewing the MSRP and Default Prices of Stock Items==
To review the MSRP and default prices defined for ''BANJAM08'', ''APJAM32'', and ''PEARJAM96'' stock items, do the following:[anchor|#_34859d92-2e83-42a7-9309-b36a8aede86a]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form.
#In the Summary area, in the '''Inventory ID''' box, select ''BANJAM08''.
#On the '''Price/Cost Info''' tab, in the '''Price Management''' section, notice the default price defined for the ''BANJAM08'' item, which is $4.15, and the MSRP, which is $4.10.
#In the Summary area, in the '''Inventory ID''' box, select ''APJAM32''.
#On the '''Price/Cost Info''' tab, in the '''Price Management''' section, notice that for this stock item, only the default price is defined ($16.60), and the MSRP is zero.
#In the Summary area, in the '''Inventory ID''' box, select ''PEARJAM96''.
#On the '''Price/Cost Info''' tab, in the '''Price Management''' section, notice that for the ''PEARJAM96'' stock item, only the default price is defined ($45.15), and the MSRP is zero.

==Step 2: Reviewing and Adding the Sales Prices Defined for Stock Items==
To review the sales prices defined for stock items, do the following:[anchor|#_157bbfb8-a804-4c3c-b8df-06b8f140a5bc]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form.
#In the Selection area, in the '''Inventory ID''' box, select ''PEARJAM96''.
#:This is the stock item that you reviewed last in Step 1. In the '''Price''' column of the table, notice that there are two effective prices for this stock item. The first price, $45.00, has the ''Base'' type and thus is effective for all customers. The other price, $43.7, has the ''Customer Price Class'' type and the ''LOCAL'' code, which indicates that this price applies only for customers that belong to the ''LOCAL'' customer price class.
#In the Selection area, in the '''Inventory ID''' box, select ''BANJAM96''.
#:Notice that for the ''BANJAM96'' stock item, the table contains three different prices of the ''Base'' type, which depend on the value in the '''Break Qty''' column. When a customer buys 1 to 4 jars of banana jam, each jar will cost $45; for the purchase of 5 to 9 jars, the effective price will be $43, and if a customer buys 10 or more jars, each will cost $40.
#In the Selection area, clear the '''Inventory ID''' box, and in the '''Item Class ID''' box, select ''MJUICE''.
#In the table, click '''Add Row''' and add three price records as indicated in the following table.
#:{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="17%" ! Price Type
!width="30%" ! Inventory ID
!width="12%" ! UOM
!width="19%" ! Price
!width="20%" ! Effective Date
|- 
| ''Base''
|  ''APL-16OZ-GBT''
|  ''EA''
| <tt>18</tt>
| ''3/2/2020''
|- 
|  ''Base''
|  ''CHR-32OZ-GBT''
|  ''EA''
| <tt>30</tt>
| ''3/2/2020''
|- 
|  ''Base''
|  ''ORG-16OZ-GBT''
|  ''EA''
| <tt>20</tt>
| ''3/2/2020''
|}
#:These stock items are matrix items that were generated in Acumatica ERP based on the ''JUICE'' template item. You can maintain individual sales prices for each of the matrix items.

==Step 3: Synchronizing the Prices of Stock Items==
To synchronize the ''JUICE'' template item (including matrix items that have been generated based on this item), the default prices, the MSRP, and the sales prices of the stock items, do the following:[anchor|#_b35686ad-a477-447f-8e0c-f73361837b84]
#Open the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_50_10_00|Prepare Data] ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) form.
#In the Selection area, specify the following settings:
#*'''Store''': The BigCommerce store with which you are synchronizing data
#*'''Prepare Mode''': ''Incremental''
#In the table, select the unlabeled check box for each of the following entities:
#*''Customer Price Class''
#*:You select this entity because one of the sales prices you reviewed in Step 2 is defined for the ''LOCAL'' customer price class, so you need to export the customer price class before syncing price lists that belong to this customer price class. 
#*''Price List''
#*:The price lists that belong to the ''LOCAL'' customer price class are synchronized when you run the process for the ''Price List'' entity. 
#*''Customer''
#*:This entity is included in this synchronization process so that the customers assigned to the ''LOCAL'' customer price class are exported to the BigCommerce store. You will use a customer of this customer price class (''FourStar Coffee & Sweets Shop'') later in this activity.
#*''Stock Item''
#*:You select this entity for inclusion because the default prices and MSRP are exported as part of the stock item data.
#*''Template Item''
#*:Matrix items, for which you created the prices in Step 2, are exported as part of the synchronization of the ''Template Item'' entity.
#*''Base Sales Price''
#*:When you process this entity, the sales prices of the ''Base'' type defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form are exported.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Synchronizing Sales Prices: Process Activity In this activity, you will explore how sales prices maintained in  Acumatica ERP are exported to and saved in the BigCommerce store. The following activity is             based on the  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system             settings have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the             activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100              dataset to its initial state. Story Suppose that SweetLife Fruits & Jams wants to maintain all of its sales prices,                 including the prices of products sold in the BigCommerce online store, in  Acumatica ERP. As an implementation consultant, you want to test how different types of prices                 are exported from  Acumatica ERP to the BigCommerce store. Configuration Overview For the purposes of this activity, the following features have been enabled on the                       ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form: Volume Pricing Matrix Items The following entities, which you will use in this activity, have been predefined in                 the system: The following stock items on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500)                     form:  APJAM32 ,  BANJAM08 .  PEARJAM96 , and                      BANJAM96 The  LOCAL  customer price class on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR208000|AR208000]) Customer Price Classes                     (AR208000) form The  COFFEESHOP  customer, to which the  LOCAL  customer price class                     is assigned, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000) form The  JUICE  template item on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN203000|IN203000]) Template Items (IN203000)                     form The following matrix items on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form:                          APL-16OZ-GBT ,  CHR-32OZ-GBT . and  ORG-16OZ-GBT The following prices have been defined for the listed stock items on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form: Inventory ID Default Price MSRP APJAM32 16.6 0 BAN JAM08 4.10 4.15 PEARJAM96 45.15 0 The following prices have been defined for the listed stock items on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) Sales Prices (AR202000) form: Inventory ID Price Type Price Code UOM Break Qty Price PEAR JAM 96 Base PIECE 0 45.0 0 PEARJAM96 Customer Price Class LOCAL PIECE 0 43 . 7 0 BANJAM96 Base PIECE 0 45.00 BANJAM96 Base PIECE 5 43 BANJAM96 Base PIECE 10 40 Process Overview First, you will review the default prices and MSRP that have been specified for                 particular stock items on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form. After                 that, you will review the sales prices of the  Base  and  Customer Price                     Class  types, including volume-dependent prices and prices assigned to some                 matrix items based on the  JUICE  template item, defined for particular items                 on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) Sales Prices (AR202000) form.

 Acumatica ERP Commerce                         Edition provides you with the ability to track the availability of stock items that you sell via the BigCommerce store and maintain in Acumatica ERP. You have the flexibility to configure which quantities of a stock item should be included in calculations of the quantity available for sale in the online store.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Define the availability settings to be applied by default to stock items, non-stock items, and template items exported to the BigCommerce store
*Define the availability settings for a particular stock item, non-stock item, or template item exported to the BigCommerce store
*Synchronize the availability of stock items, non-stock items, and template items between Acumatica ERP and the BigCommerce store

==Applicable Scenarios==
You define availability settings (which include the item purchasability settings in the online store and item availability settings in the inventory) and synchronize the availability of stock items, non-stock items and template items maintained in Acumatica ERP with the BigCommerce stores for the following purposes: [anchor|#_7165d0ed-fbf9-4bca-b563-a0155c7a9310]
*To define whether a stock item, a non-stock item or a template item exported to the BigCommerce store should be made available for purchase
*To define whether the quantities of a stock item or a template item should be tracked and synchronized between Acumatica ERP and BigCommerce
*For stock items and template items with tracked quantities, to define whether a stock item or a template item should still be available for purchase if its available quantity becomes zero
[anchor|#_4d5d29fd-f3c9-46a6-829a-c0d265fc1e6b]
==Default Product Availability Settings==
When you initially configure Acumatica ERP Commerce                         Edition, on the '''Inventory Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_00|BigCommerce Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) form, you specify the availability settings that are applied by default to non-stock, stock items, and template items when they are exported to the BigCommerce store.{br}

You first define the default availability status that is assigned to items exported from Acumatica ERP. This status determines whether the exported item can be purchased in the BigCommerce store. To define the default availability status, you select one of the following options in the '''Default Availability''' box:[anchor|#_69cb9705-2463-4096-a63a-5daa55145276]
*''Available - Track Qty'': The stock items and template items exported to the BigCommerce store are available for purchase via the storefront, and their quantities are tracked, meaning that the items can be purchased only if their quantities are greater than zero. In BigCommerce, on the product management page for each of these items, the '''This product can be purchased in my online store''' option button (in the '''Purchasability''' section) and the '''Track inventory''' check box (in the '''Inventory''' section) are selected. 
*:For stock items, the available quantities are tracked on the product level (that is, the '''On the product level''' option button is selected under the '''Track Inventory''' check box). For template items, the available quantities are tracked on the level of matrix items (that is, the '''On the variant level''' option button is selected under the '''Track Inventory''' check box).
*:The non-stock items exported to the BigCommerce store are available for purchase via the storefront, and their quantities are not tracked (that is, the '''Track inventory''' check box is cleared).
*''Available - Don&rsquo;t Track Qty'': The non-stock and stock items exported to the BigCommerce store are available for purchase via the storefront, and their quantities are not tracked. In BigCommerce, on the product management page for each of these items, the '''This product can be purchased in my online store''' option button (in the '''Purchasability''' section) is selected and the '''Track inventory''' check box (in the '''Inventory''' section) is cleared.
*''Pre-Order'': The non-stock and stock items exported to the BigCommerce store are not available for purchase but customers can pre-order them. In BigCommerce, on the product management page for each of these items, the '''This product is coming soon but I want to take pre-orders''' option button (in the '''Purchasability''' section) is selected.
*''Disabled'': The non-stock and stock items exported to the BigCommerce store are not available for purchase. In BigCommerce, on the product management page for each of these items, the '''This product cannot be purchased in my online store''' option button (in the '''Purchasability''' section) is selected.

If you select the ''Available - Track Qty'' option in the '''Default Availability''' box, you need to also specify what action the system should perform with out-of-stock items (that is, with stock items whose quantities become zero). To do so, in the '''When Qty Unavailable''' box, you select one of the following options:[anchor|#_aae38a6c-5fa0-49d8-8b5d-8c9450164471]
*''Do Nothing'': The system does not change the availability settings of the item. In BigCommerce, in the '''Purchasability''' section of the product management page, the '''This product can be purchased in my online store''' option button remains selected. However, the item cannot be included in sales orders.
*''Set as Disabled'': The system makes the item unavailable for purchase via the storefront. In BigCommerce, in the '''Purchasability''' section of the product management page, the '''This product cannot be purchased in my online store''' option button becomes selected.
*''Set as Pre-Order'': The system makes the item unavailable for purchase but available for pre-order. In BigCommerce, in the '''Purchasability''' section of the product management page, the '''This product is coming soon but I want to take pre-orders''' option button becomes selected.

If you have synchronized the ''Product Availability'' entity, when you modify any of the settings described in this section, the system resets the availability synchronization status for all synchronized items in the BigCommerce store, and you need to perform the full synchronization of the ''Product Availability'' entity again.[anchor|#_b51c363c-6f77-421c-80d2-8f9da6bd73dc]
==Availability Calculation==
During the configuration of Acumatica ERP Commerce                         Edition, you can specify which item quantity in Acumatica ERP you want to be synchronized with the BigCommerce store for the items whose quantities are tracked. To do so, you select one of the following options in the '''Availability Mode''' box:[anchor|#_a0de1b9c-9d33-4c7e-9f6e-b5ba5601dfe9]
*''On Hand'': The system synchronizes the on-hand quantity stored at particular warehouses or warehouse locations.
*''Available for Shipping'': The system synchronizes the quantity available for shipping, which is calculated as the on-hand quantity minus the quantity on issues that have not been released yet, minus the quantity allocated for shipping, and minus the shipped quantity.
*''Available'': The system synchronizes the available quantity. You can configure the way the available quantity is calculated by using an availability calculation rule. For more information, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\Availability_Calculation_Rules_GeneralInfo|Availability Calculation Rules: General Information].

You also select whether quantity calculations should include available quantities from all warehouses or from only the specified warehouses or warehouse locations. To do so, in the '''Warehouse Mode''' box on the '''Inventory Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_00|BigCommerce Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) form, you select one of the following options:[anchor|#_34711b27-7f17-455a-8370-61a122a64bb3]
*''All'': To use for calculation the available quantities of the item from all warehouses
*''Specific'': To use for calculation the available quantities from only the specified warehouses or warehouse locations.
*:When you select this option, the system displays a table in which you should specify the needed warehouses and warehouse locations. If you specify a warehouse but do not specify any of its locations, quantities available from the entire warehouse are used for quantity calculations. If you specify multiple warehouses and warehouse locations, the quantities available from all specified warehouses and warehouse locations are used for quantity calculations.
*:((({S:Warn}Multiple warehouses and warehouse locations require that the following features be enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form:[anchor|#_aab1dd84-1e58-4f9d-a78f-c81491080496]
*The ''Multiple Warehouses'' feature, which provides the functionality of working with multiple warehouses (including virtual warehouses)
*The ''Multiple Warehouse Locations'' feature, which supports multiple locations for each warehouse
)))

If you have synchronized the ''Product Availability'' entity, when you modify any of the settings described in this section, the system resets the availability synchronization status for all synchronized items in the BigCommerce store, and you need to perform the full synchronization of the ''Product Availability'' entity again.
==Product-Specific Availability Settings==
By default, the availability settings defined for the store on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_00|BigCommerce Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) form are applied to all stock and non-stock items exported to the BigCommerce store. However, you can override the default values for a particular stock item on the '''eCommerce''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, for a particular non-stock item on the same tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, and for a particular template item on the same tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_30_00|Template Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN203000|IN203000]) form.{br}

The options available for selection in the '''Availability''' box on the '''eCommerce''' tab are similar to the options of the '''Default Availability''' box on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_00|BigCommerce Stores] form with the following exceptions:[anchor|#_ad57b3c7-44a7-4416-9575-03e0d9286739]
*The ''Available - Track Qty'' option does not appear in the '''Availability''' box for non-stock items.
*The ''Store Default'' option (which is not in the '''Default Availability''' box) is available in the '''Availability''' box for both stock and non-stock items. When this option is selected, the system applies the setting selected in the '''Default Availability''' box on the '''Inventory Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_00|BigCommerce Stores] form. 
*:Because the tracking of quantities is not applicable to non-stock items, if '''Default Availability''' in the store settings is set to ''Available - Track Qty'' and '''Availability''' of a non-stock item is set to ''Store Default'', after the non-stock item is exported to the BigCommerce store, it is available for purchase but its quantity is not tracked.

Additionally, for a stock item, if the ''Available - Track Qty'' option is selected in the '''Availability''' box on the '''eCommerce''' tab, you can also specify the action that the system should perform if after the synchronization of the ''Product Availability'' entity, the item has an available quantity of zero. The available options include all options of the '''When Qty Unavailable''' box on the '''Inventory Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_00|BigCommerce Stores] form, as well as the ''Store Default'' option, which (if selected) indicates that the setting specified in the box of the same name on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_00|BigCommerce Stores] form should be applied. For information about the store's default settings, see [[#_4d5d29fd-f3c9-46a6-829a-c0d265fc1e6b|Default Product Availability Settings].
==Synchronization of Product Availability==
Depending on the item type, data about the product purchasability of an item in the online store is exported from Acumatica ERP to the BigCommerce store as part of the synchronization of the ''Stock Item'', ''Non-Stock Item'', or ''Template Item'' entity. During the export, the system updates the availability settings of each item exported to BigCommerce based on the option selected in the '''Availability''' box on the '''eCommerce''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form (if the item is a non-stock item), the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form (if the item is a stock item), or the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_30_00|Template Items] form (if the item is a template item). If the ''Store Default'' option is selected, the system uses the value specified in the '''Default Availability''' box on the '''Inventory Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_00|BigCommerce Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) form.{br}

The status of an item in Acumatica ERP affects the purchasability status of the item in BigCommerce. If the item&rsquo;s status in Acumatica ERP is ''Inactive'', ''No Sales'', or ''Marked for Deletion''—that is, if any of these options is selected in the '''Status''' box in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form, the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form, or the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_30_00|Template Items] form—after the synchronization of the relevant entity, in the '''Purchasability''' section of the product management page of the item in the BigCommerce store, the '''This product cannot be purchased in my online store''' option button is selected, regardless of the '''Availability''' setting of this item in Acumatica ERP.{br}

Data about the product availability in the inventory is exported from Acumatica ERP to the BigCommerce store when the ''Product Availability'' entity is synchronized. The synchronization process affects only the items that have '''Availability''' set to ''Available - Track Qty'' or ''Available - Don&rsquo;t Track Qty''. For stock items and template items whose quantities are configured to be tracked, the system also exports the item quantities calculated based on the settings specified in the '''Availability Mode''' and '''Warehouse Mode''' boxes on the '''Inventory Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_00|BigCommerce Stores] form. For more information about the calculation of available quantities, see [[#_b51c363c-6f77-421c-80d2-8f9da6bd73dc|Availability Calculation].]]></column>
			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Synchronizing Product Availability: General Information  Acumatica ERP Commerce                         Edition     provides you with the ability to track the availability of stock items that you sell via the     BigCommerce store and maintain in  Acumatica ERP.     You have the flexibility to configure which quantities of a stock item should be included in     calculations of the quantity available for sale in the online store. Learning Objectives In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following: Define the availability settings to be applied by default to stock items, non-stock items,      and template items exported to the BigCommerce store Define the availability settings for a particular stock item, non-stock item, or template      item exported to the BigCommerce store Synchronize the availability of stock items, non-stock items, and template items between  Acumatica ERP      and the BigCommerce store Applicable Scenarios You define availability settings (which include the item purchasability settings in the online     store and item availability settings in the inventory) and synchronize the availability of stock     items, non-stock items and template items maintained in  Acumatica ERP     with the BigCommerce stores for the following purposes:  To define whether a stock item, a non-stock item or a template item exported to the      BigCommerce store should be made available for purchase To define whether the quantities of a stock item or a template item should be tracked and      synchronized between  Acumatica ERP      and BigCommerce For stock items and template items with tracked quantities, to define whether a stock item      or a template item should still be available for purchase if its available quantity becomes      zero Default Product Availability Settings When you initially configure  Acumatica ERP Commerce                         Edition, on the       Inventory Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) BigCommerce Stores (BC201000)     form, you specify the availability settings that are applied by default to non-stock, stock     items, and template items when they are exported to the BigCommerce store. You first define the default availability status that is assigned to items exported from  Acumatica ERP.     This status determines whether the exported item can be purchased in the BigCommerce store. To     define the default availability status, you select one of the following options in the       Default Availability  box: Available - Track Qty : The stock items and template items exported to the BigCommerce       store are available for purchase via the storefront, and their quantities are tracked, meaning       that the items can be purchased only if their quantities are greater than zero. In       BigCommerce, on the product management page for each of these items, the  This        product can be purchased in my online store  option button (in the         Purchasability  section) and the  Track inventory        check box (in the  Inventory  section) are selected.  For stock items, the available quantities are tracked on the product level (that is, the         On the product level  option button is selected under the         Track Inventory  check box). For template items, the available       quantities are tracked on the level of matrix items (that is, the  On the variant        level  option button is selected under the  Track Inventory        check box). The non-stock items exported to the BigCommerce store are available for purchase via the       storefront, and their quantities are not tracked (that is, the  Track        inventory  check box is cleared). Available - Don't Track Qty : The non-stock and stock items exported to the      BigCommerce store are available for purchase via the storefront, and their quantities are not      tracked. In BigCommerce, on the product management page for each of these items, the        This product can be purchased in my online store  option button (in the        Purchasability  section) is selected and the  Track       inventory  check box (in the  Inventory  section) is      cleared. Pre-Order : The non-stock and stock items exported to the BigCommerce store are not      available for purchase but customers can pre-order them. In BigCommerce, on the product      management page for each of these items, the  This product is coming soon but I want       to take pre-orders  option button (in the  Purchasability       section) is selected. Disabled : The non-stock and stock items exported to the BigCommerce store are not      available for purchase. In BigCommerce, on the product management page for each of these items,      the  This product cannot be purchased in my online store  option button      (in the  Purchasability  section) is selected. If you select the  Available - Track Qty  option in the  Default      Availability  box, you need to also specify what action the system should perform     with out-of-stock items (that is, with stock items whose quantities become zero). To do so, in     the  When Qty Unavailable  box, you select one of the following     options: Do Nothing : The system does not change the availability settings of the item. In      BigCommerce, in the  Purchasability  section of the product management      page, the  This product can be purchased in my online store  option button      remains selected. However, the item cannot be included in sales orders. Set as Disabled : The system makes the item unavailable for purchase via the      storefront. In BigCommerce, in the  Purchasability  section of the product      management page, the  This product cannot be purchased in my online store       option button becomes selected. Set as Pre-Order : The system makes the item unavailable for purchase but available      for pre-order. In BigCommerce, in the  Purchasability  section of the      product management page, the  This product is coming soon but I want to take       pre-orders  option button becomes selected. If you have synchronized the  Product Availability  entity, when you modify any of the     settings described in this section, the system resets the availability synchronization status     for all synchronized items in the BigCommerce store, and you need to perform the full     synchronization of the  Product Availability  entity again. Availability Calculation During the configuration of  Acumatica ERP Commerce                         Edition, you can     specify which item quantity in  Acumatica ERP     you want to be synchronized with the BigCommerce store for the items whose quantities are     tracked. To do so, you select one of the following options in the  Availability      Mode  box: On Hand : The system synchronizes the on-hand quantity stored at particular warehouses      or warehouse locations. Available for Shipping : The system synchronizes the quantity available for shipping,      which is calculated as the on-hand quantity minus the quantity on issues that have not been      released yet, minus the quantity allocated for shipping, and minus the shipped quantity. Available : The system synchronizes the available quantity. You can configure the way      the available quantity is calculated by using an availability calculation rule. For more      information, see  Availability Calculation Rules: General Information. You also select whether quantity calculations should include available quantities from all     warehouses or from only the specified warehouses or warehouse locations. To do so, in the       Warehouse Mode  box on the  Inventory Settings  tab     of the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) BigCommerce Stores (BC201000) form, you select one of the following     options: All : To use for calculation the available quantities of the item from all      warehouses Specific : To use for calculation the available quantities from only the specified      warehouses or warehouse locations. When you select this option, the system displays a table       in which you should specify the needed warehouses and warehouse locations. If you specify a       warehouse but do not specify any of its locations, quantities available from the entire       warehouse are used for quantity calculations. If you specify multiple warehouses and warehouse       locations, the quantities available from all specified warehouses and warehouse locations are       used for quantity calculations. Multiple warehouses and warehouse locations require       that the following features be enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000)        form: The  Multiple Warehouses  feature, which provides the functionality of working with         multiple warehouses (including virtual warehouses) The  Multiple Warehouse Locations  feature, which supports multiple locations for         each warehouse If you have synchronized the  Product Availability  entity, when you modify any of the     settings described in this section, the system resets the availability synchronization status     for all synchronized items in the BigCommerce store, and you need to perform the full     synchronization of the  Product Availability  entity again. Product-Specific Availability Settings By default, the availability settings defined for the store on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) BigCommerce Stores (BC201000) form are applied to all stock and non-stock items exported     to the BigCommerce store. However, you can override the default values for a particular stock     item on the  eCommerce  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items     (IN202500) form, for a particular non-stock item on the same tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form, and for a particular template item on the same tab     of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN203000|IN203000]) Template Items (IN203000) form. The options available for selection in the  Availability  box on the       eCommerce  tab are similar to the options of the  Default      Availability  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) BigCommerce Stores form with the following     exceptions: The  Available - Track Qty  option does not appear in the        Availability  box for non-stock items. The  Store Default  option (which is not in the  Default       Availability  box) is available in the  Availability  box for      both stock and non-stock items. When this option is selected, the system applies the setting      selected in the  Default Availability  box on the  Inventory       Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) BigCommerce Stores form.  Because the tracking       of quantities is not applicable to non-stock items, if  Default        Availability  in the store settings is set to  Available - Track Qty  and         Availability  of a non-stock item is set to  Store Default , after       the non-stock item is exported to the BigCommerce store, it is available for purchase but its       quantity is not tracked. Additionally, for a stock item, if the  Available - Track Qty  option is selected in the       Availability  box on the  eCommerce  tab, you can     also specify the action that the system should perform if after the synchronization of the       Product Availability  entity, the item has an available quantity of zero. The available     options include all options of the  When Qty Unavailable  box on the       Inventory Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) BigCommerce Stores form, as     well as the  Store Default  option, which (if selected) indicates that the setting     specified in the box of the same name on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) BigCommerce Stores form should be     applied. For information about the store's default settings, see  Default Product Availability Settings Default Product Availability Settings. Synchronization of Product Availability Depending on the item type, data about the product purchasability of an item in the online     store is exported from  Acumatica ERP     to the BigCommerce store as part of the synchronization of the  Stock Item ,  Non-Stock      Item , or  Template Item  entity. During the export, the system updates the     availability settings of each item exported to BigCommerce based on the option selected in the       Availability  box on the  eCommerce  tab of the        ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items form (if the item is a non-stock item), the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form (if the item is a stock item), or the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN203000|IN203000]) Template Items form (if the item is a template item). If the  Store Default      option is selected, the system uses the value specified in the  Default      Availability  box on the  Inventory Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) BigCommerce Stores (BC201000) form. The status of an item in  Acumatica ERP     affects the purchasability status of the item in BigCommerce. If the item's status in  Acumatica ERP     is  Inactive ,  No Sales , or  Marked for Deletion —that is, if any of these     options is selected in the  Status  box in the Summary area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items form, the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form, or the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN203000|IN203000]) Template Items form—after the synchronization of the relevant entity, in the       Purchasability  section of the product management page of the item in the     BigCommerce store, the  This product cannot be purchased in my online      store  option button is selected, regardless of the       Availability  setting of this item in  Acumatica ERP. Data about the product availability in the inventory is exported from  Acumatica ERP     to the BigCommerce store when the  Product Availability  entity is synchronized. The     synchronization process affects only the items that have  Availability  set     to  Available - Track Qty  or  Available - Don't Track Qty . For stock items and     template items whose quantities are configured to be tracked, the system also exports the item     quantities calculated based on the settings specified in the  Availability      Mode  and  Warehouse Mode  boxes on the  Inventory      Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) BigCommerce Stores form.

==Story==
Suppose that the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company sells several kinds of jams in its online store. Some jams need to always be available for purchase online, while the others are made available for purchase online only when there is enough stock. Acting as an implementation consultant helping SweetLife to set up the integration of Acumatica ERP with the BigCommerce store, you want to explore how various availability settings specified for stock items affect the results of the synchronization of the ''Product Availability'' entity between Acumatica ERP and BigCommerce.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, the following features have been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form:
*''Multiple Warehouses'', which provides the functionality of working with several warehouses (including virtual warehouses)
*''Multiple Warehouse Locations'', which supports multiple locations for each warehouse

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form, the ''RETAIL'' warehouse and the ''JS1'' warehouse location have been configured.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, the following stock items have been configured in the system and added to the appropriate locations: ''BANJAM08'', ''BANJAM96'', ''PEARJAM08'', ''PEARJAM96'', ''PLUMJAM08'', ''PLUMJAM96'', and ''CHERJAM96''.
==Process Overview==
You will update the default availability settings for the BigCommerce store on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_00|BigCommerce Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) form. Then you will review and update the availability settings specific to particular stock items on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. On the Storage Details by Item Warehouse Location (BC408055) form, you will review the quantities of stock items available in the ''RETAIL'' warehouse. After that, on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_50_10_00|Prepare Data] ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) form, you will synchronize the ''Product Availability'' entity with the BigCommerce store. Once the synchronization is complete, you will review the availability settings and quantities of the exported stock items in the BigCommerce store.
==System Preparation==
Before you complete the instructions in this activity, do the following:
#Make sure that the following prerequisites have been met:
#*The BigCommerce store has been created and configured, as described in [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_BigCommerce_Initial_Configuration_Set_Up_BC_Store_Activity|Initial Configuration: To Set Up a BigCommerce Store].
#*The connection to the BigCommerce store has been established and the initial configuration has been performed, as described in [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_BigCommerce_Initial_Configuration_Implem_Activity|Initial Configuration: To Establish and Configure the Store Connection].
#*The entities have been prepared for synchronization, as described in [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_BigCommerce_Preparing_Entities_Implem_Activity|Preparing Entities for Synchronization: Implementation Activity].
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded, and sign in with the ''admin'' login.

==Step 1: Updating the Default Availability Settings==
To specify the availability settings that the system will apply by default to stock items and non-stock items exported from Acumatica ERP to the BigCommerce store, do the following:[anchor|#_fa742785-635f-4638-890f-918dff014a89]
#Open the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_00|BigCommerce Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) form.
#On the '''Inventory Settings''' tab, specify the following settings:
#*'''Default Availability''': ''Available - Track Qty''
#* '''When Qty Unavailable''': ''Set as Pre-Order''
#* '''Availability Mode''': ''Available for Shipping''
#* '''Warehouse Mode''': ''Specific''
#* '''Warehouse''': ''RETAIL''
#* '''Location ID''': ''JS1''
#:With these settings, by default, a stock item exported to the BigCommerce store will be available for purchase through the storefront, and its quantity will be tracked. For each item, only its quantity available for shipping at the ''F1J1'' location in the ''RETAIL'' warehouse is synchronized with the BigCommerce store. After the synchronization of the ''Product Availability'' entity, if the stock item&rsquo;s quantity becomes zero, the stock item will no longer be available for purchase in the BigCommerce store, but customers will be able to place pre-orders.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save''' to save the settings.

==Step 2: Reviewing Availability Settings and Available Quantities of Items==
To review the availability settings specific to the stock items, do the following:[anchor|#_157bbfb8-a804-4c3c-b8df-06b8f140a5bc]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form.
#In the Summary area of the form, in the '''Inventory ID''' box, select ''BANJAM96''.
#On the '''eCommerce''' tab, make sure the following settings are specified:
#*'''Availability''': ''Store Default''
#* '''When Qty Unavailable''': ''Store Default''
#*:With these settings specified, when you synchronize the ''Product Availability'' entity with the BigCommerce store, the system will apply the availability settings that you specified on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_00|BigCommerce Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) form in Step 1.
#Repeat Instructions 2 and 3 for each of the stock items listed in the following table, and specify the '''Availability''' and '''When Qty Unavailable''' settings as indicated. 
#:{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="33%" ! Stock Item
!width="33%" ! Availability
!width="33%" ! When Qty Unavailable
|- 
| ''BANJAM08''
|  ''Store Default''
|  ''Store Default''
|- 
|  ''PEARJAM96''
|  ''Available - Track Qty''
|  ''Set as Disabled''
|- 
|  ''PEARJAM08''
|  ''Available - Track Qty''
|  ''Set as Disabled''

|  ''Pre-Order''
| N/A
|}
#Open the Storage Details by Item Warehouse Location (BC408055) form.
#In the Selection area, in the '''Warehouse''' box, select ''RETAIL''.
#:The system displays the quantities of all items stored in the ''RETAIL'' warehouse.
#Click the header of the '''Location ID''' column, and in the dialog box that opens, select ''Equals'', type <tt>JS1</tt> in the text box, and click '''OK'''.
#:The system now displays only the items that are stored in the ''JS1'' warehouse location. Because in Step 1 you have set the '''Availability Mode''' setting to ''Available for Shipping'', the quantities of the items displayed in the '''Location Available for Shipping''' column (which is shown in the following screenshot) will be synchronized with the BigCommerce store. Notice that the ''BANJAM96'', ''PEARJAM96'', and ''PLUMJAM96'' stock items are available at the ''JS1'' location (a nonzero quantity is displayed for each of these items in the '''Location Available for Shipping''' column), whereas the ''BANJAM08'', ''PEARJAM08'', and ''PLUMJAM08'' stock items have zero quantities. [anchor|#_5d28de77-df12-49b1-9329-e0e87a22d6cd][image:UserGuide/Images/activity_BigCommerce_Syncing_Availability.png|popup|Quantities available for shipping at the JS1 location of the RETAIL warehouse|400px]

==Step3: Synchronizing the Product Availability Entity==
To synchronize the availability settings and the quantities of the stock items you reviewed in Step 2, do the following:[anchor|#_9f1c4112-4096-4dc5-a3ef-87486ef4fc3d]
#Open the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_50_10_00|Prepare Data] ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) form.
#In the Summary area, make sure the following settings are specified:
#*'''Store''': The name of the BigCommerce store with which you synchronize data
#*'''Prepare Mode''': ''Full''
#In the table, select the unlabeled check box in the rows of the ''Stock Item'' entity and the ''Product Availability'' entity.
#:Before the quantity of a stock item and its availability settings can be exported, the stock item itself must be synchronized. If you have previously synchronized the stock items that you reviewed in Step 2, you can select the check box for only the ''Product Availability'' entity.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Process'''.
#In the '''Processing''' dialog box, which opens, review the results and click '''Close'''
#On the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_50_15_00|Process Data] ([~/?ScreenId=BC501500|BC501500]) form, on the form toolbar, click '''Process All''' to process all out-of-sync synchronization records.
#In the '''Processing''' dialog box, which opens, review the results of the processing, and if the entities have been processed successfully, click '''Close''' to close the dialog box.

==Step 4: Reviewing the Synchronized Data==
To review the synchronized availability data in the BigCommerce store, do the following:[anchor|#_bd3aa867-51db-46a7-9264-79a84f072609]
#Sign in to the BigCommerce store as an administrator.
#In the left menu of the control panel, click '''Products''' > ''' View'''.
#On the '''View Products''' page, which opens, review the ''BANJAM96'' and ''BANJAM08'' stock items.
#:In the '''Stock Level''' column, notice that for the ''BANJAM96'' stock item, the green bar is displayed, which indicates that the quantity of this item is tracked and the item is in stock. For ''BANJAM08'', the bar in the '''Stock Level''' column is gray, meaning that the item&rsquo;s quantity is tracked and the item is currently out of stock, and ''Pre-Order'' is displayed right of the product name.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Synchronizing Product Availability:          Activity In this activity, you will specify the default availability settings for the                 BigCommerce store, specify item-specific availability settings for particular stock                 items, export product availability data to the BigCommerce store, and review the                 results of the export. The following activity is             based on the  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system             settings have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the             activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100              dataset to its initial state. Story Suppose that the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company sells several kinds of jams in                 its online store. Some jams need to always be available for purchase online, while                 the others are made available for purchase online only when there is enough stock.                 Acting as an implementation consultant helping SweetLife to set up the integration                 of  Acumatica ERP with the BigCommerce store, you want to explore how various availability settings                 specified for stock items affect the results of the synchronization of the                      Product Availability  entity between  Acumatica ERP and BigCommerce. Configuration Overview For the purposes of this activity, the following features have been enabled on the                       ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form: Multiple Warehouses , which provides the functionality of working with                     several warehouses (including virtual warehouses) Multiple Warehouse Locations , which supports multiple locations for each                     warehouse On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses (IN204000) form, the  RETAIL  warehouse                 and the  JS1  warehouse location have been configured. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form, the following stock items                 have been configured in the system and added to the appropriate locations:                      BANJAM08 ,  BANJAM96 ,  PEARJAM08 ,  PEARJAM96 ,                      PLUMJAM08 ,  PLUMJAM96 , and  CHERJAM96 . Process Overview You will update the default availability settings for the BigCommerce store on the                       ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) BigCommerce Stores (BC201000) form. Then you will review and update                 the availability settings specific to particular stock items on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form. On the Storage Details by Item                 Warehouse Location (BC408055) form, you will review the quantities of stock items                 available in the  RETAIL  warehouse. After that, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) Prepare Data (BC501000) form, you will synchronize the  Product                     Availability  entity with the BigCommerce store. Once the synchronization is                 complete, you will review the availability settings and quantities of the exported                 stock items in the BigCommerce store. System Preparation Before you complete the instructions in this activity, do the following: Make sure that the following prerequisites have been met: The BigCommerce store has been created and configured, as described in                                  Initial Configuration: To Set Up a BigCommerce Store. The connection to the BigCommerce store has been established and the                             initial configuration has been performed, as described in  Initial Configuration: To Establish and Configure the Store Connection. The entities have been prepared for synchronization, as described in                                  Preparing Entities for Synchronization: Implementation Activity. Launch the  Acumatica ERP website with the  U100  dataset preloaded, and sign in with the                          admin  login. Step 1: Updating the Default Availability Settings To specify the availability settings that the system will apply by default to stock                 items and non-stock items exported from  Acumatica ERP to the BigCommerce store, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) BigCommerce Stores (BC201000) form. On the  Inventory Settings  tab, specify the following                         settings: Default Availability :  Available - Track                                 Qty When Qty Unavailable :  Set as                             Pre-Order Availability Mode :  Available for                             Shipping Warehouse Mode :  Specific Warehouse :  RETAIL Location ID :  JS1 With these settings, by default, a stock item exported to the                         BigCommerce store will be available for purchase through the storefront, and                         its quantity will be tracked. For each item, only its quantity available for                         shipping at the  F1J1  location in the  RETAIL  warehouse is                         synchronized with the BigCommerce store. After the synchronization of the                              Product Availability  entity, if the stock item's quantity becomes                         zero, the stock item will no longer be available for purchase in the                         BigCommerce store, but customers will be able to place                          pre-orders . On the form toolbar, click  Save  to save the                     settings. Step 2: Reviewing Availability Settings and Available Quantities of Items To review the availability settings specific to the stock items, do the                 following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form. In the Summary area of the form, in the  Inventory ID  box,                     select  BANJAM96 . On the  eCommerce  tab, make sure the following settings                     are specified: Availability :  Store Default When Qty Unavailable :  Store Default With                                 these settings specified, when you synchronize the  Product                                     Availability  entity with the BigCommerce store, the system                                 will apply the availability settings that you specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) BigCommerce Stores (BC201000) form in Step 1. Repeat Instructions 2 and 3 for each of the stock items listed in the following                     table, and specify the  Availability  and  When                         Qty Unavailable  settings as indicated.  Stock Item Availability When Qty Unavailable BANJAM08 Store Default Store Default PEARJAM96 Available - Track Qty Set as Disabled PEARJAM08 Available - Track Qty Set as Disabled PLUMJAM96 Available - Track Qty Do Nothing PLUMJAM08 Available - Track Qty Do Nothing CHERJAM96 Pre-Order N/A Open the Storage Details by Item Warehouse Location (BC408055) form. In the Selection area, in the  Warehouse  box, select                          RETAIL . The system displays the quantities of all items stored in                         the  RETAIL  warehouse. Click the header of the  Location ID  column, and in the                     dialog box that opens, select  Equals , type  JS1  in                     the text box, and click  OK . The system now displays                         only the items that are stored in the  JS1  warehouse location. Because                         in Step 1 you have set the  Availability Mode  setting                         to  Available for Shipping , the quantities of the items displayed in                         the  Location Available for Shipping  column (which is                         shown in the following screenshot) will be synchronized with the BigCommerce                         store. Notice that the  BANJAM96 ,  PEARJAM96 , and                              PLUMJAM96  stock items are available at the  JS1  location                         ( a                         nonzero quantity  is displayed for each of these items in                         the  Location Available for Shipping  column), whereas                         the  BANJAM08 ,  PEARJAM08 , and  PLUMJAM08  stock items have                         zero quantities.  Quantities available for shipping at the JS1 location of the RETAIL                             warehouse Step3: Synchronizing the Product Availability Entity To synchronize the availability settings and the quantities of the stock items you                 reviewed in Step 2, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) Prepare Data (BC501000) form. In the Summary area, make sure the following settings are specified: Store : The name of the BigCommerce store with                             which you synchronize data Prepare                                  Mode :  Full In the table, select the unlabeled check box in the rows of the  Stock                         Item  entity and the  Product Availability  entity. Before the                         quantity of a stock item and its availability settings can be exported, the                         stock item itself must be synchronized. If you have previously synchronized                         the stock items that you reviewed in Step 2, you can select the check box                         for only the  Product Availability  entity. On the form toolbar, click  Process . In the  Processing  dialog box, which opens, review the                     results and click                      Close On                     the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501500|BC501500]) Process Data (BC501500) form, on the form toolbar, click                          Process All  to process all out-of-sync                     synchronization records. In the  Processing  dialog box, which opens, review the                     results of the processing, and if the entities have been processed successfully,                     click  Close  to close the dialog box. Step 4: Reviewing the Synchronized Data To review the synchronized availability data in the BigCommerce store, do the                 following: Sign in to the BigCommerce store as an administrator. In the left menu of the control panel, click  Products  View . On the  View Products  page, which opens, review the                          BANJAM96  and  BANJAM08  stock items.

When you provide delivery service to customers of your organization, you need to calculate the freight prices to charge customers. When a sales order is placed in the BigCommerce store, the freight price, which is calculated based on the shipping rules configured in the store, is added to the sales order.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to configure shipping rules to charge customers for freight and how freight fees are represented in sales orders imported from BigCommerce to Acumatica ERP for fulfillment.
==Freight Charges in Imported Orders==
When you set up your BigCommerce store, one of the things you do is configuring shipping. This includes specifying the address of the shipping origin and the geographical areas to which you plan to ship products (the shipping zones), as well as configuring the shipping options available to customers (the shipping methods). For each shipping zone, you can also specify a fee for handling orders. The shipping options and their accompanying costs are displayed to the customer in the cart and at checkout. The sales order includes the total of the shipping fees corresponding to the shipping method selected by the customer and the handling fees, if any have been configured for the customer&rsquo;s shipping zone. For more information about the configuration of shipping in the BigCommerce store, see [https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Shipping-Setup|Shipping Setup] in the BigCommerce documentation.{br}

During the configuration of the synchronization settings of the store on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_00|BigCommerce Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) form of Acumatica ERP, in the '''Shipping Zone Mapping''' section on the '''Order Settings''' tab, you map each shipping method set up in BigCommerce with the ship via code (which represents a particular service method provided by a carrier and determines the freight cost) and, optionally, and, optionally, with the shipping zone or shipping terms (or both) configured in Acumatica ERP. For more information about ship via codes and shipping terms in Acumatica ERP, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\CS__con_Integration_with_Carriers|Integration with Carriers] and [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\CS__con_Freight_Calculation#_beeed649-3493-45fd-b8f0-6601b2f4f5a1|Freight Price Calculation].((({S:Danger}In Acumatica ERP, when an invoice is created for a sales order imported from the online store, the system recalculates the freight price amount based on the freight information from the sales order or the shipment. If the freight price is calculated based on shipments, there might be a discrepancy between the freight amount in the invoice generated in Acumatica ERP and the order amount paid by the customer in the online store. To present customers with the correct amount to be paid in the online store and avoid the discrepancy, you need to be sure that the shipping terms mapped to the shipping method selected by the customer at checkout stipulate that freight in a sales order invoice be calculated based on a sales order rather than shipment—that is, in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_80_00|Shipping Terms] ([~/?ScreenId=CS208000|CS208000]) form, the '''Invoice Freight Price Based On''' box should be set to ''Sales Order''.
)))
When the sales order is imported from the BigCommerce store to Acumatica ERP, the shipping fees and handling fees are added together and the resulting amount is displayed in the '''Freight Price''' box on the '''Totals''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form.((({S:Warn}When you create a sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form of Acumatica ERP, you specify additional freight charges for handling an order in the '''Premium Freight Price''' box on the '''Totals''' tab. However, in orders imported from BigCommerce, handling fees are included in the freight price and are not displayed in this box.

During the configuration of the synchronization settings of the store on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) BigCommerce Stores (BC201000) form of  Acumatica ERP,     in the  Shipping Zone Mapping  section on the  Order      Settings  tab, you map each shipping method set up in BigCommerce with the ship via     code (which represents a particular service method provided by a carrier and determines the     freight cost) and, optionally, and, optionally, with the shipping zone or shipping terms (or     both) configured in  Acumatica ERP.     For more information about ship via codes and shipping terms in  Acumatica ERP,     see  Integration with Carriers and  Freight Price Calculation. In  Acumatica ERP,     when an invoice is created for a sales order imported from the online store, the system     recalculates the freight price amount based on the freight information from the sales order or     the shipment. If the freight price is calculated based on shipments, there might be a     discrepancy between the freight amount in the invoice generated in  Acumatica ERP     and the order amount paid by the customer in the online store. To present customers with the     correct amount to be paid in the online store and avoid the discrepancy, you need to be sure     that the shipping terms mapped to the shipping method selected by the customer at checkout     stipulate that freight in a sales order invoice be calculated based on a sales order rather than     shipment—that is, in the Summary area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS208000|CS208000]) Shipping Terms (CS208000) form,     the  Invoice Freight Price Based On  box should be set to  Sales      Order . When the sales order is imported from the BigCommerce store to  Acumatica ERP,     the shipping fees and handling fees are added together and the resulting amount is displayed in     the  Freight Price  box on the  Totals  tab of the        ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form. When you create a sales order on the         ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders form of  Acumatica ERP,      you specify additional freight charges for handling an order in the  Premium Freight       Price  box on the  Totals  tab. However, in orders imported      from BigCommerce, handling fees are included in the freight price and are not displayed in this      box. ]]></column>

==Story==
Suppose that you are an implementation consultant helping the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company to configure the integration with the BigCommerce store. As part of the implementation process, you want to explore how freight charges added to an online order in the BigCommerce store are imported to Acumatica ERP. For testing purposes, you need to configure a shipping zone that will correspond to Manhattan, where SweetLife&rsquo;s head office and main warehouse are also located. For shipments to this area, you will charge a small handling fee of $5. You need to create at least one shipping method for the shipping zone. For simplicity, you will charge a $30 shipping fee per order. Before processing an order placed with the shipping method, you need to map it to the ship via code and shipping terms defined in Acumatica ERP.{br}

To test the configuration, you need to create a BigCommerce order that requires shipment; you will then synchronize it with Acumatica ERP and review the details of the imported order. For training purposes, you will process a purchase of a cherry jam for the GoodFood One Restaurant customer. GoodFood is located in Manhattan and the shipping option corresponding to the created shipping rule will be available to this customer in the cart and at checkout.
==Process Overview==
In this activity, you will do the following:[anchor|#_d27a25e5-ee4e-4ce5-8444-0cc04b793beb]
#In the BigCommerce store, on the '''Shipping Manager''' page, you will create a shipping zone for Manhattan and configure a shipping rule for this shipping zone based on a flat fee.
#On the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_00|BigCommerce Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) form of Acumatica ERP, you will map the shipping rule you created to the ''LOCAL'' ship via code, which has been preconfigured in Acumatica ERP.
#By using the control panel of the BigCommerce store, you will create a sales order for the ''GoodFood'' customer.
#On the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_50_10_00|Prepare Data] ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) form of Acumatica ERP, you will  sales order data for import from BigCommerce to Acumatica ERP.
#On the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_50_15_00|Process Data] ([~/?ScreenId=BC501500|BC501500]) form, you will synchronize sales order data.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, you will review the imported sales order and analyze how the freight fees have been imported to Acumatica ERP.

In the box with the list of shipping options, select  Flat Rate                         ($35.00) . Note that this amount combines a $30 shipping fee, which                         corresponds to the flat-rate shipping rule, and a $5 handling fee, which you                         configured for the  New York, Manhattan  shipping zone (to which the                         customer's shipping address belongs). For the purposes of this                         activity, you can assume that the billing address and shipping address are                         the same. At the bottom of the page, click  Next . On the  Add an Order - Finalize  page, do the following: Review the information in the  Customer Billing                                 Details ,  Shipping Details , and                                  Summary  sections In the  Finalize  section, select the  Manual                                 Payment  payment method. At the bottom of the page, click  Save & Process                         Payment . On the  View Orders  page, which opens, notice that the                     order has been created. Step 4: Importing the Sales Order To import the sales order you created in Step 3 to  Acumatica ERP, do the following: Sign in to  Acumatica ERP by using the  admin  login. Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) Prepare Data (BC501000) form. In the Summary area, specify the following settings: Store : The name of your BigCommerce store  Prepare                                  Mode :  Incremental In the table, in the row of the  Sales Order  entity, select the unlabeled                     check box. On the form toolbar, click                          Prepare . In the  Processing  dialog box, which opens, review the                     results of the processing, and click  Close  to close the                     dialog box. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501500|BC501500]) Process Data (BC501500) form, on the form toolbar,                     click  Process All  to process all out-of-sync                     synchronization records. In the  Processing  dialog box, which opens, review the                     results of the processing, and click  Close  to close the                     dialog box. Step 5: Reviewing the Imported Sales Order To review how the freight charges are displayed in the imported sales order, do the                 following: Open the Sales Orders (SO3010PL) form. In the list of orders, click the order number link of the sales order for the                          GOODFOOD  customer that you created in Step 3 and imported in Step                     4. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, on the                          Totals  tab, review the freight details in the                          Freight Info  section. Notice that the $35.00 amount                         is displayed in the  Freight Price  box. During the                         import of the sales order, the system combined the $30 shipping fee and the                         $5 handling fee. ]]></column>

*[HelpRoot_Commerce\COM_BigCommerce_Related_Items_GeneralInfo|Related Items: General Information]
*:For each stock and non-stock item in Acumatica ERP, an organization can maintain a list of related items that shoppers might be interested in buying in addition to or instead of the original item. These items might include items complementary to the original item (for example, a cover case or a mouse may be offered to the customer when a laptop is purchased), additional services (such as, assembly services for sold furniture), items that are purchased by other shoppers with similar buying habits, and higher-priced variants of the original item. Offering related items to customers can help the organization increase the value of each sale and capitalize on sales to existing customers. Starting in Acumatica ERP 2020 R2, the BigCommerce Connector supports the export of related items to the BigCommerce store connected to the Acumatica ERP instance.

*Configure related items in Acumatica ERP
*Export the information about related items from Acumatica ERP to the BigCommerce store

==Configuration of Related Items in Acumatica ERP==
A user can create or update the list of related items for a stock item on the '''Related Items''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form and for a non-stock item on the same tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. The tab is displayed if the ''Commerce Integration'' group of features and the ''BigCommerce Connector'' feature are enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

For each related item added to the '''Related Items''' tab, the user should specify the appropriate settings in the following columns:[anchor|#_118e070f-aaae-4fe8-a6de-f29a1bb64b47]
*'''Relation''': The relation to the original item, which can be one of the following options (this list can be extended through customization):
**''Cross-Sell'': An additional item that can be sold along with the original item (the item selected in the Summary area of the form)
**''Up-Sell'': A more expensive version of the original item
**''Related'': An item with a non-specific relation
**''Substitute'': A substitute item (that is, an item that is the same as or similar to the original item and that can be bought instead of the original item)
**''Alternative'': An alternative item (that is, an item that might be different from the original item but serves the same purpose as the original item)
*'''Rank''': The rank of the item, which is the order in which the item in the row is displayed among the items with the same type of relation (as specified in the '''Relation''' column) on the e-commerce website.
*'''Tag''': An additional characteristic of the related item. The list of options a user can select, which can be extended through customization, includes the following:

Users can export all related items displayed in the table to an Excel spreadsheet and mass-import related items in bulk from an Excel spreadsheet.
==Export of Related Items to the BigCommerce Store==
If the ''BigCommerce Connector'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form and the integration between the Acumatica ERP instance and the BigCommerce store has been configured, users can export stock and non-stock items from Acumatica ERP to the BigCommerce store along with the list of related items that have been defined for each item.{br}

During the initial configuration of a BigCommerce store, on the '''Inventory Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_00|BigCommerce Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) form, the administrative user can select the types of related items whose information needs to be exported to the BigCommerce store during the synchronization of stock items and non-stock items. On the '''Inventory Settings''' tab, in the '''Related Items''' box, the user can select the check box for any or all of the following options:[anchor|#_b63a4851-2606-49c8-9846-b17f95b0765a]
*''Cross-Sell''
* ''Related''
* ''Up-Sell''

By default, none of these options is selected, and during the synchronization of stock items and non-stock items with the BigCommerce store, information about related items is not exported to the BigCommerce store, even if the item relations have been specified in Acumatica ERP. If an option is selected in this box and any related items are specified for the original stock item or non-stock item with a relation that corresponds to the selected option, the information about the related item is exported to the BigCommerce store when the original item is exported.((({S:Warn}Information about the related items is exported to the BigCommerce store only if all of the following conditions are met:[anchor|#_8271e4d0-92c5-463a-8dcc-d14b42c4f71e]
*The relation of the related item to the original item is ''Cross-Sell'', ''Up-Sell'', or ''Related''.
*The relation of the related item to the original item is effective on the date of the synchronization.
*The related item itself exists in (or has been exported to) the BigCommerce store.
)))
After the original item has been exported to the BigCommerce store, all its related items are listed in the '''Related Products''' section of the product management page. When a shopper browses products on the storefront, they can see the list of related products for a particular product at the bottom of the product listing page.]]></column>

In Acumatica ERP Commerce                         Edition, users can import and, if necessary, process debit and credit card payments from external e-commerce systems through integration with the Authorize.Net payment gateway.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Configure the mapping of card-based payment methods in Acumatica ERP with store payment methods.
*Import payments based on the card-based payment methods from the external e-commerce system
*Process credit card payments imported to Acumatica ERP

==Applicable Scenarios==
You import payments based on credit card payment methods if you want to accept payments by card in the online store as well as track and, if necessary, process the imported payments in Acumatica ERP.
==Configuration of Credit Card Payment Processing for E-commerce Systems==
Authorize.Net is a processing center that accepts transactions through an application programming interface and processes payments online. Before credit card payments can be imported from an external e-commerce system, you need to configure payment processing via Authorize.Net as follows:[anchor|#_0dd20bc9-8a54-4871-8b55-08f8c4733a59]
#''Configure the Authorize.Net processing center''. You set up the processing center on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_50_00|Processing Centers] ([~/?ScreenId=CA205000|CA205000]) form. Before you proceed with the configuration, you need to obtain the API login, signature key, and transaction key that you will use to connect to the Authorize.Net server. For instructions on setting up a processing center in Acumatica ERP, see [HelpRoot_Integration\CA__CON_Integration_AuthorizeNet_APIPlugin|Integration with Authorize.Net Through the API Plug-in] and [HelpRoot_Integration\CA__HOW_Configure_AuthorizeNet_ProcCenterAPI|To Configure the Authorize.Net Processing Center with the API Plug-in].
#''Configure a card-based payment method''. After you have configured the processing center, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_40_00|Payment Methods] ([~/?ScreenId=CA204000|CA204000]) form, you need to create a payment method that will be associated with the processing center. If saving payment profiles is allowed for a customer class to which a particular customer belongs, the payment method will be used as a template for creating new customer payment methods. For more information about creating card-based payment methods, see [HelpRoot_Integration\CA__HOW_Add_PM_Card|To Add a Payment Method for Payment Processing].
#''Configure the Authorize.Net payment gateway in the e-commerce system''. You set up the Authorize.Net payment provider in the e-commerce system using the same API login, signature key, and transaction key that you have used to configure the processing center in Step 1. For information about configuring payment providers in the external-system, refer to the e-commerce system&rsquo;s documentation.
#''Map the card-based payment method with the payment methods configured in the e-commerce system.'' You map payment methods between Acumatica ERP and the BigCommerce e-commerce system on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_00|BigCommerce Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) form, and between Acumatica ERP and the Shopify e-commerce system on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_10|Shopify Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201010|BC201010]) form. When a payment is imported from the e-commerce system to Acumatica ERP, a prepayment is created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_20_00|Payments and Applications] ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) form based on the payment method that was mapped to the payment method used for payment in the e-commerce system. For more information about mapping of card-based payment methods, see the following section.

==Mapping of Card-Based Payment Methods==
During the configuration of a connection to an e-commerce system, one of the steps you perform is the mapping of payment methods configured in Acumatica ERP with payment methods configured in the e-commerce system. For BigCommerce and Shopify, you define payment method mapping in the '''Base Currency Payment Methods''' table on the '''Payment Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_00|BigCommerce Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) or [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_10|Shopify Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201010|BC201010]) form, respectively.{br}

For the Authorize.Net store payment method, you specify the following:[anchor|#_6feb00a1-8c06-4944-ae9c-d074b0aa9598]
*'''Payment Method ID''': The identifier of the payment method in Acumatica ERP that was configured to use the same processing center as was used for setting up the payment provider in the online store.
*'''Cash Account''': A cash account that was specified for the payment method on the '''Allowed Cash Accounts''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_40_00|Payment Methods] ([~/?ScreenId=CA204000|CA204000]) form.
*'''Proc. Center ID''': The identifier of the processing center configured for the payment method on the '''Processing Centers''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_50_00|Processing Centers] ([~/?ScreenId=CA205000|CA205000]) form.
*'''Active''': A check box that you select for a payment method to indicate that payments made in the e-commerce system that are based on should be imported to Acumatica ERP. For payment methods based on credit cards, the '''Release Payments''' check box is always cleared and not available for editing. Users must release payments based on credit cards manually or by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_50_10_00|Release AR Documents] ([~/?ScreenId=AR501000|AR501000]) form.

==Import of Payments Based on Credit Cards==
A customer who has signed in to the BigCommerce store can save credit card details during checkout. When this customer selects the ''Authorize.Net'' payment method, enters the details of a new card, selects the '''Save this card for future transactions''' check box, and then places an order, the details of the credit card are saved in the processing center configured in the BigCommerce store.{br}

When the payment is imported from BigCommerce to Acumatica ERP (as part of the synchronization of the ''Sales Order'' entity or the ''Payment'' entity), on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_20_00|Payments and Applications] ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) form, the system creates a document of the ''Prepayment'' type with the ''Pending Processing'' status. In the Summary area of the created document, the system inserts the following information:[anchor|#_469f9cee-10fb-4b95-adb9-2bc1be6bbd16]
*'''Payment Method''': The payment method that has been mapped to the store payment method in the '''Base Currency Payment Methods''' table on the '''Payment Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_00|BigCommerce Stores] form
*'''Cash Account''': The cash account selected for the mapped payment method
*'''Payment Ref.''': The number of the related credit card transaction in the processing center
*'''Processing Status''': The processing status of the credit card transaction. Depending on the last successful operation with the transaction, the processing status can be one of the following:
**''Pre-Authorized'': The payment has been authorized but the funds have not been captured. The last successful operation was ''Authorize Only''.
**''Captured'': The funds have been captured. The last successful operation with the credit card transaction was either ''Authorize and Capture'' or ''Capture Authorized''.
**''Unknown'': The last successful operation with the credit card transaction is unknown. To get the correct processing status of the credit card transaction, a user can use the '''Validate CC Payment''' action on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_20_00|Payments and Applications] form.

On the '''Credit Card Processing Info''' tab, the system creates a row for the last successful operation with the credit card transaction. In the '''PC Response Reason''' box, ''Imported External Transaction'' indicates that the information about the credit card transaction operation has been imported from the external e-commerce system. The transaction operation can have one of the following types:[anchor|#_65728120-9689-4ac7-9c64-43b11c724afe]
*''Authorize Only'': The payment was authorized when the order was placed but has not yet been captured.
*''Authorize and Capture'': The payment was captured when the order was placed.
*''Capture Authorized'': The payment was authorized when the order was placed, and then the funds were captured in the admin panel of the store.
*''Unknown'': The status of the operation with the credit card transaction is unknown.

==Deferred Processing of Imported Credit Card Payments==
Credit card transactions created in Acumatica ERP during the import of payments based on credit card payment methods require validation in the following cases:[anchor|#_c61572b7-7a9e-4b50-a7aa-6eff4675f363]
*If the customer used a previously saved credit card
*If the customer entered the details of a new card and selected the '''Save this card for future transactions''' check box during checkout
*If the last operation on the credit card transaction has the ''Unknown'' status
{br}

External credit card transactions that meet these conditions are displayed on the '''Deferred Processing Required''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_51_30_00|Validate External Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=AR513000|AR513000]) form with the '''Load Payment Profile''' check box selected (see the following screenshot).{br}

When the validation process is started, the system performs the following actions:[anchor|#_82e53e11-d065-49ae-a34c-7c9dfc16c330]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_10|Customer Payment Methods] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303010|AR303010]) form, creates a customer payment method based on the payment profile from the processing center.
#Links the customer payment method to the credit card transaction.
#Links the customer payment method to the imported payment.
#Requests the status of the credit card transaction, and updates the processing status of the transaction and the status of the prepayment, if necessary.
#:If the updated processing status of the transaction is ''Captured'', the status of the prepayment changes to ''Balanced''. If on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) form, the '''Enable Integrated CC Processing''' check box is selected, the system releases the prepayment.

Customizations may support forced validation of all imported credit card transactions. In this case, credit card transactions imported from external systems will be displayed on the '''Deferred Processing Required''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_51_30_00|Validate External Transactions] form and will need to be validated.]]></column>
			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Importing Credit Card Payments: General Information In  Acumatica ERP Commerce                         Edition,     users can import and, if necessary, process debit and credit card payments from external     e-commerce systems through integration with the Authorize.Net payment gateway. Learning Objectives In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following: Configure the mapping of card-based payment methods in  Acumatica ERP      with store payment methods. Import payments based on the card-based payment methods from the external e-commerce      system Process credit card payments imported to  Acumatica ERPApplicable Scenarios You import payments based on credit card payment methods if you want to accept payments by     card in the online store as well as track and, if necessary, process the imported payments in       Acumatica ERP. Configuration of Credit Card Payment Processing for E-commerce Systems Authorize.Net is a processing center that accepts transactions through an application     programming interface and processes payments online. Before credit card payments can be imported     from an external e-commerce system, you need to configure payment processing via Authorize.Net     as follows: Configure the Authorize.Net processing center . You set up the processing center on      the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA205000|CA205000]) Processing Centers (CA205000) form. Before you proceed with the configuration,      you need to obtain the API login, signature key, and transaction key that you will use to      connect to the Authorize.Net server. For instructions on setting up a processing center in  Acumatica ERP,      see  Integration with Authorize.Net Through the API Plug-in and  To Configure the Authorize.Net Processing Center with the API Plug-in. Configure a card-based payment method . After you have configured the processing      center, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA204000|CA204000]) Payment Methods (CA204000) form, you need to create a payment      method that will be associated with the processing center. If saving payment profiles is      allowed for a customer class to which a particular customer belongs, the payment method will be      used as a template for creating new customer payment methods. For more information about      creating card-based payment methods, see  To Add a Payment Method for Payment Processing. Configure the Authorize.Net payment gateway in the e-commerce system . You set up the      Authorize.Net payment provider in the e-commerce system using the same API login, signature      key, and transaction key that you have used to configure the processing center in Step 1. For      information about configuring payment providers in the external-system, refer to the e-commerce      system's documentation. Map the card-based payment method with the payment methods configured in the e-commerce       system.  You map payment methods between  Acumatica ERP      and the BigCommerce e-commerce system on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) BigCommerce Stores (BC201000) form,      and between  Acumatica ERP      and the Shopify e-commerce system on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC201010|BC201010]) Shopify Stores (BC201010) form. When      a payment is imported from the e-commerce system to  Acumatica ERP,      a prepayment is created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) Payments and Applications (AR302000) form based on the      payment method that was mapped to the payment method used for payment in the e-commerce system.      For more information about mapping of card-based payment methods, see the following      section. Mapping of Card-Based Payment Methods During the configuration of a connection to an e-commerce system, one of the steps you perform     is the mapping of payment methods configured in  Acumatica ERP     with payment methods configured in the e-commerce system. For BigCommerce and Shopify, you     define payment method mapping in the  Base Currency Payment Methods  table     on the  Payment Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) BigCommerce Stores     (BC201000) or   ([~/?ScreenId=BC201010|BC201010]) Shopify Stores (BC201010) form, respectively. For the Authorize.Net store payment method, you specify the following: Payment Method ID : The identifier of the payment method in  Acumatica ERP      that was configured to use the same processing center as was used for setting up the payment      provider in the online store. Cash Account : A cash account that was specified for the payment      method on the  Allowed Cash Accounts  tab on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA204000|CA204000]) Payment Methods (CA204000) form. Proc. Center ID : The identifier of the processing center configured      for the payment method on the  Processing Centers  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA205000|CA205000]) Processing Centers (CA205000) form. Active : A check box that you select for a payment method to indicate      that payments made in the e-commerce system that are based on should be imported to  Acumatica ERP.      For payment methods based on credit cards, the  Release Payments  check      box is always cleared and not available for editing. Users must release payments based on      credit cards manually or by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR501000|AR501000]) Release AR Documents (AR501000)      form. Import of Payments Based on Credit Cards A customer who has signed in to the BigCommerce store can save credit card details during     checkout. When this customer selects the  Authorize.Net  payment method, enters the details     of a new card, selects the  Save this card for future transactions  check     box, and then places an order, the details of the credit card are saved in the processing center     configured in the BigCommerce store. When the payment is imported from BigCommerce to  Acumatica ERP     (as part of the synchronization of the  Sales Order  entity or the  Payment  entity),     on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) Payments and Applications (AR302000) form, the system creates a     document of the  Prepayment  type with the  Pending Processing  status. In the Summary     area of the created document, the system inserts the following information: Payment Method : The payment method that has been mapped to the store      payment method in the  Base Currency Payment Methods  table on the        Payment Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) BigCommerce Stores form Cash Account : The cash account selected for the mapped payment      method Payment Ref. : The number of the related credit card transaction in      the processing center Processing Status : The processing status of the credit card      transaction. Depending on the last successful operation with the transaction, the processing      status can be one of the following: Pre-Authorized : The payment has been authorized but the funds have not been        captured. The last successful operation was  Authorize Only . Captured : The funds have been captured. The last successful operation with the        credit card transaction was either  Authorize and Capture  or  Capture        Authorized . Unknown : The last successful operation with the credit card transaction is unknown.        To get the correct processing status of the credit card transaction, a user can use the          Validate CC Payment  action on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) Payments and Applications form. On the  Credit Card Processing Info  tab, the system creates a row for     the last successful operation with the credit card transaction. In the  PC Response      Reason  box,  Imported External Transaction  indicates that the information     about the credit card transaction operation has been imported from the external e-commerce     system. The transaction operation can have one of the following types: Authorize Only : The payment was authorized when the order was placed but has not yet      been captured. Authorize and Capture : The payment was captured when the order was placed. Capture Authorized : The payment was authorized when the order was placed, and then      the funds were captured in the admin panel of the store. Unknown : The status of the operation with the credit card transaction is      unknown. Deferred Processing of Imported Credit Card Payments Credit card transactions created in  Acumatica ERP     during the import of payments based on credit card payment methods require validation in the     following cases: If the customer used a previously saved credit card If the customer entered the details of a new card and selected the  Save this        card for future transactions  check box during checkout If the last operation on the credit card transaction has the  Unknown  status External credit card transactions that meet these conditions are displayed on the       Deferred Processing Required  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR513000|AR513000]) Validate External Transactions (AR513000) form with the  Load Payment      Profile  check box selected (see the following screenshot). When the validation process is started, the system performs the following actions: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303010|AR303010]) Customer Payment Methods (AR303010) form, creates a customer      payment method based on the payment profile from the processing center. Links the customer payment method to the credit card transaction. Links the customer payment method to the imported payment. Requests the status of the credit card transaction, and updates the processing status of the      transaction and the status of the prepayment, if necessary. If the updated processing status       of the transaction is  Captured , the status of the prepayment changes to        Balanced . If on the  General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) Accounts Receivable Preferences (AR101000) form, the  Enable Integrated CC        Processing  check box is selected, the system releases the prepayment. Customizations may support forced validation of all imported credit card transactions. In this     case, credit card transactions imported from external systems will be displayed on the       Deferred Processing Required  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR513000|AR513000]) Validate External Transactions form and will need to be validated. ]]></column>

Before you can start using the Shopify integration functionality of Acumatica ERP Commerce                         Edition, you need to set up a Shopify store, establish a connection between the Acumatica ERP instance and the Shopify store, and perform the initial configuration of the connection.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this section, you will learn what general steps are involved in establishing a connection between Acumatica ERP and the Shopify store and in performing the initial configuration of these systems.
==Steps for Establishing the Store Connection and Performing the Initial Configuration==
In order to connect the Acumatica ERP instance to the Shopify store, you perform the following general steps:[anchor|#_f1e4ba01-4f26-4ea3-b55b-38fe9ee31328]
#Set up a Shopify store.
#Obtain the Shopify API credentials.
#Prepare the Acumatica ERP instance.
#Establish the connection to the Shopify store.
#Perform the initial configuration of the store connection.
#Configure the entities enabled for synchronization.
#Start synchronizing data.

Each of these steps is described in greater detail below.
==Setup of a Shopify Store==
Before you can connect Acumatica ERP to a Shopify store, you need to set up the store. For a test implementation, we recommend that you sign up for a Shopify trial account. For more information, see [https://www.shopify.com/pricing|the Shopify pricing page].
==Obtaining of the Shopify API Credentials==
When you are creating a Shopify store in Acumatica ERP, you need to specify the following details:[anchor|#_fa13f27f-4025-4670-ab18-84bf5a081205]
*Store admin path, which is the URL of the Shopify store followed by ''/admin''
*API credentials (API key and password, and a shared secret)

For details on obtaining the API credentials, see [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_Shopify_Initial_Configuration_To_Capture_Connection_Info|Initial Configuration: To Capture Store Connection Information].
==Preparation of the Acumatica ERP Instance==
During the configuration of the connection to the Shopify store, you need to specify certain values coming from the Acumatica ERP instance, such as the numbering sequence to be used for generating the identifiers of customers imported from the Shopify store, and the payment methods that will be mapped to the payment methods configured in the Shopify store. Some of these values can be created on the fly. However, we recommend that the Acumatica ERP instance be prepared in advance.{br}

For more information, see [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_Shopify_Initial_Configuration_To_Prepare_Instance|Initial Configuration: To Prepare the Acumatica ERP Instance].
==Establishing of the Connection to the Shopify Store==
Once you have captured the API account details for your Shopify store, you proceed to set up the connection on the '''Connection Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_10|Shopify Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201010|BC201010]) form. You specify the store name, the admin path to the store, and the API account details. Once you have specified these settings, you click '''Test Connection''' on the form toolbar to ensure that the data has been specified correctly.
==Initial Configuration of the Store Connection==
After you have successfully established a connection to the Shopify store, you can perform the basic required configuration. This step involves the following substeps:[anchor|#_72840e55-ef30-4adf-8fb1-9fb8800bb905]
#On the '''Entity Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_10|Shopify Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201010|BC201010]) form, you activate the needed entities—that is, you select the '''Active''' check box in the row of each entity whose records you want to synchronize between Acumatica ERP and the Shopify store. 
#:The synchronization of a particular entity may require that some other entities be synchronized as a prerequisite. When you select the '''Active''' check box for such an entity, the system automatically selects it for all other entities required as a prerequisite. Similarly, when you clear the '''Active''' check box for an entity that is a required entity for other entities, the check box becomes cleared for all dependent entities.
#:In this substep, you also review the following default synchronization settings for each entity for which the '''Active''' check box is selected, and make sure the default settings are appropriate for your configuration needs:
#*'''Sync Direction''': The direction of the synchronization, which can be ''Import'' (data is imported to Acumatica ERP), ''Export'' (data is exported to the Shopify store), and ''Bidirectional'' (data is both exported to the Shopify store and imported to Acumatica ERP).
#*'''Primary System''': The system, ''Local'' (Acumatica ERP) or ''External'' (the Shopify store), whose data takes precedence if conflicts occur during the synchronization.
#*'''Real-Time Import''': The status of the real-time import process. At the time of the initial configuration, this status is either ''Stopped'' (real-time synchronization is supported but has not been started) or ''Not Supported'' (real-time synchronization cannot be started).
#*'''Real-Time Export''': The status of the real-time export process. At the time of the initial configuration, this status is either ''Stopped'' (real-time synchronization is supported but has not been started) or ''Not Supported'' (real-time synchronization cannot be started). 
#*'''Real-Time Mode''': The mode of the processing synchronization records, which can be either of the following:
#**''Prepare'': As soon as a push notification about a change to data is received, the corresponding synchronization record is placed in the processing queue.
#**''Prepare & Process'': As soon as a push notification about a change to data is received, the corresponding synchronization record is placed in the processing queue, and the data synchronization process is immediately started for the synchronization record.
#*'''Max. Number of Failed Attempts''': The maximum number of errors that are allowed during the import or export before the record is automatically skipped. By default, 5 attempts are allowed.
#:Although most of the settings on this tab can be changed, we recommend that you leave the default values during the initial configuration. For more information about configuring synchronization, see [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_BigCommerce_Data_Sync_GeneralInfo|Data Synchronization: General Information].
#On the '''Customer Settings''' tab, you specify the following settings, which will be applied to customers and customer locations synchronized between the Shopify store and Acumatica ERP:
#*'''Customer Class''': The customer class from which default customer settings will be populated for new customers that are imported from the Shopify store.
#*'''Customer Autonumbering''': The numbering sequence the system will use to automatically generate the identifiers of the customers that are imported from the Shopify store.
#*'''Location Autonumbering''': The numbering sequence the system will use to automatically generate identifiers of the customer locations (that is, addresses) that are imported from the Shopify store.
#*'''Generic Guest Customer''': The customer account to be used in orders placed in the Shopify store by non-registered customers. This customer account is used only if guest orders are allowed in the Shopify store.
#:If your company uses segmented keys that consist of multiple segments for customers and customer locations, you also need to specify the numbering templates in the '''Customer Numbering Template''' and '''Location Numbering Template''' boxes.
#On the '''Inventory Settings''' tab, you specify the following settings that apply to inventory items:
#*'''Sales Category Export''': The sales category export mode, which determines if item sales categories assigned to an item in Acumatica ERP should be synchronized with the Shopify store. You select ''Sync Sales Categories to Product Tags'' to instruct the system to synchronize item sales categories (assigned to synchronized items) with product tags in the Shopify store and ''Do Nothing''if item sales categories should not be exported. You can view item sales categories in on the 
#*'''Default Availability''': The default availability assigned to stock items exported from Acumatica ERP. You can select any of the following options:
#**''Available - Track Qty'': The exported items will be available in the store, and their quantity will be tracked.
#**''Available - Don&rsquo;t Track Qty'': The exported items will be available in the store, and their quantity will not be tracked.
#**''Pre-Order'': The exported items will be available for pre-order in the store.
#**''Disabled'': The exported items will not be available for purchase in the store.
#*:((({S:Warn}The default availability can be overridden for each particular item on the '''eCommerce''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form.
)))
#*:If you select ''Available - Track Qty'', in the '''When Qty Unavailable''' box, you also need to select one of the following actions that the system should take if after the synchronization of the ''Product Availability'' entity, the item&rsquo;s available quantity becomes zero. You can select one of the following actions:
#**''Do Nothing'': The system should perform no action.
#**''Set as Disabled'': The system should make the item unavailable for purchase.
#**''Set as Pre-Order'': The system should make the item available for pre-order.
#*'''Availability Mode''': You select which item quantities need to be synchronized with the Shopify store: all available items, items available for shipping, or items on hand.
#*'''Warehouse Mode''': You specify if you want to use all warehouses or only specific warehouses for quantity calculations. In the latter case, you need to specify the warehouses whose quantities are to be included in calculations.
#*:((({S:Warn}If ''Multiple Warehouse Locations'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can specify warehouse locations whose item quantities should be used for calculating the items' available quantities in the Shopify store.
)))
#On the '''Order Settings''' tab, you define default settings for the Shopify store as follows:
#*In the '''General''' section, you select the branch that will appear on sales orders imported from the Shopify store.
#*In the '''Order''' section, you select the order types for e-commerce orders and e-commerce returns, and you specify if discounts should be aggregated on the level of the entire document or for particular items in the order (if discounts are provided). Here you also select the non-stock item that will represent gift certificates and will be available for purchase.
#*In the '''Shipping Option Mapping''' section, you specify the '''Ship Via''' options for the combinations of the shipping zone and shipping method configured in the Shopify store. For each combination of the store shipping zone and store shipping method, you can optionally specify the shipping zone and shipping terms to make the mapping more granular. The values specified in this table appear on the '''Shipping Settings''' tab of orders imported to Acumatica ERP from the Shopify store.
#*In the '''Taxes''' section, you specify if taxes need to be synchronized with the Shopify store. If synchronization of taxes is enabled—that is, if the ''Synchronize Automatically'' or ''Synchronize Manually'' option is selected—you must also select the IDs of the primary tax zone and default tax zone. The primary tax zone, if specified, has precedence over the tax zone passed to Acumatica ERP through the API or calculated based on the customer&rsquo;s location or postal code and always applies to order lines in the imported sales orders. The default tax zone applies if no primary tax zone is specified and the tax zone can be calculated based on the customer&rsquo;s location or postal code.. In this section, you can also select the substitution lists that you will use to map tax codes and tax categories between Acumatica ERP and the Shopify store.
#On the '''Payment Settings''' tab, you map the payment methods defined in the Shopify store (that is, the values in the '''Store Payment Methods''' column) to the combination of the payment method and cash account defined in Acumatica ERP (that is, with the values in the '''Payment Method ID''' and '''Cash Account''' columns, respectively). You can indicate that payments by a specific payment method should be processed in Acumatica ERP by selecting the '''Active''' check box for a particular store payment method; you can also indicate that payments based on a specific payment method that are imported from the Shopify store should be released on import automatically by selecting the check box in the '''Release Payments''' column.

==Configuration of the Entities Enabled for Synchronization==
For each entity that you want to synchronize between Acumatica ERP and the Shopify store and that you have activated on the '''Entity Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_10|Shopify Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201010|BC201010]) form, you can also set up the mapping of custom fields for synchronization and synchronization filtering settings on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) form.{br}

For more information about defining filtering and mapping settings for the needed entities, see [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_BigCommerce_Preparing_Entities_MapRef|Preparing Entities for Synchronization].
==Synchronization of Data==
After you have performed the initial configuration, you can start to synchronize data between Acumatica ERP and the Shopify store. First, you perform manual synchronization for entities in a specific order. Then you set up synchronization to run automatically, either in real-time or according to a specific schedule. For information about synchronization, see [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_BigCommerce_Data_Sync_GeneralInfo|Data Synchronization: General Information].]]></column>
			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Initial Configuration: General Information Before you can start using the  Shopify     integration functionality of  Acumatica ERP Commerce                         Edition, you     need to set up a  Shopify store,     establish a connection between the  Acumatica ERP     instance and the  Shopify store,     and perform the initial configuration of the connection. Learning Objectives In this section, you will learn what general steps are involved in establishing a connection     between  Acumatica ERP     and the  Shopify store and in performing the initial configuration of these systems. Steps for Establishing the Store Connection and Performing the Initial     Configuration In order to connect the  Acumatica ERP     instance to the  Shopify store,     you perform the following general steps: Set up a  Shopify      store. Obtain the  Shopify API      credentials. Prepare the  Acumatica ERP      instance. Establish the connection to the  Shopify      store. Perform the initial configuration of the store connection. Configure the entities enabled for synchronization. Start synchronizing data. Each of these steps is described in greater detail below. Setup of a  Shopify     Store Before you can connect  Acumatica ERP     to a  Shopify     store, you need to set up the store. For a test implementation, we recommend that you sign up     for a  Shopify     trial account. For more information, see  the Shopify pricing page the Shopify pricing page. Obtaining of the  Shopify API     Credentials When you are creating a  Shopify store in       Acumatica ERP, you need to specify the following details: Store admin path, which is the URL of the  Shopify store      followed by  /admin API credentials (API key and password, and a shared secret) For details on obtaining the API credentials, see  Initial Configuration: To Capture Store Connection Information. Preparation of the  Acumatica ERP     Instance During the configuration of the connection to the  Shopify store,     you need to specify certain values coming from the  Acumatica ERP     instance, such as the numbering sequence to be used for generating the identifiers of customers     imported from the  Shopify store,     and the payment methods that will be mapped to the payment methods configured in the  Shopify store.     Some of these values can be      created     on the fly . However, we recommend that the  Acumatica ERP     instance be prepared in advance. For more information, see  Initial Configuration: To Prepare the Acumatica ERP Instance. Establishing of the Connection to the  Shopify     Store Once you have captured the API account details for your  Shopify store,     you proceed to set up the connection on the  Connection Settings  tab of     the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC201010|BC201010]) Shopify Stores (BC201010) form. You specify the store name, the admin path     to the store, and the API account details. Once you have specified these settings, you click       Test Connection  on the form toolbar to ensure that the data has been     specified correctly. Initial Configuration of the Store Connection After you have successfully established a connection to the  Shopify store,     you can perform the basic required configuration. This step involves the following substeps: On the  Entity Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC201010|BC201010]) Shopify Stores      (BC201010) form, you activate the needed entities—that is, you select the        Active  check box in the row of each entity whose records you want to      synchronize between  Acumatica ERP      and the  Shopify store.  The synchronization of a particular entity may require that some other       entities        be synchronized  as a       prerequisite. When you select the  Active  check box for such an entity,       the system automatically selects it for all other entities required as a prerequisite.       Similarly, when you clear the  Active  check box for an entity that is a       required entity for other entities, the check box becomes cleared for all dependent       entities. In this substep, you also review the following default synchronization       settings for each entity for which the  Active  check box is selected,       and make sure the default settings are appropriate for your configuration needs: Sync Direction : The direction of the synchronization, which can be          Import  (data is imported to  Acumatica ERP),  Export  (data is exported to the  Shopify        store), and  Bidirectional  (data is both exported to the  Shopify store        and imported to  Acumatica ERP). Primary System : The system,  Local  ( Acumatica ERP) or  External  (the  Shopify        store), whose data takes precedence if conflicts occur during the synchronization. Real-Time Import : The status of the real-time import process. At        the time of the initial configuration, this status is either  Stopped  (real-time        synchronization is supported but has not been started) or  Not Supported  (real-time        synchronization cannot be started). Real-Time Export : The status of the real-time export process. At        the time of the initial configuration, this status is either  Stopped  (real-time        synchronization is supported but has not been started) or  Not Supported  (real-time        synchronization cannot be started).  Real-Time Mode : The mode of the processing synchronization records,        which can be either of the following: Prepare : As soon as a push notification about a change to data is received, the          corresponding synchronization record is placed in the processing queue. Prepare & Process : As soon as a push notification about a change to data is          received, the corresponding synchronization record is placed in the processing queue, and          the data synchronization process is immediately started for the synchronization          record. Max. Number of Failed Attempts : The maximum number of errors that        are allowed during the import or export before the record is automatically skipped. By        default, 5 attempts are allowed. Although most of the settings on this tab can be changed, we recommend that you leave       the default values during the initial configuration. For more information about configuring       synchronization, see  Data Synchronization: General Information. On the  Customer Settings  tab, you specify the following settings,      which will be applied to customers and customer locations synchronized between the  Shopify store      and  Acumatica ERP: Customer Class : The customer class from which default customer        settings will be populated for new customers that are imported from the  Shopify        store. Customer Autonumbering : The numbering sequence the system will use        to automatically generate the identifiers of the customers that are imported from the  Shopify        store. Location Autonumbering : The numbering sequence the system will use        to automatically generate identifiers of the customer locations (that is, addresses) that are        imported from the  Shopify        store. Generic Guest Customer : The customer account to be used in orders        placed in the Shopify store by non-registered customers. This customer account is used only        if guest orders are allowed in the  Shopify        store. If your company uses segmented keys that consist of multiple segments for customers and       customer locations, you also need to specify the numbering templates in the         Customer Numbering Template  and  Location Numbering        Template  boxes. On the  Inventory Settings  tab, you specify the following settings      that apply to inventory items: Sales Category Export : The sales category export mode, which        determines if item sales categories assigned to an item in  Acumatica ERP should be synchronized with the  Shopify store.        You select  Sync Sales Categories to Product Tags  to instruct the system to synchronize        item sales categories (assigned to synchronized items) with product tags in the  Shopify store        and  Do Nothing if item sales categories should not be exported. You can view item sales        categories in on the         Default Availability : The default availability assigned to stock        items exported from  Acumatica ERP. You can select any of the following         options: Available - Track Qty : The exported items will be available in the store, and          their quantity will be tracked. Available - Don't Track Qty : The exported items will be available in the store,          and their quantity will not be tracked. Pre-Order : The exported items will be available for pre-order in the store. Disabled : The exported items will not be available for purchase in the          store. The default availability can be overridden for each particular         item on the  eCommerce  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items or            ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items form. If you select  Available - Track Qty ,         in the  When Qty Unavailable  box, you also need to select one of the         following actions that the system should take if after the synchronization of the  Product          Availability  entity, the item's available quantity becomes zero. You can select one of         the following actions: Do Nothing : The system should perform no action. Set as Disabled : The system should make the item unavailable for purchase. Set as Pre-Order : The system should make the item available for pre-order. Availability Mode : You select which item quantities need to be        synchronized with the  Shopify store:        all available items, items available for shipping, or items on hand. Warehouse Mode : You specify if you want to use all warehouses or        only specific warehouses for quantity calculations. In the latter case, you need to specify        the warehouses whose quantities are to be included in calculations. If  Multiple          Warehouse Locations  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features         (CS101000) form, you can specify warehouse locations whose item quantities should be used         for calculating the items' available quantities in the Shopify store. On the  Order Settings  tab, you define default settings for the  Shopify store as       follows: In the  General  section, you select the branch that will appear on        sales orders imported from the Shopify store. In the  Order  section, you select the order types for e-commerce        orders and e-commerce returns, and you specify if discounts should be aggregated on the level        of the entire document or for particular items in the order (if discounts are provided). Here        you also select the non-stock item that will represent gift certificates and will be        available for purchase. In the  Shipping Option Mapping  section, you specify the          Ship Via  options for the combinations of the shipping zone and        shipping method configured in the Shopify store. For each combination of the store shipping        zone and store shipping method, you can optionally specify the shipping zone and shipping        terms to make the mapping more granular. The values specified in this table appear on the          Shipping Settings  tab of orders imported to  Acumatica ERP from the Shopify store. In the  Taxes  section, you specify if taxes need to be synchronized        with the Shopify store. If synchronization of taxes is enabled—that is, if the  Synchronize         Automatically  or  Synchronize Manually  option is selected—you must also select the        IDs of the primary tax zone and default tax zone. The primary tax zone, if specified, has        precedence over the tax zone passed to  Acumatica ERP through the API or calculated based on the customer's location or postal code and always        applies to order lines in the imported sales orders. The default tax zone applies if no        primary tax zone is specified and the tax zone can be calculated based on the customer's        location or postal code.. In this section, you can also select the substitution lists that        you will use to map tax codes and tax categories between  Acumatica ERP and the Shopify store. On the  Payment Settings  tab, you map the payment methods defined in      the Shopify store (that is, the values in the  Store Payment Methods       column) to the combination of the payment method and cash account defined in  Acumatica ERP      (that is, with the values in the  Payment Method ID  and  Cash       Account  columns, respectively). You can indicate that payments by a specific      payment method should be processed in  Acumatica ERP      by selecting the  Active  check box for a particular store payment method;      you can also indicate that payments based on a specific payment method that are imported from      the Shopify store should be released on import automatically by selecting the check box in the        Release Payments  column. On the form toolbar, you click  Save  to save the settings. Configuration of the Entities Enabled for Synchronization For each entity that you want to synchronize between  Acumatica ERP     and the Shopify store and that you have activated on the  Entity Settings      tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC201010|BC201010]) Shopify Stores (BC201010) form, you can also set up the mapping of     custom fields for synchronization and synchronization filtering settings on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) Entities (BC202000) form. For more information about defining filtering and mapping settings for the needed entities,     see  Preparing Entities for Synchronization. Synchronization of Data After you have performed the initial configuration, you can start to synchronize data between       Acumatica ERP and the Shopify store. First, you perform manual synchronization for entities in a specific     order. Then you set up synchronization to run automatically, either in real-time or according to     a specific schedule.

The Acumatica ERP instance with the ''U100'' dataset already contains most of the settings and data that you will need to specify when you start configuring the store connection. In this activity, you will review the following settings or entities on the following forms of the Acumatica ERP instance:[anchor|#_1e592139-d036-4db8-a531-ee951aab1d05]
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form: The features that have been enabled to support e-commerce functionality
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_10_00|Customer Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR201000|AR201000]) form: The customer class for the customers imported from the Shopify store
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_10_10|Numbering Sequences] ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) form: The numbering sequences to be used for generating the identifiers for new customers and customer locations imported from the Shopify store
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form: The customer account to be used for guest orders (orders placed by unregistered users) in the online store
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form: The order type to be used for orders imported from the Shopify store, and the order type to be used for handling returns of online purchases
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_75_00|Ship via Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]): The carrier to be used for handling shipping
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_20_00|Cash Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CA202000|CA202000]): The cash account to be used for e-commerce orders
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_40_00|Payment Methods] ([~/?ScreenId=CA204000|CA204000]): The payment method to which payment methods from the Shopify store will be mapped

==System Preparation==
Sign in to the Acumatica ERP instance with the ''U100'' dataset preloaded by using the ''gibbs'' username and the ''123'' password.
==Step 1: Enabling the Needed Features==
To make sure the needed features for e-commerce functionality have been enabled, do the following:[anchor|#_7ed2d626-e797-4a7d-b611-2db60feedc15]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
#Make sure that the following features are enabled:
#*''Inventory''
#* ''Business Account Locations''
#* ''Commerce Integration''
#* ''Shopify Connector''
#:If any of these features is not enabled, click '''Modify''' on the table toolbar, select the check box that activates the feature, and click '''Enable''' on the form toolbar.
#:((({S:Warn}Depending on the setup of your Shopify store and the inventory and order management processes in your company, you might need to enable additional features. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_Shopify_Initial_Configuration_ImplemChecklist|Initial Configuration: Implementation Checklist].
)))

==Step 2: Reviewing the Customer Class for Customers Imported from Shopify==
During the process of establishing and configuring the connection between Acumatica ERP and the Shopify store, you will need to specify the customer class that will be used for creating customer records for customers imported from Shopify. You can use an existing customer class or create a new one with a different set of default settings to be used specifically for online customers. In the instance with the ''U100'' data preloaded, a dedicated customer class for online customers has already been created. {br}

To review the customer class that will be used for customers imported from Shopify, do the following:[anchor|#_0a625ccf-14f4-4a21-8588-ed843aaec26a]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_10_00|Customer Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR201000|AR201000]) form.
#In the '''Class ID''' box, select ''ECCUSTOMER''.
#:The system will use the settings of this customer class to populate customer records for new customers that will be imported from the Shopify store to Acumatica ERP.

==Step 3: Reviewing the Numbering Sequences for Customers and Customer Locations==
To review the numbering sequences that Acumatica ERP will use to assign identifiers to customers and customer addresses imported from the Shopify store, do the following:[anchor|#_5892801f-292e-4336-9315-ba924470abb2]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_10_10|Numbering Sequences] ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) form.
#In the '''Numbering ID''' box, select ''ECCUSTOMER''.
#:Review the settings of the numbering sequence that will be used to automatically generate the identifiers of the customers imported from the Shopify store to Acumatica ERP. With these settings, these customers will be assigned identifiers that start with the letter ''C'' followed by a numerical portion.
#In the '''Numbering ID''' box, select ''ECLOCATION''.
#:Review the settings of the numbering sequence that will be used to automatically generate the identifiers of the customer locations imported from the Shopify store to Acumatica ERP. With these settings, these customer locations will be assigned identifiers that start with the letter ''L'' followed by a numerical portion.

==Step 4: Reviewing the Customer Record to be Used for Guest Orders==
SweetLife&rsquo;s online store is going to accept guest orders: orders from customers who are not registered in the store. During the configuration of the store connection, you will need to select the customer record in Acumatica ERP that will appear in orders that are placed as guest orders in the Shopify store. In the instance with the ''U100'' data preloaded, the generic online customer account has already been created.{br}

To review the customer account that will be used for guest orders, do the following:[anchor|#_3c680e7e-ac8a-40fb-970d-e7d158053640]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form.
#In the Summary area, in the '''Customer ID''' box, select ''ECOMGUEST''.
#:This customer will appear on all orders imported from the Shopify store that were placed in the store by non-registered customers. 

==Step 5: Reviewing the Order Settings==
In order to review the order types created for the orders coming from the Shopify store, do the following:[anchor|#_791c1a70-e014-4bf4-81ff-e007654de055]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form.
#In the '''Order Type''' box, select ''EO - eCommerce Order''.
#Review the order type settings.
#:In a subsequent activity, you will configure the system to assign this order type to all orders imported from the Shopify store.
#In the '''Order Type''' box, select ''ER - eCommerce CR Order''.
#:In the '''Order Template''' box notice that this order type is based on the ''CR'' order template. In a subsequent activity, you will specify this order type to be used for all returns of products purchased in the Shopify store.

==Step 6: Reviewing the Reason Code for Refunds==
To review the reason code that the system will insert in return orders, do the following:[anchor|#_d1a588aa-8f3a-46dc-b8a7-a3c862d29bc4]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_21_10_00|Reason Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS211000|CS211000]) form.
#In the '''Reason Code''' box, select ''EREFUND''.

Notice that in the '''Usage''' box, ''Issue'' is selected. The reason code that the system uses in return orders for returns and refunds imported from the Shopify store must have the ''Issue'' usage type.
==Step 7: Reviewing the Shipping Settings==
To review the Acumatica ERP shipping settings that you will need to specify during the configuration of the store connection, do the following:[anchor|#_394cd533-8041-427c-ab82-9f351bb6dfae]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_75_00|Ship via Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]) form.
#In the '''Ship Via''' box, select ''LOCAL''.
#:Because SweetLife is going to deliver the products by using only its own fleet of vehicles, you will specify this shipping option when you configure the store connection.

==Step 8: Reviewing the Cash Account and Payment Method Settings==
To review the payment method in Acumatica ERP that will be mapped to the Shopify payment methods configured in the online store, do the following:[anchor|#_2d933a19-8207-4744-af16-3fc0d97bf8d8]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_40_00|Payment Methods] ([~/?ScreenId=CA204000|CA204000]) form.
#In the '''Payment Method ID''' box, select ''ONLINE''.
#:For simplicity, this payment method will be mapped to all payment methods configured in the Shopify store. On the '''Allowed Cash Accounts''' tab, notice that the table contains only one cash account, ''10250ST - Company Merchant Account''.
#In the '''Cash Account''' column, click the link with the cash account name.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_20_00|Cash Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=CA202000|CA202000]) form, which opens in a pop-up window, review the cash account settings.
#:In the Summary area, notice that the ''10250ST'' cash account has been configured for the ''USD'' currency and the ''RETAIL'' branch.

Now you can proceed to the next activity, [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_Shopify_Initial_Configuration_To_Capture_Connection_Info|Initial Configuration: To Capture Store Connection Information]. In this activity, you will learn how to capture the store&rsquo;s API credentials required for establishing the connection between your instance of Acumatica ERP and the Shopify store.]]></column>

Step 1: Enabling the Needed Features To make sure the needed features for e-commerce functionality have been enabled, do                 the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. Make sure that the following features are enabled: Inventory Business Account Locations Commerce Integration Shopify Connector If any of these features is not enabled, click                              Modify  on the table toolbar, select the check box                         that activates the feature, and click  Enable  on the                         form toolbar. Depending on the setup of your Shopify store and the                         inventory and order management processes in your company, you might need to                         enable additional features. For more information, see  Initial Configuration: Implementation Checklist. Step 2: Reviewing the Customer Class for Customers Imported from Shopify During the process of establishing and configuring the connection between  Acumatica ERP and the Shopify store, you will need to specify the customer class that will be                 used for creating customer records for customers imported from Shopify. You can use                 an existing customer class or create a new one with a different set of default                 settings to be used specifically for online customers. In the instance with the                      U100  data preloaded, a dedicated customer class for online customers has                 already been created.  To review the customer class that will be used for customers imported from Shopify,                 do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR201000|AR201000]) Customer Classes (AR201000) form. In the  Class ID  box, select  ECCUSTOMER .

The                 reason code that the system uses in return orders for returns and refunds imported                 from the Shopify store must have the  Issue  usage type. Step 7: Reviewing the Shipping Settings To review the  Acumatica ERP shipping settings that you will need to specify during the configuration of the                 store connection, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]) Ship via Codes (CS207500) form. In the  Ship Via  box, select  LOCAL . Because                         SweetLife is going to deliver the products by using only its own fleet of                         vehicles, you will specify this shipping option when you configure the store                         connection. Step 8: Reviewing the Cash Account and Payment Method Settings To review the payment method in  Acumatica ERP that will be mapped to the Shopify payment methods configured in the online                 store, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA204000|CA204000]) Payment Methods (CA204000) form. In the  Payment Method ID  box, select  ONLINE . For                         simplicity, this payment method will be mapped to all payment methods                         configured in the Shopify store. On the  Allowed Cash                             Accounts  tab, notice that the table contains only one cash                         account,  10250ST - Company Merchant Account . In the  Cash Account  column, click the link with the cash                     account name. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA202000|CA202000]) Cash Accounts (CA202000) form, which opens in a pop-up                     window, review the cash account settings. In the Summary area, notice that the                              10250ST  cash account has been configured for the  USD                          currency and the  RETAIL  branch. Now you can proceed to the next activity,  Initial Configuration: To Capture Store Connection Information.                 In this activity, you will learn how to capture the store's API credentials required                 for establishing the connection between your instance of  Acumatica ERP and the Shopify store. ]]></column>

On the page that opens, click  Create new private                     app . On the  Create private app  page, in the  App                         details  page, specify the following: Private app name :  Acumatica ERP                                 Integration Emergency developer email : Enter the email that                             you have used for creating a trial account. In the  Admin API  section, set the permissions for all                     areas of your store to the highest level. In the  Webhook API version  section, leave the default                     value. Click  Save  to save your changes. In the  Create private app  dialog box, which appears, read                     the information about the API key and click  Create                     app . In the  Admin API  section, locate the API key, API                     password, and shared secret generated for your private app. Note down this                     information as you will need it when setting up a connection between the Shopify                     store and the  Acumatica ERP instance. Now you can move on to establish a connection between  Acumatica ERP and the Shopify store and perform the minimum configuration of the connection. To                 do so, follow the steps described in  Initial Configuration: To Establish and Configure the Store Connection. ]]></column>

In this activity, you will learn how to connect your Acumatica ERP instance to the Shopify store and perform the initial configuration of the connection.
==Story==
Suppose that the SweetLife company wants to sell jam in its online store deployed on the Shopify platform. SweetLife is already using Acumatica ERP and now needs to integrate its instance with a new Shopify store. As SweetLife&rsquo;s implementation consultant, you need to configure the connection to the Shopify store and perform the minimum configuration required for synchronization of data between Acumatica ERP and the store.
==Configuration Overview==
For the purposes of this activity, a number of entities have been defined as described in [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_Shopify_Initial_Configuration_To_Prepare_Instance|Initial Configuration: To Prepare the Acumatica ERP Instance].
==Process Overview==
On the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_10|Shopify Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201010|BC201010]) form, you create a new connection to the online store by using the information you captured in [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_Shopify_Initial_Configuration_To_Capture_Connection_Info|Initial Configuration: To Capture Store Connection Information]. After the connection is successfully established, you perform the minimum configuration of the settings.
==System Preparation==

==Step 1: Establishing a Connection Between Acumatica ERP and the S Store==
To establish a connection with the Shopify store in your instance of Acumatica ERP, do the following:[anchor|#_1c3468c7-c9b7-4536-a6d2-e0942f51efaa]
#Open the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_10|Shopify Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201010|BC201010]) form.
#In the Summary area, in the '''Store Name''' box, specify the name of your Shopify store.
#On the '''Connection Settings''' tab, in the '''Store Settings''' section, use the information that you have captured while completing [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_Shopify_Initial_Configuration_To_Capture_Connection_Info|Initial Configuration: To Capture Store Connection Information] to specify the settings as follows:
#*In the '''Store Admin URL''' box, enter the path of your Shopify store followed by ''/admin''.
#*:The full URL usually looks like this: https://&lt;store name&gt;.myshopify.com/admin
#*In the '''API Key''' box, enter the API key generated for the private app that you have created in your Shopify store for the integration with Acumatica ERP.

#On the form toolbar, click '''Test Connection''' to check if you have specified the connection settings correctly.
#:If the connection test is successful, you can proceed to specifying the required settings for entities, customers, inventory, orders, and payments.

==Step 2: Specifying the Entity Settings==((({S:Danger}Steps 2 through 6 must be completed together. You will not be able to save the changes until all required boxes on these tabs of the form are filled in.
)))
Do the following to specify the entity settings:[anchor|#_a580c2d1-08c3-4003-b7e8-4383a48e12a5]
#While you are still on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_10|Shopify Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201010|BC201010]) form, open the '''Entity Settings''' tab.
#In the table, select the check box in the '''Active''' column for all entities.
#:The table displays all entities that are supported by the Shopify connector and their default settings (such as, the synchronization direction and primary system). For the purposes of this activity, you can leave the default settings as they are.

==Step 3: Specifying the Customer Settings==
To specify the settings that will be used by default for importing customers from the Shopify store to Acumatica ERP, do the following:[anchor|#_35bd6c0e-f09e-4762-897f-3f824cd03c17]
#While you are still on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_10|Shopify Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201010|BC201010]) form, open the '''Customer Settings''' tab.
#In the '''Customer''' section, select the following values:
#*'''Customer Class''': ''ECCUSTOMER''
#*:This is the default customer class based on which customer records will be created in Acumatica ERP for customers imported from the online store.
#*'''Customer Autonumbering''': ''ECCUSTOMER''
#*:This numbering sequence has been configured in Acumatica ERP to automatically generate identifiers for customer records imported from the Shopify store.
#*'''Location Autonumbering''': ''ECLOCATION''
#*:This numbering sequence has been configured in Acumatica ERP to automatically generate identifiers for customer location records in orders imported from the Shopify store.
#*'''Generic Guest Customer''': ''ECOMGUEST''
#*:This customer account, which has been created in Acumatica ERP, will appear on orders imported from the Shopify stores and placed by non-registered users.

==Step 4: Specifying the Inventory Settings==
To specify the inventory-related settings, do the following:[anchor|#_676c7f4c-4763-4e00-a539-606757c414bb]
#While you are still on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_10|Shopify Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201010|BC201010]) form, open the '''Inventory Settings''' tab.
#In the '''Inventory Settings''' section, specify the following settings:
#*'''Sales Category Export''': ''Sync Sales Categories to Product Tags''
#*:With this option selected, item sales categories assigned to stock items, non-stock items, and template items in Acumatica ERP will be exported as product tags to the Shopify store.
#*'''Default Availability''': ''Available - Don&rsquo;t Track Qty''
#*:This availability option will be assigned by default to stock items and non-stock items if no other availability option has been selected for these items on the '''eCommerce''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) forms, respectively.
#*'''Availability Mode''': ''Available for Shipping''
#*:This setting controls how the system calculates inventory levels. ''Available for Shipping'' means that the availability of an item is calculated based on only units that are available for shipping. For the purposes of this activity, you can leave this setting as it is.
#*'''Warehouse Mode''': ''All''
#*:This setting controls which warehouses are used for calculations of item quantities. ''All'' means that item quantities are calculated based on the items in all warehouses. For the purposes of this activity, you can leave this setting as it is.

==Step 5: Specifying the Order Settings==
To specify the order-related settings, do the following:[anchor|#_9a0a5ff1-e1d0-4532-a5e3-8630f46cbaa6]
#While you are still on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_10|Shopify Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201010|BC201010]) form, open the '''Order Settings''' tab.
#In the '''General''' section, in the '''Branch''' box, select ''RETAIL''.
#:The ''RETAIL'' branch will be inserted by default in sales orders imported from the online store.
#In the '''Order''' section, select the following options:
#*'''Order Type''': ''EO - eCommerce Order''
#*:This order type has been configured specifically for sales orders imported from Shopify stores.
#*'''Return Order Type''': ''ER - eCommerce CR Order''
#*:This order type will be used for creating return orders for returns and refunds initiated in the Shopify store.
#*'''Refund Amount Item''': ''REFUNDAMT''
#*:This non-stock item will be used as a dummy product to reflect refunded amounts in sales orders and return orders for returns initiated in the Shopify store.
#*'''Refund Reason Code''': ''ECOMREFUND''
#*This reason code of the ''Issue'' usage type will be inserted in return orders created for returns and refunds initiated in the Shopify store.
#In the '''Taxes''' section, in the '''Synchronize Taxes''' box, leave the default value, which is ''Do Not Synchronize''.
#:For simplicity, during the initial setup of the Shopify store, configuration of taxes has been skipped. Hence, you do not need to configure the synchronization of taxes at this point.
#In the '''Shipping Option Mapping''' section, map the shipping methods configured in Shopify with the Ship Via options in Acumatica ERP as follows.
#:{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="20%" ! Store Shipping Zone
!width="20%" ! Store Shipping Method
!width="20%" ! Ship Via
!width="20%" ! Shipping Zone
!width="20%" ! Ship Terms
|- 
| ''Domestic''
|  ''Default''
|  ''LOCAL''
| Empty
| Empty
|- 
| ''Domestic''
|  ''Expedited''
|  ''LOCAL''
| Empty
| Empty
|- 
| ''Domestic''
|  ''Standard''
|  ''LOCAL''
| Empty
| Empty
|}
#:For the purposes of this activity, leave the '''Shipping Zone''' and '''Ship Terms''' columns empty. The ''Rest of the World'' shipping zone that was created in the Shopify store automatically will not be used as the SweetLife store does not ship its products internationally.

==Step 6: Reviewing the Payment Method Mapping==
If you want to import payments based on a particular payment method configured in the store to Acumatica ERP, you need to map the payment method to a corresponding payment method configured in Acumatica ERP. To review the mapping table, do the following:[anchor|#_02c971a0-9806-424a-a969-35a0c594c393]
#While you are still on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_10|Shopify Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201010|BC201010]) form, open the '''Payment Settings''' tab.
#:In the '''Payment Method Mapping''' section, notice that only one store payment method, ''SHOPIFY&#95;PAYMENTS'', has been added to the '''Base Currency Payment Methods''' table. You will not use this payment method in subsequent activities, so there is no need to set up the mapping for it at this point. Notice also that the ''Cash on Delivery (COD)'' manual payment method that you activated in the [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_Shopify_Initial_Configuration_Set_Up_Shopify_Store_Activity|Initial Configuration: To Set Up a Shopify Store] activity has not been added. It will appear in the table when an order paid with this payment method is imported to Acumatica ERP.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save''' to save your changes.
#:Now that the initial configuration is complete, you can move on to synchronize your data for the first time. For information on data synchronization, see [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_Shopify_Data_Sync_GeneralInfo|Data Synchronization: General Information].

Available for Shipping  means that the                                 availability of an item is calculated based on only units that are                                 available for shipping. For the purposes of this activity, you can                                 leave this setting as it is. Warehouse Mode :  All This setting                                 controls which warehouses are used for calculations of item                                 quantities.  All  means that item quantities are calculated                                 based on the items in all warehouses. For the purposes of this                                 activity, you can leave this setting as it is. Step 5: Specifying the Order Settings To specify the order-related settings, do the following: While you are still on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC201010|BC201010]) Shopify Stores (BC201010) form, open                     the  Order Settings  tab. In the  General  section, in the                          Branch  box, select  RETAIL . The  RETAIL                          branch will be inserted by default in sales orders imported from the online                         store. In the  Order  section, select the following options: Order Type :  EO - eCommerce Order This                                 order type has been configured specifically for sales orders                                 imported from Shopify stores. Return Order Type :  ER - eCommerce CR                                 Order This order type will be used for creating return orders                                 for returns and refunds initiated in the Shopify store. Refund Amount Item :  REFUNDAMT This                                 non-stock item will be used as a dummy product to reflect refunded                                 amounts in sales orders and return orders for returns initiated in                                 the Shopify store. Refund Reason Code :  ECOMREFUND This reason code of the  Issue  usage type will be inserted in                             return orders created for returns and refunds initiated in the Shopify                             store. In the  Taxes  section, in the  Synchronize                         Taxes  box, leave the default value, which is  Do Not                         Synchronize . For simplicity, during the initial setup of the Shopify                         store, configuration of taxes has been skipped. Hence, you do not need to                         configure the synchronization of taxes at this point. In the  Shipping Option Mapping  section, map the shipping                     methods configured in Shopify with the Ship Via options in  Acumatica ERP as follows. Store Shipping Zone Store Shipping Method Ship Via Shipping Zone Ship Terms Domestic Default LOCAL Empty Empty Domestic Expedited LOCAL Empty Empty Domestic Standard LOCAL Empty Empty For the purposes of this activity, leave the  Shipping                             Zone  and  Ship Terms  columns empty.                         The  Rest of the World  shipping zone that was created in the Shopify                         store automatically will not be used as the SweetLife store does not ship                         its products internationally. Step 6: Reviewing the Payment Method Mapping If you want to import payments based on a particular payment method configured in the                 store to  Acumatica ERP, you need to map the payment method to a corresponding payment method configured                 in  Acumatica ERP. To review the mapping table, do the following: While you are still on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC201010|BC201010]) Shopify Stores (BC201010) form, open                     the  Payment Settings  tab. In the  Payment                             Method Mapping  section, notice that only one store payment                         method,  SHOPIFY_PAYMENTS , has been added to the  Base                             Currency Payment Methods  table. You will not use this                         payment method in subsequent activities, so there is no need to set up the                         mapping for it at this point. Notice also that the  Cash on Delivery                             (COD)  manual payment method that you activated in the  Initial Configuration: To Set Up a Shopify Store activity has not been added. It will appear in the table when an order                         paid with this payment method is imported to  Acumatica ERP. On the form toolbar, click  Save  to save your                         changes. Now that the initial configuration is complete, you can move on                         to synchronize your data for the first time. For information on data                         synchronization, see                              Data Synchronization: General Information. ]]></column>

==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how data synchronization works and how to synchronize data manually.
==Stages of the Synchronization Process==
The process of the synchronization of data between Acumatica ERP and the e-commerce consists of the following stages (which are shown in the diagram below):[anchor|#_b3bfe445-1fb6-4b86-bb86-3889766b6d40]
*Preparing out-of-sync data for synchronization. For details, see the [[#_41e6f5ed-943b-4ebc-affc-46f7ed8c64b5|Preparation of Out-of-Sync Data for Synchronization] section below.
*Processing out-of-sync data, as described in the [[#_a9afd843-28dd-41af-97e2-3d5f509403a7|Processing of Out-of-Sync Data] section below.
[anchor|#_b0eaa664-f342-4759-8016-33868050b7ee][anchor|#_f92af971-168b-4e2d-af6d-1c75dac9b3c4][image:UserGuide/Images/diag_COM_Data_Sync_Stages.png|popup|Stages of data synchronization|350px][anchor|#_41e6f5ed-943b-4ebc-affc-46f7ed8c64b5]
==Preparation of Out-of-Sync Data for Synchronization==
During the preparation of data for synchronization, the system receives the data that needs to be synchronized in Acumatica ERP and the e-commerce system and puts it in the processing queue. The following mechanisms can be used for obtaining data:[anchor|#_6275c4fa-d935-4997-b3d7-9d2cbe3c6b38]
*''Data preparation process.'': The data preparation process pulls the data to be synchronized from Acumatica ERP and the e-commerce system through API calls and puts it in the processing queue. It can be performed in the following modes:
**''Full'' mode: In this mode, all records of the entity that have been created or modified during the specified date range are pulled from Acumatica ERP and the e-commerce system and put in the processing queue, regardless of whether they have been processed previously or not.
**''Incremental'' mode: In this mode, only the records that have been modified since the date of the last successful data preparation are pulled.
**''Reconciliation'' mode: In this mode, only records that have been modified during the specified date range and that have not yet been processed are pulled.
*:The pulled data is then filtered according to the filtering criteria defined on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) form and saved in the processing queue as synchronization records with the ''Pending'' status, which indicates that these synchronization records have not yet been processed. The synchronization records are then processed as described in the [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_Shopify_Data_Sync_GeneralInfo#_a9afd843-28dd-41af-97e2-3d5f509403a7|Processing of Out-of-Sync Data].
*:The data preparation process can be started in the following ways:
**Manually, on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_50_10_00|Prepare Data] ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) form. For information on manual synchronization, see the [[#_fd3581fc-17ee-4358-8a37-2d2b5011eedf|Manual Synchronization] section further in this topic.
**By an automation schedule.
*''Push notifications'': If real-time synchronization is enabled for an entity on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) form, whenever a record is changed in the source system, the e-commerce connector is immediately notified about the change, and the corresponding synchronization record is created or updated in the processing queue.
*:This synchronization record is saved with the ''Pending'' status and remains in the processing queue until it is processed.
[anchor|#_a9afd843-28dd-41af-97e2-3d5f509403a7]
==Processing of Out-of-Sync Data==
During the data processing stage, the system processes the synchronization records in the processing queue according to the synchronization settings defined for the corresponding entity on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) form or on the '''Entity Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_10|Shopify Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201010|BC201010]) form, and the synchronized data is saved in Acumatica ERP, in the Shopify store, or in both systems.{br}

During the processing of out-of-sync data, the system performs the following operations for each synchronization record:[anchor|#_4021b00c-0867-44ec-97ed-c5513e67226d]
#Pulling the record details from Acumatica ERP and the e-commerce system.
#Determining the direction of the synchronization.
#Determining if any other records should be synchronized as a prerequisite for the synchronization of the current record, and attempting to synchronize the prerequisite records.
#Applying the standard field mapping for the entity.
#:The default field mapping for each entity is detailed in [HelpRoot_Commerce\COM_Mapping_Reference|Commerce Edition Entity Reference].
#Applying the field mapping configured for the entity on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) form.
#Saving the synchronized data in the destination system or systems.
#Changing the status of the synchronization record to ''Synchronized''.

The processing of out-of-sync data can be started as follows:[anchor|#_23b86480-5cde-4a35-ba99-507af972ff6d]
*You can start data processing manually, as described in the [[#_fd3581fc-17ee-4358-8a37-2d2b5011eedf|Manual Synchronization] section of this topic.
*You can configure an automation schedule that will start data processing at regular intervals, as described in [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_BigCommerce_Scheduled_Sync_GeneralInfo|Scheduling Synchronization: General Information].
*You can configure the system to immediately start data processing for each synchronization record created or updated as a result of the real-time synchronization process. To do this, on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) form, you set '''Real-Time Mode''' for an entity to ''Prepare & Process''. 
[anchor|#_c49b8722-5f12-4f45-b94a-3026d5f40549]
==Statuses of the Synchronization Records==
When a synchronization record is prepared and processed, the system assigns it one of the statuses described in the following table. You can review the synchronization status of any synchronization record on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_30_10_00|Sync History] ([~/?ScreenId=BC301000|BC301000]) form.[anchor|#_fa6a4fc0-d51b-4c7d-9e61-e9857c82dc9c]

==Manual Synchronization==
Manual synchronization might be useful when you need to synchronize data during the initial configuration or when data has not been synchronized for some reason and manual troubleshooting is needed.{br}

To manually start the data preparation process, you perform the following general steps:[anchor|#_5b24af74-0141-470c-bdde-90894113620e]
#You open the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_50_10_00|Prepare Data] ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) form.
#In the Selection area of the form, in the '''Store''' box, you select the online store with which you are synchronizing data.
#In the '''Prepare Mode''' box, you select one of the following options:
#*''Incremental'': You select this mode to prepare for processing only the synchronization records that have changed since the last successful data preparation.
#*''Full'': You select this mode to prepare for processing all records of the selected entity, even if they have been synchronized previously.
#*''Reconciliation'': You select this mode to prepare for processing only records that have been modified during the specified date range and that have not yet been processed.
#:If you are starting the data preparation process for an entity for the first time, ''Full'' mode is used, regardless of the mode selected in the '''Prepare Mode''' box.
#In the table, you select the unlabeled check box in the rows of the needed entities, and on the form toolbar, you click '''Prepare'''.

Manual Synchronization Manual synchronization might be useful when you need to synchronize data during the initial         configuration or when data has not been synchronized for some reason and manual         troubleshooting is needed. To manually start the data preparation process, you perform the following general         steps: You open the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) Prepare Data (BC501000) form. In the Selection area of the form, in the  Store  box, you select           the online store with which you are synchronizing data. In the  Prepare Mode  box, you select one of the following             options: Incremental : You select this mode to prepare for processing only the               synchronization records that have changed since the last successful data               preparation. Full : You select this mode to prepare for processing all records of the               selected entity, even if they have been synchronized previously. Reconciliation : You select this mode to prepare for processing only records               that have been modified during the specified date range and that have not yet been               processed. If             you are starting the data preparation process for an entity for the first time,                Full  mode is used, regardless of the mode selected in the  Prepare               Mode  box. In the table, you select the unlabeled check box in the rows of the needed entities, and           on the form toolbar, you click  Prepare . To manually start data processing, you perform the following general steps: You open the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501500|BC501500]) Process Data (BC501500) form. In the Selection area, in the  Store  box, you select the online           store with which you are synchronizing data. The table shows only the synchronization             records that have not been synchronized yet (that is, the synchronization records with             the  Pending  and  Failed  status). In the  Entity  box, you select the entity for which you want to           display synchronization records in the table. If you want to process out-of-sync             synchronization records for all entities, leave the box empty.

==Story==
Suppose that you are an implementation consultant helping the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company to set up an online store. You have completed the minimum initial configuration of the integration with Shopify and now want to explore how synchronization works. You will configure synchronization for and then synchronize a subset of stock items that are maintained in Acumatica ERP (stock items of the ''Jam'' item class) with the Shopify store, where the term ''products'' describes what are called ''items'' in Acumatica ERP. You will then perform a test purchase of one of the synchronized products and explore how the online order is processed in the Shopify store and in Acumatica ERP.
==Process Overview==
In this activity, you will perform the following steps:[anchor|#_298c3ce2-c7aa-40bb-b5db-f76e15ce7d4c]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form of Acumatica ERP, you will review the stock items that need to be exported to the Shopify store.
#On the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) form, you will configure the filtering options for the ''Stock Item'' entity to include in the synchronization only the stock items of the ''Jam'' item class.
#On the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_50_10_00|Prepare Data] ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) form, you will start the data preparation process for the ''Stock Item'' entity to prepare out-of-sync data for export.
#On the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_30_10_00|Sync History] ([~/?ScreenId=BC301000|BC301000]) form, you will review the result of the data preparation process.
#On the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_50_15_00|Process Data] ([~/?ScreenId=BC501500|BC501500]) form, you will start data processing for the ''Stock Item'' entity to save the synchronized product data in the Shopify store.
#On the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_30_10_00|Sync History] form, you will review the results of data processing.
#In the Shopify store, you will review the products that have been imported from Acumatica ERP.
#By using the storefront, you will purchase one of the products that have been imported from Acumatica ERP (a jar of jam) and place an order.
#In the admin area of the store, you will review the order details.
#On the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_50_10_00|Prepare Data] form of Acumatica ERP, you will start the data preparation process for the ''Sales Order'' entity to prepare out-of-sync order data for import.
#On the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_50_15_00|Process Data] form, you will synchronize the prepared sales order data.
#On the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_30_10_00|Sync History] form, you will review the results of data synchronization.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, you will review the details of the imported sales order.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form, you will create a shipment for the imported order.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form, you will confirm the shipment.
#On the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_50_10_00|Prepare Data] form, you will start both the data preparation process for the ''Shipment'' entity.
#In the admin area of the Shopify store, you will review the updated order details and the shipment exported from Acumatica ERP.

==System Preparation==
Do the following:[anchor|#_7607bdf5-d2e3-4ae0-b9e0-633a102d930b]
#Make sure that the following prerequisites have been met:
#*The Shopify store has been created and configured, as described in [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_Shopify_Initial_Configuration_Set_Up_Shopify_Store_Activity|Initial Configuration: To Set Up a Shopify Store].
#*The connection to the Shopify store has been established and the initial configuration has been performed, as described in [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_Shopify_Initial_Configuration_Implem_Activity|Initial Configuration: To Establish and Configure the Store Connection].
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as an administrator by using the ''gibbs'' username and ''123'' password.

==Step 1: Finding and Reviewing the Stock Items to Be Sold Online==
To find and review the stock items that will be sold online, do the following:[anchor|#_986c59c0-4053-4f38-b9e8-4add2663d170]
#Open the Stock Items (IN2025PL) form.
#Filter the stock items to display only the items of the ''Jam'' item class as follows: 
##In the '''Item Class''' column, click the column header.
##In the menu that opens, select the ''Equals'' filter condition.
##In the box at the bottom of the menu, type <tt>Jam</tt>.
##Click '''OK''' to apply the filter.
#:Now all stock items of the ''Jam'' item class are displayed. Notice how many items are in the class; scan the list so you are familiar with the stock items that you need to export to the Shopify store.

==Step 2: Configuring the Export of a Subset of Stock Items==
To configure the ''Stock Item'' entity to export to the Shopify store only stock items of the ''Jam'' item class, do the following:[anchor|#_faa8d8c3-4e68-457d-819e-972b768e33d0]
#Open the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) form.
#In the '''Store''' box, select the Shopify store with which you want to synchronize data.
#In the '''Entity''' box, select ''Stock Item''.
#:Notice that this entity can only be exported to the Shopify store (that is, '''Sync Direction''' is set to ''Export''), and that only two tabs, '''Export Mapping''' and '''Export Filtering''', are displayed.
#To create a filtering condition for stock items, on the '''Export Filtering''' tab, click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar, and specify the following settings in the row:
#*'''Active''': Selected
#*'''Field Name''': ''Item Class''
#* '''Condition''': ''Equals''
#* '''Value''': <tt>Jam</tt>
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save''' to save your changes.
#:Now when you synchronize the ''Stock Item'' entity, only the stock items of the ''Jam'' item class that you reviewed in Step 1 will be exported to the Shopify store.
#:((({S:Warn}Filtering rules are not applied to data that has already been synchronized. For example, if you synchronize the ''Stock Item'' entity without filters, apply the filter described above, and run the synchronization again, all previously synchronized stock items will remain synchronized.
)))

==Step 3: Preparing the Product Data for Synchronization==
To prepare product (item) data that needs to be synchronized to the Shopify store, do the following:[anchor|#_bb2a298b-b55e-4cb5-87ca-539bdcae5b6b]
#Open the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_50_10_00|Prepare Data] ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) form.
#In the '''Store''' box, select the Shopify store with which you want to synchronize data.
#In the '''Prepare Mode''' box, select ''Incremental''.
#:This setting controls which data will be loaded. ''Incremental'' indicates that the system will load only the data that has been modified since the previous data preparation. Because you start the preparation process for the first time, all data will be prepared.
#In the table, select the unlabeled check box in the row of the ''Stock Item'' entity, and on the form toolbar, click '''Prepare'''.
#In the '''Processing''' dialog box, which opens, review the results of the processing and click '''Close''' to close the dialog box.
#:Notice that the '''Prepared Records''' and '''Processed Records''' columns now show the number of records (stock items) that have been prepared and are ready to be synchronized, and the number of records that have been processed.

==Step 4: Reviewing the Results of Data Preparation==
To review the results of preparation of product data for synchronization, do the following:[anchor|#_87961b40-3c6d-4086-876d-a37114d61d55]
#While you are still viewing the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_50_10_00|Prepare Data] ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) form, click the link in the '''Processed Records''' in the row of the ''Stock Item'' entity.
#On the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_30_10_00|Sync History] ([~/?ScreenId=BC301000|BC301000]) form, which opens in a new window with your Shopify store and the ''Stock Item'' entity selected in the Selection area, on the '''Filtered''' tab, review the synchronization records. 
#:Notice that all synchronization records have the ''Filtered'' status and are excluded from synchronization based on the filtering conditions that you have configured in Step 2.
#On the '''Pending & Failed''' tab, notice that the table lists only synchronization records with the ''Pending'' status, which indicates that these records have been prepared and are now ready to be synchronized.
#:For each of these items, the '''Local ID''' column displays a link that you can click to open the item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. The text of the link corresponds to the description of the stock item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form. The '''External ID''' column, which corresponds to the identifier of the product in the Shopify store, however, does not display any values because the stock items have not yet been exported to the Shopify store.

==Step 5: Processing the Prepared Product Data==
To process the prepared product data (that is, to synchronize it with the Shopify store), do the following:[anchor|#_8efa22b0-28b2-4c14-91c9-108ccbac3ff1]
#Open the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_50_15_00|Process Data] ([~/?ScreenId=BC501500|BC501500]) form.
#In the Selection area, select the following settings:
#*'''Store''': The Shopify store with which you are syncing data
#*'''Entity''': ''Stock Item''
#:The table displays only the list of the out-of-sync stock items (that is, the items with the ''Pending'' status) that you reviewed in Step 4.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Process All''' to synchronize all records displayed on the form.
#In the '''Processing''' dialog box, review the results of the processing and click '''Close''' to close the dialog box.

==Step 6: Reviewing the Synchronization Status of the Product Data==
To again review the synchronization status of the product data, do the following:[anchor|#_1bf27433-4687-45b8-8f7d-6ae78eb72585]
#Open the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_30_10_00|Sync History] ([~/?ScreenId=BC301000|BC301000]) form.
#In the Selection area of the form, select the following settings:
#*'''Store''': The Shopify store with which you are syncing data
#*'''Entity''': ''Stock Item''
#Open the '''Synchronized''' tab.
#:The tab shows the list of items that have been synchronized with the Shopify store. For each item, there is now a product identifier in the '''External ID''' column. You can click the link in this column to open the product in the control panel of your Shopify store. In the table, the '''Last Operation''' value has changed to ''Inserted Externally'' and the time stamp in the '''Last Attempt''' column has changed to the date and time when you ran data processing on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_50_15_00|Process Data] ([~/?ScreenId=BC501500|BC501500]) form in Step 5.

==Step 7: Viewing an Exported Product in the Shopify Store==
To view the ''ORJAM32'' stock item (which has the description ''Orange jam 32 oz''), which has been exported, in the Shopify store, do the following:[anchor|#_1dbc5851-1686-4eda-a34c-b5e746a985ea]
#While you are still viewing the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_30_10_00|Sync History] ([~/?ScreenId=BC301000|BC301000]) form, click the link in the '''External ID''' column in the row of the synchronization record for the ''Orange jam 32 oz'' item.
#:The product management page for the ''Orange jam 32 oz'' product (which is a page in the admin area of the Shopify store where you manage details of a particular product) opens in a new browser window. If you are not signed in to the Shopify store as the store owner, you will need to enter your sign-in credentials.
#On the product management page, review the product data that has been exported to the Shopify store.

==Step 8: Purchasing a Jar of Apple Jam==
To create an order for five 32-ounce jars of apple jam from the Shopify admin area, do the following:[anchor|#_29871bec-e7ca-4f57-ab4e-7965be869515]
#While you are still signed in to the admin area of your Shopify store, in the left menu, click '''Orders'''.
#On the '''Orders''' page, which opens, in the top right, click '''Create order'''.
#On the '''Create order''' page, which opens, in the '''Order details''' section, start typing <tt>Apple jam</tt> in the search bar.
#In the list of search results, which are shown in a pop-up window, select ''Apple jam 32 oz'', and click '''Add to order'''.
#In the row of the ''Apple jam 32 oz'' product, change the quantity to <tt>5</tt>.
#In the '''Find or create a customer''' section, click in the search bar and in the menu that opens, select '''Create a new customer'''.
#In the '''Create a new customer''' pop-up window, fill in the boxes as follows:
#*'''First name''': <tt>Larry</tt>
#*'''Last name''': <tt>Coleman</tt>
#*'''Email''': <tt>larry@example.com</tt>
#*'''Company''': <tt>Plan Smart Partner</tt>
#*'''Phone number''': <tt>917-552-8969</tt>
#*'''Address''': <tt>1970 Duncan Avenue</tt>
#*'''City''': <tt>New York</tt>
#*'''Country/Region''': ''United States''
#* '''State''': ''New York''
#* '''Postal Code''': <tt>10016</tt>
#In the '''Accept Payment''' section, click '''Mark as Pending'''.
#In the '''Mark as pending payment?''' pop-up window, in the '''Type of payment expected''' box, leave ''Cash on Delivery (COD)'' and click '''Create order'''.

You have selected the ''Cash on Delivery (COD)'' payment option, because it is the only manual option that you have configured in the [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_Shopify_Initial_Configuration_Set_Up_Shopify_Store_Activity|Initial Configuration: To Set Up a Shopify Store] activity.
==Step 9: Importing the Sales Order Data to Acumatica ERP==
To import sales orders from the Shopify store to Acumatica ERP, do the following:[anchor|#_046d43c1-faa1-4b57-9d20-0fbc7574f087]
#Sign in to Acumatica ERP by using the ''gibbs'' login.
#Open the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_50_10_00|Prepare Data] ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) form.
#In the '''Store''' box, select the Shopify store with which you are synchronizing data.
#In the '''Prepare Mode''' box, select ''Incremental''.
#In the table, select the unlabeled check box in the row of the ''Sales Order'' entity, and on the form toolbar, click '''Prepare'''.
#In the '''Processing''' dialog box, which opens, review the results of the processing, and click '''Close''' to close the dialog box. 
#Click the link in the '''Prepared Records''' (which shows ''1'' because you have created only one sales order in the Shopify store) in the row of the ''Sales Order'' entity.
#On the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_50_15_00|Process Data] form, which opens with your store and the ''Sales Order'' entity selected in the Selection area, select the unlabeled check box in the only row, and on the form toolbar, click '''Process'''.
#In the '''Processing''' dialog box, which opens, review the results of the processing, and click '''Close''' to close the dialog box.

==Step 10: Reviewing the Synchronization Status of the Imported Data==
To review the synchronization status of the order you imported in the previous step, do the following:[anchor|#_4df27816-c3e5-4c02-9931-e8990cae8c87]
#Open the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_30_10_00|Sync History] ([~/?ScreenId=BC301000|BC301000]) form.
#In the Selection area of the form, select the following settings:
#*'''Store''': The Shopify store with which you are syncing data
#*'''Entity''': Leave empty
#:Notice that when the ''Sales Order'' entity was synchronized, the following data related to the order has been imported:
#*Customer: ''Larry Coleman'' (see the '''Local ID''' column in the row of the ''Customer'' entity)
#*Customer Location: The address and contact details you specified in Step 8 (see the '''Local ID''' column in the row of the ''Customer Location'' entity)

==Step 11: Reviewing the Imported Sales Order==
To review the details of the imported sales order, do the following:
#While you are still viewing the synchronization results on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_30_10_00|Sync History] ([~/?ScreenId=BC301000|BC301000]) form, click the link in the '''Local ID''' column for the sales order you imported.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, which opens in a pop-up window, review the details of the order.
#:In the Summary area, notice the following:
#*The imported order has the ''EO'' type, which is configured on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_10|Shopify Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201010|BC201010]) form to be assigned to all sales orders imported from Shopify by default.
#*In the '''External Reference''' box, the number of the order in the online store and the name of the store are displayed.
#*The '''Date''' of the sales order is the same as the date on which the sales order was created in the Shopify store.
#*In the '''Description''' box, the store name, the order number and the payment status are displayed.
#*The '''Customer''' and '''Location''' boxes display the information about the customer and customer location that were created in Acumatica ERP during the import of the sales order in Step 10; both were created during the order placement in the Shopify store in Step 8.
#:On the '''Document Details''' tab, review the only line in the table. Notice the following:
#*The '''Branch''' is set to ''RETAIL'', which is the default branch configured for the Shopify store (that is, this branch was configured to appear on sales orders imported from the Shopify store on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_10|Shopify Stores] form).
#*The inventory ID, quantity, unit price, and extended price of the item are exactly the same as the values on the order in the Shopify store.

==Step 12: Creating a Shipment for the Imported Order==
To create a shipment for the order, do the following:[anchor|#_36b7c5d3-f122-43bb-a0a2-5ef167736e6b]
#While you are still viewing the sales order that you imported from the Shopify store on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, on the form toolbar, click '''Create Shipment'''.
#In the '''Specify Shipment Parameters''' dialog box, which opens, make sure the current date and the ''WHOLESALE'' warehouse are selected, and click '''OK'''. The system creates a shipment and opens it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form.

==Step 13: Confirming the Shipment for the Imported Order==
To confirm the shipment for the order, do the following:[anchor|#_8617e284-ae55-4d34-86b0-f192b3eceb6c]
#While you are viewing the shipment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form, review the line on the '''Document Details''' tab. Make sure that the correct order line is included in the shipment and that the shipped quantity is equal to the ordered quantity.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Confirm Shipment'''.

The shipment is assigned the ''Confirmed'' status.
==Step 14: Synchronizing the Shipment with the Shopify Store==
To synchronize with the Shopify store the shipment that you created and confirmed in Steps 12 and 13, do the following:[anchor|#_9df55d31-9a38-4714-888a-b91de37021e5]
#On the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_50_10_00|Prepare Data] ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) form, do the following:
##In the Selection area, select the following settings: 
##*'''Store''': The name of the Shopify store with which you are synchronizing data
##*'''Fetch Mode''': ''Incremental''
##In the table, select the unlabeled check box for the ''Shipment'' entity.
##On the form toolbar, click '''Prepare'''.
##In the '''Processing''' dialog box, which opens, review the results of the processing, and click '''Close''' when the processing has completed.
#Click the link in the '''Prepared Records''' (which shows ''1'' because only one shipment has been created) in the row of the ''Shipment'' entity.
#On the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_50_15_00|Process Data] ([~/?ScreenId=BC501500|BC501500]) form, which opens with the Shopify store and the ''Shipment'' entity selected, in the only row of the table, select the unlabeled check box and on the form toolbar, click '''Process'''.
#In the '''Processing''' dialog box, which opens, review the results of the processing, and click '''Close''' to close the dialog box.

==Step 15: Reviewing the Updated Order in Shopify==
To check whether the shipment and the updated order have been imported to the Shopify store correctly, do the following:[anchor|#_3d2cc06d-528c-4abc-bbbf-1b4954fc87af]
#On the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_30_10_00|Sync History] ([~/?ScreenId=BC301000|BC301000]) form.
#On the '''Synchronized''' tab, click the link in the '''External ID''' column in the row of the only synchronized shipment.
#On the order page of the Shopify store, which opens in a new browser tab, notice that the status of the order is now ''Fulfilled''.

You have now performed the first manual synchronization of products, sales orders, and shipments.]]></column>

Finally, you will create a shipment for the order in  Acumatica ERP and synchronize the created shipment with the Shopify store.  The following activity is             based on the  U100  dataset. If you are using another dataset, or if any system             settings have been changed in  U100 , these changes can affect the workflow of the             activity and the results of the processing. To avoid any issues, restore the  U100              dataset to its initial state. Story Suppose that you are an implementation consultant helping the SweetLife Fruits &                 Jams company to set up an online store. You have completed the minimum initial                 configuration of the integration with Shopify and now want to explore how                 synchronization works. You will configure synchronization for and then synchronize a                 subset of stock items that are maintained in  Acumatica ERP (stock items of the  Jam  item class) with the Shopify store, where the term                      products  describes what are called  items  in  Acumatica ERP. You will then perform a test purchase of one of the synchronized products and                 explore how the online order is processed in the Shopify store and in  Acumatica ERP. Process Overview In this activity, you will perform the following steps: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form of  Acumatica ERP, you will review the stock items that need to be exported to the Shopify                     store. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) Entities (BC202000) form, you will configure the                     filtering options for the  Stock Item  entity to include in the                     synchronization only the stock items of the  Jam  item class. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) Prepare Data (BC201000) form, you will start the data                     preparation process for the  Stock Item  entity to prepare out-of-sync data                     for export. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC301000|BC301000]) Sync History (BC301000) form, you will review the                     result of the data preparation process. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501500|BC501500]) Process Data (BC501500) form, you will start data                     processing for the  Stock Item  entity to save the synchronized product                     data in the Shopify store. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC301000|BC301000]) Sync History form, you will review the results of data                     processing. In the Shopify store, you will review the products that have been imported from                          Acumatica ERP. By using the storefront, you will purchase one of the products that have been                     imported from  Acumatica ERP                     ( a                     jar of jam ) and place an order. In the admin area of the store, you will review the order details. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) Prepare Data form of  Acumatica ERP, you will start the data preparation process for the  Sales Order                      entity to prepare out-of-sync order data for import. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501500|BC501500]) Process Data form, you will synchronize the prepared                     sales order data. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC301000|BC301000]) Sync History form, you will review the results of data                     synchronization. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, you will review the                     details of the imported sales order. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders form, you will create a shipment for the                     imported order. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) form, you will confirm the                     shipment. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) Prepare Data form, you will start both the data                     preparation process for the  Shipment  entity. In the admin area of the Shopify store, you will review the updated order                     details and the shipment exported from  Acumatica ERP. System Preparation Do the following: Make sure that the following prerequisites have been met: The Shopify store has been created and configured, as described in  Initial Configuration: To Set Up a Shopify Store. The connection to the Shopify store has been established and the initial                             configuration has been performed, as described in  Initial Configuration: To Establish and Configure the Store Connection. Launch the  Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as an administrator by using the  gibbs  username                     and  123  password. Step 1: Finding and Reviewing the Stock Items to Be Sold Online To find and review the stock items that will be sold online, do the following: Open the Stock Items (IN2025PL) form. Filter the stock items to display only the items of the  Jam  item class as                     follows:  In the  Item Class  column, click the column                             header. In the menu that opens, select the  Equals  filter condition. In the box at the bottom of the menu, type                              Jam . Click  OK  to apply the filter. Now all stock items of the  Jam  item class are displayed. Notice                         how many items are in the class; scan the list so you are familiar with the                         stock items that you need to export to the Shopify store. Step 2: Configuring the Export of a Subset of Stock Items To configure the  Stock Item  entity to export to the Shopify store only stock                 items of the  Jam  item class, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) Entities (BC202000) form. In the  Store  box, select the Shopify store with which you                     want to synchronize data. In the  Entity  box, select  Stock Item . Notice                         that this entity can only be exported to the Shopify store (that is,                              Sync Direction  is set to  Export ), and that                         only two tabs,  Export Mapping  and  Export                             Filtering , are displayed. To create a filtering condition for stock items, on the  Export                         Filtering  tab, click  Add Row  on the table                     toolbar, and specify the following settings in the row: Active : Selected Field Name :  Item Class Condition :  Equals Value :  Jam On the form toolbar, click  Save  to save your                         changes. Now when you synchronize the  Stock Item  entity, only the                         stock items of the  Jam  item class that you reviewed in Step 1 will be                         exported to the Shopify store. Filtering rules are not applied to                         data that has already been synchronized. For example, if you synchronize the                              Stock Item  entity without filters, apply the filter described                         above, and run the synchronization again, all previously synchronized stock                         items will remain synchronized. Step 3: Preparing the Product Data for Synchronization To prepare product (item) data that needs to be synchronized to the Shopify store, do                 the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) Prepare Data (BC201000) form. In the  Store  box, select the Shopify store with which you                     want to synchronize data. In the  Prepare Mode  box, select                          Incremental . This setting controls which data will be loaded.                              Incremental  indicates that the system will load only the data                         that has been modified since the previous data preparation. Because you                         start the preparation process for the first time, all data will be                         prepared. In the table, select the unlabeled check box in the row of the  Stock Item                      entity, and on the form toolbar, click  Prepare . In the  Processing  dialog box, which opens, review the                     results of the processing and click  Close  to close the                     dialog box. Notice that the  Prepared Records  and                              Processed Records  columns now show the number of                         records (stock items) that have been prepared and are ready to be                         synchronized, and the number of records that have been processed. Step 4: Reviewing the Results of Data Preparation To review the results of preparation of product data for synchronization, do the                 following: While you are still viewing the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) Prepare Data (BC201000) form,                     click the link in the  Processed Records  in the row of the                          Stock Item  entity. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC301000|BC301000]) Sync History (BC501500) form, which opens in a new                     window with your Shopify store and the  Stock Item  entity selected in the                     Selection area, on the  Filtered  tab, review the                     synchronization records.  Notice that all synchronization records have the                              Filtered  status and are excluded from synchronization based on                         the filtering conditions that you have configured in Step 2. On the  Pending & Failed  tab, notice that the table                     lists only synchronization records with the  Pending  status, which                     indicates that these records have been prepared and are now ready to be                         synchronized. For each of these items, the  Local ID                          column displays a link that you can click to open the item on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form. The text of the link                         corresponds to the description of the stock item on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form. The  External ID                          column, which corresponds to the identifier of the product in the Shopify                         store, however, does not display any values because the stock items have not                         yet been exported to the Shopify store. Step 5: Processing the Prepared Product Data To process the prepared product data (that is, to synchronize it with the Shopify                 store), do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501500|BC501500]) Process Data (BC501500) form. In the Selection area, select the following settings: Store : The Shopify store with which you are                             syncing data Entity :  Stock Item The table displays only the list of the out-of-sync stock items (that                         is, the items with the  Pending  status) that you reviewed in Step                         4. On the form toolbar, click  Process All  to synchronize all                     records displayed on the form. In the  Processing  dialog box, review the results of the                     processing and click  Close  to close the dialog box. Step 6: Reviewing the Synchronization Status of the Product Data To again review the synchronization status of the product data, do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC301000|BC301000]) Sync History (BC501500) form. In the Selection area of the form, select the following settings: Store : The Shopify store with which you are                             syncing data Entity :  Stock Item Open the  Synchronized  tab. The tab shows the list of                         items that have been synchronized with the Shopify store. For each item,                         there is now a product identifier in the  External ID                          column. You can click the link in this column to open the product in the                         control panel of your Shopify store. In the table, the  Last                             Operation  value has changed to  Inserted Externally                          and the time stamp in the  Last Attempt  column has                         changed to the date and time when you ran data processing on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501500|BC501500]) Process Data (BC501500) form in Step 5. Step 7: Viewing an Exported Product in the Shopify Store To view the  ORJAM32  stock item (which has the description  Orange jam 32                     oz ), which has been exported, in the Shopify store, do the following: While you are still viewing the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC301000|BC301000]) Sync History (BC501500) form,                     click the link in the  External ID  column in the row of                     the synchronization record for the  Orange jam 32 oz  item. The product                         management page for the  Orange jam 32 oz  product (which is a page in                         the admin area of the Shopify store where you manage details of a particular                         product) opens in a new browser window. If you are not signed in to the                         Shopify store as the store owner, you will need to enter your sign-in                         credentials. On the product management page, review the product data that has been exported                     to the Shopify store. Step 8: Purchasing a Jar of Apple Jam To create an order for five 32-ounce jars of apple jam from the Shopify admin area,                 do the following: While you are still signed in to the admin area of your Shopify store, in the                     left menu, click  Orders . On the  Orders  page, which opens, in the top right, click                          Create order . On the  Create order  page, which opens, in the                          Order details  section, start typing  Apple                         jam  in the search bar. In the list of search results, which are shown in a pop-up window, select                          Apple jam 32 oz , and click  Add to order . In the row of the  Apple jam 32 oz  product, change the quantity to                          5 . In the  Find or create a customer  section, click in the                     search bar and in the menu that opens, select  Create a new                         customer . In the  Create a new customer  pop-up window, fill in the                     boxes as follows: First name :  Larry Last name :  Coleman Email :                              larry@example.com Company :  Plan Smart                                 Partner Phone number :                              917-552-8969 Address :  1970 Duncan                                 Avenue City :  New York Country/Region :  United States State :  New York Postal Code :  10016 In the  Accept Payment  section, click  Mark as                         Pending . In the  Mark as pending payment?  pop-up window, in the                          Type of payment expected  box, leave  Cash on                         Delivery (COD)  and click  Create order . You have selected the  Cash on Delivery (COD)  payment option, because it is the                 only manual option that you have configured in the  Initial Configuration: To Set Up a Shopify Store                 activity. Step 9: Importing the Sales Order Data to  Acumatica ERPTo import sales orders from the Shopify store to  Acumatica ERP, do the following: Sign in to  Acumatica ERP by using the  gibbs  login. Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) Prepare Data (BC201000) form. In the  Store  box, select the Shopify store with which you                     are synchronizing data. In the  Prepare Mode  box, select  Incremental . In the table, select the unlabeled check box in the row of the  Sales                         Order  entity, and on the form toolbar, click                          Prepare . In the  Processing  dialog box, which opens, review the                     results of the processing, and click  Close  to close the                     dialog box.  Click the link in the  Prepared Records  (which shows                          1  because you have created only one sales order in the Shopify store)                     in the row of the  Sales Order  entity. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501500|BC501500]) Process Data form, which opens with your store and the                          Sales Order  entity selected in the Selection area, select the                     unlabeled check box in the only row, and on the form toolbar, click                          Process . In the  Processing  dialog box, which opens, review the                     results of the processing, and click  Close  to close the                     dialog box. Step 10: Reviewing the Synchronization Status of the Imported Data To review the synchronization status of the order you imported in the previous step,                 do the following: Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC301000|BC301000]) Sync History (BC501500) form. In the Selection area of the form, select the following settings: Store : The Shopify store with which you are                             syncing data Entity : Leave empty Notice that when the  Sales Order  entity was synchronized, the                         following data related to the order has been imported: Customer:  Larry Coleman  (see the  Local ID                              column in the row of the  Customer  entity) Customer Location: The address and contact details you specified in Step                             8 (see the  Local ID  column in the row of the                                  Customer Location  entity) Step 11: Reviewing the Imported Sales Order To review the details of the imported sales order, do the following: While you are still viewing the synchronization results on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC301000|BC301000]) Sync History (BC501500) form, click the link in the                          Local ID  column for the sales order you                     imported. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, which opens in a pop-up                     window, review the details of the order. In the Summary area, notice the                         following: The imported order has the  EO  type, which is configured on the                                   ([~/?ScreenId=BC201010|BC201010]) Shopify Stores (BC201010) form to be assigned to                             all sales orders imported from Shopify by default. In the  External Reference  box, the number of the                             order in the online store and the name of the store are displayed. The  Date  of the sales order is the same as the                             date on which the sales order was created in the Shopify store. In the  Description  box, the store name, the order                             number and the payment status are displayed. The  Customer  and  Location                              boxes display the information about the customer and customer location                             that were created in  Acumatica ERP during the import of the sales order in Step 10; both were created                             during the order placement in the Shopify store in Step 8. On the  Document Details  tab, review the only line                         in the table. Notice the following: The  Branch  is set to  RETAIL , which is the                             default branch configured for the Shopify store (that is, this branch                             was configured to appear on sales orders imported from the Shopify store                             on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC201010|BC201010]) Shopify Stores form). The inventory ID, quantity, unit price, and extended price of the item                             are exactly the same as the values on the order in the Shopify                             store. Step 12: Creating a Shipment for the Imported Order To create a shipment for the order, do the following: While you are still viewing the sales order that you imported from the Shopify                     store on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, on the form                     toolbar, click  Create Shipment . In the  Specify Shipment Parameters  dialog box, which                     opens, make sure the current date and the  WHOLESALE  warehouse are                     selected, and click  OK . The system creates a shipment and                     opens it on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) form. Step 13: Confirming the Shipment for the Imported Order To confirm the shipment for the order, do the following: While you are viewing the shipment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments                     (SO302000) form, review the line on the  Document Details                      tab. Make sure that the correct order line is included in the shipment and that                     the shipped quantity is equal to the ordered quantity. On the form toolbar, click  Confirm Shipment . The shipment is assigned the  Confirmed  status. Step 14: Synchronizing the Shipment with the Shopify Store To synchronize with the Shopify store the shipment that you created and confirmed in                 Steps 12 and 13, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) Prepare Data (BC501000) form, do the following: In the Selection area, select the following settings:  Store : The name of the Shopify store with                                     which you are synchronizing data Fetch Mode :  Incremental In the table, select the unlabeled check box for the  Shipment                              entity. On the form toolbar, click  Prepare . In the  Processing  dialog box, which opens, review                             the results of the processing, and click  Close                              when the processing has completed. Click the link in the  Prepared Records  (which shows                          1  because only one shipment has been created) in the row of the                          Shipment  entity. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC501500|BC501500]) Process Data (BC501500) form, which opens with the                     Shopify store and the  Shipment  entity selected, in the only row of the                     table, select the unlabeled check box and on the form toolbar, click                          Process . In the  Processing  dialog box, which opens, review the                     results of the processing, and click  Close  to close the                     dialog box. Step 15: Reviewing the Updated Order in Shopify To check whether the shipment and the updated order have been imported to the Shopify                 store correctly, do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC301000|BC301000]) Sync History (BC301000) form. On the  Synchronized  tab, click the link in the                          External ID  column in the row of the only                     synchronized shipment. On the order page of the Shopify store, which opens in a new browser tab, notice                     that the status of the order is now  Fulfilled . You have now performed the first manual synchronization of products, sales orders,                 and shipments. ]]></column>

 Acumatica ERP Commerce                         Edition provides flexible tools that you can use to prepare the data for synchronization with your Shopify store and configure the synchronization settings.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn the following:[anchor|#_c3b3e44e-5083-4e42-adcf-83f11b49a357]
*How to filter data that needs to be synchronized between Acumatica ERP and the Shopify store
*How to configure mapping of standard and custom fields that need to be synchronized
*How to update stock items and non-stock items with e-commerce-related data

==Applicable Scenarios==
You might want to configure additional mapping if you have defined custom fields in Acumatica ERP, in the Shopify store, or in both systems, and you want these fields to be synchronized between the two systems. For example, you might want to define an extra field on the customer registration form in the online store and map this field to a user-defined field or an attribute in a customer record in Acumatica ERP.{br}

Filtering is useful if you do not want to synchronize all data of a particular entity. For example, you might want to define a subset of items in Acumatica ERP (which are referred to as ''products'' in Shopify) that you want to export to the online store, or exclude from export the customers that have incomplete information in Acumatica ERP (that is, the customers that have the ''On Hold'' status).{br}

You might want to update e-commerce-related information about items in Acumatica ERP if you want to override default inventory settings related to export that have been configured for the store on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_10|Shopify Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201010|BC201010]) form or if you want to maintain all product data, e-commerce-related or otherwise, in one system.[anchor|#_50c53db5-087a-457f-be16-c28de249b07c]
==Configuration of Synchronization Preferences==
During the initial configuration of the connection between Acumatica ERP and the Shopify store, you determine which of the entities supported by the Shopify connector need to be synchronized between the two systems. To do this, you select the '''Active''' check box for each required entity on the '''Entity Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_10|Shopify Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201010|BC201010]) form. On this tab, you can also configure the following:[anchor|#_b4f99531-bd47-4b78-be8f-a603e1279e4a]
*The direction of the synchronization. For each entity, you specify whether data should be exported to Shopify, imported to Acumatica ERP, or synchronized in both directions.
*The primary system. You indicate which of the systems, ''Local'' (that is, Acumatica ERP) or ''External'' (that is, Shopify), should be used as the source of data if conflicts occur during the synchronization of a particular entity.
*The real-time synchronization mode. You indicate whether the synchronization records for a particular entity should be processed immediately after the data is prepared by selecting either of the following options:
**''Prepare'': As soon as a push notification about a change to data is received, the corresponding synchronization record is placed in the processing queue.
**''Prepare & Process'': As soon as a push notification about a change to data is received, the corresponding synchronization record is placed in the processing queue, and data processing is immediately started for the synchronization record.
*The number of attempts when an error occurs. You specify the number of times the system will try to process the synchronization records before excluding them from further synchronization attempts.

You can also change these settings for each particular entity by using the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) form.
==Filtering and Field Mapping for Export and Import==
For some of the entities supported by the e-commerce connector, on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) form, you can configure the additional synchronization settings—for example, define a filter to be applied during the synchronization of entity data, or define a new mapping between the fields in Acumatica ERP and the fields in Shopify. You define filters and mappings for the import and export processes on the following tabs:[anchor|#_1c822ccc-4c97-45b6-b1dd-9bc1248a8ddb]
*Filtering for import: '''Import Filtering''' tab
*Filtering for export: '''Export Filtering''' tab
*Mapping for import: '''Import Mapping''' tab
*Mapping for export: '''Export Mapping''' tab

The display of the listed tabs is determined by the entity selected in the Summary area. The table below shows the availability of filtering and mapping functionality for particular entities.[anchor|#_91956937-cd35-4125-91d1-fe8516c7108c]

In this topic, you will learn how you can define export and import filtering settings.{br}{TOC}
==Export Filtering==
You can configure the rules according to which data from Acumatica ERP should or should not be exported to the online store by using the '''Export Filtering''' tab of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) form. {br}

To define a filter, you need to specify at least one filtering condition. Each condition includes the following components:[anchor|#_628eed0b-551f-497c-95b8-5dc36b6df3bb]
*'''Field Name''': The data field by which data needs to be filtered. The list of options you can select from depends on the selected entity.
*'''Condition''': The logical operation to apply to the value of the selected data field.
*'''Value''': The value you enter for the logical condition used to filter the data, if the selected condition requires a value.
*'''Value 2''': The second value for the logical condition, if the selected logical condition requires a second value. For example, the ''Is Between'' logical condition requires a second value. 

A filter may contain multiple simple conditions or lines combined into one logical expression with brackets and logical operators (''And'' and ''Or'').{br}

'''Example'''{br}

Suppose that you want to maintain customers of a particular customer class, ''INTL'', only in Acumatica ERP, and you want to exclude such customers from synchronization with the Shopify store. To do this, you select the ''Customer'' entity in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] form, and on the '''Export Filtering''' tab, you specify the condition corresponding to the settings shown in the following table.[anchor|#_dbeebe71-d3aa-4e47-8877-dfbda398c7a4]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%"

|- 
| Selected
| -
| ''Customer Class''
|  ''Does Not Equal''
| <tt>INTL</tt>
| Empty

| ''And''
|}
The particular fields that you can select in the '''Field Name''' column depend on the selected entity.((({S:Warn}If you change the export filter settings after an export has been completed, the synchronization records that have been previously processed and are no longer included in the filter, will remain synchronized but will be assigned the ''Filtered'' status. 
)))
==Import Filtering==
You can configure the rules according to which data from the online store should or should not be imported into Acumatica ERP by using the '''Import Filtering''' tab of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) form.{br}

To define a filter, you need to specify at least one filtering condition. Each condition includes the following components:[anchor|#_521f408c-1288-4921-b036-d6653022e688]
*'''Field Name''': The data field by which data needs to be filtered. The list of options you can select from depends on the selected entity.
*'''Condition''': The logical operation to apply to the value of the selected data field.
*'''Value''': The value you enter for the logical condition used to filter the data, if the selected condition requires a value.
*'''Value 2''': The second value for the logical condition, if the selected logical condition requires a second value. For example, the ''Is Between'' logical condition requires a second value. 

A filter may contain multiple simple conditions or lines combined into one logical expression with brackets and logical operators (''And'' and ''Or'').{br}

'''Example'''{br}

Suppose that you do not want to import into Acumatica ERP orders placed in the online store by a particular customer, Morning Cafe. To do this, you select the ''Order'' entity in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] form, and on the '''Import Filtering''' tab, you specify the condition corresponding to the settings shown in the following table.[anchor|#_8c2ba6c9-5934-45c4-886c-a0a7101fdbe6]

The      list of options you can select from depends on the selected entity. Condition : The logical operation to apply to the value of the      selected data field. Value : The value you enter for the logical condition used to filter      the data, if the selected condition requires a value. Value 2 : The second value for the logical condition, if the selected      logical condition requires a second value. For example, the  Is Between  logical condition      requires a second value.  A filter may contain multiple simple conditions or lines combined into one logical expression     with brackets and logical operators ( And  and  Or ). Example Suppose that you want to maintain customers of a particular customer class,  INTL , only     in  Acumatica ERP,     and you want to exclude such customers from synchronization with the Shopify store. To do this,     you select the  Customer  entity in the Summary area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) Entities     form, and on the  Export Filtering  tab, you specify the condition     corresponding to the settings shown in the following table. Active Brackets Field Name Condition Value Value 2 Brackets Operator Selected - Customer Class Does Not Equal INTL Empty - And The particular fields that you can select in the  Field Name  column     depend on the selected entity. If you change the export filter settings after an export has been completed, the     synchronization records that have been previously processed and are no longer included in the     filter, will remain synchronized but will be assigned the  Filtered  status.     Import Filtering You can configure the rules according to which data from the online store should or should not     be imported into  Acumatica ERP     by using the  Import Filtering  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) Entities     (BC202000) form. To define a filter, you need to specify at least one filtering condition. Each condition     includes the following components: Field Name : The data field by which data needs to be filtered. The      list of options you can select from depends on the selected entity. Condition : The logical operation to apply to the value of the      selected data field. Value : The value you enter for the logical condition used to filter      the data, if the selected condition requires a value. Value 2 : The second value for the logical condition, if the selected      logical condition requires a second value. For example, the  Is Between  logical condition      requires a second value.  A filter may contain multiple simple conditions or lines combined into one logical expression     with brackets and logical operators ( And  and  Or ). Example Suppose that you do not     want to import into  Acumatica ERP     orders placed in the online store by a particular customer, Morning Cafe.  To     do this, you select the  Order  entity in the Summary area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) Entities form, and on the  Import Filtering  tab, you     specify the condition corresponding to the settings shown in the following table. Active Brackets Field Name Condition Value Value 2 Brackets Operator Selected - Customer Does Not Equal Morning Cafe Empty - And The particular fields that you can select in the  Field Name  column     depend on the selected entity. If you change the import filter settings after an import has been completed, the     synchronization records that have been previously processed and are no longer included in the     filter, will remain synchronized but will be assigned the  Filtered     status. ]]></column>

In this topic, you will learn how you can map fields between Acumatica ERP and Shopify to override the standard field mapping or define an additional mapping to suit your synchronization requirements.{br}{TOC}
==Mapping of Fields for Export==
 Acumatica ERP Commerce                         Edition provides you with the ability to map fields, which are related to synchronized entities, in Acumatica ERP with fields in the Shopify store. You can define additional mappings of standard or custom fields as well as override the standard mappings provided with the Shopify integration.{br}

You define the mappings of fields that should be processed during the export of data from Acumatica ERP to Shopify on the '''Export Mapping''' tab of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) form. During the export process, data from the specified fields is fetched and processed according to the defined mappings.{br}

To map two fields that will be processed during the export process, you specify values in the following columns:[anchor|#_c119d62b-565d-4eec-8288-0549f3159dd6]
*'''Target Object''': An object in the e-commerce system, which is a related set of fields, for the entity. The list of objects available for selection depends on the entity selected in the Summary area.
*'''Target Field''': A field related to the selected target object. The fields that are displayed in the list depend on the selected object.
*'''Source Object''': An Acumatica ERP object, which is a related set of fields, for the entity. The list of objects available for selection depends on the entity selected in the Summary area.
*'''Source Field / Value''': A field related to the selected source object. The fields that are displayed in the list depend on the selected object. In this field, you can also define a particular value for the mapped field.

 Acumatica ERP Commerce                         Edition provides you with the ability to map fields, which are related to synchronized entities, in Acumatica ERP with fields in Shopify. You can define additional mappings of standard or custom fields, as well as override the standard mappings provided with the Shopify integration.{br}

You define the mappings of fields that should be processed during the import of data from Shopify to Acumatica ERP on the '''Import Mapping''' tab of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) form. During the import process, data from the specified fields is pulled and processed according to the defined mappings.{br}

==Auto-Mapping of Fields==
When configuring the mapping of fields of the ''Stock Item'', ''Non-Stock Item'', and ''Template Item'' entities, instead of selecting a particular target field, you can type <tt>&lt;&lt;Auto&#95;Mapping&gt;&gt;</tt> in the '''Target Field''' column. During the synchronization process, the system looks for a field similar to the source field and does one of the following:[anchor|#_552e7a97-61fe-4cc3-9aa7-b562f727fb14]
*If the field is found, maps it to the source field
*If the field is not found, creates a new text field in the e-commerce system with the same name as that of the source field
((({S:Warn}If ''&lt;&lt;Auto&#95;Mapping&gt;&gt;'' is entered in the target field, you cannot use a formula in the source field.

==Removing Standard Mapping for a Field==
You can remove the mapping for fields that you do not want to be synchronized between Acumatica ERP and the external system. You perform the unmapping for import and export directions separately as follows:[anchor|#_9094e019-3986-4b0c-bd9b-893d40b19f12]
#On the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_20_00|Entities] ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000]) form, you select the store and the entity for which you want to modify field mapping.
#Depending on the synchronization direction, you do one of the following:
#*To remove the mapping from an Acumatica ERP field so that it is not used during the import, on the '''Import Mapping''' tab, you select the needed values in the '''Target Object''' and '''Target Field''' columns, and then in the '''Source Object''' column, you select ''&lt;&lt;Unmap&gt;&gt;''.
#*To remove the mapping from a field in the external e-commerce system so that it is not used during the export, on the '''Export Mapping''' tab, you select the needed values in the '''Target Object''' and '''Target Field''' columns, and then in the '''Source Object''' column, you select ''&lt;&lt;Unmap&gt;&gt;''.
#:During the synchronization, the system will not pull data from the unmapped fields or record data to these fields.

You can import to Acumatica ERPc refunds issued to customers in your Shopify store.{br}{TOC}
==Learning Objectives==
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:[anchor|#ul_dmx_2lv_pr]
*Configure the import of Shopify refunds in Acumatica ERPc
*Import refunds from the Shopify store

==Applicable Scenarios==
You import refunds from Shopify to Acumatica ERPc to accurately keep track of refunded payments and restocked items. You may issue refunds in the Shopify store in the following cases:[anchor|#_7165d0ed-fbf9-4bca-b563-a0155c7a9310]
*A customer has been overcharged in error and part of the order amount needs to be refunded.
*A customer has not received the purchased item or has received an excessive quantity of the item.
*A customer has received the purchased item but is not satisfied with its quality or performance and wants to return it.

==Configuration of Refund Import==
To configure the import of refunds from the Shopify store to Acumatica ERPc, the user needs to perform the following general steps:[anchor|#_221b5a81-971b-406c-9327-baf2e1152553]
#On the '''Entity Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_10|Shopify Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201010|BC201010]) form, activate the ''Refund'' entity.
#On the '''Order Settings''' tab, specify settings in the following boxes:
#*'''Return Order Type''': The order type, which has been created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form, that is assigned to return orders imported from the Shopify store. In this box, only order types based on the ''CR (Cash Return)'' order type template can be selected.
#*'''Refund Amount Item''': The non-stock item, which has been created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, that is used to represent imported refund amounts in sales orders and in return orders. The non-stock item selected in this box is excluded from synchronization and is not exported when the ''Non-Stock Item'' entity is synchronized. The non-stock item representing refund amounts should be exempt from taxes.
#*'''Refund Reason Code''': The reason code, which has been created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_21_10_00|Reason Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS211000|CS211000]) form, to be inserted in return orders for refunds imported from the Shopify store. In this box, only reason codes of the ''Issue'' usage type can be selected.

==Import of Refunds==
Refunds are imported from the Shopify store to Acumatica ERPc as part of the synchronization of the ''Refund'' entity, which can be synchronized only in the ''Import'' direction. During the preparation of refund data for synchronization, the system creates one synchronization record for all refunds that have been issued for a single sales order in the Shopify store.{br}

For a refund to be imported successfully, all of the following conditions must be met:[anchor|#_778c2a82-0b2e-48cd-bff3-f16919cd0f14]
*The original sales order has been synchronized.
*The original sales order must be either not shipped or shipped in full. If the sales order has been shipped partially, the refund will not be imported.
*The original payment to which the refund pertains has been imported and released.

For more information about the synchronization process, see [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_Shopify_Data_Sync_GeneralInfo|Data Synchronization: General Information]. For more information about the import of various types of refunds, see .]]></column>

Suppose that the SweetLife Fruits & Jams company sells several kinds of jams in its online store. Acting as an implementation consultant helping SweetLife to set up the integration of Acumatica ERP with the Shopify store, you want to explore how refunds issued in the Shopify store are imported to Acumatica ERP. For this purpose, you will create an order in the store, import it to Acumatica ERP, and release it. Then you will issue a refund in the store, import it to Acumatica ERP and explore the results of the import.
==Process Overview==
In this activity, you will review the settings for import refunds on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_10|Shopify Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201010|BC201010]) form. Then you will create a refund for the order you have created and imported as part of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_Shopify_Data_Sync_First_Sync|Data Synchronization: To Perform the First Synchronization] activity. After that you will import the refund by first preparing the refund data for import on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_50_10_00|Prepare Data] ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) form and then processing the prepared data on the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_50_15_00|Process Data] ([~/?ScreenId=BC501500|BC501500]) form.
==System Preparation==
Do the following:
#Make sure the connection to the Shopify store has been established and the minimum configuration has been performed, as described in [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_Shopify_Initial_Configuration_Implem_Activity|Initial Configuration: To Establish and Configure the Store Connection].
#Make sure the first synchronization has been performed as described in [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_Shopify_Data_Sync_First_Sync|Data Synchronization: To Perform the First Synchronization].
#Launch the Acumatica ERP website, and sign in as an administrator by using the ''gibbs'' username and the ''123'' password.

==Step 1: Reviewing the Settings==
To review the settings that have been configured for the import of refunds from the Shopify store, do the following:[anchor|#_fa742785-635f-4638-890f-918dff014a89]
#Open the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_10|Shopify Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201010|BC201010]) form.
#In the '''Store Name''' box, select the name of the store that you created in the [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_Shopify_Initial_Configuration_Implem_Activity|Initial Configuration: To Establish and Configure the Store Connection] activity.
#On the '''Entity Settings''' tab, notice that the '''Active''' check box has been selected for the ''Refunds'' entity.
#:You select the '''Active''' check box for an entity to indicate that the entity data needs to be synchronized between Acumatica ERP and the Shopify store.
#Open the '''Order Settings''' tab.
#:Review the following settings specified for the import of refunds: [anchor|#_e2ddd622-9a6e-43fb-a79d-948f65565837]
#*'''Return Order Type''': ''ER - eCommerce Return Order''
#*:This order type is based on the ''CR'' order template.
#*'''Refund Amount Item''': ''REFUNDAMT''
#*:This tax-exempt non-stock item is used to represent refunded amounts in documents.
#*'''Refund Reason Code''': ''EREFUND''
#*:This reason code of the ''Issue'' usage type is inserted in documents to indicate that the line represents a refund issued.

==Step 2: Issuing a Refund in the Shopify Store==
To create a refund in your Shopify store, do the following:[anchor|#_157bbfb8-a804-4c3c-b8df-06b8f140a5bc]
#Sign in to your Shopify store as the store owner.
#In the left menu, expand the '''Orders''' node and click '''Orders'''.
#On the '''Orders''' page, in the list of orders, open the order that created and imported while completing the [HelpRoot_Commerce\config_Shopify_Data_Sync_First_Sync|Data Synchronization: To Perform the First Synchronization] activity.
#On the sales order page, which opens, on the page toolbar, click '''Refund'''
#On the '''Refund''' page, in the item quantity box, specify ''1''.
#In the '''Refund Amount''' section, in the '''Manual''' box, change the current value, which is 16.6, to ''20''.
#Clear the '''Send a notification to the customer''' check box and click '''Refund $20''' button.

==Step 3: Importing the Refund==
To import the refund to Acumatica ERP, do the following:[anchor|#_d6a3a1d6-ba8b-476c-b5ab-b1888f1508b6]
#Sign in to the Acumatica ERP as an administrator with the ''gibbs'' username and ''123'' password.
#Open the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_50_10_00|Prepare Data] ([~/?ScreenId=BC501000|BC501000]) form.
#In the '''Store''' box, select the Shopify store with which you are synchronizing data.
#In the '''Prepare Mode''' box, select ''Incremental''.
#In the table, select the unlabeled check box in the row of the ''Refunds'' entity, and on the form toolbar, click '''Prepare'''.
#In the '''Processing''' dialog box, which opens, review the results of the processing, and click '''Close''' to close the dialog box. 
#Click the link in the '''Prepared Records''' (which shows ''1'' because you have created only one sales order in the Shopify store) in the row of the ''Refunds'' entity.
#On the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_50_15_00|Process Data] form, which opens with your store and the ''Refunds'' entity selected in the Selection area, select the unlabeled check box in the only row, and on the form toolbar, click '''Process'''.
#In the '''Processing''' dialog box, which opens, review the results of the processing, and click '''Close''' to close the dialog box.

==Step 4: Reviewing the Results of the Import==
To review how the refund has been imported to, do the following:[anchor|#_9f1c4112-4096-4dc5-a3ef-87486ef4fc3d]
#On the ''Sales Orders (SO3010PL)'' form, open the return order of the ''ER'' type.
#:Because the original sales order was already completed, the return order of the ''ER'' type was created because it was selected in the '''Return Order Type''' box on the on the '''Order Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_10|Shopify Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201010|BC201010]) form, which you reviewed in Step 1.
#:Notice that in the '''External Reference''' box of the Summary area, the system inserted the identifier of the refund in the Shopify store.
#:On the '''Document Details''' tab, the system created a line with the returned item (''APJAM32'') with the quantity you specified while creating the refund in the store. Notice that in the '''Reason Code''' column, the system inserted the ''EREFUND'' reason code, which is the reason code specified in the '''Refund Reason Code''' box on the '''Order Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_10|Shopify Stores] form.
#:On the '''Document Details''' tab, the system inserted a line with the ''REFUNDAMT'' non-stock item and the manual refund amount that you added to the automatically calculated refund amount in the Shopify store.

You have now imported the refund that involved the return of the item and a partial refund of the order amount.]]></column>

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Entities Form ID:  (BC202000)  ([~/?ScreenId=BC202000|BC202000])On this form, you specify the import and export settings for entities supported by the         e-commerce connector. Additionally, you can configure filters to determine which data needs         to be synchronized or excluded from the synchronization process. You can also use this form         to define the rules for mapping  Acumatica ERP fields to fields in the          online          store—for example, to map additional standard or custom fields or to override the default         mapping. For more information about filtering and field mapping, see            Preparing Entities for Synchronization: General Information. Form Toolbar The form toolbar includes standard and form-specific buttons. For the list of standard buttons, see  Form Toolbar. The form-specific buttons are listed below. Button Description Start Real-Time Sync Enables the real-time synchronization process and sets the  Real-Time                   Export   or  Real-Time Import  status, depending                 on the selected direction of the synchronization—to  Running  for the selected                 entity. Stop Real-Time Sync Disables the real-time synchronization process and sets the                    Real-Time Export   or  Real-Time                   Import  status, depending on the selected direction of the                 synchronization—to  Stopped  for the selected entity. Clear Sync Data Opens the  Clear Sync Data  dialog box, which you can use                 to delete all synchronization information for the selected entity. Clear Sync Data Dialog Box Element Description Entity Name The name of the entity for which synchronization data needs to be                 deleted. The dialog box also contains the following                 buttons. Continue Deletes all synchronization information for the entity specified in the                    Entity Name  box. This operation cannot be undone. Cancel Closes the dialog box without deleting synchronization information. Summary Area In this area, you can select a particular entity for which you want to configure field         mapping and filtering rules that are applied when data is imported to  Acumatica ERP or exported to the BigCommerce store. The elements also display the general settings for         the selected entity. Element Connector The name of the e-commerce                 connector ,                 which                  corresponds to the platform on which the online store has been deployed. Store The name of the online                   store By default, the system inserts the store for which the                      Default  check box is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) BigCommerce Stores(BC201000) or   ([~/?ScreenId=BC201010|BC201010]) Shopify Stores                   (BC201010) form. Entity The name of the entity supported by the connector. The BigCommerce connector supports the synchronization of the following                   entities: Customer Price Class Customer Customer Location Sales Category Stock Item Non-Stock Item Template Item Base Sales Price Price List Product Image Product Availability Sales Order Payment Shipment The Shopify connector supports the synchronization of the following entities: Customer Customer Location Stock Item Non-Stock Item Template Item Product Image Product Availability Sales Order Payment Shipment Refunds Active A read-only check box that indicates (if selected) that the entity has been                 activated (that is, selected for synchronization) on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) BigCommerce Stores (BC201000)                 form                  or on the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC201010|BC201010]) Shopify Stores (BC201010) form . Sync                    Direction The direction in which the entity should be synchronized, which can be one of the                   following:  Export : Data is exported from  Acumatica ERP to the BigCommerce store. Import : Data is imported to  Acumatica ERP from the BigCommerce store. Bidirectional : Data is synchronized between  Acumatica ERP and the BigCommerce store in both directions. For the                   BigCommerce stores, the direction  of the synchronization is                   inserted by the system and cannot be changed for the following entities: Stock Item  (predefined as  Export ) Non-Stock Item  (predefined as  Export ) Template Item  (predefined as  Export ) Base Sales Price  (predefined as  Export ) Price List  (predefined as  Export ) Product Image  (predefined as  Export ) Product Availability  (predefined as  Export ) Payment  (predefined as  Import ) Shipment  (predefined as  Import ) Refunds  (predefined as  Import ) Primary System The system that is used as the source of data during the synchronization of                   entities. If bidirectional synchronization is selected for the entity, the data of                   the primary system takes precedence if any conflicts arise during the                   synchronization. The primary system can be either of the following: Local  (that is,  Acumatica ERP) External  (that is, the BigCommerce                     store                      or the Shopify store ) The primary system is determined based on the direction of the synchronization as                   follows: For  Export , the  Local  system is set to be the primary                     system. For  Import , the  External  system is set to be the primary                     system. For  Bidirectional , you can select which system should be used as the                     primary system, based on your synchronization processes. Max.                   Number of Failed Attempts The maximum number of errors that are allowed during the import or export of data                   before the synchronization record is skipped (that is, excluded from further                   synchronization). By default the system allows 5 failed attempts before excluding the                   synchronization record from further processing. Real-Time                    Import The status of real-time import for the entity.                    The                   status can be one of the                   following: Stopped : Real-time synchronization is                      not                     started  for the  Import  direction. Running : Real-time synchronization is                      started                      for the  Import  direction. Not Supported : Real-time synchronization is not supported for the                        Import  direction. Real-Time                    Export The status of real-time export for the entity.                    The                   status can be  one of the                   following: Stopped : Real-time synchronization is                      not                     started  for the  Export  direction. Running : Real-time synchronization is                      started                      for the  Export  direction. Not Supported : Real-time synchronization is not supported for the                        Export  direction. Real-Time                   Mode The mode of the processing of the synchronization records, which can be either of                   the following: Prepare : As soon as a push notification about a change to data is                     received, the corresponding synchronization record is placed in the processing                     queue. Prepare & Process : As soon as a push notification about a change to                     data is received, the corresponding synchronization record is placed in the                     processing queue, and the data synchronization process is immediately started                     for the synchronization record.

On this form, you can also set the status of         particular synchronization records to  Skipped  or  Synchronized , or delete         synchronization records. Form Toolbar The form toolbar includes standard and form-specific buttons. For the list of standard buttons, see  Form Toolbar. The form-specific buttons are listed below. Button Description Sync Starts the data synchronization process for the synchronization records that                 have been selected in the                   table. This                   button launches forced synchronization. That is, even if the record is already has                   a status of  Synchronized , the system synchronizes it again, with the data                   in the primary system (the system used as the source of data) taking                   precedence. Delete Deletes the synchronization record from the table on the tab. Skip Sets the status of the selected synchronization records (that is, the records for                   which the unlabeled check box is selected) to  Skipped , which excludes the                   records from further synchronization, and removes the synchronization record from                   the table. Skipped records are listed on the  Skipped  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=BC301000|BC301000]) Sync History (BC301000) form. Set Synced Sets the status of the selected synchronization records (that is, those for                 which you have selected the unlabeled check box) to  Synchronized , updates the                 date and time of the last synchronization with the current date and time for the                 records, and sets the  Last Operation  to  Manually                   Synchronized  for the selected records. Add New Opens the  Add or Edit Sync Status  dialog box for adding                 a new synchronization record.

This topic provides reference information about the standard filtering and field mapping used for the ''Customer'' entity during the synchronization between Acumatica ERP and BigCommerce. The topic also contains information about the merging of duplicate records during the synchronization.{br}{TOC}
==Customer Filtering==
During the export of the ''Customer'' entity from Acumatica ERP, the guest customer account—which is the account selected in the '''Generic Guest Customer''' box on the '''Customer Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_00|BigCommerce Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) form—is excluded from synchronization.
==Merging of Duplicates==
During the synchronization of the ''Customer'' entity (for both the ''Export'' direction and the ''Import'' direction), a customer record in the source system is merged with an existing customer record in the target system if both records have the same email address.
==Customer Export Mapping==
The following table shows the mapping of Acumatica ERP fields to BigCommerce fields that is used during the export of customer data to BigCommerce.[anchor|#_025ea359-2c67-4e2c-8605-d99b6589495a]

This topic provides reference information about the standard filtering and field mapping used for the ''Sales Order'' entity during the synchronization between Acumatica ERP and BigCommerce. The topic also contains information about the merging of duplicate records during the synchronization.{br}{TOC}
==Sales Order Filtering==
During the export of sales orders from Acumatica ERP, a sales order is skipped if any of the following conditions are met:[anchor|#_5c95475f-aca5-4296-8d44-aea5b4478b1d]
*A sales order is skipped if it has the ''Completed'' or ''Canceled'' status.
*A sales order is skipped if its type is not supported. Only the order types that are selected in the '''Order Type''' box and the '''Return Order Type''' boxes on the '''Order Settings''' tab ('''Order''' section) of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_00|BigCommerce Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201000|BC201000]) form are supported.
*A sales order is skipped if it is a guest order—that is, a previously imported order saved in Acumatica ERP with the generic guest customer account (the customer specified in the '''Generic Guest Customer''' box on the '''Customer Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_00|BigCommerce Stores] form) or an order that was created in Acumatica ERP for the generic guest customer.

The following filter is applied during the import of sales orders:[anchor|#_2e11fd86-672e-4981-bc11-b46942183d3c]
*A sales order is skipped if its status in BigCommerce is ''Shipped'', ''Canceled'', ''Incomplete'', ''Pending'', or ''Verification Required''.

==Merging of Duplicates==
A sales order imported from the BigCommerce store is merged with an existing sales order in Acumatica ERP if the '''ID''' of the BigCommerce order (found on the '''View orders''' page) matches the '''External Reference''' of the order, which is located on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, in Acumatica ERP.
==Sales Order Export Mapping==
The following table shows the mapping of Acumatica ERP fields to BigCommerce fields that is used during the export of sales order data to BigCommerce.

This topic provides reference information about the standard filtering and field mapping used for the ''Customer'' entity during the synchronization between Acumatica ERP and Shopify. The topic also contains information about the merging of duplicate records during the synchronization.
==Customer Filtering==
During the export of the ''Customer'' entity from Acumatica ERP, the guest customer account—which is the account selected in the '''Generic Guest Customer''' box on the '''Customer Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_Commerce\BC_20_10_10|Shopify Stores] ([~/?ScreenId=BC201010|BC201010]) form—is excluded from synchronization.
==Merging of Duplicates==
During the synchronization of the ''Customer'' entity (for both the ''Export'' direction and the ''Import'' direction), a customer record in the source system is merged with an existing customer record in the target system if both records have the same email address or the same phone number (if there is no email address).
==Customer Export Mapping==
The following table shows the mapping of Acumatica ERP fields to Shopify fields that is used during the export of customer data to Shopify.[anchor|#_4a2aebff-e76a-4548-b219-1a86e5ce0278]

This topic provides reference information about the standard filtering and field mapping used for the ''Customer Location'' entity during the synchronization between Acumatica ERP and Shopify.
==Customer Location Filtering==
Filters are applied during the export of customer locations to Shopify. A customer location is skipped if any of the following is true:[anchor|#_ebd21d4b-dbf5-41c7-aa7c-8cf96fe9d106]
*The customer location is a location of the guest customer. The guest customer is excluded from synchronization so its locations are not synchronized.
*The customer to which the customer location refers has not been synchronized.

During the import of customer locations to Acumatica ERP, the customer location is skipped if the corresponding customer has not been synchronized.

This topic provides reference information about the standard filtering and field mapping used for the ''Stock Item'' entity during the synchronization between Acumatica ERP and Shopify. The topic also contains information about the merging of duplicate records during the synchronization.
==Stock Item Filtering==
A stock item is skipped if it is a matrix item—that is, if a template is specified for the item in the '''Template ID''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. Matrix items are synchronized as part of the synchronization of template items.
==Merging of Duplicates==
During the export of stock items from Acumatica ERP, a stock item is merged with an existing product in BigCommerce if its ID in Acumatica ERP—that is, the value in the '''Inventory ID''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form—matches the '''SKU''' of the product in Shopify.
==Stock Item Export Mapping==
The following table shows the mapping of Acumatica ERP fields to Shopify fields that is used during the export of stock items to Shopify.[anchor|#_f0ef2e6a-f739-4f0d-8f78-b809f6886ad6]

This topic provides reference information about the standard filtering and field mapping used for the ''Sales Order'' entity during the synchronization between Acumatica ERP and Shopify. The topic also contains information about the merging of duplicate records during the synchronization.
==Sales Order Filtering==
During the import of sales orders, a sales order is skipped if its status in Shopify is ''Shipped'', ''Canceled'', ''Incomplete'', ''Pending'', or ''Verification Required''.
==Merging of Duplicates==
A sales order imported from the Commerce store is merged with an existing sales order in Acumatica ERP if the '''ID''' of the Shopify order (found on the '''View orders''' page) matches the '''External Reference''' of the order, which is located on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, in Acumatica ERP.
==Sales Order Import Mapping==
The following table shows the mapping of Shopify fields to Acumatica ERP fields that is used during the import of sales order data from Shopify.[anchor|#_4a792b61-2314-40f9-976d-591577b4b3bd]
