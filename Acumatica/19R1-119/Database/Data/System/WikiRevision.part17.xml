|  '''Decide which predefined order types your company will use'''
|  Decide which predefined order types you will use and which you will not use.
| 
| 
|- 
| '''2'''
|  '''Review order type settings'''
|  Use the Order Types form to review settings of each predefined order type you will use, and write down the necessary changes to settings. In particular, note the following elements: 
*'''Order Numbering Sequence''': Which sequence the system uses to give a reference number to an order of the type. Numbering sequences can be unique to each order type or shared by multiple types. 
*'''Days to Keep''': How many days an order of this type may be kept in the system before it can be deleted. 
*'''Hold Orders on Entry''': Whether all new sales orders of the type are created with the status ''On Hold''. 
*'''Hold Document on Failed Credit Check''': Whether on order creation, the customer’s credit status is checked. If the customer exceeds the credit limit or has overdue invoices, the order can be put on hold (depending on customer settings). 
*'''Require Control Total''': Whether the user needs to enter a control total for each order. The order can be processed only when the system-calculated total equals the manually entered control total. 
*'''Bill Separately''': Whether multiple orders of the type for the same customer will be billed separately by default. 
*'''Ship Separately''': Whether multiple orders of this type for the same customer will be shipped separately by default. 
*'''Calculate Freight''': Whether freight charges should be calculated for an order automatically. 
*'''Recalculate Discount on Partial Shipment''': Whether the discount for partial shipment should be recalculated anew based on shipped quantities. 
*'''Copy Notes/Attachments To Shipment/Invoice''': Whether, when a shipment or invoice is created for an order, notes or attachments of order lines are copied to the respective shipment or invoice lines.
*'''Allow Quick Processing''': Whether new orders of this order type can be quickly processed from the entry form.

| 
| 
|- 
| '''3'''
|  '''Review order type&rsquo;s Accounts Receivable settings'''
|  Review the settings in the '''Accounts Receivable Settings''' section (on the '''General Settings''' tab of the Order Types form). Note any that should be changed.
| 
| 
|- 
| '''4'''
|  '''Review posting settings of order types'''
|  For each order type you will use, review the settings in the '''Posting Settings''' section. Posting settings define which General Ledger accounts and subaccounts are updated by the orders of this type: 
* The sales revenue account and subaccount are credited by the gross invoice amount, minus taxes, volume discounts, and freight and miscellaneous charges. 
* The miscellaneous charges account and subaccount are credited by the order&rsquo;s miscellaneous charges. 
* The freight charges account and subaccount are credited by the order&rsquo;s freight amount that you bill to the customer. 
* The discount account and subaccount are debited by volume discounts applied to the whole order. Line discounts are deducted from order line amounts, which are posted to the revenue account. 

The posting settings for the order type refer to the record from which the account should be sourced. Available options can include the following: customer location, inventory item, non-stock item, warehouse, posting class, reason code, carrier, and order type. Similarly, the order type indicates the source for each segment of subaccounts: your company location, the customer location, the inventory item, the warehouse, the posting class, the carrier, the reason code, the salesperson, the employee, or the company branch. Review the General Ledger accounts and subaccounts of the chosen master records that serve as sources of accounts and subaccounts.
| 
| 
|- 
| '''5'''
|  '''Plan shipment settings'''
|  Decide upon the settings that control processing of shipments (regardless of the order or orders they are created for). These settings include the following: 
*'''Shipment Numbering Sequence''': This numbering sequence is used to assign each shipment a unique number. 
*'''Freight Allocation on Partial Shipping''': Freight charges are represented in a sales order as a single figure. If an order has multiple partial shipments, freight can be allocated to shipments (and consequently to invoices) in one of two ways, based on this setting: with the first shipment getting the full freight amount, or with each shipment getting part of the total freight (proportionally to the billing amount of the shipped goods). 
*'''Hold Shipments on Entry''': The option indicates whether new shipment should be put on Hold to prevent accidental confirmation. 
*'''Validate Shipments Total on Confirmation''': If this option is selected, the system will require independent input of shipment total quantity to verify it against shipment details. 
*'''Add Zero Lines for Items Not in Stock''': This option indicates whether sales order items should be added in the shipment even though they have no available quantity. 

| 
| 
|- 
| '''6'''
|  '''Plan global settings'''
|  Decide upon the global settings specific to the Sales Order Management module, including the following: 
*'''Default Sales Order Type''': The most common (most frequently used) order type. 
*'''Hold Invoices on Failed Credit Check''': A customer credit check is performed when each sales order is created. If it fails, the order will be put on hold and no shipment will be possible until it is released from credit hold. If the time between placement of the order and actual shipment is long, the customer’s credit situation may change. If this is a concern in your business, select this check box, and invoices created for a confirmed shipment will be automatically put on hold if the credit check fails. 
*'''Automatically Release IN Documents''': This option indicates whether the respective documents should be released automatically in the Inventory module. 

| 
| 
|- 
| '''7'''
|  '''Review relevant delivery settings for customers'''
|  Review the delivery settings on the Customers form for each customer; if the customer has multiple locations, review the settings of each location. Look at the following settings and note any that should be changed: 
*'''Ship Via''': The carrier to handle shipments to this customer location. The carrier record serves as the source of the freight account and subaccount and can be used for automated calculation of the freight amount. 
*'''Shipping Terms''': The terms governing delivery of goods. 
*'''FOB Point''': The port where the title of shipped goods is transferred to the customer. 
*'''Ship Complete''': How the shipment should be generated if the quantity is insufficient: only in full, in multiple partial shipments, or shipped partially with cancellation of the quantity remaining after the first shipment. 
*'''Order Priority''': The relative &ldquo;weight&ldquo; of the customer&rsquo;s orders in allocating the inventory in mass order processing. Orders with a higher priority are processed first. 
*'''Warehouse''': The preferred warehouse for sales to the customer. 

| 
| 
|- 
| '''8'''
|  '''Review relevant delivery settings for customer classes'''
|  Analyse the delivery settings of customers considering how customers are grouped in customer classes. Review the following settings in Customer Classes form: 
*'''Ship Via'''
* '''Shipping Terms'''
* '''Ship Complete'''

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Sales Orders Preparation Checklist No. Task Deliverables Person in Charge Done 1 Decide which predefined order types your company will use  Decide which predefined order types you will use and which you will 							not use. 2 Review order type settings  Use the Order Types form to review settings of each predefined order 							type you will use, and write down the necessary changes to settings. In 							particular, note the following elements:  Order Numbering Sequence : Which sequence the system uses 									to give a reference number to an order of the type. Numbering 									sequences can be unique to each order type or shared by multiple 									types.  Days to Keep : How many days an order of this type may be 									kept in the system before it can be deleted.  Hold Orders on Entry : Whether all new sales orders of the 									type are created with the status  On Hold .  Hold 										Document on Failed Credit Check : 									Whether on order creation, the customer’s credit status is 									checked. If the customer exceeds the credit limit or has overdue 									invoices, the order can be put on hold (depending on customer 									settings).  Require Control Total : Whether the user needs to enter a 									control total for each order. The order can be processed only 									when the system-calculated total equals the manually entered 									control total.  Bill Separately : Whether multiple orders of the type for 									the same customer will be billed separately by default.  Ship Separately : Whether multiple orders of this type for 									the same customer will be shipped separately by default.  Calculate Freight : Whether freight charges should be 									calculated for an order automatically.  Recalculate Discount on Partial Shipment : Whether the 									discount for partial shipment should be recalculated anew based 									on shipped quantities.  Copy Notes/Attachments To Shipment/Invoice : Whether, when 									a shipment or invoice is created for an order, notes or 									attachments of order lines are copied to the respective shipment 									or invoice lines. Allow 										Quick Processing : Whether new orders of this order type 									can be quickly processed from the entry 									form. 3 Review order type's Accounts Receivable settings  Review the settings in the  Accounts Receivable Settings  							section (on the  General Settings  tab of the Order Types form). 							Note any that should be changed. 4 Review posting settings of order types  For each order type you will use, review the settings in the 								 Posting Settings  section. Posting settings define which 							General Ledger accounts and subaccounts are updated by the orders of 							this type:   The sales revenue account and subaccount are credited by the 									gross invoice amount, minus taxes, volume discounts, and freight 									and miscellaneous charges.   The miscellaneous charges account and subaccount are credited 									by the order's miscellaneous charges.   The freight charges account and subaccount are credited by the 									order's freight amount that you bill to the customer.   The discount account and subaccount are debited by volume 									discounts applied to the whole order. Line discounts are 									deducted from order line amounts, which are posted to the 									revenue account.  The posting settings for the order type refer to the record from 								which the account should be sourced. Available options can include 								the following: customer location, inventory item, non-stock item, 								warehouse, posting class, reason code, carrier, and order type. 								Similarly, the order type indicates the source for each segment of 								subaccounts: your company location, the customer location, the 								inventory item, the warehouse, the posting class, the carrier, the 								reason code, the salesperson, the employee, or the company branch. 								Review the General Ledger accounts and subaccounts of the chosen 								master records that serve as sources of accounts and 								subaccounts. 5 Plan shipment settings  Decide upon the settings that control processing of shipments 							(regardless of the order or orders they are created for). These settings 							include the following:  Shipment Numbering Sequence : This numbering sequence is 									used to assign each shipment a unique number.  Freight Allocation on Partial Shipping : Freight charges 									are represented in a sales order as a single figure. If an order 									has multiple partial shipments, freight can be allocated to 									shipments (and consequently to invoices) in one of two ways, 									based on this setting: with the first shipment getting the full 									freight amount, or with each shipment getting part of the total 									freight (proportionally to the billing amount of the shipped 									goods).  Hold Shipments on Entry : The option indicates whether new 									shipment should be put on Hold to prevent accidental 									confirmation.  Validate Shipments Total on Confirmation : If this option 									is selected, the system will require independent input of 									shipment total quantity to verify it against shipment details.  Add Zero Lines for Items Not in Stock : This option 									indicates whether sales order items should be added in the 									shipment even though they have no available quantity.  6 Plan global settings  Decide upon the global settings specific to the Sales Order 							Management module, including the following:  Default Sales Order Type : The most common (most 									frequently used) order type.  Hold Invoices on Failed Credit Check : A customer credit 									check is performed when each sales order is created. If it 									fails, the order will be put on hold and no shipment will be 									possible until it is released from credit hold. If the time 									between placement of the order and actual shipment is long, the 									customer’s credit situation may change. If this is a concern in 									your business, select this check box, and invoices created for a 									confirmed shipment will be automatically put on hold if the 									credit check fails.  Automatically Release 										 IN  										Documents : 									Th is  									option  									indicate s  									whether the respective documents should be released 									automatically in 									 the  									Inventory 									module .  7 Review relevant delivery settings for customers  Review the delivery settings on the Customers form for each 							customer; if the customer has multiple locations, review the settings of 							each location. Look at the following settings and note any that should 							be changed:  Ship Via : The carrier to handle shipments to this 									customer location. The carrier record serves as the source of 									the freight account and subaccount and can be used for automated 									calculation of the freight amount.  Shipping Terms : The terms governing delivery of goods.  FOB Point : The port where the title of shipped goods is 									transferred to the customer.  Ship Complete : How the shipment should be generated if 									the quantity is insufficient: only in full, in multiple partial 									shipments, or shipped partially with cancellation of the 									quantity remaining after the first shipment.  Order Priority : The relative "weight" of the customer's 									orders in allocating the inventory in mass order processing. 									Orders with a higher priority are processed first.  Warehouse : The preferred warehouse for sales to the 									customer.  8 Review relevant delivery settings for customer classes  Analyse the delivery settings of customers considering how customers 							are grouped in customer classes. Review the following settings in 							Customer Classes form:  Ship Via Shipping Terms Ship Complete 9 Determine whether you need to define 								carriers  								or configure integration with third-party 								carriers  If you decide to use carriers in the basic configuration, prepare the list and note 							for each carrier:  Carrier ID  Carrier name or description  Freight sales account and subaccount  Freight expense account and subaccount If 								you decide to use integration with nationwide carriers (FedEx or UPS), follow the steps in the  Carrier Integration Checklist 							topic. 10 Define any needed shipping terms  Plan any shipping terms to be used. Indicate for each set of terms 							its ID and description. 11 Plan needed FOB points  Decide whether your site will define FOB Points. If so, compile a 							list of them and indicate for each FOB point its ID and 							description. ]]></column>

| '''1'''
|  '''Decide on integration with Active Directory or another system'''
| 
Consider whether you want to integrate Acumatica ERP with Microsoft Active Directory (AD) or Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).{br}

Review any user groups to be mapped to user roles in Acumatica ERP, and identify any domain users that do not need access to Acumatica ERP.
| 
| 
|- 
| '''2'''
|  '''Develop a convention for logins (usernames)'''
| 
If integration with Active Directory (AD) is planned, consider using users&rsquo; domain logins as their logins to Acumatica ERP.{br}

If no integration is planned, develop a convention for creating logins in Acumatica ERP.
| 
| 
|- 
| '''3'''
|  '''Prepare a list of users'''
| 
Prepare a list of individuals who will need to access and use Acumatica ERP. For each user, list the following information:[anchor|#ul_ggn_cls_jt]
*The name of the user.
*The login to be used to access the system.
*The email address of the user.
*The initial password.
*Password options. Decide whether to apply the following options for the user:
**Allow password recovery if the user provides an answer to a question maintained in his or her profile.
**Allow password changes. When users change their passwords regularly, their accounts are more secure.
**Permit the user to have a never-expiring password.
**Force the user to change the password on the next login. 
*The user&rsquo;s regular job responsibilities, such as creating invoices, generating statements, and collecting payments.
*Optional: IP addresses from which the user may access the system.

| 
| 
|- 
| '''4'''
|  '''Design user roles'''
| 
For each identified role, plan the following: [anchor|#ul_fjn_cls_jt]
*Role name.
*Description.
*List of users who will be assigned to the role.
*List of Acumatica ERP modules, forms, and reports that the users with the role may access. Also, note the level of access to modules (''Granted'', ''View Only'', or ''Revoked'') and to forms (''Delete'', ''Edit'', ''View Only'', or ''Revoked'') that should be assigned.

| 
| 
|- 
| '''5'''
|  '''Plan user types'''
| 
If you are going to implement Self-Service Portal, create user types to group the default roles created for internal users and the default roles intended for external users (the users of Self-Service Portal). {br}

Identifiers for user types can be unicode strings of up to 50 characters. 
| 
| 
|- 
| '''6'''
|  '''Redefine security and audit policies'''
| 
If no AD integration is planned, review your security and audit options, which will affect all local users, as follows: [anchor|#ul_amn_cls_jt]
*Decide whether to require password complexity. Complex passwords include at least three of these four features: 
**Uppercase letters
**Lowercase letters
**Numbers
**Special symbols
*Decide whether to force users to change passwords and how often.
*Determine whether to apply a mask in addition to other password restrictions. This mask involves excluding characters that may not be supported by the involved systems. Use this option only when it&rsquo;s absolutely necessary. If you decide to use this mask, develop a message text to be displayed to the user when the password violates the validation mask.
* Determine whether to set up an account lock time and how many unsuccessful login attempts users can perform before their accounts will be locked.
*Decide how long you want to keep security audit logs and which of these security events should be logged: 
** Successful login attempt 
** Failed login attempt (this event should always be audited, because it helps you detect possible break-ins to the system)
** Logout 
** Session expiration 
** Screen access (the log will grow very fast if you log this event, so we recommend that you not do so)
** Successful sending of email 
** Failure sending email 

| 
| 
|- 
| '''7'''
|  '''Review the security preferences'''
| 
Review the following security preferences: [anchor|#ul_lpn_cls_jt]
*'''Password Policy''': Decide on the maximum lifetime for user passwords, minimum password length, password complexity (whether it is required), additional validation mask (if required), and tip that the user will see if a new password doesn&rsquo;t meet the complexity requirements.
*'''Account Lockout Policy''': Decide on the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts, lockout time, and lockout counter reset time. 
*'''Audit policy''': Decide on the audited operations and the time to keep the audit history 
*'''Security Certificates:''' If you have not done this, decide on the default certificate to be used for PDF signing and on the certificate to be used for encryption of the database.

| 
| 
|- 
| '''8'''
|  '''Decide on user access to branches'''
| 
This task is needed only if the ''Multiple Branch Support'' feature is enabled in your system on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. {br}

Plan the branch access roles. For each role, decide on the role name and on the list of users.

When users change their passwords regularly, their accounts            are more secure. Permit the user to have a never-expiring password. Force the user to change the password on the next login.  The user's regular job responsibilities, such as creating invoices, generating          statements, and collecting payments. Optional: IP addresses from which the user may access the system. 4 Design user roles For each identified role, plan the following:  Role name. Description. List of users who will be assigned to the role. List of  Acumatica ERP modules, forms, and reports that the users with the role may access. Also, note the          level of access to modules ( Granted ,  View Only , or  Revoked ) and to          forms ( Delete ,  Edit ,  View Only , or  Revoked ) that should be          assigned. 5 Plan user types If you are going to implement  Self-Service Portal,         create user types to group the default roles created for internal users and the default         roles intended for external users (the users of  Self-Service Portal).  Identifiers for user types can be unicode strings of up to 50 characters.  6 Redefine security and audit policies If no AD integration is planned, review your security and audit options, which will affect         all local users, as follows:  Decide whether to require password complexity. Complex passwords include at least three          of these four features:  Uppercase letters Lowercase letters Numbers Special symbols Decide whether to force users to change passwords and how often. Determine whether to apply a mask in addition to other password restrictions. This mask          involves excluding characters that may not be supported by the involved systems. Use this          option only when it's absolutely necessary. If you decide to use this mask, develop a          message text to be displayed to the user when the password violates the validation          mask.  Determine whether to set up an account lock time and how many unsuccessful login          attempts users can perform before their accounts will be locked. Decide how long you want to keep security audit logs and which of these security events          should be logged:   Successful login attempt   Failed login attempt (this event should always be audited, because it helps you            detect possible break-ins to the system)  Logout   Session expiration   Screen access (the log will grow very fast if you log this event, so we recommend            that you not do so)  Successful sending of email   Failure sending email  7 Review the security preferences Review the following security preferences:  Password Policy : Decide on the maximum lifetime for user passwords, minimum          password length, password complexity (whether it is required), additional validation mask          (if required), and tip that the user will see if a new password doesn't meet the complexity          requirements. Account Lockout Policy : Decide on the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts,          lockout time, and lockout counter reset time.  Audit policy : Decide on the audited operations and the time to keep the audit          history  Security Certificates:  If you have not done this, decide on the default          certificate to be used for PDF signing and on the certificate to be used for encryption of          the database. 8 Decide on user access to branches This task is needed only if the  Multiple Branch Support  feature is enabled in your         system on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form.  Plan the branch access roles. For each role, decide on the role name and on the list of         users.  ]]></column>
