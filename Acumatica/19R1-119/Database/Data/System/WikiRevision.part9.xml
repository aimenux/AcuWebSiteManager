			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[With Acumatica ERP, your company can easily configure and adjust sales order processing, accurately fulfill sales orders, process shipments and transfers of items, bill customers for sales orders, record customer returns, and perform other tasks required by the sales workflow of your company. Acumatica ERP provides flexible configuration options so that you can configure the system to fit the requirements of your company and efficiently manage business processes. In this topic, you will read about the sales order-related processes that you can configure and perform in the Sales Orders module.{br}{TOC}
==Configuring Order Workflows==
 Acumatica ERP includes a set of predefined order types for common distribution operations. To adjust the system to your needs and maintain your business processes, you can specify specific settings for each predefined order type. For an order type, you can specify posting settings and numbering sequences, specify whether the orders of this type and related documents should be on hold when they are entered or when the customer&rsquo;s credit limit has been exceeded, set up parallel or multistage approval, and specify other settings specific to order type. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__CNF_OrderTypes|Predefined Sales Order Types].{br}

You can define custom order types based on the predefined order types to meet specific order processing requirements. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Custom_Order_Types|Custom Sales Order Types]. Also, users can simplify multi-step processing and configure quick processing for a particular order type (predefined or custom) so that users can process the orders of this type with just one click. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Quick_Process_Workflow|Quick Processing of Sales Orders].
==Shipping Orders Fully or in Parts==
You can specify flexible shipping options for a sales order. The shipping rules specified for a particular sales order define whether the goods for the sales order should be shipped only in full or partial shipments for the available quantities are allowed. For each customer, you can specify the shipping rule to be used by default for the orders to this customer. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Default_Shipping_Rules|Shipping Rule Settings].
==Integrating Acumatica ERP with Local and National Carriers and Calculating Freight Charges==
You can configure local carriers to be used for shipping the orders, or integrate your system with nationwide carriers, such as FedEx or UPS. For local carriers, the system can estimate shipping costs by using the carriers&rsquo; predefined rates. For details on freight calculation for orders shipped via local carriers and via nationwide carriers, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\CS__con_Freight_Calculation|Freight Calculation]. {br}

With the ''Shipping Carrier Integration'' feature enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, users can get real-time shipping rates on sales orders from the nationwide carriers, and select the lowest freight cost for customers by comparing carrier rates on the fly. The customers can track their own order and check the delivery status of each box by using tracking numbers, which are provided through integration. Shipping terms configured in the system allow insurance and handling fees for labor and packaging fees to be added seamlessly. For details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\CS__con_Integration_with_Carriers|Integration with Carriers].
==Configuring Auto-Packaging for Shipped Items==
With Acumatica ERP you can make processing of shipments more effective by configuring automatic packaging suggestions both for orders shipped via integrated carriers and via local carriers. With the ''Automated Packaging'' feature enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form, the system automatically selects the minimum set of packaging boxes for each sales order to be shipped, depending on the weight and volume of the ordered items. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_WeightVolume|Weight and Volume in Sales Orders].
==Using Sales Prices in Orders and Applying Discounts==
The prices and discounts that are maintained in the Accounts Receivable module are used in the sales orders and invoices. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Prices_SO|Sales Prices in Sales Documents] and [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Discounts_SO|Discount Application in Sales Documents].
==Calculating Taxes for Sales Orders==
The rate and the amount of sales tax that apply to ordered items depend on many factors, including the types of items purchased, the delivery address of the customer, the address of the selling branch, and your organization&rsquo;s business presence (if it has one) in the state of the customer. With Acumatica ERP, you can set up the taxes to be automatically applied to Sales Orders documents. For details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Sales_Taxes_on_Sales_Orders|Tax Application in Sales Documents].
==Tracking Sales Proposals==
To record planned sales, you can create quotes that then can be used as a base for preparing a sales order, invoice order, or cash sale order. For more information on processing quotes, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_scn_Sale_Quote|Processing Pre-Sale Quotes].
==Processing Sales of Stock and Non-Stock Items==
Multiple order types that are predefined in Acumatica ERP support various business processes. Through sales orders of different types, you can process sales of inventory items (stock and non-stock) for credit and for cash, sales with transfer of items between warehouses, orders with both stock and non-stock items, and other orders that involve inventory items. For detailed descriptions of these processes, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Inventory_Sales|Processing Sales of Stock Items] and [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_NStock_Sales|Processing Sales of Non-Stock Items].
==Reviewing Item Availability Information and Allocating Stock Items==
During order entry, you can access item availability information to check whether a sufficient quantity of the needed items is available for sale. Also, for a particular sales order, you can perform stock reservations (and specify items&rsquo; lot or serial numbers, if required) so that the items promised to a customer cannot be shipped to another customer. When items are stocked at multiple warehouses, this helps avoid overstocks and stockouts because the system gives you the ability to reserve items at any warehouse and automates transfers. 
==Attaching Files and Notes ==
You can attach to a sales order scanned images or electronic versions of customer orders to facilitate tracking and processing of the order. You can also add notes with shipping and handling instructions to sales orders or specific lines of sales orders, and configure any order type so that the system will copy attached notes and files from sales orders of this type to related shipments and invoices.
==Printing Documents and Labels==
If you need printed copies of the documents in the Sales Orders module, you can print any sales order or quote, shipment pick list, shipment confirmation, or invoice. Also, if an integrated carrier is used for shipping items, you can configure the printing of carrier labels. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Printing_Docs|Printing Sales Documents] and [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Carriers_Label|Carrier Labels and Tracking Numbers].
==Shipping Orders in Full and Partially==
You can specify a different delivery date for each line item on a sales order, and prepare separate shipments for particular items. Also, you can prepare a partial shipment depending on the inventory availability information of the item. In these cases, the system splits a sales order into multiple shipments from different warehouses For more details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Partial_Shipments|Partial Shipping of Orders].
==Processing Orders for Items That Are Out of Stock==
 Acumatica ERP supports multiple scenarios for tracking and processing orders that have been prepared when there are insufficient item quantities:[anchor|#_d8763532-01d8-42c4-b56d-504be422d7d5]
*Transfer order preparation for a sales order: You can allocate the insufficient item quantity in other warehouse, and then prepare a transfer order to transfer the items to the destination warehouse. Once the items are received, the sales order can be processed further. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__MNG_TR_Orders|Sale with Transferred Stock Items].
*Sales order for drop-shipping: If the ''Drop Shipments'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can mark a sales order line as intended for drop-shipping; when you process the sales order further, the customer receives the goods directly from one of your vendors. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_scn_DropShip|Processing Sales for Drop-Shipment].
*Back ordering: If back ordering is allowed for a sales order, you can ship the items partially; the system tracks the remaining quantities in an order after partial shipment and places a partially shipped order to back order. Once the remaining item quantity becomes available in inventory, back-orders can be replanned and processed further. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_ReplanBackOrders|Back Ordering and Replanning Back Orders].
*Purchase for sale: If the ''Sales Order to Purchase Order Link'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form, you can mark a sales orders line that is out of stock fully or partially, so that the remaining quantity will be purchased directly for this order. For more information on how to use the goods received from vendors for fulfilling specific sales orders, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Purchase_for_Sale|Processing Purchased Items for Sale].

==Processing Customer Returns==
 Acumatica ERP provides the flexibility to manage various types of customer returns. Your company can set up its own return policies by using specific predefined order types and by creating custom order types for authorized and unauthorized returns. You can perform authorized and unauthorized returns, returns for credit and for cash, and returns with replacement, for the same price or for a changed price. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Sale_Return|Processing Customer Returns].
==Processing Sales Through Point of Sale ==
If the ''Advanced SO Invoices'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, a user can add stock items directly to a Sales Orders invoice without creating and processing the associated sales order and shipment. This sales workflow is used for simplified processing of direct sales with the integration of an external point of sale system.
==Reserving Payments for Sales Orders==
If your company requires prepayments or payments to be made for particular orders, you can create payments and prepayments and reserve them for specific orders, and then track how payment amounts have been applied to one invoice or multiple invoices prepared for the order. 
==Converting Opportunities to Sales Orders Documents==
With Acumatica ERP, salespeople can convert customer relationship management (CRM) opportunities to sales orders without re-entering pricing and discount information. Customer service personnel can easily locate customer orders to verify their delivery status. Order fulfillment personnel can associate tasks and activities with each order. For more information, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CR__MNG_Opportunities|Managing Opportunities].
==Mass-Processing of Documents==
To simplify regular operations that are performed, Acumatica ERP provides mass-processing forms on which you can perform the commonly used operations for multiple orders, shipments, or invoices at a time. You can also schedule any of the operations to be performed automatically at a convenient interval (daily or weekly).]]></column>

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
The Purchase Orders module helps you organize and control the purchasing process, plan purchasing expenses, and reduce spending on goods and services. Acumatica ERP automates the purchasing process: issuing purchase orders, receiving orders, and creating Accounts Payable bills. With the Purchase Orders module, you gain complete visibility into the whole purchasing process, from planning purchases to paying the bills. {br}{TOC}
==Multiple Purchase Order Types==
The Purchase Orders module supports the following purchase order types: ''Normal'', ''Drop Ship'', ''Blanket'', and ''Standard''. The features that affect the list of order types (if not enabled) are: ''Blanket and Standard Purchase Orders'' and ''Drop Shipments''. Orders of different types have different functionality and fulfillment flows; for instance, orders of the ''Standard'' type can be included in ''Normal'' orders. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_Types_of_Purchase_Orders|Types of Purchase Orders]. 
==Default Settings==
Multiple default settings, if they hold the values your employees use most frequently, help users save time and avoid input errors during data entry. Some default settings are defined within the Purchase Orders module, while others are defined in the modules that integrate closely with purchasing. Users can, of course, override these values at any time. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_Purchasing-Related_Defaults_and_Overrides|Purchase Order Configuration]. 
==Integration with Inventory and Accounting==
Because of this module&rsquo;s seamless integration with financial and inventory modules, you can generate back orders, view item availability data, generate invoices for drop-ship orders, and view customer demand when you create purchase orders. You can automatically generate Accounts Payable bills and inventory receipts and issues. Such integration eliminates repetitive data entry and automates workflows for the complete purchasing cycle. 
==Vendor Catalogs==
To maintain up-to-date information on vendor prices in Acumatica ERP, you can create vendor catalogs and update them periodically for each vendor. For updating, you can use information on released vendor documents or import vendor price lists. If the ''Volume Pricing'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can define price tiers for different quantities of the items purchased from a particular vendor. Also, you can specify minimum and maximum order quantities, lot sizes, alternative IDs used by vendors for products they sell, and other related information. For more details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_Vendor_Catalog|Vendor Catalogs]. 
==Vendor Prices and Discounts==
By maintaining vendor discounts and prices in the system, you can take advantage of quantity pricing offers from the vendors and effectively plan your purchases. In Acumatica ERP, you can enter and maintain the vendor discounts that the system applies automatically to each purchase order or bill if the ''Vendor Discounts'' feature is enabled. Vendor prices and discounts can be configured in the Accounts Payable module. 
==Flexible Approval Procedures==
Most organizations require that purchase orders be approved by designated persons before they can be emailed or printed for sending by mail to the vendor. You can configure the approval process with approvals to be performed in parallel by multiple employees or in multiple successive stages. The rules for automatic assignment of orders for approval can be based on the type of order, vendor information, order amount, and other order-specific information. For details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_Purchase_Order_Approvals|Purchase Order Approval]. 
==Processing of Drop-Ship Orders==
Drop shipping is a type of sales order fulfillment in which the customers order goods from your company, receive them directly from a vendor (wholesaler or manufacturer), and send payments for the orders to your company. The quantities of stock items on drop-ship orders do not update the item availability data in the Inventory module. The functionality that allows processing of drop-ship orders is available only if the ''Drop Shipments'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form. For details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_Drop-Ship_Order_Flow|Drop-Ship Purchase Orders].
==Processing of Returns==
For damaged goods or services not rendered, you can create returns. To a return, you can add a purchase order, add order lines, or specify the items with their quantities manually. You can configure the system on release of returns to automatically create Inventory issues for stock items. Further processing of returns depend on the policies established in your company: You can choose whether to create a debit adjustment and later apply it against a refund or against other bills, or to later create a new receipt for replacements of damaged items. For details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_Return_Processing|Purchase Return Processing].
==Support of COD Purchases==
The type of purchasing transaction for which a buyer pays at the time of delivery is generally referred to as ''cash on delivery (COD)'' or (because there are multiple possible methods of payment) ''collect on delivery (COD)''. Acumatica ERP provides you with the functionality that you can use to account for payments made on delivery. For information on a workflow used for processing COD transactions, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_COD|Support of COD Transactions].
==Landed Cost Tracking==
By using the Purchase Orders module, you can account for additional costs that your company can incur in the process of purchasing goods, such as transportation costs, taxes, shipment insurances, and other charges. For information about how landed costs are processed in Acumatica ERP, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_Landed_Cost_Tracking|Processing Landed Cost Documents]. 
==Barcode Support==
Scanning product barcodes on receipt of goods to warehouses simplifies data entry. By using warehouse and location IDs printed as barcodes and scanned on data entry, you can more easily maintain correct item allocation data, which helps your employees effectively fulfill orders. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_Barcode_Support|Barcode Support]. 
==Inclusive VAT Support==
In Acumatica ERP, you can configure automatic calculation of value-added taxes (VATs) included in item prices. This functionality is available only if the ''VAT Reporting'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form. Tax amounts will be calculated appropriately, recorded to proper tax claimable accounts, and excluded from item costs. For details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_Inclusive_VAT_Support|Inclusive VAT Support in Purchase Orders]. 
==Audit Trail==
The Purchase Orders module provides a complete audit trail of all purchasing transactions. After a transaction is released, it cannot be deleted; to correct mistakes, you must enter a transaction to reverse the incorrect entry. The system keeps the details of all purchasing transactions, including information about users who entered, approved, and modified records. Also, you can attach scanned copies of original documents and notes directly to the documents. 
==Retainage Support==
If the ''Retainage Support'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the user can specify the retainage amount in a purchase order; when the Accounts Payable bill is created based on this order, the system will specify the retainage settings in the bill based on the purchase order settings.{br}

This feature can be used only with the Construction Edition.
==Other Features and Options==
The Purchase Orders module also offers the following features: 
*Integration with the Inventory module: You can purchase goods for inventory, and when the goods are received at the warehouse and the purchase receipts are released, the system automatically generates inventory receipts.
*The ability to attach scanned images of vendor documents or images of items received from vendor to receipts or returns.
*The ability to add notes with handling instructions to receipts. 
*The option to link receipts to purchase orders or to specific lines of a purchase order to easily trace the process of purchase order fulfillment.
*Support of non-stock items on purchase receipts.
*Automatic conversion of units of measure (and resulting item costs).
*The ability to specify service charges and shipping and handling fees on purchase orders and receipts.
*Automatic printing of purchase orders to further send them to vendors by mail, or automatic emailing of such orders.
*Automatic update of item costs, depending on the valuation methods chosen for inventory items, with vendor prices specified on purchase receipts.
*Convenient display of item availability information on the form when users create purchase orders.
*Automatic calculation of taxes on purchases, depending on the tax zone of the shipping location.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Purchase Orders Processes The Purchase Orders module helps you organize and control the purchasing process, plan 				purchasing expenses, and reduce spending on goods and services.  Acumatica ERP automates the purchasing process: issuing purchase orders, receiving orders, and 				creating Accounts Payable bills. With the Purchase Orders module, you gain 				complete visibility into the whole purchasing process, from planning purchases to 				paying the bills.  Multiple Purchase Order Types The Purchase Orders module supports the following purchase order types:  Normal , 					 Drop Ship ,  Blanket , and  Standard . The features that affect 				the list of order types (if not enabled) are:  Blanket and Standard Purchase 					Orders  and  Drop Shipments . Orders of different types have different 				functionality and fulfillment flows; for instance, orders of the  Standard  				type can be included in  Normal  orders. For more information, see  Types of Purchase Orders.  Default Settings Multiple default settings, if they hold the values your employees use most frequently, help 				users save time and avoid input errors during data entry. Some default settings are 				defined within the Purchase Orders module, while others are defined in the 				modules that integrate closely with purchasing. Users can, of course, override 				these values at any time. For more information, see  Purchase Order Configuration.  Integration with Inventory and Accounting Because of this module's seamless integration with financial and inventory modules, you 				can generate back orders, view item availability data, generate invoices for 				drop-ship orders, and view customer demand when you create purchase orders. You can 				automatically generate Accounts Payable bills and inventory receipts and issues. 				Such integration eliminates repetitive data entry and automates workflows for the 				complete purchasing cycle.  Vendor Catalogs To maintain up-to-date information on vendor prices in  Acumatica ERP, you can create vendor catalogs and update them periodically for each vendor. For 				updating, you can use information on released vendor documents or import vendor 				price lists. If the  Volume Pricing  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, you can 				define price tiers for different quantities of the items purchased from a particular 				vendor. Also, you can specify minimum and maximum order quantities, lot sizes, 				alternative IDs used by vendors for products they sell, and other related 				information. For more details, see  Vendor Catalogs.  Vendor Prices and Discounts By maintaining vendor discounts and prices in the system, you can take advantage of quantity 				pricing offers from the vendors and effectively plan your purchases. In  Acumatica ERP, you can enter and maintain the vendor discounts that the system applies 				automatically to each purchase order or bill if the  Vendor Discounts  feature 				is enabled. Vendor prices and discounts can be configured in the Accounts Payable 				module.  Flexible Approval Procedures Most organizations require that purchase orders be approved by designated persons before they 				can be emailed or printed for sending by mail to the vendor. You can configure the 				approval process with approvals to be performed in parallel by multiple employees or 				in multiple successive stages. The rules for automatic assignment of orders for 				approval can be based on the type of order, vendor information, order amount, and 				other order-specific information. For details, see  Purchase Order Approval.  Processing of Drop-Ship Orders Drop shipping is a type of sales order fulfillment in which the customers order goods from 				your company, receive them directly from a vendor (wholesaler or manufacturer), and 				send payments for the orders to your company. The quantities of stock items on 				drop-ship orders do not update the item availability data in the Inventory 				module. The functionality that allows processing of drop-ship orders is available 				only if the  Drop Shipments  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features form. For details, see  Drop-Ship Purchase Orders. Processing of Returns For damaged goods or services not rendered, you can create returns. To a return, you can add a 				purchase order, add order lines, or specify the items with their quantities 				manually. You can configure the system on release of returns to automatically create 				Inventory issues for stock items. Further processing of returns depend on the 				policies established in your company: You can choose whether to create a debit 				adjustment and later apply it against a refund or against other bills, or to later 				create a new receipt for replacements of damaged items. For details, see  Purchase Return Processing.

You use the Purchase Requisitions module to configure and adjust request processing to best meet the needs of your company. By using this module, you can easily create requests for goods or services, and optimally fulfill these requests. The module makes the bidding process clear and simple, and provides instant analysis of bid results based on your preferred criteria. Thanks to smooth integration between the Purchase Requisitions module and other Acumatica ERP modules, you can easily create purchase orders, sales orders, and customer quotes related to the requests. {br}{TOC}
==Two Types of Request Documents==
 Acumatica ERP provides two types of request documents that you can use in ways that meet your specific processing requirements: 
*''Requests'' can serve as a starting point in procuring goods and services, with the system verifying that the estimated total cost of the request is on budget and that the document gets all needed approvals. For request documents, you can specify the request class, items, shipping instructions, vendor information, approval details, budget details, bidding details, and document owner. Request classes, described below, can make it easier for users to enter requests quickly.
*''Requisitions'' help users to request goods and services and can facilitate the bidding process and the creation of any needed customer quotes, purchase orders, and sales orders. Generally, requisitions are created by employees who are responsible for purchasing. These employees can convert requests into requisitions and make needed changes, such as selecting a different vendor from the one specified for the request. A request can be fulfilled only by using a requisition.

By using these two types of documents, you can organize the request process to meet your company&rsquo;s needs. The [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\RQ__con_Basic_Requisitions|Basic Purchase Requisition Process] topic describes some common ways the request process can work.
==Request Classes==
By using request classes, you can simplify the data entry process and reduce error rates when requests are created. For each request class, you can define a variety of settings that set up budget verification options and automatically fill in some elements of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_10_00|Requests] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ301000|RQ301000]) form with the default values. You can set up a default request class with frequently used settings, as well as multiple request classes for particular types of requests. A request class can be set up to include a predefined list of items, so that when employees enter a request of the class, they select from this list rather than the list of all possible items in the system. 
==Budget Compliance Verification==
You can set up budget verification for requests. Depending on your budget verification settings, if a request exceeds budgeted amounts, the system may disallow creation of the request or warn the user. To set up budget verification, you should specify the budget ledger, the period for the budget calculation, the type of the budget validation, the rule for selecting the account or accounts to which the expense amount will be assigned after the request has been fulfilled, and the rule for selecting segment values for the segments from the expense subaccounts involved. For details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\RQ__con_Extended_Requisitions|Extended Purchase Requisition Process]. 
==Creation of Requisitions Based on Requests==
If your company requires budget verification (and thus the creation of both request and requisition documents), requisitions can be created based on approved requests. You can create one requisition based on multiple requests, and you can add requested items into a requisition without first creating a request. 
==Flexible Approval Procedures==
Most organizations require that requests or requisitions or both be approved by designated persons before they can be further processed. You can configure approval to be performed in parallel by multiple employees or as a sequential process, in multiple stages. The rules for automatic assignment of document for approval can be different for request and requisitions. For instance, if budgets have been specified for specific requests, the requests that exceed the budget can be assigned for approval to other persons than the requests that comply with the budget. For details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\RQ__con_Extended_Requisitions|Extended Purchase Requisition Process].
==Bidding Process==
With the bidding process facilitated by Acumatica ERP, you can easily send requests for proposals and select the vendor that offers the lowest price. You can use the bidding process when it&rsquo;s appropriate; at other times, you might want to assign a vendor to a requisition directly without soliciting bids. With Acumatica ERP, you can choose the vendor manually or direct the system to automatically select the vendor with the lowest extended cost. Moreover, you can configure the system so that some users may enter bidding results into the database, while others may be permitted to select the successful bidder. With this arrangement, the users who enter bidding results might not be permitted to view the selected vendor. For more details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\RQ__con_Bidding_Process|Processing and Selection of Bids]. 
==Integration with Purchase Orders and Sales Orders modules==
Because the Purchase Requisitions and Purchase Orders modules of Acumatica ERP are closely integrated, approved requisitions can be allocated to purchase orders quickly and easily. One requisition can be allocated to multiple purchase orders. Also, you can link requisitions with sales orders for situations when a requisition addresses a customer request. You can allocate approved requisitions to sales orders right from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_20_00|Requisitions] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ302000|RQ302000]) form. 
==Creation of Customer Quotes==
You can create customer quotes, which are sales orders with the ''Quote'' sales order type, to offer a price to customers that they can pay for requested goods. You can link requisitions with customer quotes and create a quote directly from the applicable requisition. Prices can be adjusted to meet your needs. 
==Other Features==
The Purchase Requisitions module also provides the following features: 
*Shipping instructions within request documents
*The ability to split orders across multiple vendors
*Built-in calculation of the total price, including a markup if you plan to sell purchased items

To maintain data consistency during the sales operations, the Sales Orders module is tightly integrated with other system modules. The Sales Orders module does not produce General Ledger transactions directly; during the order fulfillment processes, these transactions are generated from the Inventory and Accounts Receivable modules. Together these modules provide integrated order fulfillment, inventory management, and financial accounting. The following diagram illustrates the documents that are produced in the Sales Orders module and the related documents processed in other modules.[anchor|#_d5ebc332-fab4-4f17-be1f-5ac758636629][anchor|#_3acd5c41-9832-4977-a0aa-c1edefbf8d38][image:UserGuide/Images/SO_Connection_Overview.png|popup|450px]
The Sales Orders process typically starts when a user enters a sales order document. Acumatica ERP provides multiple predefined order types that support typical business operations; you select the order type depending on which process you need to perform.{br}

When you enter an order, in each order line, you can select a particular stock or non-stock item from the list of configured inventory items. The Sales Orders module provides instant access to accurate inventory allocation information. For the stock items, the system checks the item availability information and notifies the user if the item quantity specified in a sales order line is currently not available. {br}

If a sales order requires the shipping of items during processing, the related shipment document has to be prepared and confirmed. After the shipment of items is completed (or if the sales order does not require shipping), the Sales Orders (SO) invoice document has to be prepared for the sales order. On release of this SO invoice, the related Accounts Receivable document (invoice or cash sale) becomes available in the Accounts Receivable module; this document should be then paid by the customer for the shipped goods. {br}

To keep the inventory information up to date, the system generates the inventory transactions from the Sales Orders module when a user processes a sales order. When the sold goods are issued from the inventory, an inventory issue is generated to update the item availability information in the Inventory module. When a return of items is processed through a sales order, an inventory receipt is generated to reflect the receipt of the returned item to inventory. When a transfer of items is processed through transfer order, an inventory transfer is generated to reflect the item movement between locations or warehouses.{br}

The Sales Orders module provides flexible pricing and discounting policies by using the sales prices and discounts that are maintained in the Accounts Receivable module. {br}

For financial accounting processes, the Inventory module and the Accounts Receivable module are integrated with the General Ledger module. When you release an inventory transaction and an Accounts Receivable document, the batches of the corresponding transactions are generated in the General Ledger module.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
For the shipment of goods, your business may use local carriers as well as carriers that provide nationwide services. When you configure local carriers, you specify their estimated predefined rates. {br}

Large carriers operating over a broad geographical area—such as FedEx, USPS, and UPS—provide shipping solutions to clients with whom they have service agreements. A user can access the carrier&rsquo;s system, enter package details, get actual rates, print authorized labels for shipments, and track the delivery of shipments. If you configure integration with the carrier, your users don&rsquo;t need to enter the same information into both Acumatica ERP and the carrier&rsquo;s system.{br}

In Acumatica ERP, you can configure integration with FedEx, USPS and UPS; we refer to these carriers as ''integrated carriers''. The functionality of integrating with carriers is available only if the ''Shipping Carrier Integration'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.((({S:Warn}The integration of Acumatica ERP with the carriers (such as UPS, or FedEx) does not support international shipments.
))){br}{TOC}
==Carrier-Specific Plug-ins and Their Parameters==
The FedEx, UPS, and USPS carriers provide application programming interfaces (APIs) that allow their systems to be integrated with their clients&rsquo; systems. Acumatica ERP provides the following plug-ins for integration with these carriers: [anchor|#ul_ull_zjy_ls]
*{{PX.UpsCarrier.UpsCarrier}}: For use with UPS
*{{PX.FedExCarrier.FedExCarrier}}: For use with FedEx
*{{PX.StampsCarrier.StampsCarrier}}: For use with USPS
((({S:Hint}Plug-ins for other carriers can be developed on request.
)))
Before you configure integration with a carrier, your company should have an account with the carrier and a signed service agreement. For each of the plug-ins, you specify parameters that are specific to the carrier, including the account number and password for authorization with the carrier&rsquo;s system. Such services as ''FedEx SmartPost'' and ''UPS SurePost'' require additional service contracts to be signed with the respective carriers. These services employ the USPS for final delivery of low-weight packages to customers in the residential areas.{br}

To configure integration with a carrier, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_77_00|Carriers] ([~/?ScreenId=CS207700|CS207700]) form. On the this form, you specify a name to be used for this carrier in your system, select the appropriate plug-in, and enter the values for the parameters, which are specific to the plug-in you have selected. Some parameters are used for authentication with the carrier's system, while others are used to print carrier labels. All plug-ins include a parameter that can be used if recipient's signature is required to confirm shipments.{br}

Also, you can set up notification of the recipients about shipments sent via the carrier. For the '''NOTIFY''' (Send Notification to Recipient) parameter that each of the plug-ins has, you select the check box to set up this notification. Then on release of each shipment, the carrier&rsquo;s online service will generate a notification email for the email address of the contact specified for the shipment on the '''Shipping Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form.{br}

For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Integrate_FedEx|To Set Up Integration with FedEx], and [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Integrate_UPS|To Set Up Integration with UPS].
== Ship via Codes Based on Carrier Service Methods==
Generally, carriers provide multiple service methods. Each service method has its own rates and time frame for delivery. In Acumatica ERP, for each service method of the integrated carrier to be used by your company, you can define a ship via code by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_75_00|Ship via Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]) form. Then, when a user creates a sales order, the user can easily select the appropriate carrier and its service method by specifying the appropriate ship via code.{br}

You also can specify for each ship via code whether shipment confirmation for each box is required and whether at least one package (box) is required to confirm a shipment. For details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Create_Ship_Via_Codes|To Create Ship via Codes for the Integrated Carrier].
==Use of Customer Accounts with Carriers==
You can set up billing of the customers, rather than your company, for shipping if the customers provide information about their accounts with the carrier. On the '''Customer Accounts''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_77_00|Carriers] ([~/?ScreenId=CS207700|CS207700]) form, create a list of customers with their locations and their accounts with the integrated carrier. Only customers with the '''Active''' check box selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form can be billed by the carrier. For each customer, you can view the list of customer accounts with carriers on the '''Delivery Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form.
==Automatic Packaging ==
For effective integration with carriers, you can configure the system to automatically suggest packaging options for sales orders and then for shipments based on item quantities, weights, or volumes. To use this functionality, you need to enable the ''Automatic Packaging'' feature on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Automated_Shipments|Automatic Packaging for Integrated Carriers].
==Freight Calculation==
Once integration with carriers is configured, the system will be able to automatically evaluate freight cost on shipping the sales orders via integrated carriers. On the '''Shipping Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, for each sales order, you can click the '''Shop for Rates''' button to view the freight costs for the specified packages if sent by different methods of the selected carrier available for this particular shipment. You can then select the most appropriate ship via code for this shipment. The full freight amount you charge your customers may include not only the freight your organization is charged by carriers (freight cost), but also insurance, handling, packaging, and premium freight amounts defined by your shipping terms. You can view the freight total on the '''Totals''' tab.{br}

For details on defining and calculating freight, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\CS__con_Freight_Calculation|Freight Calculation].

To automate the processing of sales orders, you can configure the system to automatically determine the optimal set of boxes for sales orders and for shipments to be sent via the integrated carriers.

 The configuration of automatic packaging is described in detail in [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Configure_Automatic_Packaging|To Configure Automatic Packaging].
))){br}{TOC}
==Package Calculation for a Sales Order==
Once the automatic packaging functionality has been configured, you can use it when you prepare a sales order for shipping or create a consolidated shipment. {br}

Because the calculation of packages is resource-intensive, the system calculates packages only when the user requests this calculation. As you are preparing a sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form and adding items, the system calculates the weight and volume of the sales order. Once you specify the shipping information on the '''Shipping Settings''' tab—including the ship via code of the integrated carrier, the shipping terms, and the shipping zone—and save the order, the system determines the set of boxes and the weight and volume of each package. {br}

The system uses an heuristic algorithm (one that is not guarantee to find the best set of boxes, but quickly finds a satisfactory set for these purposes) and the following information to make suggestions about the boxes required for the order:[anchor|#ul_exb_r2x_jm]
*The lists of boxes assigned to each ship via code, with the maximum weight and volume each box can hold and the weight of the box (which must include the weight of any packaging material)
*For each stock item in the order, the quantity in base units, the weight and volume of the base unit of the item, and the option instructing the system how to pack this item

To view carrier charges, you can click the '''Shop for Rates''' button on the '''Shipping Settings''' tab. When you click '''Shop for Rates''', the system performs the following actions:[anchor|#ol_zl3_gg4_lm]
#Sends the information about the calculated packages (box ID, weight, volume, linear dimensions, declared value, and COD) to the carrier system
#Requests rates from the carriers and calculates carrier charges for the order for each ship via code associated with the carrier

 Based on the system&rsquo;s suggestions, you can select the ship via code with lowest cost for the order. {br}

 In some cases, you may need to edit the packages manually. If you select the '''Manual Packaging''' check box, you can adjust information about the boxes and their contents to match the quantities and weights of actual packages. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Manual_Packaging|Manual Packaging of Items]. If you have specified the declared values or changed the COD settings for any packages of the order, selecting the '''Manual Packaging''' option will prevent the system from automatically recalculating these packages and thus resetting the specified values.
==Package Calculation for Consolidated Shipments==
When you initiate a shipment creation for the order, the system recalculates the packages and the carrier charges based on the selected ship via code because there may be insufficient quantities of items listed in the order. Information about particular boxes used for the shipment becomes available for reviewing on the '''Packages''' tab. Packages will not be recalculated if the '''Manual Packaging ''' option has been selected for the order. {br}

You can create shipments for multiple orders by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) form. If multiple orders are consolidated in one shipment, you can recalculate the packages initially determined for sales orders by clicking the '''Refresh Packages''' button on the table toolbar on the '''Packages''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form. Once the set of boxes is determined for the consolidated shipment, you can review and edit this list if needed on the '''Packages''' tab. You can manually specify the declared values and COD amounts for packages if needed.

For thermal printers, the carriers usually provide labels in EPL or ZPL formats. {br}

You can create a batch file for the operating system so that the system sends the label file to the thermal printer once you double-click the label file. To create the batch file, follow the steps in the following sections. 
==To Share a Printer==
Connect the printer to a local network computer by using a USB cable, and turn the printer on. To share the printer on the network, do the following: [anchor|#ul_ynj_hv5_rs]
*For Windows XP: 
*#Open the '''Start''' > '''Printers and Faxes''' window, right-click the thermal printer, and select '''Sharing'''.
*#Select the '''Share this printer''' option, write down the shared printer name (or copy it to the clipboard), and click '''OK''' to close the dialog box.
*For Windows 7: 
*#Open the '''Start''' > '''Devices and Printers''' window, right-click the thermal printer, and select the '''Printer Properties''' option.
*#On the '''Sharing''' tab on the '''Printer Properties''' dialog box, select the '''Share this printer''' option, write down the shared printer name (or copy it to the clipboard), and click '''OK''' to close the dialog box.

==To Prepare a Batch File for Label Printing==
On the computer to which the printer is connected, create the batch file {{PrintLabels.bat}} that will handle the printing. (You can change the suggested batch name if needed.) {br}

If you will use a USB printer, create the file as follows: [anchor|#ol_urj_hv5_rs]
#Open Notepad, and type the following text:{{{{Net use LPT2: \\%ComputerName%\SharedPrinterName
Copy %1 LPT2
Net use LPT2: /Delete

}}}}
#Replace {{<tt>SharedPrinterName</tt>}} with the shared printer&rsquo;s actual name that you wrote down or copied earlier. Do not change <tt>%ComputerName%</tt>; the system will replace it automatically with your computer name.
#Save the file as {{PrintLabels.bat}} to the appropriate location. Make sure that you select ''All Files'' for the '''Save as Type''' action. 

If you will use a network printer, take these steps: [anchor|#ol_rtj_hv5_rs]
#In Notepad, type the following text:{{{{print /d:\\ServerName\PrinterName %1 

}}}}
#Replace {{ServerName}} with the name of your network server.
#Replace {{PrinterName}} with the name of your network thermal printer. 
#Save the file as {{PrintLabels.bat}} to the appropriate location. Make sure that you select ''All Files'' for the '''Save as Type''' action. 

==To Associate the File Extension with the Created Batch File==
You can register the file extension with the Windows operating system as follows: [anchor|#ul_xxj_hv5_rs]
*For Windows XP: 
*#Open '''Start''' > '''Control Panel''' > '''Folder Options''' and select the '''File Types''' tab.
*#Click '''New''' to register the extension of the carrier&rsquo;s file.
*#Select the extension from the list of extensions and click the '''Change''' button under the details section.
*#Select the {{PrintLabels.bat}} batch that you’ve created earlier. 
[anchor|#ul_d1k_hv5_rs]
*For Windows 7: 
*#Click '''Start''' and type '''Index''' in the search text box. On the list of search results, that appears as you type, select '''Indexing Options'''.
*#On the '''Indexing Options''' dialog box, click the '''Advanced''' button.
*#Open the '''File Types''' tab and add the carrier file&rsquo;s extension to the list.
*#Click '''OK''' to save the settings and close the dialog box.
*#Open '''Start''' > '''Default Programs''' > '''Associate a file type or protocol with a specific program''', select the added extension. In the '''Current Default''' columns, select the {{PrintLabels.bat}} batch that you’ve created earlier. 

Connect the printer and load the label stock. Now the system will be able to attach carrier labels to the appropriate lines in the shipment documents.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[To Set Up Integration with UPS Before you configure integration with UPS, your organization should have an account                 with the carrier and a signed service agreement. The SurePost service requires an                 additional service contract signed with USPS. The settings for the plug-in are                 specified in accordance with the information available in the agreement.  To configure integration between  Acumatica ERP and UPS—a carrier that provides shipping services nationwide—you use the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS207700|CS207700]) Carriers (CS207700) form. On this form, specify a                 name to be used for this carrier in your system, select the appropriate plug-in                 developed for this integration, and enter the values for the plug-in parameters.                 Some parameters are used for authentication with the carrier's system, while others                 are used for printing carrier labels or enabling recipient notifications.  To open any form, you can navigate to it or search             for it (by its name or by its form ID without periods). For more information about             search capabilities, see  Search in the Modern UI. To Specify Plug-in Settings for UPS Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS207700|CS207700]) Carriers (CS207700) form by                     searching for or navigating to it. In the  Carrier ID  box, type an easy-to-remember name for                     the carrier to be integrated. Provide a description for this carrier. In the  Plug-in (Type)  box, select                          PX.UpsCarrier.UpsCarrier . In the  Carrier Unit of Weight  box, select one of the                     units of measure (UOM) used by the carrier for weight calculation, either  SI                         Units (Kilogram)  or  US Units (Pound) . By selecting one of                         options, you also select the appropriate UOM for linear dimensions of the                         boxes used by the carrier,  сm (centimeter)  or  in                         (inch) . In the  UOM  box, select an UOM that is used in your system                     to measure weight and that is equal to the carrier's unit of weight.  We recommend that you select the UOM that is specified on the                               ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000) form as the                         default  Weight UOM  for inventory. Otherwise (if you                         select an UOM other than the default weight UOM), use the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) Units of Measure (CS203100) form to specify                         the conversion from the inventory default weight UOM to the unit you’ve                         selected as the equivalent to the UOM used by the carrier. On the  Plug-in Parameters  tab, do the following:  If you need to get certification from UPS to use its API in production,                             prepare the certification files. To generate the files for certification                             with this carrier, click  Prepare Certification                                 Files  on the table toolbar of the  Plug-in                                 Parameters  tab.

For the  NEGOTIATED  parameter, select the check                             box if your organization has special rates that should be used for                             calculating freight costs.  For the  NOTIFY  parameter, select the check box if                             you want notifications to be sent to the recipients. Then on release of                             each shipment, the carrier's online service will generate a notification                             email to the email address of the contact specified for the shipment on                             the  Shipping Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) form.

For the  SHIPPER FROM  parameter, leave the default                                  Company Branch  value if you want the system to get the                             shipper information from the company branch, or select  Warehouse                              to make the system get the shipper information from the warehouse.

==To Define a Box==[anchor|#ol_hsh_t55_rs]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_76_00|Boxes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS207600|CS207600]) form by searching for or navigating to it.
#On the table toolbar, click '''Add Row'''.
#In the '''Box ID''' column, type a unique identifier for the box.
#In the '''Description''' column, specify a description for this box.
#In the '''Box Weight''' column, specify the weight of the box in the selected UOM. 
#In the '''Max. Weight''' column, specify the maximum weight the box can hold.
#In the '''Weight UOM''' column, select the UOM to be used to measure the weight.
#In the '''Max Volume''' column, specify the maximum volume that the box can hold.
#In the '''Volume UOM''' column, select the UOM to be used to measure the volume of the box.
#If the box will be used for shipping via an integrated carrier, specify the box&rsquo;s '''Length''', '''Width''', and '''Height'''. 
#If the box is used by an integrated carrier, in the '''Carrier&rsquo;s Package''' column, provide the identifier used for this box by the carrier.
#Make sure the '''Active by Default''' check box is selected for the box if boxes of this type are used for shipping by most of the carriers and should appear by default on the list of boxes used for any ship via code on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_75_00|Ship via Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]) form.

==Notes About the Procedure==[anchor|#_36f015c7-a7cd-48ce-adb6-058bdfbe7e94]
The notes in this section describe the nuances of the UI elements available on the form, such as when an element is required and when it is not, and when the system fills in settings by default. This section can include other notes.{br}

Note the following about this procedure:[anchor|#_37fdd7f2-1723-4574-b0ba-ddfd929b017b]
*For the carriers whose systems are integrated with your system, the UOM for linear dimensions must match the UOM selected in the '''Carrier Unit of Weight''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_77_00|Carriers] ([~/?ScreenId=CS207700|CS207700]) form. If ''SI Units (Kilogram)'' is selected, specify the box dimensions in centimeters; if ''US Units (Pound)'' is selected, specify the dimensions in inches. For other delivery services that are not integrated carriers, specify the box dimensions only if there are special requirements for linear dimensions imposed by the delivery in the appropriate UOMs.
*For boxes to be used for shipping by delivery services that are not integrated carriers, you can specify the linear dimensions (such as width, height,or length) for informational purposes only; the values are not used in any calculations.
*The '''Carrier&rsquo;s Package''' column is displayed only if the ''Shipping Carrier Integration'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.

If  SI Units (Kilogram)  is selected, specify the box dimensions in                     centimeters; if  US Units (Pound)  is selected, specify the dimensions in                     inches. For other delivery services that are not integrated carriers, specify                     the box dimensions only if there are special requirements for linear dimensions                     imposed by the delivery in the appropriate UOMs. For boxes to be used for shipping by delivery services that are not integrated                     carriers, you can specify the linear dimensions (such as width, height,or                     length) for informational purposes only; the values are not used in any                     calculations. The  Carrier's Package  column is displayed only if the                          Shipping Carrier Integration  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. ]]></column>

If you use a set of standard boxes for shipping goods, you can configure the system to suggest boxes for each sales order and shipment based on the packaging options and weights specified for stock items. With Acumatica ERP, you can configure and use the automatic packaging functionality for all the local carriers used by your organization to ship the sales orders. To use the automatic packaging functionality, make sure the ''Automatic Packaging'' feature is enabled on [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}{TOC}
==Package Calculation for a Sales Order==
Once the automatic packaging functionality has been configured, you can use it when you prepare a sales order for shipping or create a consolidated shipment. {br}

Because the calculation of packages is resource-intensive, the system calculates packages only when the user requests this calculation. As you are preparing a sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form and adding items, the system calculates the weight and volume of the sales order. Once you specify the shipping information on the '''Shipping Settings''' tab—including the ship via code, the shipping terms, and the shipping zone—and save the order, the system determines the set of boxes, each package weight, the freight cost, and the freight charges. {br}

The system uses a heuristic algorithm (an algorithm that quickly finds a satisfactory set of boxes, however it does not guarantee that this set is the best one) and the following information to make suggestions about the boxes required for the order:[anchor|#ul_exb_r2x_jm]
*The lists of boxes assigned to each ship via code, with the maximum weight and volume each box can hold and the weight of the box (which must include the weight of any packaging material)
*The quantity of each stock item in base units, the weight and volume of the base unit of the item, and the option instructing the system about how to pack this item
*The quantity of each non-stock item in base units, and the weight and volume of the base unit of the item

You can view the particular packages on the '''Shop for Rates''' dialog box, which opens when you click the '''Shop for Rates''' button on the '''Shipping Settings''' tab. You can review the calculated totals on the '''Totals''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form. If freight for a specific ship via code should be specified manually, you can enter the total freight amount in the '''Freight''' box on the '''Totals''' tab.{br}

 In some cases, you may need to edit the packages manually. If you select the '''Manual Packaging''' check box, you can adjust information about the boxes and their contents to match the quantities and weights of actual packages. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Manual_Packaging|Manual Packaging of Items].
==Automatic Packaging Suggestions for Shipments==
If the automatic packaging is configured, once a shipment is generated for a sales order, the system updates the packages calculated for the order. You can view the suggested minimal set of boxes for a shipment on the''' Packages''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form. For packages that have been suggested automatically (those with ''Auto'' selected in the '''Type''' column on the '''Packages''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form), the system adds the weights of the boxes automatically. If needed, you can manually correct information about packages to match the quantities and weights of the actual packages, or select another box or boxes. {br}

You can create shipments for multiple orders by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) form. If multiple orders are consolidated into one shipment, you can recalculate the packages initially determined for sales orders by clicking the '''Refresh Packages''' button on the table toolbar on the '''Packages''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form. Once the set of boxes is determined for the consolidated shipment, you can review and edit this list if needed on the '''Packages''' tab.

For more information,     see  Manual Packaging of Items. Automatic Packaging Suggestions for Shipments If the automatic packaging is configured, once a shipment is generated for a sales order, the     system updates the packages calculated for the order. You can view the suggested minimal set of     boxes for a shipment on the  Packages  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) form. For packages that have been suggested automatically     (those with  Auto  selected in the  Type  column on the       Packages  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) form),     the system adds the weights of the boxes automatically. If needed, you can manually correct     information about packages to match the quantities and weights of the actual packages, or select     another box or boxes.  You can create shipments for multiple orders by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) Process Orders     (SO501000) form. If multiple orders are consolidated into one shipment, you can recalculate the     packages initially determined for sales orders by clicking the  Refresh      Packages  button on the table toolbar on the  Packages  tab of     the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) form. Once the set of boxes is determined for the     consolidated shipment, you can review and edit this list if needed on the       Packages  tab.   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) ]]></column>

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
To make sales order processing more effective, you can configure the system to automatically determine the optimal set of boxes for sales orders and for shipments to be sent via carriers, including integrated carriers. {br}

Configuration includes the following major steps.
==Before You Proceed==
Make sure the ''Automatic Packaging'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. 
==1. Create the Weight and Volume UOMs ==
Start by compiling a list of the units of measure used in your system to measure weights and volumes for different stock items that are usually shipped via carriers. {br}

Then make sure that all these UOMs are defined in the system on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) form. If any UOM is not listed among the predefined UOMs, define it. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Define_UOM|To Create an UOM].
==2. Specify the Base UOMs to Measure Weights and Volumes==
Decide on the base unit of measure (UOM) to be used for weight and the base unit of measure to be used for volume in your system; for more information, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_BaseWeightVolumeUOMs|Units of Weight and Volume]. After you have created the UOMS that you planned to use as the base UOMs for weights and volumes, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) form to select these UOMs as the base weight and volume UOMs as follows:[anchor|#ol_ipz_z1y_jm]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] form by searching for or navigating to it.
#:((({S:Hint}To open any form, you can navigate to it or search for it (by its name or by its form ID without periods). For more information about search capabilities, see [HelpRoot_Interface\UIG__con_New_UI_Search|Search in the Modern UI].
)))
#In the '''Weight UOM''' box, specify the UOM to be used to measure the weights of the stock items.
#In the '''Volume UOM''' box, specify the UOM to be used to measure the volumes of the stock items.
#Click '''Save''' on the form toolbar. 

==3. Specify the Rule for Converting the Base UOM to the Carrier UOM for Weight==
If integration with any carrier system is configured in your system, notice the UOM (in the '''UOM''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_77_00|Carriers] ([~/?ScreenId=CS207700|CS207700]) form) selected as the unit that is equal to the UOM specified for the carrier in the '''Carrier Unit of Weight''' box. Make sure that the conversion rules from the base weight UOM to the UOM (which is equal to the carrier unit of weight) are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) form.{br}

For more information on setting up integration with carriers, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Integrate_FedEx|To Set Up Integration with FedEx], and [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Integrate_UPS|To Set Up Integration with UPS].
==4. Define the Boxes to Be Used for Shipping==
To make it possible for the system to make packaging suggestions for sales orders, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_76_00|Boxes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS207600|CS207600]) form, list all the available boxes with their own weights (which may include the weight of all packaging materials) and their capacities for weight and volume. For each box that will be used for the integrated carrier, you must specify the box's linear dimensions (height, width, and length) because dimensions may affect the rates.((({S:Hint}By selecting the carrier&rsquo;s unit of weight, you also select the UOM to be used to specify the linear dimensions (height, width, and length) of boxes used by the carrier. If the carrier uses ''SI Units (Kilogram)'', the UOM for linear dimensions is ''centimeter''; if the carrier uses ''US Units (Pound)'', the UOM is inch. 
))){br}

For carriers that are not integrated with your system, linear dimensions for boxes are optional, and because they can be used for information purposes only, the UOM for measurement can be selected arbitrary. {br}

For details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Define_Carrier_Packages|To Define a Box].
==5. Create Ship via Codes and Assign Boxes==
For each delivery service used by your organization, create a ship via code by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_75_00|Ship via Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]) form, specify the freight calculation method and freight rates, and create a list of boxes on the '''Packages''' tab. The rates of different carriers or different delivery services for boxes of the same capacity may vary significantly, and some services may be available for only packages with specific weights, volumes, or dimensions. For more details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Create_Ship_Via_Codes_NIC|To Create a Ship via Code ].{br}

If your system is integrated with any carrier, also create a ship via code for each service method of each carrier that your organization uses, and assign the boxes. For details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Create_Ship_Via_Codes|To Create Ship via Codes for the Integrated Carrier].
==6. Configure Stock Items for Automatic Packaging ==
For each stock item, on the '''Packaging Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, specify the weight and volume of the base unit and the packaging option that defines how this stock item should be packed:[anchor|#ul_k2f_dfx_jm]
*By quantity, separately from other items 
*By weight, separately from other items
*By weight, not necessarily separately from other items
*By weight and volume, generally with other items
*Manually
{br}

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
When you provide delivery service to customers of your organization, you need to calculate the freight price to charge customers. The freight price usually depends on any number of the following factors, most of which affect the freight costs to your company: the shipping rates of the third-party carriers whose services your organization uses, the shipping zones, the weight or volume of goods, and the total amount of the applicable order.{br}

In Acumatica ERP, you can configure the system so that it calculates the freight price automatically on sales documents. Also users can enter the freight price manually for each document. If automatic freight calculation is set up, in most cases, users can still override the automatically calculated freight price on a sales order or shipment.{br}

In this topic, you will read about the calculation of freight costs and prices in Acumatica ERP.{br}{TOC}
==Configuration of Automatic Freight Calculation==
If you want to calculate freight cost and price automatically for particular order types, you do the following:[anchor|#_17a8efcc-c939-4db1-bcd2-e906ec322481]
#You enable automatic freight calculation for each applicable order type by selecting the '''Calculate Freight''' check box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form.
#You create shipping settings for each shipping method by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_75_00|Ship via Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]) form. Shipping settings depend on the carrier. For details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Create_Ship_Via_Codes|To Create Ship via Codes for the Integrated Carrier] and [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Create_Ship_Via_Codes_NIC|To Create a Ship via Code ].
#You create shipping terms, which the system will use to calculate freight price depending on the order amount, by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_80_00|Shipping Terms] ([~/?ScreenId=CS208000|CS208000]) form. For details, see [[#_beeed649-3493-45fd-b8f0-6601b2f4f5a1|Freight Price Calculation].
[anchor|#_beeed649-3493-45fd-b8f0-6601b2f4f5a1]
==Freight Price Calculation==
The ship via code specified on a sales order defines the freight cost. To calculate the freight price, the system uses either default shipping terms that can be specified for a customer on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form or shipping terms that you specify manually on the sales order. The freight price may include insurance, handling fees, or line handling fees.{br}

To encourage larger orders, you can configure shipping terms so that customers won&rsquo;t pay freight on orders with total amounts greater than a specified value. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_80_00|Shipping Terms] ([~/?ScreenId=CS208000|CS208000]) form, you can create tiers (or break points) based on shipping amount and specify the lower freight price for larger amounts.{br}

The freight price is calculated similarly for all ship via codes, as shown below.{{{{FreightPrice = (FreightCost * FreightCost% / 100) + 
             (LineTotal x InvoiceAmt% / 100) + 
              ShippingHandling + 
             (NumberOfLines x LineHandling)
}}}}
==Freight Information on Sales Documents==
The first sales document that contains freight information is the sales order. If the sales process in your organization includes shipments, you can edit the freight information on shipments (or leave the information if it is correct for the shipment). An invoice (or multiple invoices) based on a sales order or shipment can contain the freight price copied from the sales order or the shipment. For each shipping term, you can specify which document will provide freight information to an invoice with this shipping term—a sales order or shipment—by selecting the corresponding option in the '''Invoice Freight Price Based On''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_80_00|Shipping Terms] ([~/?ScreenId=CS208000|CS208000]) form.((({S:Hint}The value of the '''Invoice Freight Price Based On''' box on this form cannot be changed for the shipping terms after any order or shipment has been created with these shipping terms.
)))
If the freight price can be determined when the sales order is entered, you can select ''Sales Order'' in this box, so that changes of freight information on any shipment created for this sales order do not influence the freight price on the invoice or invoices for the sales order. If the freight price should instead be defined during shipping, you can select ''Shipment'' as the base document for freight price.
==Freight Cost for Integrated Carriers==
National carriers, such as UPS or FedEx, allow direct access to their automated systems to provide real-time information about rates for their clients. In Acumatica ERP, you can configure integration with these carriers, so they are referred to as integrated carriers. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\CS__con_Integration_with_Carriers|Integration with Carriers].{br}

With integrated carriers, the freight cost is calculated on the carrier&rsquo;s side based on the specified shipping settings and the dimensions and weights of packages. The full freight amount on the shipment is calculated based on the freight charged by the carrier and on the shipping terms that apply to the shipments.{br}

You can compare the freight amounts charged by various carriers by using the '''Shop for Rates''' dialog box, which you open from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form by clicking the '''Shop for Rates''' button on the '''Shipping Settings''' tab. You will be able to see the freight rates offered by all the integrated carriers and select the carrier with the lowest freight amount.{br}

The freight price the customer is charged for goods delivered by an integrated carrier is calculated as a sum of the bill amount for this delivery, the freight price calculated according to shipping terms, and the premium freight price.
==Freight Cost for Local Carriers==
If the goods for a sales order are shipped via a local carrier, the system estimates the freight cost based on the rates defined by the ship via code specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_75_00|Ship via Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]) form. You enter rates for each ship via code based on a local carrier on the '''Freight Rates''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_75_00|Ship via Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]) form. For details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Create_Ship_Via_Codes_NIC|To Create a Ship via Code ].((({S:Hint}The number of decimal places for freight rates is defined by the value in the '''Price/Cost Decimal Places''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) form.
)))
When a user enters a sales order with goods to be shipped by a local carrier, the system estimates the freight cost for the order based on the ship via code—that is, based on the predefined rates you have specified for the carrier. The weight of each order is calculated automatically in the same weight UOM that is specified in the '''Weight UOM''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] form. For details on setting up the weight calculation of a sales order, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Automated_Shipments_NICarriers|Automatic Packaging for Local Carriers].{br}

By default, the currency of the freight is the base currency.{br}

Rates are specified for shipping zones based on the weight of the total shipment and, optionally, the volume. The weight of an order is compared to break points, and the first break point that is less than the order weight determines the freight rate. {br}

The system calculates the freight cost based on the calculation method selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_75_00|Ship via Codes] form for the carrier as follows:
*For the ''Per Unit'' calculation method:{{{{FreightCost = BaseRate + (FreightRate x Weight)
}}}}
*For the ''Net'' calculation method:{{{{FreightCost = BaseRate + FreightRate
}}}}
*:Here, {{FreightRate}} is equal to the rate defined for a specific range of the shipment&rsquo;s weight and volume, as specified on the '''Freight Rates''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_75_00|Ship via Codes] form.

==Manual Entry of Freight Amounts==
You can configure the system so that users can manually enter the freight cost, the freight price, or both of these on a sales order or shipment.{br}

To set up the ability to enter freight cost manually on sales orders, you select ''Manual'' in the '''Calculation Method''' box of the '''Details''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_75_00|Ship via Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]) form for a ship via code of a local carrier. With this setting, you can specify the freight cost manually in the '''Freight Cost''' box on the '''Totals''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form.{br}

As an alternative to creating a ship via code, you can enter a freight price manually in a sales order or shipment. The system preserves the manually entered freight price in the sales order or shipment, and does not recalculate the price if any of the order lines (in particular, the quantities, extended price, or amount) are modified. You can do the following to enter the freight price manuallyfor the particular document type:[anchor|#_164a0437-78b9-4ff7-932a-946de4b0823b]
*Sales order: On the '''Totals''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, you select the '''Override Freight Price''' check box, and in the '''Freight Price''' box, you type the freight price for this sales order.
*Shipment: On the '''Shipping Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form, you select the '''Override Freight Price''' check box, and in the '''Freight Price''' box, you type the freight price for this shipment.

The '''Override Freight Price''' check box is available for documents that meet any of the following conditions:[anchor|#_e45f3877-6385-4f52-9046-0ef2dda33ae2]
*The '''Shipping Terms''' box is empty for the sales order or shipment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] form, respectively.
*''Sales Order'' is specified in the '''Invoice Freight Price Based On''' box on the '''Totals''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form for the sales order.
*''Shipment'' is specified in the '''Invoice Freight Price Based On''' box on the '''Shipping Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] form for the shipment.

==Freight Amount on Partial Shipments==
A sales order can be fulfilled by multiple shipments if the ''Back Order Allowed'' option is selected in the '''Shipping Rule''' box of the '''Shipping Settings''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. With multiple shipments, you can define how the freight amount should be allocated among shipments by selecting one of the following options in the '''Freight Allocation on Partial Shipping''' box of the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form:[anchor|#_84e22c28-4c29-4ff0-aee7-2ccae3ebca34]
*''Full Amount First Time'' to assign the freight amount to the first shipment created for the order
*''Allocate Proportionally'' to distribute the freight amount among shipments proportionally to partial shipment amounts

==Correction of Freight Price==
If you want to charge a customer for any additional conditions, such as extreme fragility or unusual dimensions, you can enter a premium freight price that the system will add to the order total. The premium freight price is specified for a sales order as a flat amount on the '''Totals''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form.{br}

Sometimes the real cost of freight and handling becomes known only after all shipments have been completed and the actual shipping charges for all packages have been provided by the carrier. With local carriers, the probability of change is higher because the rates used can become obsolete, while integrated carriers provide real-time rates at the time of shipment.{br}

If you need to correct the excessive freight charges that were specified in one of the earlier orders, you can manually adjust the premium freight price in the current order by decreasing it by an adjustment amount or by entering a negative freight amount. If you need to adjust the total freight price in an invoice, you can specify the needed positive or negative value in the '''Premium Freight Price''' column of the shipment line on the '''Freight Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form.((({S:Hint}The order&rsquo;s total amount after you adjust the premium freight price must be greater than zero or, at minimum, equal to zero—otherwise, the invoice that is later generated for the order cannot be released.
)))
==Posting Settings for Freight Amounts==
You can specify the General Ledger accounts that the system uses for posting freight amounts in the settings of the following entities:[anchor|#_2e6b5766-c733-4d2f-aba2-05eb5b0d2b45]
*Order type
*Customer location
*Ship via code

You select the source of the freight account in the '''Use Freight Account From''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. The freight account that you specify on this form in the '''Freight Account''' box is used as the default freight account. If the ''Subaccounts'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the freight subaccount to record freight is generated according to the rule specified in the '''Combine Freight Sub. From''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] form.{br}

If you need to post a freight cost to an expense account, you specify this account in the '''Freight Expense Account''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_75_00|Ship via Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]) form. The freight cost determined for a sales order is not recorded to any expense account until a bill from the carrier is processed. A bill from the carrier may include freight charges for all the sales orders that were shipped by the carrier during a specific time interval (a week, two weeks, or a month). If the bills are created for each ship via code used for shipping, the freight expense account can be manually selected on the appropriate lines of the bill.

To set up the ability to enter freight cost manually on sales orders, you select  Manual  				in the  Calculation Method  box of the 					 Details  tab on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]) Ship via Codes (CS207500) form for a ship via code of a local carrier. With 				this setting, you can specify the freight cost manually in the  Freight 					Cost  box on the  Totals  tab on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form. As an alternative to creating a ship via code, you can enter a freight price manually in a 				sales order or shipment. The system preserves the manually entered freight price in 				the sales order or shipment, and does not recalculate the price if any of the order 				lines (in particular, the quantities, extended price, or amount) are modified. You 				can do the following to enter the freight price manuallyfor the particular document 				type: Sales order: On the  Totals  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, you select the 						 Override Freight Price  check box, and in the 						 Freight Price  box, you type the freight price for 					this sales order. Shipment: On the  Shipping Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) form, you select the 						 Override Freight Price  check box, and in the 						 Freight Price  box, you type the freight price for 					this shipment. The  Override Freight Price  check box is available for 				documents that meet any of the following conditions: The  Shipping Terms  box is empty for the sales order or shipment on 					the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders or   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments form, respectively. Sales Order  is specified in the  Invoice Freight Price Based On  					box on the  Totals  tab of the    ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders form for the sales order. Shipment  is specified in the  Invoice Freight Price Based On  					box on the  Shipping Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments form for the shipment. Freight Amount on Partial Shipments A sales order can be fulfilled by multiple shipments if the  Back Order Allowed  option 				is selected in the  Shipping Rule  box of the 					 Shipping Settings  tab on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form. With multiple shipments, 				you can define how the freight amount should be allocated among shipments by 				selecting one of the following options in the  Freight Allocation on 					Partial Shipping  box of the  General Settings  				tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences (SO101000) form: Full Amount First Time  to assign the freight amount to the first shipment 					created for the order Allocate Proportionally  to distribute the freight amount among shipments 					proportionally to partial shipment amounts Correction of Freight Price If you want to charge a customer for any additional conditions, such as extreme fragility or 				unusual dimensions, you can enter a premium freight price that the system will add 				to the order total. The premium freight price is specified for a sales order as a 				flat amount on the  Totals  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form. Sometimes the real cost of freight and handling becomes known only after all shipments have 				been completed and the actual shipping charges for all packages have been provided 				by the carrier. With local carriers, the probability of change is higher because the 				rates used can become obsolete, while integrated carriers provide real-time rates at 				the time of shipment. If you need to correct the excessive freight charges that were specified in one of the earlier 				orders, you can manually adjust the premium freight price in the current order by 				decreasing it by an adjustment amount or by entering a negative freight amount. If 				you need to adjust the total freight price in an invoice, you can specify the needed 				positive or negative value in the  Premium Freight Price  				column of the shipment line on the  Freight Details  tab of the 					  ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form. The order's total amount after you adjust the premium freight price must be greater than 				zero or, at minimum, equal to zero—otherwise, the invoice that is later generated 				for the order cannot be released. Posting Settings for Freight Amounts You can specify the General Ledger accounts that the system uses for posting freight amounts 				in the settings of the following entities: Order type Customer location Ship via code You select the source of the freight account in the  Use Freight Account 					From  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form. The 				freight account that you specify on this form in the  Freight 					Account  box is used as the default freight account. If the 					 Subaccounts  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features 				(CS100000) form, the freight subaccount to record freight is generated according to 				the rule specified in the  Combine Freight Sub. From  box on 				the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types form. If you need to post a freight cost to an expense account, you specify this account in the 					 Freight Expense Account  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]) Ship via Codes (CS207500) form. The freight cost determined for a 				sales order is not recorded to any expense account until a bill from the carrier is 				processed. A bill from the carrier may include freight charges for all the sales 				orders that were shipped by the carrier during a specific time interval (a week, two 				weeks, or a month). If the bills are created for each ship via code used for 				shipping, the freight expense account can be manually selected on the appropriate 				lines of the 				bill .

Most businesses have their own processes of reviewing and approving sales orders. Generally, approval is required for sales performed on credit. In addition to credit checks, which can be set up to be performed automatically for all customers, your organization can configure the approval of specific sales orders—for instance, orders with greater than average amounts or orders that include specific items. {br}

With Acumatica ERP, you can set up as many approvals for specific types of sales orders and invoices as your company&rsquo;s policies require. {br}{TOC}
==Approval Support in the Sales Orders Module==
The functionality of approvals is available only if the ''Approval Workflow'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. If the feature is enabled, approvals can be configured for the following predefined order types: ''CS'', ''CR'', ''IN'', ''SO'', ''SA'', ''CM'', ''TR'', and ''QT''. The order types for which approval can be configured have the '''Supports Approval''' check box selected on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form.((({S:Hint} If custom order types are configured in your system, approval can be configured for orders of the types whose templates use the ''Sales Order'', ''Invoice'', and ''Quote'' automation behaviors. 
)))
If approval is required, when a sales order is taken off hold and saved, the system gives the order the ''Pending Approval'' status and selects an approver for the order, in accordance with the approval map used for approval assignment. Once each of the assigned persons approves the order on either the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) form, the order gets the ''Open'' status. If the approver rejects the order, the order gets the ''Rejected'' status. If the order is then edited and taken off hold, the system assigns it for approval according to the approval map.((({S:Hint}The orders with the ''Pending Approval'' and ''Open'' statuses cannot be edited.
)))
==Configuration of Approval for Sales Orders==
To set up the approval of sales orders, perform the following general steps:[anchor|#ul_fht_4q1_br]
#Identify the employees who will be reviewing sales orders of specific types, and plan the workgroups that will include these employees. Review your organization&rsquo;s hierarchy of workgroups on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_40_61|Company Tree] ([~/?ScreenId=EP204061|EP204061]) form, and add any new workgroups needed for approvals.
#For each type of sales order, define the rules for the assignment of specific orders to specific employees. Assignment can be done unconditionally or can be based on the specific properties of the order. Decide whether a single approval is required or multiple approvals are required; if multiple approvals are required, determine whether they should be performed in parallel or in multiple stages. Specify these rules by using approval maps, which are created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_55_00|Assignment and Approval Maps] ([~/?ScreenId=EP205500|EP205500]) form.
#:((({S:Hint}For each type of sales order for which approval is required, you should configure at least one approval map. If multiple parallel approvals are required for orders of the type, create multiple approval maps. 
)))
#If needed, create email templates to notify approvers about new sales orders pending approval—then once an order has been assigned to a specific employee or multiple employees for approval, the system generates a email or multiple emails (based on the template you created) that will be sent to the employees to notify them about the order pending approval. You can create email templates by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_03|Notification Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=SM204003|SM204003]) form.
{br}

For details on setting up the approval of sales orders, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Set_Up_Approval|To Set Up Approval of Sales Orders].
==General Rules for Configuring Parallel Approvals==
If your company requires multiple independent approvals for a sales order of a specific type, you can configure parallel approvals. In this case, every sales order of the type is approved by multiple employees in any order; the number of required approvals can depend on the document total, specific customer, or particular item. For example, in a small company, suppose that each sales order must be approved by the CEO, CFO, and CTO independently—in this case, you will need three maps, each of which assigns all orders unconditionally to one of these approvers. {br}

In Acumatica ERP, you will need multiple approval maps, developed by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_55_00|Assignment and Approval Maps] form, for each sales order type. For each type, the rules can be very simple if all orders are to be approved by the same persons, or more complicated if the approver is selected based on the properties of the order, such as the total amount or the specific products being sold. For more information on creating an approval map, see [HelpRoot_Organization\EP__con_Assignment_Automation|Managing Assignment and Approval Maps]. 
==Parallel Approval Workflow==
After parallel approval has been configured for a specific type of sales order in your system, an order of the type will be processed as follows: When a user saves a new sales order that has the '''Hold''' check box cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, the system uses all the applicable approval maps to select the appropriate approvers for the order and changes the status of the order to ''Pending Approval''. ((({S:Hint} Orders with the ''Pending Approval'' status cannot be edited. 
))){br}

If email templates are specified on the '''Approval''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form, emails are generated and sent to the employees who have been assigned as approvers.{br}

Each approver may approve or reject the order by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) form. If any approver rejects the order, the system assigns the ''Rejected'' status to the order. Rejected orders cannot be removed from the system; they are kept with the history of approvals. If your organization&rsquo;s policies allow rejected orders to be edited, the orders can be modified. Any modification removes all approval records for this order, and the process of approval starts again once the '''Hold''' check box is cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form. ((({S:Hint}If the system doesn&rsquo;t assign an approver to an order while applying the rules of assignment, the order gets the ''Open'' status. For instance, suppose that you designed an approval map that assigns an approver for orders with amounts greater than $500. If you create an order with an order total of $450, no approver will be assigned to it, and the order will get the ''Open'' status once you take it off hold.
)))
The order gets the ''Open'' status only after all required approvals (those specified on the '''Approval''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] form) have been performed. Open sales orders may be emailed, or printed and mailed, to the customer.
==General Rules for Configuring Multistage Approvals==
If a sales order of a specific type should be approved sequentially by multiple people (perhaps at different levels of the company hierarchy) in your company, you should configure multistage (sequential) approval of orders. ((({S:Hint}To configure multistage approval for orders of a specific type, you need to create only one approval map (which assigns approvers sequentially) and specify this map for orders of the type on the '''Approvals''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] form. 
))){br}

Consider an example of multistage approvals. You might require that all sales orders in your company be approved in the following stages:[anchor|#ul_twm_bzh_1w]
#By a senior accountant (with senior accountants belonging to ''Workgroup1'')
#By the manager of the accounting department (who belongs to ''Workgroup2'')
#For orders above $5000 only, by the CFO (the sole member of ''Workgroup3'')
The assignment rules for multistage approval should be designed so that an order, when it is saved, is assigned to ''Workgroup1'' only if its current approval group is ''none'', to ''Workgroup2'' when its current approval group is ''Workgroup1'', and then to ''Workgroup3'' when its current approval group is ''Workgroup2'' and its amount is greater than $5000. For each approval level, you can add conditions if needed (such as whether this order is from a specific customer or requests a specific item, or the document amount exceeds a specific threshold). {br}

For more details, see [HelpRoot_Organization\AP__How_To_Configure_Multistage_Approvals|To Create an Approval Map for Multistage Approvals]; the process of creating maps for sales orders is similar to that of creating approval maps for purchase orders. 
==Multistage Approval Workflow==
After multistage approval has been configured in your system, an order of the type will be processed as follows: When a user saves a sales order with the '''Hold''' check box cleared, the system applies the specified rules to select the initial approver for the order and changes the status of the order from ''On Hold'' to ''Pending Approval''. Orders with the ''Pending Approval'' status cannot be edited.((({S:Hint}Upon application of the approval map, if an order has not been assigned to anybody, its status changes to ''Open (Approved)''. For instance, if only orders with amounts that exceed a specific threshold should be approved, specify conditions that assign only orders with amounts exceeding this threshold. An order that does not exceed this threshold is given the ''Open'' status. 
)))
 Once the initial approver approves the order, the system assigns the next approver, and so forth. Each of the approvers can view the document at the appropriate stage in the approval process on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) form when the order is assigned to her or him. ((({S:Hint}If an order is first approved by an employee of a workgroup located higher (according to the company tree) than any of the assigned approvers, or by an assigned approver who belongs to an higher group than other approvers, the order is considered as getting all the required approvals at once. 
)))
If any of the approvers rejects the order, the system assigns the ''Rejected'' status to the order and the order will not appear in the lists for other approvals. Rejected orders cannot be removed from the system; they are kept with the history of approvals. If your organization&rsquo;s policies allow editing of the rejected orders, the orders can be modified. Any modification removes all approval records for this order, and the process of approval can be started again from the beginning—assigning approvers. {br}

Once the last approver approves the order, the status of the order changes to ''Open''. Open sales orders may be sent to the customer via email, printing and mailing, or both methods.((({S:Hint}Open orders cannot be edited.
)))
==Approval Escalation==
Every workgroup has a ''wait time'' specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_40_61|Company Tree] ([~/?ScreenId=EP204061|EP204061]) form. If a document assigned to a specific workgroup for approval is not approved by any user of the workgroup during the group's wait time, then the document becomes escalated—visible to the group that is one level or multiple levels up in the company tree—and any user from this higher workgroup can review the document and approve or reject it. If an order that should be approved by multiple approvers in a multistage approval process has been approved only by an approver from the highest-level workgroup specified for this approval process, the order gets the ''Open'' status and other approvals become unnecessary. {br}

You can specify whether escalation bypasses particular groups on the company tree by selecting the '''Bypass Escalation''' check box in the '''List of Groups''' pane on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_40_61|Company Tree] form.

If         the approver rejects the order, the order gets the  Rejected  status. If the order is         then edited and taken off hold, the system assigns it for approval according to the approval         map. The orders with the  Pending Approval  and  Open  statuses cannot be         edited. Configuration of Approval for Sales Orders To set up the approval of sales orders, perform the following general steps: Identify the employees who will be reviewing sales orders of specific types, and plan           the workgroups that will include these employees. Review your organization's hierarchy           of workgroups on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP204061|EP204061]) Company Tree (EP204061) form, and add any new           workgroups needed for approvals. For each type of sales order, define the rules for the assignment of specific orders           to specific employees. Assignment can be done unconditionally or can be based on the           specific properties of the order. Decide whether a single approval is required or           multiple approvals are required; if multiple approvals are required, determine whether           they should be performed in parallel or in multiple stages. Specify these rules by using           approval maps, which are created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP205500|EP205500]) Assignment and Approval Maps (EP205500)           form. For each type of sales order for which approval is required,             you should configure at least one approval map. If multiple parallel approvals are             required for orders of the type, create multiple approval maps.  If needed, create email templates to notify approvers about new sales orders pending           approval—then once an order has been assigned to a specific employee or multiple           employees for approval, the system generates a email or multiple emails (based on the           template you created) that will be sent to the employees to notify them about the order           pending approval. You can create email templates by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM204003|SM204003]) Notification Templates (SM204003) form. For details on setting up the approval of sales orders, see  To Set Up Approval of Sales Orders. General Rules for Configuring Parallel Approvals If your company requires multiple independent approvals for a sales order of a specific         type, you can configure parallel approvals. In this case, every sales order of the type is         approved by multiple employees in any order; the number of required approvals can depend on         the document total, specific customer, or particular item. For example, in a small company,         suppose that each sales order must be approved by the CEO, CFO, and CTO independently—in         this case, you will need three maps, each of which assigns all orders unconditionally to one         of these approvers.

For more information on creating an         approval map, see  Managing Assignment and Approval Maps.  Parallel Approval Workflow After parallel approval has been configured for a specific type of sales order in your         system, an order of the type will be processed as follows: When a user saves a new sales         order that has the  Hold  check box cleared on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders         (SO301000) form, the system uses all the applicable approval maps to select the         appropriate approvers for the order and changes the status of the order to  Pending           Approval .   Orders with the  Pending Approval  status cannot be edited.          If email templates are specified on the  Approval  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences (SO101000) form, emails are generated and sent to the         employees who have been assigned as approvers. Each approver may approve or reject the order by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) Approvals (EP503010) form. If any approver rejects the order, the system assigns         the  Rejected  status to the order. Rejected orders cannot be removed from the system;         they are kept with the history of approvals. If your organization's policies allow rejected         orders to be edited, the orders can be modified. Any modification removes all approval         records for this order, and the process of approval starts again once the  Hold  check         box is cleared on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders form.  If the system doesn't assign an approver to an order while applying the rules of         assignment, the order gets the  Open  status. For instance, suppose that you designed         an approval map that assigns an approver for orders with amounts greater than $500. If you         create an order with an order total of $450, no approver will be assigned to it, and the         order will get the  Open  status once you take it off hold. The order gets the            Open  status only after all required approvals (those specified on the            Approval  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences form) have been performed. Open         sales orders may be emailed, or printed and mailed, to the customer. General Rules for Configuring Multistage Approvals If a sales order of a specific type should be approved sequentially by multiple people         (perhaps at different levels of the company hierarchy) in your company, you should configure         multistage (sequential) approval of orders.  To configure multistage approval for           orders of a specific type, you need to create only one approval map (which assigns           approvers sequentially) and specify this map for orders of the type on the              Approvals  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences form.          Consider an example of multistage approvals. You might require that all sales orders in         your company be approved in the following stages: By a senior accountant (with senior accountants belonging to  Workgroup1 ) By the manager of the accounting department (who belongs to  Workgroup2 ) For orders above $5000 only, by the CFO (the sole member of  Workgroup3 ) The assignment rules for multistage approval should be designed so that an order, when         it is saved, is assigned to  Workgroup1  only if its current approval group is            none , to  Workgroup2  when its current approval group is  Workgroup1 ,         and then to  Workgroup3  when its current approval group is  Workgroup2  and its         amount is greater than $5000. For each approval level, you can add conditions if needed         (such as whether this order is from a specific customer or requests a specific item, or the         document amount exceeds a specific threshold).  For more details, see  To Create an Approval Map for Multistage Approvals; the         process of creating maps for sales orders is similar to that of creating approval maps for         purchase orders.  Multistage Approval Workflow After multistage approval has been configured in your system, an order of the type will be         processed as follows: When a user saves a sales order with the  Hold  check box         cleared, the system applies the specified rules to select the initial approver for the order         and changes the status of the order from  On Hold  to  Pending Approval . Orders         with the  Pending Approval  status cannot be edited. Upon application of the approval map, if an order has not been assigned to         anybody, its status changes to  Open (Approved) . For instance, if only orders with         amounts that exceed a specific threshold should be approved, specify conditions that assign         only orders with amounts exceeding this threshold. An order that does not exceed this         threshold is given the  Open  status.   Once the initial approver approves the order, the system assigns the next approver, and so         forth. Each of the approvers can view the document at the appropriate stage in the approval         process on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) Approvals (EP503010) form when the order         is assigned to her or him.  If an order is first approved by an employee of a workgroup located higher (according to         the company tree) than any of the assigned approvers, or by an assigned approver who belongs         to an higher group than other approvers, the order is considered as getting all the required         approvals at once.  If any of the approvers rejects the order, the system assigns the  Rejected  status to         the order and the order will not appear in the lists for other approvals. Rejected orders         cannot be removed from the system; they are kept with the history of approvals. If your         organization's policies allow editing of the rejected orders, the orders can be modified.         Any modification removes all approval records for this order, and the process of approval         can be started again from the beginning—assigning approvers.  Once the last approver approves the order, the status of the order changes to  Open .         Open sales orders may be sent to the customer via email, printing and mailing, or both         methods. Open orders cannot be edited. Approval Escalation Every workgroup has a  wait time  specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP204061|EP204061]) Company Tree         (EP204061) form. If a document assigned to a specific workgroup for approval is not approved         by any user of the workgroup during the group's wait time, then the document becomes         escalated—visible to the group that is one level or multiple levels up in the company         tree—and any user from this higher workgroup can review the document and approve or reject         it. If an order that should be approved by multiple approvers in a multistage approval         process has been approved only by an approver from the highest-level workgroup specified for         this approval process, the order gets the  Open  status and other approvals become         unnecessary.  You can specify whether escalation bypasses particular groups on the company tree by         selecting the  Bypass Escalation  check box in the  List of           Groups  pane on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP204061|EP204061]) Company Tree form.

Most companies have established their own processes of reviewing and approving purchase orders. Generally, all purchase orders require at least one approval, and orders with amounts above a particular threshold require one or more additional approvals. {br}

))){br}{TOC}
==Configuration of Approval for Purchase Orders==
To make it possible to set up the approval of purchase orders, perform the following general steps:[anchor|#ul_fht_4q1_br]
#Identify the employees who will be reviewing purchase orders of specific types, and plan the workgroups that will include these employees. Review the organization&rsquo;s hierarchy of workgroups on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_40_61|Company Tree] ([~/?ScreenId=EP204061|EP204061]) form, and add any new workgroups needed for approvals.
#Do the following for each type of purchase orders (if you will have different rules for different types): 
#*Decide whether a single approval is required or multiple approvals are required; if multiple approvals are required, determine whether they should be performed in parallel or in multiple stages. If multiple parallel approvals are required, you will need to create multiple approval maps.
#*Define the rules for assignment of specific orders to specific employees. Assignment can be done unconditionally or can be based on the specific properties of the order.
#*Specify these rules by using approval maps, which are created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_55_00|Assignment and Approval Maps] ([~/?ScreenId=EP205500|EP205500]) form.
#If needed, create email templates to notify approvers about new orders pending approval—then, once an order has been assigned to a specific employee or multiple employees for approval, the system generates a email or emails (based on such a template) that will be sent to the employees to notify them about the order pending approval. You can create email templates by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_03|Notification Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=SM204003|SM204003]) form.

For details on setting up the approval of purchase orders, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__how_Set_Up_Approval|To Set Up Approval of Purchase Orders].
==General Rules for Configuring Parallel Approvals==
If your company requires multiple independent approvals for a purchase order, you can configure parallel approvals. In this case, every purchase order is approved by multiple employees in any order; the number of required approvals can depend on the document total, specific vendor, or particular item. For example, in a small company, each purchase order might be approved by a buyer, purchasing manager, and CFO independently—in this case you will need three maps, each of which assigns all orders unconditionally to one of these approvers. {br}

In general, you will need multiple approval maps, developed by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_55_00|Assignment and Approval Maps] form, for each purchase order type: ''Normal'', ''Blanket'', and ''Standard''. For each type, the rules can be very simple if all orders are to be approved by the same persons, or more complicated if selection of the approver depends on the properties of the order, such as total amount, number of order lines, or specific products to be purchased. ((({S:Hint}For each order type, you should configure one approval map per required approval.
)))
For details, see [HelpRoot_Organization\AP__How_To_Configure_Parallel_Approvals|To Create Approval Maps for Parallel Approvals].
==Parallel Approval Workflow==
After parallel approval has been configured for a specific type of purchase orders in your system, an order of the type will be processed as follows. When a user saves a new purchase order that has the '''Hold''' check box cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, the system applies all the applicable approval maps to select the appropriate approvers for the order and changes the status of the order to ''Pending Approval''. {br}

If email templates are specified on the '''Approval''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form, emails are generated and sent to the employees who have been assigned as approvers.{br}

Each approver may approve or reject the order by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) form. If any approver rejects the order, the system assigns the ''Rejected'' status to the order. Rejected orders cannot be removed from the system; they are kept with the history of approvals. If your organization&rsquo;s policies allow editing of rejected orders, the orders can be modified. Any modification removes all approval records for this order, and the process of approval starts again once the '''Hold''' check box is cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form. ((({S:Hint}If the system (when applying the rules of assignment) doesn&rsquo;t assign an approver to an order, the order gets the ''Open'' status. For instance, suppose you created an approval map that assigns approver for orders with amounts greater than $500. If you create an order with an order total of $450, no approver will be assigned, and the order will get the ''Open'' status once you take it off hold.
)))
If purchase orders should be approved by multiple persons, order statuses do not indicate whether the orders are approved by some users or not yet approved at all. Once an order is assigned for approval, it has the ''Pending Approval'' status until all approvals have been completed. Detailed information about multiple approvals appears on the '''Approval Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form. The order gets the ''Open'' status only after all required approvals have been received. Open purchase orders may be emailed, or printed and mailed, to the vendor. 
==Configuration of Multi-Step Approvals==
If in your company a purchase order of a specific type should be approved sequentially by multiple people, you should configure multistage approval of orders. {br}

((({S:Hint}To configure multi-step approval for orders of a specific type, you need to create only one approval map (which would assign approvers in multyiple stages) and specify this map for orders of this type on the '''Approvals''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] form. 
))){br}

Consider an example of multi-step approvals. You might require that all purchase orders in your company be approved by a buyer (a member of the Buyer Workgroup), then the orders should be approved by the purchase manager (who belongs to Purchase Manager Workgroup), and that the orders above $5000 then be signed by the CFO (the sole member of CFO). The assignment rules for multistage approval should be designed in such a way that an order, when it is saved, is assigned to ''Buyer '' workgroup only if its current approval group is ''none'', to ''Purchase Manager'' workgroup when its current approval group is ''Buyer'', and to the ''CFO'' workgroup when its current approval group is ''Purchase Manager'' and only if the order total is greater than $5000. For each approval level, you can add as many level-specific conditions as needed (such as whether the order amount exceeds specific threshold amount or whether the order lists specific items).{br}

For details, see [HelpRoot_Organization\AP__How_To_Configure_Multistage_Approvals|To Create an Approval Map for Multistage Approvals].
==Multi-Step Approval Workflow==
After multi-step approval has been configured in your system, an order of the type will be processed as follows: When a user saves a purchase order with the '''Hold''' check box cleared, the system applies the specified rules to select the initial approver for the order and changes the status of the order from ''On Hold'' to ''Pending Approval''. ((({S:Hint}Upon approval map application, if an order has not been assigned to anybody, its status changes to ''Approved''. For instance, if only orders with amounts that exceed a specific threshold should be approved, specify conditions that assign only orders with amounts exceeding this threshold.
)))
 Once the initial approver approves the order, the system assigns the next approver, and so forth. Each of the approvers will be able to view the document at the appropriate time (upon assignment to the first approver, or after the previous approval for subsequent approvals) by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) form. ((({S:Hint}If an order is first approved by an employee of a workgroup located higher (according to the company tree) than any of the assigned approvers, or by an assigned approver who belongs to an higher group than other approvers, the order gets all the required approvals at once. 
)))
If any of the approvers rejects the order, the system assigns the ''Rejected'' status to the order. Rejected orders cannot be removed from the system because they are kept with the history of approvals. If your organization&rsquo;s policies allow editing of the rejected orders, the orders can be modified. Any modification removes all approval records for this order, and the process of approval can be started again from the lowest level. {br}

Once the last approver approves the order, the status of the order changes to ''Open''. Open purchase orders may be emailed, or printed and sent to the vendor by mail. 
==Approval Escalation==
Every workgroup has a ''wait time'' specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_40_61|Company Tree] ([~/?ScreenId=EP204061|EP204061]) form. If a document assigned to a specific workgroup for approval is not approved by any user of the workgroup during the group's wait time, then the document becomes escalated—visible to the group that is one level or multiple levels up in the company tree—and any user from this higher-level workgroup can review the document and approve or reject it. If an order that should be approved by multiple approvers in a multi-stage approval process has been approved only by an approver from the highest-level workgroup (specified for this approval process), the order gets the ''Open'' status and other approvals become unnecessary. {br}

For some groups on the company tree, you can specify whether escalation bypasses them.

For many businesses, approval of sales orders is required for sales performed on credit. You can set up approval for sales orders by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form.[anchor|#_977290a3-83d7-4372-bd01-f14814237413]((({S:Hint}To open any form, you can navigate to it or search for it (by its name or by its form ID without periods). For more information about search capabilities, see [HelpRoot_Interface\UIG__con_New_UI_Search|Search in the Modern UI].
)))
==Before You Proceed==
Before you can set up the approval of sales orders, make sure the following steps are completed in your system:[anchor|#ul_fht_4q1_br]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form, make sure that the '''Supports Approval''' check box is selected for each order type for which you want to set up the approval of orders.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[To Set Up Approval of Sales Orders For many businesses, approval of sales orders is required for sales performed on                 credit. You can set up approval for sales orders by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences (SO101000) form. To open any form, you can navigate to it or search             for it (by its name or by its form ID without periods). For more information about             search capabilities, see  Search in the Modern UI. Before You Proceed Before you can set up the approval of sales orders, make sure the following steps are                 completed in your system: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form, make sure that the                              Supports Approval  check box is selected for each                         order type for which you want to set up the approval of orders.  Review the organization's hierarchy of workgroups on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP204061|EP204061]) Company Tree (EP204061) form, and add new groups whose                         members are authorized to approve sales orders, if needed.   Select the                             employee who will be the  default owner  of each workgroup—the                             member of the group to whom the documents will be assigned for approval                             by default. A group may include only one default owner. By using the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP205500|EP205500]) Assignment and Approval Maps (EP205500) form, create the                         approval maps that will be used to determine the employee or employees who                         should approve an order of a specific type with specific properties. For                         details on configuring approval maps, see  To Create Approval Maps for Parallel Approvals and  To Create an Approval Map for Multistage Approvals.  For each type of sales orders for which approval is                             required, you should configure at least one approval map. If multiple                             parallel approvals are required, create an approval map for each                             required approval. For each order type, create email templates for notifications about orders                         pending approval. These emails will be sent to employees authorized to                         approve sales orders of a specific type.

On the  Approval  tab of this form, select the                          Require Approval  check box.  For each order type for which you need to configure approval, add an approval                     map as follows: Click  Add Row  in the table. In the  SO Type  column, select the type of sales                             orders that requires approval. In the  Approval Map  column, select the approval                             map to be used for orders of the selected type. In the  Pending Approval Notification  column,                             select the email template you created for generating emails about orders                             of this type pending approval.

If in your company sales orders of specific type must be approved, you can configure approval of sales orders in Acumatica ERP. In general, you will need an approval map, developed by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_50_00|Assignment and Approval Maps] ([~/?ScreenId=EP205000|EP205000]) form.{br}

The rules can be very simple if all orders are to be assigned for approval to the same person, or more complicated if the selection of the approver depends on the properties of the order, such as the total amount, the specific products to be sold, or credit settings of the customer. {br}

A company structure (company tree) and approval maps that use the structure of company&rsquo;s workgroups may depend on many particular factors. In this topic, we describe how to create an approval map for the following simple example: In a small company, sales orders over $10000 of the ''SO'' type must be approved by the CFO if the customer credit limit is less than 50000. 
==Before You Proceed==
Review the company tree structure and decide whether you need to add workgroups that will be involved in the process of sales order approval. For our example, the company tree should have the ''CFO'' workgroup.{br}

Make sure that user and employee accounts are created for each of the persons involved in approval of purchase orders and that workgroups with the approvers as workgroup members are created. 
==To Create an Approval Map==[anchor|#ol_ohd_rtc_jr]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_50_00|Assignment and Approval Maps] ([~/?ScreenId=EP205000|EP205000]) form by searching for or navigating to it.
#In the '''Name''' box in the Summary area of the form, type a name for a new approval map, for example, <tt>Approval of Orders Over 10000</tt>.
#In the '''Entity''' box, expand the nodes: '''Distribution &gt; Purchase Orders &gt; Work Area &gt; Enter'''; click '''Sales Orders'''.
#Click '''Save''' on the form toolbar. Notice that the map name is shown now in the '''Map''' box.
# In the '''Rules''' pane (to the right in the lower part of the form), click Add Row.
#In the '''Type''' column, select ''Assign to''.
#In the '''Workgroup''' column, select the workgroup (in our example, ''CFO'') to which the orders will be assigned for approval. 
#In the '''Assign to''' column, make sure that the employee ID of the approver from the selected workgroup is displayed.
#In the pane, make sure ''All conditions are true'' is selected in the '''Rule Type''' box.
#in the '''Conditions''' table, click '''Add Row'''.
#in the '''Entity''' column, select the entity, ''Sales Order'', whose properties will be used in the conditions for assignment.
#In the '''Field Name''' column, select ''Order Total''.
#In the '''Condition''' column, select ''Greater Than''.
#In the '''Value''' column, type <tt>10000</tt>.
#in the '''Conditions''' table, click '''Add Row'''.
#in the '''Entity''' column, select the entity, ''Customer'', whose properties will be used in the conditions for assignment.
#In the '''Field Name''' column, select ''Credit Limit''.
#In the '''Condition''' column, select ''Is Less Than or Equal To''.
#In the '''Value''' column, type <tt>50000</tt>.
#Click '''Save''' on the form toolbar.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[To Set Up Approval of Purchase Orders For many businesses, approval of purchase orders is essential for effective             procurement. For more information on approvals, see  Purchase Order Approval. You can set up approval for purchase             orders by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) Purchase Orders Preferences (PO101000) form. To open any form, you can navigate to it or search             for it (by its name or by its form ID without periods). For more information about             search capabilities, see  Search in the Modern UI. Before You Proceed Before you can set up approval of purchase orders, make sure the following steps are                 completed: Make sure the  Approval Workflow  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. Review the organization's hierarchy of workgroups on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP204061|EP204061]) Company Tree (EP204061) form, and add new workgroups whose                     members are authorized to approve purchase orders if needed. Select the employee                     who will be the  default owner —the member of the group to whom by default                     the documents will be assigned for approval. A group may include only one                     default owner.  By using the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP205500|EP205500]) Assignment and Approval Maps (EP205500) form, for each type of                     purchase order, create the approval maps that will be used to determine the                     employee who should approve an order of this type with specific properties. For                     details on configuring maps, see  To Create Approval Maps for Parallel Approvals and  To Create an Approval Map for Multistage Approvals.  For each type of purchase order for which approval is required, you should                         configure at least one approval map. If multiple parallel approvals are                         required, create an approval map for each required parallel approval for                         orders of the type. For each order type, create the email templates for notifications about orders                     pending approval. These templates will be used to generate emails that will be                     sent to employees authorized to approve purchase orders. You can create email                     templates by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM204003|SM204003]) Notification Templates (SM204003) form. To Set Up Approval  Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) Purchase Orders Preferences (PO101000) form by searching for or                         navigating to it. On the  Approvals  tab of this form, select the                              Require Approval  check box. If you have configured a single approval map for each order type with                         approval, add them as follows: In the  PO Type  column, select the type of                                 purchase orders that require approval. In the  Approval Map  column, select the                                 approval map to be used for orders of the selected type.  If no map is selected for the specified order                                     type, all new orders of this type will be automatically                                     approved. In the  Pending Approval Notification  column,                                 select the email template you created for generating emails about                                 orders of this type pending approval. If multiple parallel approvals are required for orders of the specific type,                         repeat the three previous substeps to add each of the approval maps.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
 Acumatica ERP supports four types of purchase orders, described below: normal, drop-ship, blanket, and standard. {br}{TOC}
==Normal Orders==
You can create normal purchase orders to order goods and services for retail, wholesale, production, stock replenishment, and other demands. Products purchased on normal orders are generally received to the company&rsquo;s warehouses. The quantities of items on such orders update the item&rsquo;s availability data. {br}

With the item lookup dialog box, you can check the item availability at a particular warehouse. With quantities on hand, available quantities, and quantities already on purchase orders in view, you can knowledgeably specify the appropriate quantity for the item. {br}

You generally create normal purchase orders by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. You select the type of the order as ''Normal'' and add the items to be purchased to the list; you can also add lines from an existing purchase order (or add the whole purchase order). Also, to adjust the quantity of the item on the order, you can view the demand for the item (that is, the item&rsquo;s quantity specified on back orders or orders with '''Mark for PO''' check box selected). {br}

By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_50_00|Create Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) form, you can create multiple normal purchase orders for available back orders—that is, sales orders with lines that list items not currently available in the company's stock and that have the '''Mark for PO''' check box selected. {br}

For more information on processing normal orders, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_Purchase_Order_Processing|Purchase Order Creation].
==Standard Orders==
 Orders of this type are available only if the ''Blanket and Standard Purchase Orders'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. {br}

Standard purchase orders are used as templates for normal orders. If your company regularly purchases from a vendor the same list of products in the same quantities, you can create a standard purchase order with those items listed in the required quantities by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. {br}

You can create multiple normal purchase orders that reference the standard purchase order. To do this, you add the entire standard sales order to a new normal purchase order, or add several lines from the standard sales order to a normal purchase order and edit the resulting item quantities. {br}

Unlike blanket purchase orders, standard orders have no expiration date, and their status does not change to ''Closed'' when all goods in the related normal orders are received. The quantities of items on standard orders do not update the items&rsquo; availability data. 
==Drop-Ship Orders==
Drop-ship purchase orders are used for goods that will be delivered directly from the vendor to the customer that ordered the goods from your company. These goods are not received in the inventory at your company. Orders of this type are available only if the ''Drop Shipments'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. {br}

To create a drop-ship purchase order, you create a new purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form and select the ''Drop Ship'' type. If there are sales orders for the items your company plans to purchase from the vendor, you can create a drop-ship order by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_50_00|Create Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) form. Once you select an item and a vendor for a new drop-ship order, sales orders (if they include a line with the selected inventory item that has the '''Mark for PO''' check box selected) are available for selection and can be added as document lines on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_50_00|Create Purchase Orders] form. For details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_Drop-Ship_Order_Flow|Drop-Ship Purchase Orders]. You can also add lines with the ''Service'' line type to drop-ship purchase orders to record extra charges without generating another invoice for the customer. For details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_Drop-Ship_Order_Flow|Drop-Ship Purchase Orders]. 
==Blanket Orders==
Blanket purchase orders are created for a longer time interval or a larger quantity of goods than your company currently needs. You may choose to order goods in larger volumes for reserved stock if considerable volume discounts are offered or the specified goods are not always available from the vendor. A blanket order has expiration date after which the order cannot be used for generating normal orders. Orders of this type are available only if the ''Blanket and Standard Purchase Orders'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. {br}

A blanket order can be fulfilled through multiple normal orders. To do this, you create purchase orders with the ''Normal'' type that reference the blanket order. In this case, the open quantity on the blanket order is reduced by the quantity specified in the purchase orders with the ''Normal'' type, and the price is transferred to normal orders from the blanket order. When the entire quantity of goods included in the blanket order is purchased and received through normal orders, the blanket order&rsquo;s status changes to ''Closed''.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[An order with the ''CM'' order type, or a credit memo order, is used to account for unauthorized returns from customers; this order includes a reference to the original invoice. You can use credit memo orders to adjust completed sales orders and account for unauthorized returns. {br}{TOC}
==Order Type Activation==
To give users in the system the ability to create credit memo orders, you need to select the ''CM'' order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form, select the '''Active''' check box, and save your changes.
==Template Settings==
Each predefined order type has an associated ''template'': a collection of settings that controls the processing of documents of the type, including what related documents it generates, whether it requires shipment, and how the automation behavior determines the conditions for changing the statuses of orders of the type. The template settings of the order type are displayed on the '''Template Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. The ''CM'' order type has the following template settings:[anchor|#ul_xbj_rwx_bdb]
*'''Automation Behavior''': ''Credit Memo''
*:The system uses this set of automation steps for a credit memo order. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Workflow_Customization|Workflow Customization by Means of Automation Steps].
*'''Default Operation''': ''Receipt''
*:This is the default inventory operation to be performed for a credit memo order.
*'''AR Document Type''': ''Credit Memo''
*:This setting means that an Accounts Receivable credit memo is generated during the processing of a credit memo order.
*'''Process Shipments''': Cleared
*:This setting means that no shipment is created during the processing of a credit memo order.

The template settings of the ''CM'' order type cannot be changed. If you want to modify the order processing, you can create a custom type based on the ''CM'' order type, and modify its settings based on your needs. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Custom_Order_Types|Custom Sales Order Types].'''Posting Settings'''
In the posting settings of the order type, you specify the set of rules for defining which accounts and subaccounts should be used to post General Ledger transactions during the processing of an order of this type. You specify the posting settings on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''Posting Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_PostingSettings|Posting Settings in Sales Order Types].
==Quick Processing of Credit Memo Orders==
To give users the ability to quickly process a credit memo order from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, you need to select the '''Allow Quick Process''' check box on the '''Template Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Quick_Process_Workflow|Quick Processing of Sales Orders].
==Approval of Credit Memo Orders==
Approvals can be configured for credit memo orders, if needed, because the '''Supports Approval''' check box is selected (and cannot be cleared) for the ''CM'' order type on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form.{br}

If your organization&rsquo;s policies require that orders of the ''CM'' type should be approved before processing, you can set up approval of credit memo orders. After approval has been configured, when a credit memo order is saved on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, it will be assigned to an approver, and its status will change to ''Pending Approval''. If it has been rejected, the order should be corrected, and after the approver has edited the order, it will be automatically reassigned for approval. If it has been approved, the order may be processed to completion. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Approvals|Sales Order Approval].
==Calculation of Freight Charges==
By default, freight is not calculated on credit memo orders. This is indicated by the '''Calculate Freight''' check box, which is cleared by default for the ''CM'' order type on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. For more information on the configuration and calculation of freight, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\CS__con_Freight_Calculation|Freight Calculation].
==Configuration of Document Processing==
In the ''CM'' order type settings, you can specify how the system processes the orders of this type and related documents that are generated during the processing of a ''CM'' order. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_AffectingProcessingDocs|Changing the Processing of Sales Documents].]]></column>

Template Settings Each predefined order type has an associated  template : a collection of settings that         controls the processing of documents of the type, including what related documents it         generates, whether it requires shipment, and how the automation behavior determines the         conditions for changing the statuses of orders of the type. The template settings of the         order type are displayed on the  Template Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form. The  CM  order type has the following         template settings: Automation Behavior :  Credit Memo The system uses this             set of automation steps for a credit memo order. For more information, see  Workflow Customization by Means of Automation Steps. Default Operation :  Receipt This is the default inventory             operation to be performed for a credit memo order. AR Document Type :  Credit Memo This setting means that an             Accounts Receivable credit memo is generated during the processing of a credit memo             order. Process Shipments : Cleared This setting means that no shipment             is created during the processing of a credit memo order. The template settings of the  CM  order type cannot be changed. If you want to modify         the order processing, you can create a custom type based on the  CM  order type, and         modify its settings based on your needs. For more information, see  Custom Sales Order Types. Posting Settings In the posting settings of the order type,         you specify the set of rules for defining which accounts and subaccounts should be used to         post General Ledger transactions during the processing of an order of this type. You specify         the posting settings on the  General Settings  tab ( Posting           Settings  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form.         For more information, see  Posting Settings in Sales Order Types. Quick Processing of Credit Memo Orders To give users the ability to quickly process a credit memo order from the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, you need to select the  Allow           Quick Process  check box on the  Template Settings  tab of         the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form. For more information, see  Quick Processing of Sales Orders. Approval of Credit Memo Orders Approvals can be configured for credit memo orders, if needed, because the            Supports Approval  check box is selected (and cannot be cleared) for         the  CM  order type on the  General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form. If your organization's policies require that orders of the  CM  type should be         approved before processing, you can set up approval of credit memo orders. After approval         has been configured, when a credit memo order is saved on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, it will be assigned to an approver, and its status will change to            Pending Approval . If it has been rejected, the order should be corrected, and after         the approver has edited the order, it will be automatically reassigned for approval. If it         has been approved, the order may be processed to completion. For more information, see  Sales Order Approval. Calculation of Freight Charges By default, freight is not calculated on credit memo orders. This is indicated by the            Calculate Freight  check box, which is cleared by default for the            CM  order type on the  General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form.

To process a return of items that were sold in a cash sale and do not require shipping, you create a cash return order (that is, an order of the ''CR'' order type). {br}{TOC}
==Activation of the Order Type==
To give users in the system the ability to create cash return orders, you need to select the ''CR'' order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form, select the '''Active''' check box, and save your changes.
==Template Settings==
Each predefined order type has an associated ''template'': a collection of settings that controls the processing of documents of the type, including what related documents it generates, whether it requires shipment, and how the automation behavior determines the conditions for changing the statuses of orders of the type. The template settings of the order type are displayed on the '''Template Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. The ''CR'' order type has the following template settings:[anchor|#ul_fn5_rwx_bdb]
*'''Automation Behavior''': ''Invoice''
*:The system uses the ''Invoice'' set of automation steps for a cash return order. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Workflow_Customization|Workflow Customization by Means of Automation Steps].
*'''Default Operation''': ''Receipt''
*:This is the default inventory operation to be performed for a cash return order.
*'''AR Document Type''': ''Cash Return''
*:This setting means that an Accounts Receivable cash return is generated during the processing of a cash return order.
*'''Process Shipments''': Cleared
*:This setting means that no shipment is created during the processing of a cash return.

Although the template settings of the ''CR'' order type can be edited, we do not recommend that you modify them. If you want to modify the order processing, you can create a custom type based on the ''CR'' order type, and modify its settings based on your needs. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Custom_Order_Types|Custom Sales Order Types].'''Posting Settings'''
In the posting settings of the order type, you specify the set of rules for defining which accounts and subaccounts should be used to post General Ledger transactions during the processing of an order of this order type. You specify the posting settings on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''Posting Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_PostingSettings|Posting Settings in Sales Order Types].

If your organization&rsquo;s policies require that orders of the ''CR'' type should be approved before processing, you can set up approval of cash return orders. After approval has been configured, when an order is saved on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, it will be assigned to an approver, and its status will change to ''Pending Approval''. If it has been rejected, the order should be corrected, and after the approver has edited the order, it will be automatically reassigned for approval. If it has been approved, the order may be processed further. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Approvals|Sales Order Approval].
==Calculation of Freight Charges==
By default, freight is calculated on cash return orders. This is indicated by the '''Calculate Freight''' check box, which is selected by default for the ''CR'' type on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form.

The template settings of the ''IN'' order type cannot be changed. If you want to modify the order processing, you can create a custom type based on the ''IN'' order type, and modify its settings based on your needs. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Custom_Order_Types|Custom Sales Order Types].'''Posting Settings'''
In the posting settings of the order type, you specify the set of rules for defining which accounts and subaccounts should be used to post General Ledger transactions during the processing of an order of this order type. You specify the posting settings on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''Posting Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_PostingSettings|Posting Settings in Sales Order Types].
==Quick Processing of Invoice Orders==
To give users the ability to quickly process an invoice order from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, you need to select the '''Allow Quick Process''' check box on the '''Template Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form.

If your organization&rsquo;s policies require that invoice orders be approved, you can set up their approval, as described in [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Approvals|Sales Order Approval]. If approval is required, when an invoice order is taken off hold on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, the system assigns an invoice order the ''Pending Approval'' status and selects an approver for the order, in accordance with the approval map used for invoice orders. If the approver approves the order, the order can be processed further. If the approver rejects the order, the order is assigned the ''Rejected'' status. If it has been rejected, the order should be corrected, and after the approver has edited the order, it will be automatically reassigned for approval. 
==Calculation of Freight Charges==
By default, freight is not calculated on invoice orders. This is indicated by the '''Calculate Freight''' check box, which is cleared by default for the ''IN'' type on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. For more information on the configuration and calculation of freight, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\CS__con_Freight_Calculation|Freight Calculation].

Activation of the Order Type To give users in the system the ability to create invoice orders, you need to select the            IN  order type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form, select the            Active  check box, and save your changes. Template Settings Each predefined order type has an associated  template : a collection of settings that         controls the processing of documents of the type, including what related documents it         generates, whether it requires shipment, and how the automation behavior determines the         conditions for changing the statuses of orders of the type. The template settings of the         order type are displayed on the  Template Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form.

A quote is a proposal of future sales to a particular customer for a specified price on the specified date. You can use order documents of the ''QT'' order type to plan production or sales orders and to register a customer&rsquo;s intention to buy particular goods. {br}{TOC}
==Order Type Activation==
To give users in the system the ability to create quotes, you need to select the ''QT'' order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form, select the '''Active''' check box, and save your changes.
==Template Settings==
Each predefined order type has an associated ''template'': a collection of settings that controls the processing of documents of the type, including what related documents it generates, whether it requires shipment, and how the automation behavior determines the conditions for changing the statuses of orders of the type. The template settings of the order type are displayed on the '''Template Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. The ''QT'' order type has the following template settings:[anchor|#ul_zxl_krx_bdb]
*'''Automation Behavior''': ''Quote''
*:The system uses the ''Quote'' set of automation steps for a quote order. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Workflow_Customization|Workflow Customization by Means of Automation Steps].
*'''Default Operation''': ''Issue''
*:This is the default inventory operation to be performed for a quote order.
*'''AR Document Type''': ''No Update''
*:This setting means that no Accounts Receivable document is generated during the processing of a quote.
*'''Process Shipments''': Cleared
*:This setting means that no shipment is created during the processing of a quote.

The template settings of the ''QT'' order type cannot be changed. If you want to modify the order processing, you can create a custom type based on the ''QT'' order type, and modify its settings based on your needs. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Custom_Order_Types|Custom Sales Order Types].'''Posting Settings'''
In the posting settings of the order type, you specify the set of rules for defining which accounts and subaccounts should be used to post General Ledger transactions during the processing of an order of this type.

For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_PostingSettings|Posting Settings in Sales Order Types]. {br}

When you create an order based on quote, the accounts and subaccounts specified in the quote are copied to the created order. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_scn_Sale_Quote|Processing Pre-Sale Quotes].
==Quick Processing of Quotes==
Quick processing cannot be configured for quotes because they are based on the ''Quote'' automation behavior, which does not support quick processing.
==Approval of Quote Orders==
Approvals can be configured for quotes, if needed, because the '''Supports Approval''' check box is selected (and cannot be cleared) for the ''QT'' order type on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. {br}

If your organization&rsquo;s policies require that quotes should be approved before processing, you can set up approval of ''QT'' orders. After approval has been configured, when a quote is saved on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, it will be assigned to an approver, and its status will change to ''Pending Approval''. If it has been rejected, the quote should be corrected, and after the approver has edited the order, it will be automatically reassigned for approval. If it has been approved, the quote may be processed further. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Approvals|Sales Order Approval].
==Calculation of Freight Charges==
Freight is calculated on quotes. This is indicated by the '''Calculate Freight''' check box, which is selected by default for the ''QT'' type on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form.

''RM'' is the basic order type used for returns with replacement or returns for credit within the product&rsquo;s warranty period. You use a document of this type for the authorization of customer returns.{br}{TOC}
==Activation of the Order Type==
To give users in the system the ability to create merchandise authorization return orders, you need to select the ''RM'' order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form, select the '''Active''' check box, and save your changes.
==Template Settings==
Each predefined order type has an associated ''template'': a collection of settings that controls the processing of documents of the type, including what related documents it generates, whether it requires shipment, and how the automation behavior determines the conditions for changing the statuses of orders of the type. The template settings of the order type are displayed on the '''Template Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. The ''RM'' order type has the following template settings:[anchor|#ul_fn5_rwx_bdb]
*'''Automation Behavior''': ''RMA Order''
*:The system uses the ''RMA Order'' set of automation steps for a merchandise authorization return order. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Workflow_Customization|Workflow Customization by Means of Automation Steps].
*'''Default Operation''': ''Issue''
*:This is the default inventory operation to be performed for a merchandise authorization return order.
*'''AR Document Type''': ''Invoice''
*:This setting means that an Accounts Receivable invoice is generated during the processing of a merchandise authorization return order.
*'''Process Shipments''': Selected
*:This setting means that the processing of a merchandise authorization return order requires the creation of a shipment.

The template settings of the ''RM'' order type cannot be changed. If you want to modify the order processing, you can create a custom type based on the ''RM'' order type, and modify its settings based on your needs. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Custom_Order_Types|Custom Sales Order Types].
==Posting Settings==
In the posting settings of the order type, you specify the set of rules for defining which accounts and subaccounts should be used to post General Ledger transactions during the processing of an order of this order type. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_PostingSettings|Posting Settings in Sales Order Types].
==Quick Processing of the RM Orders==
Quick processing cannot be configured for merchandise authorization return orders because they are based on the ''RMA Order'' automation behavior, which does not support quick processing.
==Approval of the RM Orders==
Approvals cannot be configured for merchandise authorization return orders, because the '''Supports Approval''' check box is cleared (and cannot be selected) for the ''RM'' order type on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form.
==Calculation of Freight Charges==
By default, freight is calculated on merchandise authorization return orders. This is indicated by the '''Calculate Freight''' check box, which is selected by default for the ''RM'' type on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. For more information on the configuration and calculation of freight, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\CS__con_Freight_Calculation|Freight Calculation].
==Configuration of Document Processing==
In the ''RM'' order type settings, you can specify how the system processes orders of this type and related documents that are generated during the processing of an ''RM'' order.

*'''Process Shipments''': Selected
*:This setting means that the processing of a sales order with allocation requires the creation of a shipment.
*'''Require Stock Allocation''': Selected
*:This setting means that orders of this type require the allocation (reservation) of ordered stock items in inventory before the orders can be removed from hold.

The template settings of the ''SA'' order type cannot be changed. If you want to modify the order processing, you can create a custom type based on the ''SA'' order type, and modify its settings based on your needs. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Custom_Order_Types|Custom Sales Order Types].
==Allocation of Items in Inventory==
When you save a new order of the ''SA'' type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, the specified quantities of the line items are automatically reserved specifically for this order. You can view the allocation for each line item, and change it, if needed. If there is an insufficient quantity in the specified warehouse, the system automatically splits the requested quantity into two allocation schedules: one with the available quantity reserved in the specified warehouse, and one with the remaining unallocated quantity, which you can allocate manually. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Sale_with_Reserve|Stock Reservation in Sales Orders]. 
==Posting Settings==
In the posting settings of the order type, you specify the set of rules for defining which accounts and subaccounts should be used to post General Ledger transactions during the processing of an order of this type. You specify the posting settings on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''Posting Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_PostingSettings|Posting Settings in Sales Order Types].
==Quick Processing of Sales Orders with Allocation==
To give users the ability to quickly process a sales order with allocation from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, you need to select the '''Allow Quick Process''' check box on the '''Template Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Quick_Process_Workflow|Quick Processing of Sales Orders].
==Approval of Sales Orders with Allocation==
Approvals can be configured for sales orders with allocation, if needed, because the '''Supports Approval''' check box is selected (and cannot be changed) for the ''SA'' order type on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. {br}

If your organization&rsquo;s policies require that orders of the ''SA'' type should be approved before they can be shipped, you can set up approval of sales orders with allocation. After approval has been configured, when a sales order is saved, it will be assigned to an approver, and its status will change to ''Pending Approval''. If it has been rejected, the order should be corrected, and after the approver edits the order, it will be automatically reassigned for approval. If it has been approved, the order may be processed further to completion. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Approvals|Sales Order Approval].
==Calculation of Freight Charges==
By default, freight is calculated on sales orders with allocation. This is indicated by the '''Calculate Freight''' check box, which is selected by default on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. For more information on the configuration and calculation of freight, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\CS__con_Freight_Calculation|Freight Calculation].
==Credit Verification for Sales Orders with Allocation==
For the ''SA'' order type, the '''Hold Document on Failed Credit Check''' check box is selected by default on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. This means that once a sales order with allocation is saved, the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, the system checks the credit history of the customer to verify that the customer has not exceeded the specified credit limit or days past due. If the customer fails the credit check, the status of the order changes to ''Credit Hold''. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Credit_Check|Checking the Credit Limit in Sales Documents].
==Configuration of Document Processing==
In the ''SA'' order type settings, you can specify how the system processes orders of this type and related documents that are generated during the order processing. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_AffectingProcessingDocs|Changing the Processing of Sales Documents].

Quick Processing of Sales Orders with Allocation To give users the ability to quickly process a sales order with allocation from the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, you need to select the  Allow Quick           Process  check box on the  Template Settings  tab of the             ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form. For more information, see  Quick Processing of Sales Orders. Approval of Sales Orders with Allocation Approvals can be configured for sales orders with allocation, if needed, because the            Supports Approval  check box is selected (and cannot be changed) for         the  SA  order type on the  General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form.  If your organization's policies require that orders of the  SA  type should be         approved before they can be shipped, you can set up approval of sales orders with         allocation. After approval has been configured, when a sales order is saved, it will be         assigned to an approver, and its status will change to  Pending Approval . If it has         been rejected, the order should be corrected, and after the approver edits the order, it         will be automatically reassigned for approval. If it has been approved, the order may be         processed further to completion. For more information, see  Sales Order Approval. Calculation of Freight Charges By default, freight is calculated on sales orders with allocation. This is indicated by the            Calculate Freight  check box, which is selected by default on the            General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types         (SO201000) form. For more information on the configuration and calculation of freight, see            Freight Calculation. Credit Verification for Sales Orders with Allocation For the  SA  order type, the  Hold Document on Failed Credit           Check  check box is selected by default on the  General           Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form. This         means that once a sales order with allocation is saved, the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders         (SO301000) form, the system checks the credit history of the customer to verify that the         customer has not exceeded the specified credit limit or days past due. If the customer fails         the credit check, the status of the order changes to  Credit Hold . For more         information, see  Checking the Credit Limit in Sales Documents. Configuration of Document Processing In the  SA  order type settings, you can specify how the system processes orders of         this type and related documents that are generated during the order processing.

A sales order is a document with the ''SO'' order type that you create to represent a customer request to buy goods in the specified quantities on the specified date, with the items in the sales order being shipped. A sales order of this type can be created based on a quote or opportunity, or you can enter all its settings from scratch.{br}{TOC}
==Activation of the Order Type==
To give users in the system the ability to create sales orders of this type, you need to open the ''SO'' order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form, select the '''Active''' check box, and save your changes.
==Template Settings==
Each predefined order type has an associated ''template'': a collection of settings that controls the processing of documents of the type, including what related documents it generates, whether it requires shipment, and how the automation behavior determines the conditions for changing the statuses of orders of the type. The template settings of the order type are displayed on the '''Template Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. The ''SO'' order type has the following template settings:[anchor|#ul_jcd_qwx_bdb]
*'''Automation Behavior''': ''Sales Order''
*:The system uses the ''Sales Order'' set of automation steps for a sales order. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Workflow_Customization|Workflow Customization by Means of Automation Steps].
*'''Default Operation''': ''Issue''
*:This is the default inventory operation to be performed for a sales order.
*'''AR Document Type''': ''Invoice''
*:This setting means that an Accounts Receivable invoice is generated during the processing of a sales order.
*'''Process Shipments''': Selected
*:This setting means that the processing of a sales order requires the creation of a shipment.

The template settings of the ''SO'' order type cannot be changed. If you want to modify the order processing, you can create a custom type based on the ''SO'' order type, and modify its settings based on your needs. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Custom_Order_Types|Custom Sales Order Types].'''Posting Settings'''
In the posting settings of the order type, you specify the set of rules for defining which accounts and subaccounts should be used to post General Ledger transactions during the processing of an order of this order type. You specify the posting settings on the '''General Settings''' tab ('''Posting Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_PostingSettings|Posting Settings in Sales Order Types].
==Quick Processing of Sales Orders==
To give users the ability to quickly process a sales order from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, you need to select the '''Allow Quick Process''' check box on the '''Template Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Quick_Process_Workflow|Quick Processing of Sales Orders].

If your organization&rsquo;s policies require that orders of the ''SO'' type should be approved before they can be processed, you can set up approval of sales orders. After approval has been configured, when a sales order is saved, it will be assigned to an approver, and its status will change to ''Pending Approval''. If it has been rejected, the order should be corrected, and after the approver has edited the order, it will be automatically reassigned for approval. If it has been approved, the order may be processed to completion. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Approvals|Sales Order Approval].
==Calculation of Freight Charges==
Freight is calculated on sales orders of the ''SO'' type. This is indicated by the '''Calculate Freight''' check box, which by default is selected for the ''SO'' order type on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. For more information on the configuration and calculation of freight, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\CS__con_Freight_Calculation|Freight Calculation].
==Credit Verification for Sales Orders==

This means that once a sales order is saved the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, the system checks the credit history of the customer to verify that the customer has not exceeded the specified credit limit or days past due. If the customer fails the credit check, the status of the order changes to ''Credit Hold''. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Credit_Check|Checking the Credit Limit in Sales Documents].
==Configuration of Document Processing==

In addition to the predefined order types Acumatica ERP provides for common order processing operations, if the ''Custom Order Types'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can create more order types to support business processes in your company that cannot be supported with the predefined order types.{br}

You configure custom order types that are based on the available templates, which generally involves creating a new order type with a predefined template and making slight changes to the order type settings. Custom order types that you have configured appear for selection in the '''Order Type '''box of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. Users can then create new orders of custom types and process them in accordance with the automation behavior configured for the template. ((({S:Warn}Although the '''Template Settings''' tab is not hidden, we do not recommend that you modify the available templates. In exceptional cases, new custom templates can be created with the help of the Acumatica ERP development team, and custom order types can be based on those templates. 
)))
The sections below describe the creation of custom order types based on predefined templates and custom templates. {br}{TOC}
==Order Types Based on Predefined Templates==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form, you can view the settings of predefined order types and create new custom order types that are based on predefined templates. When you create a new order type based on a predefined template, you make minor modifications of the predefined template order type. For example, you can create separate quote order types, based on the ''QT (Quote)'' template, for the customer price classes of wholesale, retail, and catalog customers. These types might use different numbering sequences to determine order IDs and different sets of General Ledger accounts and subaccounts. Also, the types might have different processing options specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] form, such as the setting that determines whether the system performs a credit check when the quotes are entered. {br}

The following order type templates are available: [anchor|#ul_knm_j1m_1w]
*''CM (Credit Memo)'': The built-in template for the ''CM'' order type. You use documents of this type to adjust already-completed sales orders.
*''CR (Cash Return)'': The built-in template for the ''CR'' order type. Documents of this type are used when the customer returns goods from a cash sale order that did not involve shipping.
*''IN (Invoice)'': The built-in template for the ''IN'' order type. You use documents of this type to bill the customer for shipped goods.
*''CS (Cash Sale)'': The built-in template for the ''CS'' order type. You use documents of this type to register cash sales.
*''QT (Quote)'': The built-in template for the ''QT'' order type. Documents of this type register the customer&rsquo;s intention to buy goods in the specified quantity, on the specified date, and at the specified price.
*''RC (Return for Credit)'': The built-in template for the ''RC'' order type. You use documents of this type to register customer returns for credit without replacement.
*''RM (Generic Authorized Return)'': The built-in template for the ''RM'' order type. Documents of this type register customer returns with replacement for credit within the product&rsquo;s warranty period.
*''RR (Return with Replacement)'': The built-in template for the ''RR'' order type. You use documents of this type to register customer returns with exact replacement of goods.
*''SA (Sales Order with Allocation)'': The built-in template for the ''SA'' order type. You create documents of this type to record customers&rsquo; requests to purchase goods and to reserve the requested goods for the orders.
*''SO (Sales Order)'': The built-in template for the ''SO'' order type. Documents of this type are created to record customers&rsquo; requests to purchase goods that should then be shipped to the customer location.
*''TR (Transfer)'': The built-in template for the ''TR'' order type. You generate documents of this type to record stock replenishment by transferring goods from the source warehouse to a destination warehouse. 
*:This order type appears only if the ''Multiple Warehouses'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.

==Order Types Based on Custom Templates==
 The functionality of order types is implemented through automation steps developed for each of the forms involved in order processing: [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders], [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]), and [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]). This functionality defines, for orders of specific types with each status, what actions are enabled and under what conditions. The details of automation steps are specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_00|Automation Steps] ([~/?ScreenId=SM205000|SM205000]) form. Automation behaviors use various built-in order and shipment plans. The following automation behaviors are available: [anchor|#ul_gwm_j1m_1w]
*'''Sales Order''': Implements typical sales order and transfer processing with approval
*'''Invoice''': Implements typical invoice order and cash sale order processing with approval
*'''Quote''': Implements typical quote processing with approval
*'''Credit Memo''': Implements typical credit memo processing
*'''RMA Order''': Implements processing for typical types of customer returns: returns for credit, returns with replacement, and RMA returns

The settings in the '''Operations''' area on the '''Template Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form affect the integration of orders with the Inventory and Accounts Receivable modules. For example, for the ''RC (Return for Credit)'' template, the default inventory operation for receiving the returned goods will be ''Receipt'' in the Inventory module and a credit memo will be generated in the Accounts Receivable module to reimburse the customer for the returned goods. With the ''RR (Return for Replacement)'' template, no Accounts Receivable document will be generated for an order of the type, while in the Inventory module, the release of the receipt (the default inventory operation for this order type) will initiate the creation of an issue to account for the replacement sent to the customer in the same quantity with the same price.

The order workflow in the Sales Orders module depends on the order type and your organizational requirements, and may include multiple operations, such as creating and confirming a shipment, creating an invoice, and preparing printed forms. In Acumatica ERP, users can simplify multi-step processing and configure quick processing for a particular order type so that users can process the orders of this type with just one click. Quick order processing is mostly intended for use at points of sale with a single warehouse.{br}{TOC}
==Configuring Quick Processing for an Order Type==
For quick order processing to be used, a user must allow quick processing for a particular order type and configure the actions to be performed during quick processing. The user allows quick processing for a particular order type by selecting the '''Allow Quick Process''' check box on the '''Template Settings''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. This causes the '''Quick Process Settings''' tab to appear on the form. On this tab, the user configures the sequence of order processing actions to be used by default for orders of this type. For each particular order of the type being processed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, the list of actions to be performed can be changed. For step-by-step instructions on configuring an order type for quick processing, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Configure_Quick_Processing|To Configure Quick Processing for an Order Type].{br}

Quick processing can be configured for predefined and custom order types, except for order types that are based on the ''Quote'' and ''RMA Order'' automation behaviors (specified on the '''Template Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] form). Also, the sales order lines that are marked for purchasing—that is, those with the '''Mark for PO''' check box selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form—are excluded from quick processing because the creation of a purchase order is not included in the quick processing configuration flow.
==Configuring Quick Processing for an Order==
After quick processing is configured for a particular order type, a user can run quick processing from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. On the form toolbar of this form, the '''Quick Process''' button appears for the orders of this type. When a user clicks this button for an order with the ''Open'' status, the system opens the '''Process Order''' dialog box. In this dialog box, the user can change the following settings before quick processing an order:[anchor|#ul_enw_34b_wcb]
*The warehouse ID (if applicable for the order type) of the warehouse from which the goods will be shipped.
*The date on which the shipment will be prepared.
*:After the user specifies the shipment date, the system checks the availability of the ordered items for the specified date and displays the result in the '''Availability''' section of the dialog box. The following availability states may be displayed: 
**Green mark: The ordered items with the ''Ship Complete'' rule are available for shipping. The items with the ''Cancel Remainder'' shipping rule are partially available or not available at all.

==Running Quick Processing==
When a user launches quick processing, the system performs the selected processing steps and notifies the user about the completion of each step in the '''Processing Results''' window. The window also shows links to all documents prepared during processing, so that after processing has completed, the user can click these links, review the created documents, and send them for printing.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Quick Processing of Sales Orders The order workflow in the Sales Orders module depends on the order type and your     organizational requirements, and may include multiple operations, such as creating and     confirming a shipment, creating an invoice, and preparing printed forms. In  Acumatica ERP,     users can simplify multi-step processing and configure quick processing for a particular order     type so that users can process the orders of this type with just one click. Quick order     processing is mostly intended for use at points of sale with a single warehouse. Configuring Quick Processing for an Order Type For quick order processing to be used, a user must allow quick processing for a particular     order type and configure the actions to be performed during quick processing. The user allows     quick processing for a particular order type by selecting the  Allow Quick      Process  check box on the  Template Settings  tab on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form. This causes the  Quick Process      Settings  tab to appear on the form. On this tab, the user configures the sequence     of order processing actions to be used by default for orders of this type. For each particular     order of the type being processed on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, the     list of actions to be performed can be changed. For step-by-step instructions on configuring an     order type for quick processing, see  To Configure Quick Processing for an Order Type. Quick processing can be configured for predefined and custom order types, except for order     types that are based on the  Quote  and  RMA Order  automation behaviors (specified on     the  Template Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types form).     Also, the sales order lines that are marked for purchasing—that is, those with the       Mark for PO  check box selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders     form—are excluded from quick processing because the creation of a purchase order is not     included in the quick processing configuration flow. Configuring Quick Processing for an Order After quick processing is configured for a particular order type, a user can run quick     processing from the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form. On the form toolbar of this     form, the  Quick Process  button appears for the orders of this type. When     a user clicks this button for an order with the  Open  status, the system opens the       Process Order  dialog box. In this dialog box, the user can change the     following settings before quick processing an order: The warehouse ID (if applicable for the order type) of the warehouse from which the goods      will be shipped. The date on which the shipment will be prepared. After the user specifies the shipment       date, the system checks the availability of the ordered items for the specified date and       displays the result in the  Availability  section of the dialog box. The       following availability states may be displayed:  Green mark: The ordered items with the  Ship Complete  rule are available for        shipping. The items with the  Cancel Remainder  shipping rule are partially available or        not available at all. Yellow mark: The ordered items are partially available, and back-ordering is allowed for        these items. Red mark: The ordered items are not available for shipment, so the order cannot be        processed further. The shipping and invoicing operations (if applicable for the order type) to be       performed during quick processing. The user can change the default set of operations, which is       copied from the settings of the order type. If the printing or emailing settings of       the customer specified in the order differs from the configured processing flow, the system       will display a notification. After reviewing the processing details, the user clicks  OK  in the     dialog box to launch quick processing of the order. Running Quick Processing When a user launches quick processing, the system performs the selected processing steps and     notifies the user about the completion of each step in the  Processing      Results  window. The window also shows links to all documents prepared during     processing, so that after processing has completed, the user can click these links, review the     created documents, and send them for printing.  For a particular order type, you can select the  Open All Created Documents in      New Tabs  on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form, to make the system     open the prepared documents in new browser tabs after quick processing has finished. If a sales order contains items located in different warehouses, users need to run quick     processing for each warehouse separately. For a particular sales order, the shipment from the     previous processing must be completed before the next run of the quick processing can be     performed.  ]]></column>

Each order type has its own posting settings that specify to which accounts and subaccounts specific General Ledger transactions should be posted during the processing of orders of this order type. The following sections describe which accounts and subaccounts you can specify to be used for posting.{br}{TOC}
==Posting Settings of Order Types==
The system can obtain the accounts for transactions generated during the processing of a sales order from several sources, depending on the policies established in your company. For each order type, you can specify the source of the following accounts: [anchor|#ul_y31_vm3_kdb]
*The sales account (of the ''Income'' type) and subaccount to be used for each inventory item that is sold and issued from your company&rsquo;s inventory. The system can obtain the sales account from the settings of the inventory item, warehouse (if applicable), posting class, customer location (if applicable), or the reason code.
*:((({S:Hint}This setting overrides the posting settings of a sales account specified in the posting class assigned to an item.
)))
*The freight account (of the ''Income'' type) and subaccount to be used for recording the freight revenue for each item sold. The system can obtain the freight account from the settings of the order type, customer location (if applicable), or ship via code.
*The discount account (of the ''Income'' type) and subaccount to be used for recording the discounts provided for an order of this type. The system can obtain the discount account from the settings of the order type or the customer location (if applicable).

==Rules for Selecting Subaccounts==
If the ''Subaccounts'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you also need to specify for each order type how the system selects the appropriate subaccounts to be used for transaction posting. By default, for the subaccounts, the system uses the same sources as those for the corresponding accounts (as summarized in the previous section). You can configure the posting settings in an order type to combine the segment values of multiple subaccount segments from different sources to get subaccounts that would perfectly reflect all the details of the transaction. For more details on the rules for combining subaccounts, see [HelpRoot_Financials\GL__CON_Combined_Subaccounts|Combining Subaccounts].

A third-party carrier used to deliver products from your company to a customer can charge your company specific freight amounts that depend on the weights or volumes of the packages in shipments. The carrier may also set restrictions on the weight or volume of packages. Landed costs incurred for shipments delivered from vendors to your company can be allocated by the weight or volume of the items in the shipment. {br}

In Acumatica ERP, you can configure the system to automatically calculate freight charges or suggest a box for packing the order for shipping based on the total weight and volume of stock and non-stock items in this order. Base units of weight and volume, which are used by default for each inventory item, are specified in the configuration settings of a company on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) form. For each particular inventory item, you can specify the weight and volume (and, optionally, change the units of weight and volume) on the '''Packaging''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. For each item, its ordered quantity specified in the sales units is calculated in the base units and multiplied by the weight of the base unit. You can view the calculated weight and volume totals for a sales order on the '''Totals''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. For more information on specifying base and item units of measure, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_BaseWeightVolumeUOMs|Units of Weight and Volume].{br}

If freight calculation is configured for a sales order, the system calculates freight charges by using freight rates that are based on the total shipment weight and (optionally) volume. The weight of a shipment is compared to break points, and the first one that is less than the shipment weight provides the freight rate. For more information on calculating freight charges, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\CS__con_Freight_Calculation|Freight Calculation].{br}

If the ''Automatic Packaging'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the system uses the packaging options of the ship via code and the items' weight and volume to determine the set of boxes for each shipment. If integration with any of the nationwide carriers is also configured, you can select the best rates for boxes and print labels with tracking numbers for each package.

The shipping rules specified for a particular sales order define whether the goods for the sales order should be shipped only in full or partial shipments for the available quantities are allowed. This topic explains how you can set up the shipping rules to be used in sales orders by default.
==Shipping Settings of a Customer==
You can specify the shipping rule for each customer class in the '''Default Delivery Settings''' section on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_10_00|Customer Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR201000|AR201000]) form. Then when you create a new customer and select this class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form, the shipping rule specified in the customer class will be copied to the '''Shipping Rule''' box on the '''Delivery Settings''' tab. If needed, for the selected customer, you can override the default shipping rule copied from the customer class.{br}

When you create a new sales order on the on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form and select the customer, the system inserts the default shipping rule of the selected customer as the document-level shipping rule for this sales order in the '''Shipping Rule''' box on the '''Shipping Settings''' tab. Then when you add lines to the sales order, the system specifies the document-level shipping rule to each added line by default. ((({S:Hint}You can override the document-level shipping rule so that all new lines in this sales order will be added with this new rule (which differs from the customer&rsquo;s default shipping rule). Also, you can change the shipping rule manually in any sales order line.
)))
==Shipping Settings of Customer Locations==
If the ''Business Account Locations'' feature is enabled in your system on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the system copies the default shipping rule values from the customer to the customer locations. If needed, you can specify different default shipping rules for different customer locations on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_20|Customer Locations] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303020|AR303020]) form.
==Shipping Settings for Transfer Orders==
Because transfer orders are created to account for transfers of items between warehouses, and warehouses are assigned to particular branches, default shipping rules can be specified for branches on the '''Delivery Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_20_00|Branches] ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) form.

Based on where items are ordered from, they may be subject to particular sales taxes. The rate and the amount of the sales taxes that apply to sales orders and SO invoices can depend on many factors, including the types of items purchased, the delivery address of the customer, the address of the selling branch, and the business presence of your organization in the customer location.{br}

If automatic calculation of taxes is configured in your system, the system determines the applicable taxes for each sales order or invoice based on the tax categories of the items sold and the tax zones assigned to customer locations. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Financials\TX__MNG_Managing_Tax_Zones_and_Categories|Managing Tax Zones and Categories]. {br}

With Acumatica ERP, to minimize tax-related errors that users make when they enter sales orders, cash sales, and invoices, you can provide default values for the tax zones used for tax calculation, as described in this topic.{br}{TOC}
==Sales Taxes on Sales Orders==
You enter customers&rsquo; sales orders on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. The system inserts the default tax zone (displayed in the '''Customer Tax Zone''' box on the '''Financial Details''' tab) into the sales order, copying it as follows:[anchor|#ol_qlt_w2h_2l]
#From the tax zone specified for the opportunity on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) form if the order has been created from an opportunity that has a tax zone specified.
#From the tax zone of the customer location, if one has been specified. Tax zones for customer locations can be specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_20|Customer Locations] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303020|AR303020]).
#From the tax zone determined by the ZIP code of the '''Ship To''' location specified in the sales order if no tax zone has been specified for this customer location and if the sales order will be shipped by an integrated carrier.
#:((({S:Hint}In the order, the ship via code denotes how the order is shipped. To check whether the ship via code denotes a delivery method of a common carrier, use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_75_00|Ship via Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]) form.
)))
#From the tax zone associated with the selling branch, which is specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_20_00|Branches] ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) form, if no tax zone has been specified for this customer location and if the order will not be shipped by an integrated carrier. If the ''Branch Accounting'' feature is not activated on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the tax zone assigned to your organization on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) form is used.
{br}

If you know exactly which tax zone should be used for a specific sales order, you can override the default setting and select it in the '''Customer Tax Zone''' box.
==Taxes Applicable to Freight Sales==
If your company provides freight as an additional service that is subject to taxes, you configure a ship via code for the shipping options provided by your company (that is, a ship via code with the '''Common Carrier''' check box cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_75_00|Ship via Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]) form), in the ship via code settings, you can specify the appropriate tax category that applies to freight. The list of taxes that apply to the freight includes the taxes that are present both in the tax category of the ship via code and in the tax zone of the branch that sold the goods. {br}

If the goods are being shipped by an integrated carrier, the tax category is applied to only the amount of freight that exceeds the freight cost. The list of taxes applied to the specified amount consists of the taxes from both the tax category and the tax zone of the customer&rsquo;s delivery address (the specified tax zone of the customer location or, if one has not been specified, the tax zone automatically determined by the ZIP code of the delivery address). 
==Sales Taxes on Sales Orders Invoices==
When a sales order is shipped, the system generates an SO invoice, which you can view on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form. For these invoices, the system copies all the details from the associated sales orders. Sales orders with different tax zones cannot be added to the same invoice. When you mass-create invoices for multiple sales orders by using the ''Prepare Invoice'' action on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) form, the system groups the sales orders by tax zone.((({S:Hint}When a user mass-prepares invoices to a customer that is assigned to the tax zone configured for Avalara, shipments that have different ship-to addresses can be consolidated into one SO invoice.
)))
Also, you can manually create invoices to bill customers for services rendered, or you can enter cash sales when the customer immediately pays for the services. You can create an invoice by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) or the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form. Cash sales can be created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_40_00|Cash Sales] ([~/?ScreenId=AR304000|AR304000]) form. {br}

The system inserts the default tax zone for the accounts receivable or SO invoice or cash sale (displayed in the '''Customer Tax Zone''' box on the '''Financial Details''' tab of the applicable form), copying it as follows:[anchor|#ol_npz_xch_2l]
#From the tax zone specified for the opportunity on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) form if the order has been created from an opportunity that has a tax zone specified.
#From the tax zone of the customer location specified on the document. Tax zones for customer locations can be selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_20|Customer Locations] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303020|AR303020]) form.
#From the tax zone associated with the selling branch if no tax zone is specified for this customer location. If the ''Branch Accounting'' feature is not activated on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the tax zone assigned to your organization on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_20_00|Branches] ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) form is used. 

If you know exactly which tax zone should be used on a specific invoice or cash sale document, you can override the default tax zone and select it in the '''Customer Tax Zone''' box.{br}

On release of the SO invoice, the system generates a batch of the following general ledger transactions.[anchor|#table_wlz_zx5_rr]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="33%" ! Account
!width="33%" ! Debit
!width="33%" ! Credit
|- 
| Accounts Receivable account
| Amount + Tax Amount
| 
|- 
| Sales account
| 
| Amount
|- 
| Tax Payable account
| 
| Tax amount
|}
==Tax Calculation with Specialized Third-Party Software==
If your system is integrated with the AvaTax service of Avalara or another third-party tax calculation software, the applicable taxes are calculated by this service or software and recorded to the sales order or invoice when you save the document. {br}

Once you remove a sales order or a SO invoice from hold, the system checks whether the customer location specified in the document is in the tax zone configured for the tax calculation software. If so, the system sends a request to the tax calculation software to determine the applicable taxes, based on the customer location address, entity code, available exemption certificates, and tax rules (if any). The tax amounts computed by the tax calculation software are sent to Acumatica ERP and can be reviewed on the '''Tax Details''' tab of the document entry form. ((({S:Hint}For sales orders, the taxes are shown for informational purposes only. Only taxes on invoices are actually reported. 
)))
The way the system applies taxes depends on the settings of the origin ('''From''') and destination ('''To''') addresses specified in a document (sales order or invoice). For the addresses that are specified in the document header, the system inserts the address of the company branch (as specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_20_00|Branches] ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) form) as the '''From''' address, and the address of the customer location specified in the document as the '''To''' address. {br}

The system inserts the '''From''' and '''To''' addresses of each sales order line by using the following rules:[anchor|#ul_f5j_hwd_5db]
*If the customer picks up the ordered item directly from a warehouse (that is, if the '''Will Call''' check box is selected on the '''Shipping Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form), the system uses the '''From''' and '''To''' addresses of the warehouse selected in the sales order line, as specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form.
*If the ordered item is shipped via a common carrier (that is, if the '''Will Call''' check box is cleared on the '''Shipping Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form), the system uses the warehouse address as the '''From''' address and the '''Ship-To''' address of the sales order as the '''To''' address.

In the lines of sales orders marked for drop-shipment, the system inserts the address of the default location of the vendor as the '''From''' address. The system inserts the '''Ship-To''' address specified in the sales order as the '''To''' address. In each related line of the drop-ship invoice, the system uses the vendor&rsquo;s location address in the related purchase receipt as the '''From''' address. The system inserts the '''Ship-To''' address in the related purchase order as the '''To''' address.{br}

In an SO invoice, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form, the system uses the following rules to insert the from and ship-to information: [anchor|#_7013f79c-5b39-402d-95cb-101b32c478af]
*In the document header, the system uses the address of the company branch as the '''From''' address, and the '''Ship-To''' address of the SO invoice as the '''To''' address.
*In the document lines, if the SO invoice was prepared from a sales order that requires shipment, the system uses the address of the warehouse specified in the line as the '''From''' address, and the '''Ship-To''' address of the shipment as the '''To''' address.
*In the document lines, if the SO invoice was prepared from an order that does not require shipment, the system uses the address of the warehouse or branch specified in the line as the '''From''' address, and the '''Ship-To''' address of the sales order as the '''To''' address.
*If the SO invoice was prepared for multiple shipments, for each line, the system uses the address specified for the line in the corresponding shipment.
*:((({S:Hint}If multiple shipments or sales orders with different addresses are included in the SO invoice, the system selects the '''Multiple Ship-To Addresses''' check box on the '''Address Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] form. 
)))
*In a line added to the SO invoice without a link to sales order or shipment, the system inserts the address of the company branch as the '''From''' address, and the '''Ship-To''' address of the SO invoice as the '''To''' address.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Tax Application in Sales Documents Based on where items are ordered from, they may be subject to particular sales taxes. The rate     and the amount of the sales taxes that apply to sales orders and SO invoices can depend on many     factors, including the types of items purchased, the delivery address of the customer, the     address of the selling branch, and the business presence of your organization in the customer     location. If automatic calculation of taxes is configured in your system, the system determines the     applicable taxes for each sales order or invoice based on the tax categories of the items sold     and the tax zones assigned to customer locations. For more information, see  Managing Tax Zones and Categories.  With  Acumatica ERP,     to minimize tax-related errors that users make when they enter sales orders, cash sales, and     invoices, you can provide default values for the tax zones used for tax calculation, as     described in this topic. Sales Taxes on Sales Orders You enter customers' sales orders on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form. The     system inserts the default tax zone (displayed in the  Customer Tax Zone      box on the  Financial Details  tab) into the sales order, copying it as      follows: From the tax zone specified for the opportunity on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) Opportunities       (CR304000) form if the order has been created from an opportunity that has a tax zone       specified. From the tax zone of the customer location, if one has been specified. Tax zones for       customer locations can be specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303020|AR303020]) Customer Locations (AR303020). From the tax zone determined by the ZIP code of the  Ship To  location       specified in the sales order if no tax zone has been specified for this customer location and       if the sales order will be shipped by an integrated carrier. In the order, the ship via        code denotes how the order is shipped. To check whether the ship via code denotes a delivery        method of a common carrier, use the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]) Ship via Codes (CS207500)       form. From the tax zone associated with the selling branch, which is specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) Branches (CS102000) form, if no tax zone has been specified for this       customer location and if the order will not be shipped by an integrated carrier. If the         Branch Accounting  feature is not activated on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features       (CS100000) form, the tax zone assigned to your organization on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) Companies (CS101500) form is used. If you know exactly which tax zone should be used for a specific sales order, you can override     the default setting and select it in the  Customer Tax Zone  box. Taxes Applicable to Freight Sales If your company provides freight as an additional service that is subject to taxes, you     configure a ship via code for the shipping options provided by your company (that is, a ship via     code with the  Common Carrier  check box cleared on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS207500|CS207500]) Ship via Codes (CS207500) form), in the ship via code settings, you     can specify the appropriate tax category that applies to freight. The list of taxes that apply     to the freight includes the taxes that are present both in the tax category of the ship via code     and in the tax zone of the branch that sold the goods.  If the goods are being shipped by an integrated carrier, the tax category is applied to only     the amount of freight that exceeds the freight cost. The list of taxes applied to the specified     amount consists of the taxes from both the tax category and the tax zone of the customer's     delivery address (the specified tax zone of the customer location or, if one has not been     specified, the tax zone automatically determined by the ZIP code of the delivery address).  Sales Taxes on Sales Orders Invoices When a sales order is shipped, the system generates an SO invoice, which you can view on the        ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form. For these invoices, the system copies all the     details from the associated sales orders. Sales orders with different tax zones cannot be added     to the same invoice. When you mass-create invoices for multiple sales orders by using the       Prepare Invoice  action on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) Process Orders (SO501000) form, the     system groups the sales orders by tax zone. When a user mass-prepares invoices to a customer that is assigned to the tax zone     configured for Avalara, shipments that have different ship-to addresses can be consolidated into     one SO invoice. Also, you can manually create invoices to bill customers for services rendered, or you can     enter cash sales when the customer immediately pays for the services. You can create an invoice     by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) or the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices     (SO303000) form. Cash sales can be created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR304000|AR304000]) Cash Sales (AR304000)     form.  The system inserts the default tax zone for the accounts receivable or SO invoice or cash sale     (displayed in the  Customer Tax Zone  box on the  Financial      Details  tab of the applicable form), copying it as follows: From the tax zone specified for the opportunity on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) Opportunities      (CR304000) form if the order has been created from an opportunity that has a tax zone      specified. From the tax zone of the customer location specified on the document. Tax zones for customer      locations can be selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303020|AR303020]) Customer Locations (AR303020) form. From the tax zone associated with the selling branch if no tax zone is specified for this      customer location. If the  Branch Accounting  feature is not activated on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, the tax zone assigned to your organization on the         ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) Branches (CS102000) form is used.  If you know exactly which tax zone should be used on a specific invoice or cash sale document,     you can override the default tax zone and select it in the  Customer Tax      Zone  box. On release of the SO invoice, the system generates a batch of the following general ledger     transactions. Account Debit Credit Accounts Receivable account Amount + Tax Amount Sales account Amount Tax Payable account Tax amount Tax Calculation with Specialized Third-Party Software If your system is integrated with the AvaTax service of Avalara or another third-party tax     calculation software, the applicable taxes are calculated by this service or software and     recorded to the sales order or invoice when you save the document.  Once you remove a sales order or a SO invoice from hold, the system checks whether the     customer location specified in the document is in the tax zone configured for the tax     calculation software. If so, the system sends a request to the tax calculation software to     determine the applicable taxes, based on the customer location address, entity code, available     exemption certificates, and tax rules (if any). The tax amounts computed by the tax calculation     software are sent to  Acumatica ERP     and can be reviewed on the  Tax Details  tab of the document entry form.  For sales orders, the taxes are shown for informational purposes only. Only taxes on     invoices are actually reported.  The way the system applies taxes depends on the settings of the origin      ( From ) and destination ( To ) addresses specified     in a document (sales order or invoice). For the addresses that are specified in the document     header, the system inserts the address of the company branch (as specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) Branches (CS102000) form) as the  From  address, and the     address of the customer location specified in the document as the  To      address.  The system inserts the  From  and  To  addresses of     each sales order line by using the following rules: If the customer picks up the ordered item directly from a warehouse (that is, if the        Will Call  check box is selected on the  Shipping       Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form), the system      uses the  From  and  To  addresses of the warehouse      selected in the sales order line, as specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses      (IN204000) form. If the ordered item is shipped via a common carrier (that is, if the  Will       Call  check box is cleared on the  Shipping Settings  tab of      the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders form), the system uses the warehouse address as the        From  address and the  Ship-To  address of the      sales order as the  To  address. In the lines of sales orders marked for drop-shipment, the system inserts the address of the     default location of the vendor as the  From  address. The system inserts     the  Ship-To  address specified in the sales order as the       To  address. In each related line of the drop-ship invoice, the system     uses the vendor's location address in the related purchase receipt as the       From  address. The system inserts the  Ship-To      address in the related purchase order as the  To  address. In an SO invoice, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form, the system uses the     following rules to insert the from and ship-to information:  In the document header, the system uses the address of the company branch as the        From  address, and the  Ship-To  address of the SO      invoice as the  To  address. In the document lines, if the SO invoice was prepared from a sales order that requires      shipment, the system uses the address of the warehouse specified in the line as the        From  address, and the  Ship-To  address of the      shipment as the  To  address. In the document lines, if the SO invoice was prepared from an order that does not require      shipment, the system uses the address of the warehouse or branch specified in the line as the        From  address, and the  Ship-To  address of the      sales order as the  To  address. If the SO invoice was prepared for multiple shipments, for each line, the system uses the      address specified for the line in the corresponding shipment. If multiple shipments or       sales orders with different addresses are included in the SO invoice, the system selects the         Multiple Ship-To Addresses  check box on the  Address        Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices form.  In a line added to the SO invoice without a link to sales order or shipment, the system      inserts the address of the company branch as the  From  address, and the        Ship-To  address of the SO invoice as the  To       address.

A use tax is a type of a tax that is applied when a merchant purchases a product or service on which sales tax was not initially paid, and then converts this product or service for its own use. For example, if your company purchases tax-free goods from a vendor that is not registered in the state of your purchase, it must report the purchases and pay the use tax directly to the tax agency of your state. {br}

The rate and the amount of the use taxes that apply to a purchase document can depend on many factors, including the types of items purchased, the vendor relations you have configured, the remittance address of the vendor, and the address of the warehouse.{br}{TOC}
==Use Tax Calculation with Avalara AvaTax==
If your system is integrated with the AvaTax service of Avalara or another third-party tax calculation software, the applicable taxes are calculated by this service or software and recorded to the purchase order or AP bill when you save the document. {br}

Once a user creates a document that is subject to taxes and removes it from hold (if applicable), the system checks whether the vendor location specified in the document is in the tax zone configured for the tax calculation software. If so, the system sends a request to the tax calculation software to determine the applicable taxes, based on the vendor location address, entity code, available exemption certificates, and tax rules (if any). The tax amounts computed by the tax calculation software are sent to Acumatica ERP and can be reviewed on the '''Tax Details''' tab of the document entry form, [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]). ((({S:Hint}For purchase orders, the taxes are shown for informational purposes only. Only taxes on AP bills are actually reported to the applicable tax agency. 
)))
The way the tax calculation software calculates use taxes depends on the settings of the origin ('''From''') and destination ('''To''') addresses specified in an Acumatica ERP document. The following sections describes how the system selects the '''From''' and '''To''' addresses in documents and individual document lines, depending on the document type and vendor settings.
==Addresses in Purchase Orders==
In the document header of a purchase order, the system specifies the remittance address of the vendor selected in the purchase order as the '''From''' address, and the '''Ship-To''' address of the purchase order as the '''To''' address.{br}

In the individual purchase order lines, the system specifies the '''From''' and '''To''' addresses by using the following rules:[anchor|#_7db36be2-006c-4f45-8c59-53007f94020d]
*For lines of ''Normal'', ''Blanket'', and ''Standard'' purchase orders, the system specifies the vendor remittance address as the '''From''' address, and the address of the warehouse in the line as the '''To''' address. (If the ''Multiple Warehouses'' feature is not used in the system, the '''Ship-To''' address of the purchase order is used as the '''To''' address.) 
*For lines of ''Drop-Ship'' purchase orders, the system specifies the vendor remittance address as the '''From''' address, and the '''Ship-To''' address of the purchase order as the '''To''' address.

==Addresses in Accounts Payable Bills==
If the '''Vendor Relations''' feature is disabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the system specifies the vendor location address of the bill as the '''From''' address, and the main address of the bill&rsquo;s branch as the '''To''' address.{br}

If the '''Vendor Relations''' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form and vendor relations are set up, the system specifies the supplied-by vendor's location address of the bill as the '''From''' address, and the main address of the bill&rsquo;s branch as the '''To''' address.{br}

In the individual lines of the bills, the system specifies the '''From''' and '''To''' addresses by using the following rules:[anchor|#_155bf262-865c-4292-b788-db6ba9cb74b7]
*If a bill line is related to a line of a ''Normal'' purchase order, the system specifies the vendor address of the related purchase order line as the '''From''' address, and the address of the warehouse in the related purchase receipt line (or in the related purchase order line if the receipt has not been prepared yet) as the '''To''' address. (If the ''Multiple Warehouses'' feature is not used in the system, the '''Ship-To''' address of the purchase order is used as the '''To''' address.)
*If a bill line is related to a line of a ''Drop-Ship'' purchase order, the system specifies the vendor address of the related purchase order line as the '''From''' address, and the '''Ship-To''' address of the purchase order as the '''To''' address.
*If a bill line is related to a line of a direct purchase receipt (that is, one that is not linked to a purchase order), the system uses the vendor location address of the related purchase receipt as the '''From''' address, and the address of the warehouse in the related purchase receipt as the '''To''' address. (If the ''Multiple Warehouses'' feature is not used in the system, the main address of the bill&rsquo;s branch is used as the '''To''' address.)
*If a bill line is not related to any line of a purchase order or purchase receipt, the system uses the vendor location address of the bill as the '''From''' address, and the main address of the bill&rsquo;s branch as the '''To''' address.

For purchase orders, the taxes are shown for informational purposes only. Only taxes on         AP bills are actually reported to the applicable tax agency.  The way the tax calculation software calculates use taxes depends on the settings of the         origin ( From ) and destination ( To ) addresses         specified in an  Acumatica ERP document. The following sections describes how the system selects the            From  and  To  addresses in documents and         individual document lines, depending on the document type and vendor settings. Addresses in Purchase Orders In the document header of a purchase order, the system specifies the remittance address of the         vendor selected in the purchase order as the  From  address, and the            Ship-To  address of the purchase order as the            To  address. In the individual purchase order lines, the system specifies the  From          and  To  addresses by using the following rules: For lines of  Normal ,  Blanket , and  Standard  purchase orders, the system           specifies the vendor remittance address as the  From  address, and           the address of the warehouse in the line as the  To  address. (If the              Multiple Warehouses  feature is not used in the system, the              Ship-To  address of the purchase order is used as the              To  address.)  For lines of  Drop-Ship  purchase orders, the system specifies the vendor remittance           address as the  From  address, and the  Ship-To            address of the purchase order as the  To  address. Addresses in Accounts Payable Bills If the  Vendor Relations  feature is disabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, the system specifies the vendor location         address of the bill as the  From  address, and the main address of the         bill's branch as the  To  address. If the  Vendor Relations  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features form and vendor relations are set up, the system specifies the         supplied-by vendor's location address of the bill as the  From          address, and the main address of the bill's branch as the  To          address. In the individual lines of the bills, the system specifies the  From  and            To  addresses by using the following rules: If a bill line is related to a line of a  Normal  purchase order, the system specifies           the vendor address of the related purchase order line as the  From            address, and the address of the warehouse in the related purchase receipt line (or in the           related purchase order line if the receipt has not been prepared yet) as the              To  address. (If the  Multiple Warehouses  feature is not           used in the system, the  Ship-To  address of the purchase order is           used as the  To  address.) If a bill line is related to a line of a  Drop-Ship  purchase order, the system           specifies the vendor address of the related purchase order line as the              From  address, and the  Ship-To  address of           the purchase order as the  To  address. If a bill line is related to a line of a direct purchase receipt (that is, one that is not           linked to a purchase order), the system uses the vendor location address of the related           purchase receipt as the  From  address, and the address of the           warehouse in the related purchase receipt as the  To  address. (If           the  Multiple Warehouses  feature is not used in the system, the main address of the           bill's branch is used as the  To  address.) If a bill line is not related to any line of a purchase order or purchase receipt, the           system uses the vendor location address of the bill as the  From            address, and the main address of the bill's branch as the  To            address.

The Purchase Orders module supports value added taxes (VATs) on purchased items if the ''VAT Reporting'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. {br}

In most European countries, where VATs are often used, prices for consumers are tax-inclusive—that is, specified with the tax amount included. In Acumatica ERP, you can configure the VAT-like taxes or sales taxes as calculated separately on item prices or as extracted from prices. The base and sale prices, too, can be specified as including or excluding the appropriate tax amount. {br}

Inclusive and non-inclusive taxes are configured on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\TX_20_50_00|Taxes] ([~/?ScreenId=TX205000|TX205000]) form. For inclusive taxes, the '''Extract from Item Amount''' option is selected. {br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, the document details include applicable taxes shown for informational purposes on the '''Tax Details''' tab; the list of applicable taxes includes the taxes present in both the vendor tax zone and the ordered item&rsquo;s tax category. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, tax amounts are calculated because although value-added taxes for inventory items are paid to vendors, they are claimable from the tax agency. ((({S:Hint} Correcting taxes in a purchase order does not affect the taxes in documents (purchase receipts and Accounts Payable bills) created from this purchase order. The taxes for each document are calculated when the document is created based on the tax settings of this document.
)))
==Example of Inclusive Tax Processing==
Consider an example in which a company purchases 100 motherboards at $22 each with a 10% VAT included. The total amount is $2200, and the VAT amount calculated for the document is $200. {br}

The following transactions will be generated for the Inventory receipt. 
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="40%" !  Account
!width="20%" ! Credit
!width="40%" ! Debit
|- 
| Inventory (Components) 
|  0 
|  2200 – 200 = 2000
|- 
|  PO Accruals
|  2000 
|  0
|}
 The following transactions will be generated for the Accounts Payable bill. 
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="33%" !  Account
!width="33%" ! Credit
!width="33%" ! Debit
|- 
|  PO Accruals
|  0 
|  2000 (accrued amount)
|- 
|  Accounts Payable
|  2200 (full receipt amount)
|  0
|- 
|  VAT Claimable Account
|  0 
|  200
|}
If any difference arises, due to rounding, between the original order amount and the sum of the tax amount and the amount to be recorded to the accrual account, it will be added to the Purchase Price Variance account.

))){br}{TOC}
==Types of Discounts in Sales Orders==
When a user saves a sales order, the system selects and applies the types of automatic discounts configured in the system in the following order:[anchor|#ul_ltk_fjp_mdb]
#Line-level discounts (which are applied to each line of the document): For each sales order line, the system finds and applies the applicable line-level discount with the largest discount amount. The system can apply only one (the best) line-level discount to a sales order line. Line-level discounts that the system has automatically applied to sales order lines are shown on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form.
#Group-level discounts (which are applied to multiple lines of the document): The system finds and applies the applicable group-level discount or discounts. (Multiple group discounts can be applied to a sales order.) The discountable amount for each group discount is calculated as the sum of the extended prices of all lines in the group to which the group discount is applicable. Group discounts are applied in parallel. That is, if multiple group discounts are applicable to the same sales order lines, each discount is calculated based on the total of these lines, which is not affected by other group discounts. Group-level discounts that were applied to a document are shown on the '''Discount Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form.
#Document-level discounts (which are applied to the total amount of the document): The system finds and applies the applicable document-level discount with the largest discount amount for a particular sales order. The system can apply only one (the best) document-level discount to a document. Document-level discounts that were applied to a document are shown on the '''Discount Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form.
[anchor|#_4bb3c5af-0aeb-4d62-b6b6-24b977b86b05]((({S:Hint}Document and group discounts are not applicable to the following orders:[anchor|#_89ae040f-6532-477a-8f7d-a33d3ea58529]

*Orders of an order type that has the ''RMA Order'' automation behavior and ''No Update'' selected in the '''AR Document Type''' box on the '''Template Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form
)))
==Discount Update in Sales Orders==
By default, Acumatica ERP updates all discounts in a sales order as you change any information in the order (such as adding new lines). Manual line discounts are fixed based on the discount percent: If you change the line details, the system keeps the current discount percentage and uses it to recalculate the discount amount. Manual document discounts are fixed based on the discount amount: If any changes have been introduced to the document, the system keeps the discount amount and uses it to recalculate the discount percentage.{br}

You can configure the system so that it does not update discounts automatically in orders of a particular type by selecting the '''Disable Automatic Discount Update''' check box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. For a particular order of a type, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, you can change the state of this check box on the '''Discount Details''' tab. {br}

When the '''Disable Automatic Discount Update''' check box is selected for an order, the already-applied discounts are treated as manual for the order. When you run discount recalculation or add new lines to the order, the system preserves the set of applied discounts; it checks whether these discounts are still applicable for the order, but does not apply any other new discounts to the order. If you manually change any of the discountable amounts or quantities in the order, the system recalculates the fixed set of applied discounts based on these changes.{br}

If you have disabled automatic updating of discounts on an order, you can initiate discount recalculation manually by using the '''Recalculate Prices''' dialog box, which you open by selecting '''Actions''' > '''Recalculate Prices''' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form toolbar.
==Transfer of Discounts to SO Invoices==
When an SO invoice is prepared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form for a sales order, the system transfers all applicable sales order discounts to this SO invoice by using the following rules:[anchor|#ul_a2f_plp_mdb]
*If the sales order has been shipped and billed in full, the discounts are transferred to the invoice in full.
*If the sales order has been shipped and billed partially, the applicable discounts are transferred to the invoice partially, by using the ratio of the invoice amount to sales order amount.
*If a consolidated invoice has been prepared for multiple sales orders, the document and group discounts from all orders are transferred to the invoice. If the same document or group discount applies to multiple orders, the system adds a separate discount line for each order; each discount line is linked to the sales order from which it was transferred.
*If the invoice is modified (for example, if invoice lines are added or deleted, or the date is changed) or if the user clicks '''Actions &gt; Recalculate Prices''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] form, the system removes the applicable discounts from the corresponding orders and recalculates the discounts as if they had been applied directly to the invoice. 
*:((({S:Hint}Discounts that provide free items on sales orders that have been shipped partially or in full are not recalculated when you edit a sales order, edit an invoice, or invoke the recalculation action.
)))

==General Ledger Transactions for SO Invoices==
On release of the SO invoice, the system generates a batch of the following General Ledger transactions.[anchor|#_2ac7d5c2-d53f-4c72-816f-91189239e805]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|-

| Accounts Receivable account
| Amount
| 0.0
|- 
| Sales account
| 0.0
| Amount
|- 
| Discount account 
| Discount Total
| 0.0
|}
When the SO invoice is released, all discounts applicable to the invoice at the moment of release are transferred to the created AR invoice. You can review applicable line discounts on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form, and group and document discounts on the '''Discount Details''' tab of this form.

This topic explains how to configure sales prices for stock and non-stock items, and how to set up and use the price adjustment factor for items that are sold in multiple units of measure.
==Configuring Prices for Sales Orders==
In Acumatica ERP you can maintain sales prices in two ways: by using default prices and by using sales price lists. {br}

Maintaining default prices rather than using sales price lists is a straightforward option for companies that sell specific items whose prices do not vary depending on the customer, quantity, or other factors. Default prices are specified in the base currency for each base unit. You specify a default price for each individual stock or non-stock item on the '''Price/Cost Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) or the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, respectively. If sales price lists are not in use, sales prices in a sales order are not recalculated when a user changes any details in the sales order summary. The system does not keep a history of changes to default prices. For more information on configuring and using default prices, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Base_Prices|Default Prices].{br}

If you need to implement different pricing strategies, provide promotional prices, and keep a history of price changes, you should instead maintain sales prices via ''price lists''. Sales price lists are used in accounts receivable and sales orders documents. For details on configuring and maintaining sales prices via price lists, see the topics of the [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__MNG_Sales_Prices|Managing Sales Prices] section.
==Specifying the Price Adjustment Factor==
If your company has many items in a price list and each item can be sold in different units of measure, you may want to keep and update sales prices for only one unit of measure, and configure the system to update the prices for other units of measure automatically based on this price.{br}

For example, suppose that you sell some stock item for which the ''EA'' base unit and the ''BOX'' non-base unit are configured so that 1 ''BOX'' = 10 ''EA'' (here, ''10'' is the conversion factor). After you specify the base price of $5 per ''EA'' unit, the system will automatically calculate and suggest the $50 price for each ''BOX'' if you select the ''BOX'' unit of measure in the document line. {br}

Now suppose that you want to sell 1 ''BOX'' for $45 instead of $50. You cannot adjust the conversion factor, because it affects the quantity of items to be sold. You could create a separate price record that would define the sales price for the ''BOX'', but if you did so, you would later need to update two prices instead of one when there was a price change. Instead of creating these separate UOM-specific price records, you can specify the adjustment multiplier, which will define the ratio between the price for the base unit of measure and the price for the non-base unit of measure for the particular stock or non-stock item.{br}

To make it possible to adjust the calculation of sales prices, you need to select the '''Use a Price Adjustment Multiplier''' check box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form. After you do this, you can specify the adjustment multiplier in the '''Price Adjustment Multiplier''' column on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form for a stock item or the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form for a non-stock item. {br}

If this functionality has been turned on, the system will calculate the sales prices as follows.{br}

{{{{Base UOM Price = Sales UOM Price / (or *) Conversion Factor / Price Adjustment Multiplier
}}}}{br}

{{{{Non-Base UOM Price = Base UOM Price * (or /) Conversion Factor * Price Adjustment Multiplier
}}}}{br}

In these calculations, the operator of the first action in both expressions is defined by the '''Multiply/Divide''' column on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form or the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form.{br}

Thus, in the example presented earlier in this section, you need to specify an adjustment multiplier of 0.9, so that the price for 1 ''BOX'' will be calculated as $5 (the base price for each ''EA'') &#42; 10 (the conversion factor) &#42; 0.9 (the adjustment multiplier) = $45 for each ''BOX''. If you later set a new sales price for ''EA'', such as $6, the price for the ''BOX'' will be calculated as $6 &#42; 10 &#42; 0.9 = $54.{br}

If you clear the '''Use a Price Adjustment Multiplier''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] form, the system will ignore any specified price adjustment multipliers when calculating sales prices.
==Minimum Markup Validation in Sales Orders==
To make sure that sales prices satisfy your gross profit requirements, you can configure the validation of minimum markup for in sales orders. The markup percentage can be defined for an item class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form causing the markup percentage to be used as the default value for items of the class), or specified for particular stock and non-stock items on the '''Price/Cost Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form and the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, respectively.{br}

You can configure minimum markup validation for prices on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form. In the '''Validate Min. Markup''' box, you select one of the following options: [anchor|#ul_cz1_pfq_cp]
*''No Validation'': No markup validation will be performed for new pending prices.
*''Warning'': The system will display a warning when a user enters a pending price that is below the price plus the minimum markup.
*''Set to Minimum'': The system will automatically set the price to the value with the minimum markup when a user enters a pending price that is lower than the price plus the minimum markup. The minimum markup price for a stock item is calculated as {{Average Cost * (Min Markup% / 100)}}; the minimal markup price for a non-stock item is calculated as {{Current Cost * (Min Markup% / 100)}}.

Also, you can configure the system to skip markup validation for particular types of prices (customer, customer price class, and promotional) by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the '''Ignore Min. Markup Validation for Prices Specific To''' group of check boxes.((({S:Hint}The system also does not perform minimum markup validation for order lines in which ''Receipt'' is specified in the '''Operation''' column on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form, or for transfer order lines.
)))

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Sales Prices in Sales Documents This topic explains how to configure sales prices for stock and non-stock items, and how to       set up and use the price adjustment factor for items that are sold in multiple units of       measure. Configuring Prices for Sales Orders In  Acumatica ERP you can maintain sales prices in two ways: by using default prices and by using sales         price lists.  Maintaining default prices rather than using sales price lists is a straightforward option         for companies that sell specific items whose prices do not vary depending on the customer,         quantity, or other factors. Default prices are specified in the base currency for each base         unit. You specify a default price for each individual stock or non-stock item on the            Price/Cost Info  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items         (IN202500) or the  Price/Cost Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form, respectively. If sales price lists are not in         use, sales prices in a sales order are not recalculated when a user changes any details in         the sales order summary. The system does not keep a history of changes to default prices.         For more information on configuring and using default prices, see  Default Prices. If you need to implement different pricing strategies, provide promotional prices, and keep         a history of price changes, you should instead maintain sales prices via  price lists .         Sales price lists are used in accounts receivable and sales orders documents. For details on         configuring and maintaining sales prices via price lists, see the topics of the  Managing Sales Prices section. Specifying the Price Adjustment Factor If your company has many items in a price list and each item can be sold in different units         of measure, you may want to keep and update sales prices for only one unit of measure, and         configure the system to update the prices for other units of measure automatically based on         this price. For example, suppose that you sell some stock item for which the  EA  base unit and         the  BOX  non-base unit are configured so that 1  BOX  = 10  EA  (here,            10  is the conversion factor). After you specify the base price of $5 per  EA          unit, the system will automatically calculate and suggest the $50 price for each  BOX          if you select the  BOX  unit of measure in the document line.  Now suppose that you want to sell 1  BOX  for $45 instead of $50. You cannot adjust         the conversion factor, because it affects the quantity of items to be sold. You could create         a separate price record that would define the sales price for the  BOX , but if you did         so, you would later need to update two prices instead of one when there was a price change.         Instead of creating these separate UOM-specific price records, you can specify the         adjustment multiplier, which will define the ratio between the price for the base unit of         measure and the price for the non-base unit of measure for the particular stock or non-stock         item. To make it possible to adjust the calculation of sales prices, you need to select the            Use a Price Adjustment Multiplier  check box on the            General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences         (SO101000) form. After you do this, you can specify the adjustment multiplier in the            Price Adjustment Multiplier  column on the  General           Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form for a         stock item or the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form for a non-stock item.  If this functionality has been turned on, the system will calculate the sales prices as         follows. Base UOM Price = Sales UOM Price / (or *) Conversion Factor / Price Adjustment Multiplier Non-Base UOM Price = Base UOM Price * (or /) Conversion Factor * Price Adjustment Multiplier In these calculations, the operator of the first action in both expressions is defined by         the  Multiply/Divide  column on the  General           Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form or the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items form. Thus, in the example presented earlier in this section, you need to specify an adjustment         multiplier of 0.9, so that the price for 1  BOX  will be calculated as $5 (the base         price for each  EA ) * 10 (the conversion factor) * 0.9 (the adjustment multiplier) =         $45 for each  BOX . If you later set a new sales price for  EA , such as $6, the         price for the  BOX  will be calculated as $6 * 10 * 0.9 = $54. If you clear the  Use a Price Adjustment Multiplier  check box on the             ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences form, the system will ignore any specified price         adjustment multipliers when calculating sales prices. Minimum Markup Validation in Sales Orders To make sure that sales prices satisfy your gross profit requirements, you can configure         the validation of minimum markup for in sales orders. The markup percentage can be defined         for an item class on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000) form         causing the markup percentage to be used as the default value for items of the class), or         specified for particular stock and non-stock items on the  Price/Cost           Info  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form and the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form, respectively. You can configure minimum markup validation for prices on the  General           Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences (SO101000)         form. In the  Validate Min. Markup  box, you select one of the         following options:  No Validation : No markup validation will be performed for new pending prices. Warning : The system will display a warning when a user enters a pending price that           is below the price plus the minimum markup. Set to Minimum : The system will automatically set the price to the value with the           minimum markup when a user enters a pending price that is lower than the price plus the           minimum markup. The minimum markup price for a stock item is calculated as  Average             Cost * (Min Markup% / 100) ; the minimal markup price for a non-stock item is           calculated as  Current Cost * (Min Markup% / 100) . Also, you can configure the system to skip markup validation for particular types of prices         (customer, customer price class, and promotional) by selecting the appropriate check boxes         in the  Ignore Min. Markup Validation for Prices Specific To  group of         check boxes. The system also does not perform minimum markup validation for order lines in which            Receipt  is specified in the  Operation  column on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders form, or for transfer order lines. ]]></column>

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
In the Purchase Orders module of Acumatica ERP, many elements on the data entry forms may have default values. If the default values you set are the values your organization uses most frequently, your users will save time and minimize errors. Users can, of course, override these values at any time. {br}

Some default settings are defined within the Purchase Orders module; others are defined in the modules that integrate closely with the Purchase Orders module: Inventory and Accounts Payable. {br}{TOC}
==Default GL Accounts==
To specify the default accounts for use in the Purchase Orders module, use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form. These default accounts include the following ones: 
*Account and subaccount for freight expenses: You need to specify the account and subaccount for the freight expenses incurred in the delivery of purchased goods from vendors. Enter the appropriate '''Freight Expense Account''' and '''Freight Expense Sub.''' values.
*Accounts used for purchase return operations: You can define the accounts and subaccounts used for purchase return operations by assigning a specific reason code for purchase returns in the '''PO Return Reason Code''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] form. Reason codes are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_21_10_00|Reason Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS211000|CS211000]) form.

For a detailed description of other settings that you can use to control the workflow of purchase orders and related documents, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_AffectingProcessingDocs|Changing the Processing of Purchase Documents].
==Vendor Defaults==
Once you select a vendor on a new purchase order, many elements on the order get default values. These values, specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form, are used as default values on data entry forms in the Accounts Payable and Purchase Orders modules. These settings include the following: 
*The currency used by the vendor. The currency can be overridden on particular documents, if this is allowed by vendor settings located on the '''General Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] form.
*The credit terms.
*The shipping terms.
*The vendor&rsquo;s shipping location.
*The carrier used by the vendor.
*The vendor&rsquo;s contact information.
*The payment settings used for payments made to vendors.
*GL accounts and subaccounts used to record expenses, freights, prepayments, and total liability.

A vendor&rsquo;s default settings also include the tax zone, which determines the taxes applicable to goods and services purchased from the vendor. You can also define the minimum and maximum percentage of ordered goods that can be accepted, and the actions to be performed if the ordered quantity differs from the received quantity when the quantities of received goods fall outside the specified range. 
==Inventory Item Defaults==
The inventory item records provide default values for purchase orders and receipts, such as the units of measure, vendor prices, and accounts involved. You can also provide the item settings associated with the specific warehouse that is used in purchase receipts created in the Purchase Orders module, and in the inventory receipts automatically generated to update the costs and availability data of the item. {br}

The default settings for stock items are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. For more information on configuring inventory items, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__mng_Configuring_Basic_Inventory|Configuring Basic Inventory].

If the ''Vendor Discounts'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can configure line-level, group-level, and document-level discounts that will be applied to purchase orders. For information on configuring discounts of different types, see the topics of the [HelpRoot_Financials\PO__MNG_Vendor_Pricing|Managing Vendor Discounts] chapter. This topic explains how Acumatica ERP applies discounts to purchase orders.{br}{TOC}
==Types of Discounts in Purchase Orders==
When a user enters a purchase order, the system selects and applies the automatic discounts configured in the system in the following order:[anchor|#ul_ltk_fjp_mdb]
#Line-level discounts (which are applied to each line of the document): For each purchase order line, the system finds and applies the line-level discount with the largest discount amount. The system can apply only one (the best) line-level discount to a purchase order line. When the accounts payable bill is prepared for the purchase order, the line discounts are prorated from the purchase order lines to the accounts payable bill lines.
#Group-level discounts (which are applied to multiple lines of the document): The system finds and applies the group-level discount or discounts. (Multiple group discounts can be applied to a purchase order.) The discountable amount for each group discount is calculated as the sum of the extended prices of all lines in the group to which the group discount is applicable. Group discounts are applied in parallel: if multiple group discounts are applicable to the same purchase order lines, each discount is calculated based on the total of these lines, which is not affected by other group discounts. When the accounts payable bill is prepared for the purchase order, group discounts are recalculated in the accounts payable bill according to the line quantity and amount in this bill.
#Document-level discounts (which are applied to the total amount of the document): The system finds the document-level discount with the largest discount amount for the purchase order and applies it. The system can apply only one (the best) document-level discount to a document. When the accounts payable bill is prepared for the purchase order, document discounts are recalculated in the accounts payable bill according to the line quantity and amount in this bill.

Line-level discounts that the system has automatically applied to purchase order lines are shown in the '''Discount Percent''', '''Discount Amount''' and '''Discount Code''' columns on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. Document-level and group-level discounts that were applied to a document are shown on the '''Discount Details''' tab of this form.

If the ''Vendor Relations'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the vendor relations functionality can be configured. The following sections describe how the vendor relations you configure may affect the AP bills and debit adjustments created based on a purchase order or purchase receipt. 
==Vendor Relations Overview==
In some companies that consist of multiple branches, the branches can collectively make on order to a vendor on behalf of the company (that is, its head office) by sending purchase orders to that vendor. The supplier provides goods and issues a bill to the head office of the company. The head office pays it, and, in turn, issues bills to its branches. As a result, a branch receives goods from one vendor (specified in the purchase order), but pays for those goods to another vendor (specified in the bill). In Acumatica ERP, you can set up vendor relations so that the system accurately handles those vendor relations in documents. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form, for each vendor that supplies goods and services but does not receive payment (a ''supplied-by'' vendor), you specify its vendor for which an AP bill or debit adjustment should be created if this vendor is specified in a purchase order or receipt (the pay-to vendor). For details, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AP__con_Vendor_Relations_Overview|Vendor Relations Overview].
==Vendor Relations in Purchase Orders and Purchase Receipts==
When you create a purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, in the '''Vendor''' box of the Summary area, you can select a vendor with either vendor relations set up (a supplied-by vendor) or a vendor with no vendor relations set up. The system does one of the following for the purchase order: [anchor|#ul_zxd_2tp_f1b]
*If the selected vendor is a supplied-by vendor, the system inserts in the '''Pay-to Vendor''' box of the '''Vendor Info''' tab the pay-to vendor that is specified for the selected supplied-by vendor on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] form.
*If vendor relations are not configured for the selected vendor, the system inserts this same vendor in the '''Pay-to Vendor''' box of the '''Vendor Info''' tab.
((({S:Hint}For purchase receipts on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, the system selects the '''Pay-to Vendor''' in the same way. The only difference is that this box is located on the '''Financial Details''' tab, in the '''Billing Settings''' section.
))){br}

For a purchase order or a purchase receipt, you can override the vendor in the '''Pay-to Vendor''' box, if needed.{br}

With the vendor relations functionality set up, when you invoke '''Actions &gt; Enter AP Bill''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] form, the system creates an AP bill (or, for example, a debit adjustment for a purchase receipt of the ''Return'' type) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form that has all the details copied from the initial document except the vendor in the '''Vendor''' box. In this box, the system inserts the vendor specified in the '''Pay-to Vendor''' box of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] form. As a result, the bill will be paid to a different vendor than the vendor for which the purchase order was created.
==Discount Calculation==
In an Accounts Payable document (bill or debit adjustment) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form that is based on the purchase order, the system uses the discounts of the supplied-by vendor to calculate document discounts.
==Tax Calculation==
For a purchase order or purchase receipt on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form with vendor relations set up, the system calculates the tax and taxable amounts of the purchase order or purchase receipt by using the tax zones of the supplied-by vendors (that is, of the vendor specified in the '''Vendor''' box of the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] form). With vendor relations set up, the system calculates the tax and taxable amounts of the Accounts Payable documents similarly. {br}

If integration with Avalara AvaTax is configured and used for calculating taxes for purchase documents, the vendor relations you configure may affect the way the system selects the '''From''' and '''To''' addresses in these purchase documents. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_Use_Tax_PO_Avalara|Calculating Use Taxes in Purchase Documents].

The following sections describe how the vendor relations you configure         may affect the AP bills and debit adjustments created based on a purchase order or purchase         receipt.  Vendor Relations Overview In some companies that consist of multiple branches, the branches can collectively make on         order to a vendor on behalf of the company (that is, its head office) by sending purchase         orders to that vendor. The supplier provides goods and issues a bill to the head office of         the company. The head office pays it, and, in turn, issues bills to its branches. As a         result, a branch receives goods from one vendor (specified in the purchase order), but pays         for those goods to another vendor (specified in the bill). In  Acumatica ERP, you can set up vendor relations so that the system accurately handles those vendor         relations in documents. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors (AP303000) form, for each         vendor that supplies goods and services but does not receive payment (a  supplied-by          vendor), you specify its vendor for which an AP bill or debit adjustment should be created         if this vendor is specified in a purchase order or receipt (the pay-to vendor). For details,         see  Vendor Relations Overview. Vendor Relations in Purchase Orders and Purchase Receipts When you create a purchase order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form,         in the  Vendor  box of the Summary area, you can select a vendor with         either vendor relations set up (a supplied-by vendor) or a vendor with no vendor relations         set up. The system does one of the following for the purchase order:  If the selected vendor is a supplied-by vendor, the system inserts in the                Pay-to Vendor  box of the  Vendor Info  tab             the pay-to vendor that is specified for the selected supplied-by vendor on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors form.

In Acumatica ERP, you can create and maintain vendor catalogs—that is, the lists of the inventory items you purchase from each vendor, along with the last prices of items and purchasing information about the items, which are generally used for automated replenishment. By maintaining vendor catalogs, you can more efficiently select vendors that sell specific types of items. You can also reduce errors on purchase orders by using vendor-specific alternate IDs of items. {br}{TOC}
==Creating Vendor Catalogs==
To create vendor catalogs, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_20_10_00|Vendor Inventory] ([~/?ScreenId=PO201000|PO201000]) form. On this form, you can select a vendor and vendor location and create a list of items your company can purchase from this vendor location. {br}

For each item, you can specify the following information, some of which may be specific to the vendor location: [anchor|#ul_rnd_bws_1q]
*The vendor inventory ID, which is the identifier used by the vendor for the item. This alternate ID can be assigned to the item (or to the item–subitem pair if your organization uses subitems for more detailed identification of products).
*The unit of measure (UOM) used by the vendor as the sales unit for the item at this location (defined as the item&rsquo;s ''purchase unit'' in your organization).
*The economic order quantity, which represents the quantity of this item that minimizes the costs of ordering from this vendor location.
*The vendor lead time, and the additional lead time (if any) for the inventory item purchased from the vendor. The system uses the additional lead time to schedule the purchases from the vendor and calculate the promised date. The system automatically calculates the promised date by adding the lead time and additional lead time (if any was specified for the item) to the requested date.
*The purchasing information, which is used in automated replenishment: 
**The minimum frequency of orders.
**The lot size defined for the item if it is tracked by lot numbers. 
**The minimum and maximum quantity that form the range in which the order quantity must fall
((({S:Hint}You cannot enter the prices in the '''Last Vendor Price''' column. The column is populated and updated automatically by the prices that were last used for the items. For details on setting up automatic price updating, see the following section. 
)))
Instead of entering all the items for each vendor and location, you can populate the vendor catalogs by creating a list of possible vendors for each stock item by using the '''Vendor Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form and for each non-stock item by using the same-name tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. Then, when you open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_20_10_00|Vendor Inventory] ([~/?ScreenId=PO201000|PO201000]) form and select a vendor, you can view the stock and non-stock items that the vendor sells and modify this list if needed. 
==Catalog Updating from Vendor Documents==
You can update the vendor catalogs manually at any time by replacing any changed data—such as alternate IDs, economic order quantities (EOQs), lot sizes, and minimum and maximum quantities—with the newer and more correct data. However, the last used prices in the catalogs cannot be entered manually; the system updates these prices automatically from prices quoted on vendor documents. {br}

You can set up automatic updating of the last used vendor prices in the vendor catalog based on the entry or release of specific vendor documents. To do this, on the '''Price/Discount Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_10_10_00|Accounts Payable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AP101000|AP101000]) form, in the '''Vendor Price Update''' box, select one of the following options:[anchor|#ul_nxm_bhl_rp]
*''On PO Entry''
* ''On AP Bill Release''
* ''None''

 When the event specified by the '''Vendor Price Update''' option (purchase order entry, or release of an AP bill that is linked to a purchase receipt or order) occurs, the item&rsquo;s unit price from the document replaces the last price of the item with the same UOM in the vendor catalog. If the UOM of the last price is the same as in the document, but the currency differs from the document&rsquo;s currency, the item&rsquo;s unit price in the document currency replaces the last price. If the UOM in the document line differs from the UOM of the last price, the system adds a new line to the vendor catalog.((({S:Hint}The system does not keep the history of price changes in the vendor catalog. 
)))
If you do not want to maintain information about the last used prices in the vendor catalogs, select ''None'' as the '''Vendor Price Update''' option—the last used prices will not be updated. Note that in this case the last vendor price may be updated on release of a bill that is not linked to any PO document.
==Using the Prices from Vendor Catalogs==
If you regularly receive vendors&rsquo; price lists for all or most of their items, you can maintain vendor prices with much more flexibility by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_20_00|Vendor Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AP202000|AP202000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_20_10|Vendor Price Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=AP202010|AP202010]) forms. You can import the price lists, and calculate the updated prices by applying specific percentages. {br}

 Maintaining vendor prices through vendor catalogs can also be useful for items for which the prices do not change often or information about prices is not available in advance. Once the system populates the '''Last Vendor Price''' column for items in the vendor catalogs, the system uses these last used prices as the default prices for the corresponding items on new purchase orders as follows: When you create a new purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form or receipt on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, if there are no prices listed for the item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_20_00|Vendor Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AP202000|AP202000]) form, for each item, the system inserts the last price from the vendor catalog as the vendor's default price ('''Unit Cost''' on either form). ((({S:Hint}If you are browsing the vendor catalog on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_20_10_00|Vendor Inventory] form in order to select a vendor for a specific item, you can view this vendor's current item prices by clicking the '''Vendor Prices''' button on the table toolbar and navigating to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_20_00|Vendor Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AP202000|AP202000]) form.
)))
You can override the default catalog prices on a purchase order or purchase receipt if the actual purchase prices for inventory items are different from those listed in the vendor catalog. In this case, the new prices that you enter will automatically appear in the vendor catalog as the last used prices; the particular event triggering this update depends on the option selected in the '''Vendor Price Update''' box. The new prices will then appear on a new purchase order when a user creates it. {br}

However, if the ''Volume Pricing'' feature is enabled in your system, and you purchase different volumes with different prices from your vendors, consider whether you need to maintain price updating in the catalog, taking into account that you will not know what volume the price listed in the catalog corresponds to.

While barcodes have been in use in retail stores for many years, many warehouses do not fully use this technology. Barcode scanning saves you time when you receive goods to warehouses and increases overall control of operations. {br}

 Acumatica ERP supports integration with barcode scanning solutions in the following ways. {br}{TOC}
==Barcodes as Alternative IDs for Inventory Items==
In Acumatica ERP, you can use product barcodes as alternative identifiers for inventory items. For details on allowed types of alternative IDs, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Item_Cross-References|Item Cross-References]. {br}

You can enter barcodes for items on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, the '''Cross-References''' tab, manually or by scanning them. The scanner&rsquo;s software converts the scanned barcode to an alphanumeric string that is immediately visible in the appropriate box as if it had been typed. You can add any number of different barcode strings to the item record in the database. Barcodes are not necessarily associated with particular vendors or customers. 
==Data Entry Through Barcode Scanning==
Barcode scanning can be used to effectively receive products at a warehouse and enter warehouse location information for them. {br}

From the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, you can invoke the '''Add Receipt Line''' dialog box, which has been designed for the following scenario: You scan a product barcode, and the system finds the item record, brings up the item information with the quantity copied from a matching purchase order, and automatically adds a new line to the receipt or adds one unit per each scanned item if you scan items with serial numbers. {br}

To use the dialog box for barcode scanning, make sure the '''Add Receipt Line Automatically''' option is selected. Then, once the dialog box elements are filled in, the system creates a new line automatically. {br}

If you select the '''Add One Unit per Barcode''' check box in the dialog box, each time you scan a barcode, the item quantity for the receipt will be increased by one unit. If you clear the check box, when a user scans an item barcode, the system searches for a purchase order that matches the vendor and inventory ID associated with the barcode, and inserts the quantity of the item from the purchase order. If no such order is found, the system inserts one unit.{br}

If no item is found in the system after the item barcode has been scanned, you can enter the inventory ID of the item manually. In this case, this new barcode is automatically associated with the item. {br}

To further simplify data entry in warehouses, you can print barcodes for warehouse IDs and warehouse location IDs. You can print barcodes for such identifiers by using customized Acumatica ERP reports. {br}

Barcodes of the warehouse and its locations also can be used when you create receipts by using the following scenarios: 
*If you create receipts at a desk, print barcodes on a sheet of paper, and put it close at hand. When you&rsquo;re creating a receipt line for an item, scan the barcode from the item, warehouse, and location barcodes from the paper.
*If you generally create receipts from a cart (equipped with a scanner and a computer) after you place items in appropriate locations, perform the following actions prior to receiving goods: print location IDs as barcodes on special labels, and stick them to appropriate shelves, bins, or other storage structures available in your warehouse. Then, take items one by one from the cart, and read the item barcode and location barcode from the shelf. Appropriate receipt lines will be added automatically.

==Using Barcode Scanners for Physical Inventory==
With Acumatica ERP, you can use barcode scanners to perform physical inventory counts.{br}

If product barcodes are used in your system as alternative inventory IDs, you can use barcode scanners for counting—each scanned barcode will increase the quantity of the item by one unit in the physical inventory document open on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_10|Physical Inventory Count] ([~/?ScreenId=IN305010|IN305010]) if your system is configured for using barcodes and if the scanners are connected as an input device to your computer.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Barcode Support While barcodes have been in use in retail stores for many years, many warehouses do 				not fully use this technology. Barcode scanning saves you time when you receive 				goods to warehouses and increases overall control of operations.   Acumatica ERP supports integration with barcode scanning solutions in the following ways.  Barcodes as Alternative IDs for Inventory Items In  Acumatica ERP, you can use product barcodes as alternative identifiers for inventory items. For 				details on allowed types of alternative IDs, see  Item Cross-References.  You can enter barcodes for items on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) 				form, the  Cross-References  tab, manually or by scanning them. The scanner's 				software converts the scanned barcode to an alphanumeric string that is immediately 				visible in the appropriate box as if it had been typed. You can add any number of 				different barcode strings to the item record in the database. Barcodes are not 				necessarily associated with particular vendors or customers.  Data Entry Through Barcode Scanning Barcode scanning can be used to effectively receive products at a warehouse and enter 				warehouse location information for them.  From the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form, you can invoke the 					 Add Receipt Line  dialog box, which has been designed for the following 				scenario: You scan a product barcode, and the system finds the item record, brings 				up the item information with the quantity copied from a matching purchase order, and 				automatically adds a new line to the receipt  or adds one unit per each scanned item 				if you scan items with serial numbers.  To use the dialog box for barcode scanning, make sure the  Add Receipt Line 					Automatically  option is selected. Then, once the dialog box elements are 				filled in, the system creates a new line automatically.  If you select the  Add One Unit per Barcode  check box in the dialog box, each 				time you scan a barcode, the item quantity for the receipt will be increased by one 				unit. If you clear the check box, when a user scans an item barcode, the system 				searches for a purchase order that matches the vendor and inventory ID associated 				with the barcode, and inserts the quantity of the item from the purchase order. If 				no such order is found, the system inserts one unit. If no item is found in the system after the item barcode has been scanned, you can 				enter the inventory ID of the item manually. In this case, this new barcode is 				automatically associated with the item.  To further simplify data entry in warehouses, you can print barcodes for warehouse 				IDs and warehouse location IDs. You can print barcodes for such identifiers by using 				customized  Acumatica ERP reports.  Barcodes of the warehouse and its locations also can be used when you create receipts by using 				the following scenarios:  If you create receipts at a desk, print barcodes on a sheet of paper, and put it 					close at hand. When you're creating a receipt line for an item, scan the barcode 					from the item, warehouse, and location barcodes from the paper. If you generally create receipts from a cart (equipped with a scanner and a computer) after 					you place items in appropriate locations, perform the following actions prior to 					receiving goods: print location IDs as barcodes on special labels, and stick 					them to appropriate shelves, bins, or other storage structures available in your 					warehouse. Then, take items one by one from the cart, and read the item barcode 					and location barcode from the shelf. Appropriate receipt lines will be added 					automatically.

The total cost of goods purchased generally includes the purchase price and additional charges, such as freight or other shipping costs and insurance; for an international shipment, it may also include customs duties and other taxes. All these charges, often referred to as ''landed costs'', affect the total product cost. Landed costs are the costs incurred, beyond the purchase price the vendor charges for the goods, in the process of bringing the goods to one of your company&rsquo;s warehouses. {br}

To accurately calculate the total product cost, you must consider all landed costs. By accurately analyzing total product cost statistics, your company can assign the most appropriate prices to the products you sell. {br}{TOC}
==Landed Cost Code Definition==
In Acumatica ERP, landed cost codes are used to capture various types of landed costs. For each type of landed costs your company may encounter, create a landed cost code to be used to enter and process that type of landed costs. {br}

Most landed costs are not fixed amounts associated with a specific inventory item. Landed costs may be fees, such as for shipping and handling, whose amount depends on the weight, volume, or quantity of items. Accordingly, you need to define how to allocate the incurred amounts among all items in the receipt. The landed cost amounts are ultimately paid to a carrier or customs office—the landed cost vendor—rather than to the vendor that sells the goods. {br}

In Acumatica ERP, you create and maintain landed cost codes by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_20_20_00|Landed Cost Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=PO202000|PO202000]) form. For each code, you specify the following information: [anchor|#ul_vgq_lnx_nv]
*The type of landed cost
*The method of allocating landed cost amounts among the lines of the documents added to landed cost document 
*The reason code to be used in the inventory adjustment that is generated on release of a landed cost document
*The accounts and subaccounts used to accrue landed cost amounts and landed cost variance
*The tax category (if the landed costs are subject to taxes)

A landed cost code is not associated with any specific currency, so if multi-currency support has been enabled in the system, landed costs are considered as specified in the currency of the document. 
==Landed Cost Allocation Method==
The allocation method of a landed cost defines how the landed cost is distributed among lines of the documents specified in the landed cost document. When you are creating a landed cost code for specific type of landed cost, you can select one of the following allocation methods: [anchor|#ul_ljq_lnx_nv]
*''By Quantity'': The landed cost amount is distributed among the document lines in proportion to their quantities. This adds a greater percentage of the landed cost to the goods purchased in the largest quantities. If units of measure (UOMs) other than the base UOMs are specified for items, item quantities are calculated with respect to the base UOMs.
*:((({S:Warn}Use this option for only documents that include similar items with the same base UOM or similar base UOMs. Do not use this option for documents that include disparate items with base units that cannot be compared, such as pallets and tons, or meters and pounds. 
)))
*''By Cost'': The landed cost amount is distributed among the document lines in proportion to their extended cost. The extended cost is calculated based on the item&rsquo;s valuation method. This adds a greater percentage of the landed cost amount to more expensive goods.
*''By Weight'': The landed cost amount is distributed among the inventory items proportionally to their weights. This adds a greater percentage of the landed cost to the goods that weigh the most. The weight of the base unit of the inventory item is specified on the '''Packaging''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form.
*''By Volume'': The landed cost amount is distributed among the applicable items proportionally to their volumes. This adds a greater percentage of the landed cost to goods with more bulk. The volume of the base unit of the inventory item is specified on the '''Packaging''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form.

When you add purchase receipts (or transfer receipts) to a landed cost document, the system automatically allocates the landed cost amounts between the added document lines. The system uses the allocation method to calculate the landed cost amount to be added to the cost of a particular inventory item listed on the adjustment. The system also recalculates the allocated amounts on any changes in the landed cost amounts or document lines to which these amounts are allocated.{br}

On release of the landed cost document, the system generates an inventory adjustment for the inventory items listed in the landed cost document to adjust the items&rsquo; costs.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
When a company is integrating its e-commerce system with Acumatica ERP, sales orders and their applied payments are imported to Acumatica ERP. The payment amounts are then transferred to the SO invoices created for these sales orders. In some cases, a small discrepancy can occur between the payment amount applied to a sales order and the amount of SO invoice created for this sales order (for example, as a result of the system recalculating the applicable taxes in the SO invoice). You can configure the system to write off these small discrepancies automatically when the SO invoice is released.{br}

You configure the system to automatically generate adjustments on small discrepancies by doing the following:[anchor|#_ead0d004-8292-415a-b8ee-7977fc87a9a8]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_20_25_00|Chart of Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=GL202500|GL202500]) form, you configure an expense account (and subaccount, if needed) to be used for the small amounts that are written off.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_21_10_00|Reason Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS211000|CS211000]) form, you configure a reason code that specifies the account and subaccount to be used for writing off balances. For details, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__HOW_Add_Reason_Code|To Configure a Reason Code].
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]), you specify the reason code that you have configured in the '''Balance Write-Off Reason Code''' box. By default, the system will use this reason code for writing off balances.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form, you select a particular sales order type, and you allow write-offs for the orders of this type by selecting the '''Auto Write-Off''' check box on the '''General Settings''' tab.
#For each customer for whose documents you want to allow write-offs, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form, you select the customer, and then you do the following on the '''General Info''' tab:
##To allow write-offs for the documents for which this customer is selected, you select the '''Enable Write-Offs''' check box.
##:((({S:Hint}On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_10_00|Customer Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=AR201000|AR201000]) form, you can specify that write-offs are enabled (or not enabled) by default for customers of a particular class. (If needed, you can modify the default setting for any customer of the class.)
)))
##In the '''Write-Off Limit''' box, you specify the customer&rsquo;s write-off limit. The system processes a write-off for an invoice to the customer only if the calculated discrepancy does not exceed the customer&rsquo;s write-off limit.

After you configure the listed entities and settings, the system will automatically calculate small write-offs for SO invoices that are prepared for the orders of the order type for which you enabled write-offs, if the payment amount differs from the invoice amount, and this difference does not exceed the write-off limit specified for the customer. {br}

The write-off amount can be either positive (if the invoice amount is greater than the amount of its applied payment or payments) or negative (if the invoice amount is less than the amount of applied payment or payments). You can correct the calculated write-off amount, if needed, before releasing the SO invoice. When the SO invoice is released, the write-off amount is posted to the account specified in the reason code. Accounts are affected as shown below.[anchor|#table_mlv_rfv_5m]

Note that if a payment is applied to multiple sales orders, the system automatically creates a write-off only on the closing of the last payment application for the invoice that is related to the last sales order to which the payment is applicable. If multiple payments are applied to the same sales order, then the system writes off the discrepancy for the last payment application (the one that causes the SO invoice and the last payment to be closed).{br}

Also, you can manually process small write-offs by entering them directly on the '''Documents to Apply''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_20_00|Payments and Applications] ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) form before applying a payment. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__CON_PaymentApplication|Manual Payment Application].

In Acumatica ERP, you can configure the steps that a user has to perform during automated warehouse operations. This topic lists the settings that you can use to adjust the workflow of different automated warehouse operations to meet your needs. All of these settings are branch-specific; different automated workflows can be configured for different company branches.{br}{TOC}
==Shipment Processing Workflow==
To configure the processing steps a user performs in the automated workflow of shipment processing, you use the following check boxes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form:[anchor|#_5be80f12-6a3d-4a5d-8272-e9c4d0194c55]

Otherwise, the system requests that the user enter the lot or serial number for each line with a serialized item.
*'''Default Expiration Date''' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] and [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] forms: If this check box is selected, the system generates expiration dates for processed serialized items automatically. Otherwise, the system requests that the user enter the expiration date for each line with a serialized item.

For more information about the processing of serialized items, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_WMS_LotSerial|Warehouse Operations with Lot- and Serial-Tracked Items].
==Entry of Locations==
To determine the workflow of entering a receiving location when a user is working in Receive mode, the following settings are available on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form:[anchor|#_811e46c7-36f6-41fb-a354-1728f4a1b8d1]
*'''Use Single Receiving Location''': If this check box is selected, the system asks for the receiving location only once for each purchase receipt being processed; all items of this purchase receipt are received to this location.
*'''Default Receiving Location''': If this check box is selected, the system uses the default receiving location of the warehouse for receiving the purchase receipt.

Each check box listed below determines whether a user is prompted to scan a location for each item or can scan a location for multiple items in the listed mode. If any of these check boxes is cleared, the user is prompted to enter the location or locations (depending on the mode) once, at the beginning of the processing of the applicable document; then the user can enter as many items as is necessary for the entered location or locations. To select a different location, a user should enter this location on the processing form. For the following check boxes, this processing logic applies to the applicable documents for the listed mode:[anchor|#_aaf70df8-8c96-459b-bf9a-66d824cc58a1]
*'''Request Location for Each Item on Receiving''' [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form: For Receive mode

In Acumatica ERP, you can require a user to perform additional steps during the processing of sales orders of a particular order type and related documents, by configuring order settings on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form, and by configuring module preferences on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form.{br}{TOC}
==Holding Documents on Entry==
In the settings of an order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form, you can configure the following settings, which specify whether the orders of this type and related documents should be on hold on creation:[anchor|#ul_xyk_sjb_3db]
*'''Hold Documents on Entry''': If the check box is selected for an order type, new orders of this type will be created with the ''On Hold'' status by default. Otherwise, if check box is cleared, a newly created order will be created with the ''Open'' status. 
*'''Hold Invoices on Entry''': If the check box is selected for an order type, new invoices prepared for the order of this type will be created with the ''On Hold'' status by default. Otherwise, if check box is cleared, invoices will be created with the ''Balanced'' status. 

==Holding Orders on a Failed Credit Check==
By default, a credit check is performed for sales orders of any type; the system displays a warning if the customer fails the credit check. If you want to instead hold sales orders on a failed credit check, you need to select the '''Credit Check on Entry''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form for the needed order type. Then if the customer fails the credit check, the order is assigned the ''Credit Hold'' status. {br}

Orders placed on credit hold can be released from credit hold if customer payments were entered or order amounts were appropriately decreased. To release these orders from credit hold, you select the orders on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) form, select the ''Release from Credit Hold'' action, and process the selected orders. This initiates credit checks for each selected order, and gives the order the ''Open'' status if the credit check is successful. For more details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Credit_Check|Checking the Credit Limit in Sales Documents].
==Holding Invoices on a Failed Credit Check==
New and edited invoices are put on credit hold for customers that fail credit check if the '''Hold Invoices on Failed Credit Check''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] form.
==Affecting the Processing of Inventory Issues==
Generated inventory issues are released automatically if the '''Automatically Release IN Documents''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form. If the check box is cleared, inventory issues are generated and saved with the ''Balanced'' status.
==Making the Entry of Orders Error-Proof==
You select the '''Require Control Total''' check box in the settings of an order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form to prevent the orders of this type from being processed until a user types the total order amount in the '''Control Total''' box, which is displayed on the data entry form if the check box is selected for an order type. The control total that the user enters must be equal to the order total calculated by the system.
==Making the Entry of Shipments Error-Proof==
You select the '''Validate Shipment Total on Confirmation''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form to prevent the shipment from being confirmed until a user types the total quantity of the items being shipped in the '''Control Quantity''' box, which is displayed on the data entry form if the check box is selected. The quantity that the user enters must be equal to the quantity calculated by the system.
==Causing the Documents to Be Processed Separately==
In the settings of an order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form, you can configure the following settings, which specify whether the orders of this type and related documents should be processed individually from other orders of this type:[anchor|#ul_olf_blb_3db]
*'''Bill Separately''': If this check box is selected, the system prepares individual Sales Orders invoices for each order of this type. Otherwise, if the check box is cleared, the system prepares consolidated invoices.
*'''Ship Separately''': If this check box is selected, the system prepares individual shipments for each order of this type. Otherwise, if the check box is cleared, the system prepares consolidated shipments.
*:((({S:Hint}The orders of the type for which the '''Ship Separately''' check box is selected can still be consolidated into a single shipment if you manually add them using the '''Add Order''' button on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form.
)))

==Affecting the Date of the Invoice Generation==
In the settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form, you can select the '''Use Shipment Date for Invoice Date''' check box, if you want to generate Sales Orders invoices with the date of shipment. Otherwise, if the check box is cleared, the system uses the current business date for invoice generation.]]></column>

You may need to reorder document lines in sales orders and invoices—for example, if you need the lines of the printed document to be in a specific order, or if the customer wants you to sort the document lines in some custom order (for example, by the shipment number and order number to make it easier to review a printable invoice). Also, you may need to reorder a line or multiple lines in an existing sales order, or add a new line at the beginning of a list or in the middle of it. The following sections describe how you can reorder lines in various sales documents.
==Reordering Lines in Sales Orders and Invoices==
The order number of each document line is shown in the '''Line Order''' column on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form for sales orders, and of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form for invoices. (On both forms, these columns are hidden by default, so you should use the '''Column Configuration''' dialog box to make the columns available before you reorder lines.) Once you reorder the lines, the system automatically regenerates the order numbers for each document line. {br}

You can select the lines to be reordered in any combinations, such as the following:[anchor|#ul_fjp_dyj_gz]
*A single document line (for example, line 3 or 8). To select a single line, click it. 
*Multiple non-contiguous lines (for example, lines 1, 3, and 7). To select these lines, hold Ctrl while clicking the row selector next to the needed lines.
*A contiguous group of document lines (for example, line 5 through line 9). To select a group of lines, select the first line in the group, and hold Shift while clicking the last line in the group. (Alternatively, you can click the first line and then press Shift+Down Arrow until all the needed lines are selected.)
*A group of some contiguous lines and some non-contiguous lines (for example, line 5 through line 7, and line 10). To select a non-contiguous group of lines, hold Ctrl while clicking the row selector next to the needed lines.

All selected document lines are grouped, and thus are moved contiguously, even if you have selected multiple non-contiguous document lines. After you have selected the needed lines, you move them to the new place in the table in one of the following ways:[anchor|#ul_g1n_vck_gz]
*Drag the selected document line or lines to the place where you want to move them. A thin red line between the lines shows where these lines will be inserted. Once you drag the selected lines, the system moves these lines and regenerates the '''Line Order''' numbers for all the lines in the table.
*When you need to move document lines between pages, cut the selected document lines and paste them to the new place in the table. To cut the lines, press Ctrl+X, or right-click the table and then click '''Cut Row'''. Then click the line above which the cut lines should be inserted, and press Ctrl+V; alternatively, you can right-click the table, and then click '''Insert Cut Row'''. 

Once you reorder the document lines, the system automatically regenerates the line number for each document line. These numbers are used for numbering lines in the printable reports, such as the printable sales order shown on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form or the printable invoice shown on the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\SO_64_30_00|Invoice / Memo] ([~/?ScreenId=SO643000|SO643000]) form. You can cancel the line reordering by clicking '''Cancel''' on the form toolbar before you save these changes. You can reorder the lines of a sales order until it has been completed; the lines of an invoice can be reordered until it has been released.
==Resetting the Line Order in Invoices==
The invoice lines that you add by using the '''Add Order''' dialog box, which opens when you click the '''Add Order''' button on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form, are added to the table in the order in which you have added them. If you need to rearrange the lines in the table to sort them by shipment numbers and order numbers, you can click the '''Reset Order''' button on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab. When you click this button, the system automatically sorts the invoice lines and regenerates '''Line Order''' numbers for all the lines in the table.
==Inserting New Lines into Sales Orders and Invoices==
You can insert a single line anywhere in the document. To do this, click the line above which the new line should be inserted and then press Shift+Insert, or right-click the needed line and then click '''Insert Row'''. The system adds a new blank line. When you finish populating the line information and save your changes, the system automatically regenerates the line numbers for all lines in the table.]]></column>

To simplify entering an order and minimize errors on data entry, you may start to create a sales order by copying and pasting another sales order, which you use as a template. In this case, you need to change the customer ID specified for the sales order to another one. You can change the customer ID in the '''Customer''' box of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form for a sales order that has one of the following statuses: [anchor|#ul_tfc_fvv_wx]
*''On Hold''
* ''Open'' (if the order is new)
*''Credit Hold'' (if the order is new)
*''Back Order'' (if the new order has been placed on back order manually)

You can also change the customer ID in a return order that does not have lines linked to invoices and in a sales quote that is not linked to a sales order.{br}

The following sections describe the specifics of changing the customer in a document.
==Information Kept After the Customer Is Changed==
When you change the customer ID in the sales order, the system preserves the following information: [anchor|#ul_pfq_czd_xx]
*Order type, order number, and description
*Currency ID, currency rate type, and currency rate
*Document date and date when the customer wants to receive the goods
*Order-level shipping rule, and shipping rules in the order lines
*Inventory IDs and warehouses specified in the order lines
*Hard allocations of inventory
*Notes, activities, and attachments

==Information Updated After the Customer Is Changed==
When you change the customer ID in the sales order, the system updates the following document information by using the settings of the newly selected customer:[anchor|#ul_kvg_swv_wx]
*Credit verification status
*Salesperson commissions
*Customer-specific settings on the '''Document Details''', '''Financial Settings''', '''Payment Settings''', and '''Shipping Settings''' tabs
*Taxes and freight tax category
*Group and document discounts
*Unit prices, except manual unit prices for which the '''Manual Price''' check box is selected in the document line
*Line discounts, except manual line discounts for which the '''Manual Discount''' check box is selected in the document line

The system does not automatically save the document after you change the customer ID, so you can easily cancel these changes.
==Restrictions on Customer Override==
There are some restrictions on changing the customer in a sales order. You cannot save the sales order after changing the customer in any of the following cases:[anchor|#ul_nmt_rfw_wx]
*The sales order has the ''Open'' status and is subject for approval.
*The sales order has a linked shipment, invoice, inventory issue, or drop-ship purchase order.
*Credit card payments have been authorized or captured for the sales order.
*Accounts Receivable payments or prepayments have been applied to the sales order.
*The currency of the newly selected customer differs from the currency that was previously specified in the sales order, and the system cannot override the currency in the sales order. (This could happen if the currency override is not allowed for the newly selected customer.) 

To avoid situations when the system does not allow you to override the customer, we recommend that you create order templates by currency and for each unique set of shipping rules, to make sure that shipments are processed as expected.]]></column>
			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Changing the Customer in a Sales Order To simplify entering an order and minimize errors on data entry, you may start to create a     sales order by copying and pasting another sales order, which you use as a template. In this     case, you need to change the customer ID specified for the sales order to another one. You can     change the customer ID in the  Customer  box of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form for a sales order that has one of the     following statuses:  On Hold Open  (if the order is new) Credit Hold  (if the order is new) Back Order  (if the new order has been placed on back order manually) You can also change the customer ID in a return order that does not have lines linked to     invoices and in a sales quote that is not linked to a sales order. The following sections describe the specifics of changing the customer in a document. Information Kept After the Customer Is Changed When you change the customer ID in the sales order, the system preserves the following     information:  Order type, order number, and description Currency ID, currency rate type, and currency rate Document date and date when the customer wants to receive the goods Order-level shipping rule, and shipping rules in the order lines Inventory IDs and warehouses specified in the order lines Hard allocations of inventory Notes, activities, and attachments Information Updated After the Customer Is Changed When you change the customer ID in the sales order, the system updates the following document     information by using the settings of the newly selected customer: Credit verification status Salesperson commissions Customer-specific settings on the  Document Details ,        Financial Settings ,  Payment Settings , and        Shipping Settings  tabs Taxes and freight tax category Group and document discounts Unit prices, except manual unit prices for which the  Manual Price       check box is selected in the document line Line discounts, except manual line discounts for which the  Manual       Discount  check box is selected in the document line The system does not automatically save the document after you change the customer ID, so you     can easily cancel these changes. Restrictions on Customer Override There are some restrictions on changing the customer in a sales order. You cannot save the     sales order after changing the customer in any of the following cases: The sales order has the  Open  status and is subject for approval. The sales order has a linked shipment, invoice, inventory issue, or drop-ship purchase      order. Credit card payments have been authorized or captured for the sales order. Accounts Receivable payments or prepayments have been applied to the sales order. The currency of the newly selected customer differs from the currency that was previously      specified in the sales order, and the system cannot override the currency in the sales order.      (This could happen if the currency override is not allowed for the newly selected customer.)      To avoid situations when the system does not allow you to override the customer, we recommend     that you create order templates by currency and for each unique set of shipping rules, to make     sure that shipments are processed as expected. ]]></column>

==Credit Check for Sales Orders==
The system performs a credit check of the customer for sales orders of most predefined types. When a user selects a customer for the order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, the system performs the customer credit check. If the credit rules specified for the customer on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form have been violated (that is, if the customer has exceeded the credit limit, the days past due, or both), the system displays a yellow exclamation mark to the left of the '''Customer''' box. By pointing at the mark, the user can read the warning. {br}

You can use the '''Hold Document on Failed Credit Check ''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form to indicate to the system how the orders of the specific type should be processed if the customer fails the credit check: [anchor|#ul_ndy_pdw_dt]
*If this check box is selected for the order type, when an order of this type is saved (or taken off hold, depending on whether the '''Hold Orders on Entry''' check box is selected for the order type), it will be assigned the ''Credit Hold'' status. By default, the check box is selected only for the ''SA (Sales Orders with Allocation)'' order type.
*If the check box is cleared for the order type, when an order of this type is saved or taken off hold, it will be assigned the ''Open'' status. The order can be processed as the orders that passed the credit check can be processed.

If customer payments were entered or order amounts were decreased for a customer that had violated the credit rules, orders that were previously placed on credit hold can be released from it. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) form, you can select the ''Release from Credit Hold'' action (as long as your user account has access to this action), select the orders with the ''Credit Hold'' status in the table, and click '''Process''' on the form toolbar. This initiates credit checks for each order selected, and if the credit check is successful, the applicable order receives a status of ''Open''. {br}

If approval of sales orders is configured in your system, you may need to assign the orders that have been taken from credit hold for approval—in this case, add to the approval map a condition or multiple conditions that assign the orders with the '''Credit Hold''' check box selected to specific approvers. Then on release from credit hold, the orders will get the ''Pending Approval'' status if the conditions are met. {br}

Alternatively, you can release each order from credit hold individually by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. If you as a user have access to the '''Actions &gt; Release from Credit Hold''' action on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form, you can click this action to change the status of the order to ''Open'' and process it further despite of the failed credit check. If when editing this order you increase the order amount, then when you save the order, it will get the ''Credit Hold'' status. If you do not change the amount, you can process the order further; an invoice generated for the order will not get the ''Credit Hold'' status (even if the '''Hold Invoices on Failed Credit Check''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form) and can be released.
==Credit Check for Invoices==
Generally, invoices are generated for sales orders that have passed the credit check; however, you may need to perform a separate credit check for invoices and hold invoices if the credit check has failed. Depending on your organization&rsquo;s business processes, the time range between shipment creation and invoice generation may be significant, and during this time, the prices may change. Also, services and warranties may be added manually to invoices, rather than to sales orders. {br}

A credit check is performed for each new invoice that is created by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form, and if the customer fails the credit check, the system displays a yellow exclamation mark to the left of the '''Customer''' box and a warning. However, you may want invoices to be placed on credit hold if they fail the credit check. You can select the '''Hold Invoices on Failed Credit Check''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form to indicate to the system that all invoices that fail the credit check should get the ''Credit Hold'' status. For invoices with the ''Credit Hold'' status, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_50_00|Process Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=SO505000|SO505000]) form, you can periodically perform the ''Release from Credit Hold'' action, which initiates a credit check and opens the invoices of those customers who have paid their outstanding balances fully or partially or have extended the credit limits.

During the processing of orders, you may need to print copies of the processed documents. The printer the system uses for printing documents, must be configured, as described in [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__mng_Configuring_DeviceHub_Tool|Configuring DeviceHub]. The following sections describe which printable Sales Orders documents you can prepare in Acumatica ERP.
==Printing Orders and Quotes==
You can print a sales order or quote by clicking the '''Reports &gt; Print Sales Order/Quote''' action on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. This action opens the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\SO_64_10_10|Sales Order] ([~/?ScreenId=SO641010|SO641010]) report form with the printable form of the order or quote.
==Printing Pick Lists==
A pick list is a document that is printed for a warehouse worker. It contains the lines from the shipment with quantities, lot or serial numbers of items, and warehouse locations from which the items have to be collected; a pick list does not contain information about prices. The pick list is prepared based on item availability information and the pick priorities of warehouse locations. If the highest priority location has insufficient stock of any of the requested items, the system will search for another location with some quantity available for shipping to fill the remainder. On a pick list, items are ordered based on location, pick priority, and expiration dates of items. {br}

With Acumatica ERP, you can print a pick list for a particular shipment with the ''On Hold'' or ''Open'' status by clicking '''Action''' > '''Print Pick List''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form. For a step-by-step procedure on how to print a pick list for a particular shipment, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Print_Pick_List|To Print a Pick List for a Shipment].{br}

If you need to print pick lists for multiple shipments, you can select the ''Print Pick List'' action on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_30_00|Process Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO503000|SO503000]) form and process all the shipments on the list or only the selected shipments. For a step-by-step procedure on how to mass-print pick lists for multiple shipments, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Print_PickLists|To Print Pick Lists for Multiple Shipments].((({S:Hint}If a pick list was once printed for a shipment, the shipment will be listed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_30_00|Process Shipments] form for this processing only if the '''Show Printed''' check box is selected—this helps avoid double packing for the same shipment.

You may need to reorder document lines in purchase orders and purchase receipts—for example, if you need the lines of the printed document to be in a specific order other than in the document sent by vendor. Also, you may need to add a new line to a purchase order or purchase receipt at the beginning of a list or in the middle of it. The following sections describe how you can reorder lines in various Purchase Orders documents.{br}{TOC}
==Reordering Lines in Purchase Orders==
The order number of each document line is shown in the '''Line Order''' column on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form for purchase orders, and of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form for purchase receipts. (On both forms, these columns are hidden by default so you should use the '''Column Configuration''' dialog box to make the columns available before you reorder lines.) {br}

Once you reorder the lines, the system automatically regenerates the order numbers for each document line. You can reorder lines in a purchase order that is on hold; in a purchase receipt, you can reorder the lines until this receipt has been released. You can select the lines to be reordered in any combinations, such as the following:[anchor|#ul_r23_c1l_gz]
*A single document line (for example, line 3 or 8). To select a single line, click it. 
*Multiple non-contiguous lines (for example, lines 1, 3, and 7). To select these lines, hold Ctrl while clicking the row selector next to the needed lines.
*A contiguous group of document lines (for example, line 5 through line 9). To select a group of lines, select the first line in the group, and hold Shift while clicking the last line in the group. (Alternatively, you can click the first line and then press Shift+Down Arrow until all the needed lines are selected.)
*A group of some contiguous lines and some non-contiguous lines (for example, line 5 through line 7, and line 10). To select a non-contiguous group of lines, hold Ctrl while clicking the row selector next to the needed lines.

All selected lines are grouped and thus are moved contiguously, even if you have selected multiple non-contiguous document lines. After you have selected the needed lines, move them to the new place in the table in one of the following ways:[anchor|#ul_s23_c1l_gz]
*Drag the selected line or lines to the place where you want to move them. A thin red line between the table lines shows where these lines will be inserted. Once you drag the selected lines, the system moves these lines and regenerates the '''Line Order''' numbers for all the lines in the table.
*When you need to move purchase order or purchase receipt lines between pages, cut the selected document lines and paste them to the new place in the table. To cut the lines, press Ctrl+X, or right-click the table and then click '''Cut Row'''. Then click the line the cut lines should be inserted above, and press Ctrl+V; alternatively, you can right-click the table, and then click '''Insert Cut Row'''. 

Once you reorder the lines, the system automatically regenerates the line number for each document line. For purchase receipts, these numbers are used for numbering lines in the printable reports, such as the printable purchase receipt shown on the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\PO_64_60_00|Purchase Receipt] ([~/?ScreenId=PO646000|PO646000]) report. You can cancel the line reordering by clicking '''Cancel''' on the form toolbar before you save these changes.((({S:Hint}You cannot rearrange lines in the table if custom sorting by any column is applied to the table.
)))
==Inserting Lines into Purchase Orders and Purchase Receipts==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, you can insert a single line anywhere in the document. To do this, click the line above which the new line should be inserted and then press Shift+Insert, or right-click the needed line and then click '''Insert Row'''. The system adds a new blank line. When you finish entering the line information and save your changes, the system automatically regenerates the line numbers for all lines in the table.]]></column>
			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Managing Lines in Purchase Documents You may need to reorder document lines in purchase orders and purchase receipts—for     example, if you need the lines of the printed document to be in a specific order other than in     the document sent by vendor. Also, you may need to add a new line to a purchase order or     purchase receipt at the beginning of a list or in the middle of it. The following sections     describe how you can reorder lines in various Purchase Orders documents. Reordering Lines in Purchase Orders The order number of each document line is shown in the  Line Order      column on the  Document Details  tab of the    ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form for purchase orders, and of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000)     form for purchase receipts.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[In Acumatica ERP, you can require a user to perform additional steps during the processing of purchase orders and related documents. The following sections of this topic explain how you can adjust the workflow for processing the purchase orders and the related documents as needed in your organization.{br}{TOC}
==Holding Purchase Receipts and Landed Cost Documents on Entry==
The following documents are created with the ''On Hold'' status if the respective check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form:[anchor|#_8f8c8df5-ee2e-4b96-ad65-6679a1f6acdb]
*Purchase receipts: '''Hold Receipts on Entry'''
*Landed cost documents: '''Hold Landed Costs on Entry'''

If one of these check boxes is cleared, the newly created documents of the associated type are created with the ''Balanced'' status.
==Affecting the Processing of Generated Documents==
The following documents are released automatically upon generation if the respective check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form: [anchor|#_87bc04d6-dcce-45fa-887d-0e83b731943d]
*Inventory receipts: '''Release IN Documents Automatically'''
*Landed cost adjustments: '''Release LC IN Adjustments Automatically'''
*Accounts payable documents: '''Release AP Documents Automatically'''

If one of these check boxes is cleared, the documents of the associated type are generated and saved with the ''Balanced'' status.
==Making the Entry of Documents Error-Proof==
In the '''Validate Total on Entry''' section on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form, you can prevent the particular type of document from being processed until a user types the total order amount in the '''Control Total''' box (for orders and landed costs), or the total receipt quantity in the '''Control Qty.''' box, on the corresponding document entry form. The control total or quantity that the user enters must be equal to the order total calculated by the system. You can select the corresponding check boxes in this section to enable total validation for receipts, normal and standard purchase orders, blanket orders, drop-ship purchase orders, and landed cost documents.
==Making the Entry of an External Reference Number Foolproof==
You select the '''Require Vendor Reference''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_10_10_00|Accounts Payable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AP101000|AP101000]) form to prevent any actions from being performed on a purchase receipt or a landed cost document (that is still editable) until a user types the external reference number of the vendor's original document in the '''Vendor Ref.''' box, which is displayed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form (for purchase receipts) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_30_00|Landed Costs] ([~/?ScreenId=PO303000|PO303000]) form (for landed cost documents).
==Affecting the Purchase Receipt Creation==
You can use the '''Default Receipt Quantity''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form to define which quantities the system should specify in purchase receipts created from purchase orders. You can configure the system to create purchase receipt lines with items' quantities from a purchase order (if the ''Open Quantity'' is selected), or to create lines with a quantity of zero by default, so that the user enters the received quantity manually.
==Determining Whether Bills Are Created==
To set up the workflow of the processing of purchase receipts, landed cost documents, and bills, you can use the '''Create Bill On Receipt Release''' and '''Create Bill on LC Release''' check boxes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form. These check boxes provides the default value for the '''Create Bill''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form and on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_30_00|Landed Costs] ([~/?ScreenId=PO303000|PO303000]) form, respectively. {br}

For the convenience of users, you should select these check boxes if bills should be generated automatically for most receipts and landed cost documents. You should clear these check boxes if users should enter bills manually for most receipts or landed cost documents or if users enter or import the bills and later link them to receipts and landed cost documents. A user can override this setting if needed for a particular purchase receipt or landed cost document.
==Affecting the Processing of Bills==
The '''Allow AP Bill Before Receipt''' check box, which can be selected or cleared for a particular vendor on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form or for a particular vendor location on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_10|Vendor Locations] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303010|AP303010]) form, defines the workflow for processing purchase orders and related documents. The state of the check box is copied to purchase orders prepared for the vendor, and affects the processing as follows:[anchor|#_0ed78713-c220-43bb-b7c2-a5e4691105e6]
*If the check box is selected, you can create a purchase receipt and an AP bill for the purchase order in any order.
*If the check box is cleared, you can prepare an AP bill for the lines with stock items and non-stock items requiring receipt only after the purchase receipt has been prepared and processed.

==Affecting the Processing of Service Lines==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form, you can specify whether the system should process lines of the ''Service'' type in normal and drop-ship purchase orders, respectively, through purchase receipts by selecting or clearing the following check boxes:[anchor|#_12e8ba02-717e-4009-9ba8-4d56d61730a6]
*'''Process Service Lines from Normal Purchase Orders via Purchase Receipt''': If this check box is selected, non-stock lines of the ''Service'' type in purchase orders of the ''Normal'' type are processed through purchase receipts. If the check box is cleared, the non-stock lines of the ''Service'' type are not copied to purchase receipts and are billed directly from purchase orders. 
*'''Process Service Lines from Drop-Ship Purchase Orders via Purchase Receipt''': If this check box is selected, non-stock lines of the ''Service'' type in purchase orders of the ''Drop-Ship'' type are processed through purchase receipts. If the check box is cleared, the non-stock lines of the ''Service'' type are not copied to purchase receipts and are billed directly from drop-ship orders.

You can create a quote (an order of the ''QT'' type) to record a planned sale. The quantities of goods and the document amounts on open quotes do not cause the allocation of stock items in inventory and do not update the information in the Accounts Receivable module. To be able to prepare an invoice to the customer for the quote and issue the included items from inventory, you need to create a sales order of the needed type based on that quote and process the sales order. As soon as any order (even for a partial quantity of items) has been prepared from the quote, the quote becomes completed.{br}{TOC}
==Entering a Quote==
You create a sales order of the ''QT'' type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form to represent a customer's interest in possibly purchasing goods in a specified quantity on a specified date. {br}

For a quote, you specify the following information:[anchor|#ul_fdk_lkp_np]
*The customer and its location
*The planned order date and requested date
*The shipping rule for the order and for each order line
*The shipping terms
*The included stock and non-stock items with their quantities, units of measure, unit prices, and tax category
*The expiration date of the quote
{br}

New orders of the ''QT'' type are saved with the ''Open'' status by default because the '''Hold Documents on Entry''' check box is cleared for this order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form; you can change this default setting. The first time you save the new quote, the system generates a reference number for it according to the numbering sequence assigned to this order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] form.
==Creating a Sales Order from a Quote==
From the open quote on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]), you can create an order of any of the following types: ''SO'' (sales order), ''IN'' (invoice order), or ''CS'' (cash sale order). To create an order from a quote, you click the '''Actions &gt; Copy Order''' action on the form toolbar. When you create an order based on a quote, the details of the quote (including the document lines and the specified accounts and subaccounts) are copied to the created order. You can select whether to recalculate discounts on sales orders copied from quotes. After you have copied a quote to a sales order, the quote becomes completed.{br}

Quotes can also be used as templates for repeating orders for a particular customer. In this case, you can create orders based on quotes by using the standard copy-paste functionality on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. When you create an order in this way, the quote is not completed and is still available when you need to prepare other sales orders.
==Canceling a Quote==
To reflect in the system that the customer is no longer considering a particular proposed sale (quote) or that your company is no longer offering the included item or items at the specified price or prices, you need to cancel the quote. For each newly created quote, you can specify an expiration date in the '''Cancel By''' box on the '''Shipping Settings''' tab. By default, the system calculates the '''Cancel By''' date as follows: the number of days specified in the '''Days to Keep''' box for the ''QT'' order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] form ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) is added to the '''Date''' specified in the quote.{br}

The system does not cancel the expired quotes automatically. A user should cancel expired quotes manually or by using the ''Cancel Order'' action on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] form ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]). ]]></column>

To create an order from a quote, you click the  Actions > Copy Order  action on the form toolbar. When you create an order based on a quote, the     details of the quote (including the document lines and the specified accounts and subaccounts)     are copied to the created order. You can select whether to recalculate discounts on sales orders     copied from quotes. After you have copied a quote to a sales order, the quote becomes     completed. Quotes can also be used as templates for repeating orders for a particular customer. In this     case, you can create orders based on quotes by using the standard copy-paste functionality on     the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form. When you create an order in this way, the     quote is not completed and is still available when you need to prepare other sales orders. Canceling a Quote To reflect in the system that the customer is no longer considering a particular proposed sale     (quote) or that your company is no longer offering the included item or items at the specified     price or prices, you need to cancel the quote. For each newly created quote, you can specify an     expiration date in the  Cancel By  box on the  Shipping      Settings  tab. By default, the system calculates the  Cancel      By  date as follows: the number of days specified in the  Days to      Keep  box for the  QT  order type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types form     (SO201000) is added to the  Date  specified in the quote. The system does not cancel the expired quotes automatically. A user should cancel expired     quotes manually or by using the  Cancel Order  action on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) Process Orders form (SO501000).  ]]></column>

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
To process a sale that requires the items to be shipped before an invoice can be prepared, you can use sales orders of the ''SO'' and ''SA'' predefined types. A sales order of the ''SO'' type represents a customer request to buy goods in a specified quantity on a specified date. A sales order of the ''SA'' type also represents a customer request to buy goods in a specified quantity on a particular date, but in this case, the goods are automatically reserved in inventory (that is, are allocated) for this particular order. In a typical distribution organization, the customer order may be taken over the phone or received by email.{br}

For a sales order of the ''SO'' or ''SA'' type that includes stock items and may include non-stock items requiring shipment, the typical processing involves the actions and generated documents shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#fig_p5z_bpd_h5][anchor|#image_z5v_1hn_dt][image:UserGuide/Images/Inventory_Sale_With_Shipping.png|popup|450px]((({S:Hint}If quick processing is configured for the ''SO'' or ''SA'' order type, you can perform complete processing of orders of that type directly from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Quick_Process_Workflow|Quick Processing of Sales Orders].
)))
The following sections describe in detail the processing steps shown in the diagram.{br}{TOC}
==1. Enter the Sales Order==
You create a new sales order of the ''SO'' or ''SA'' type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. A reference number for a new orders are generated according to the numbering sequence assigned to this order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] form. If the order is created with the ''On Hold'' status, you should clear the '''Hold''' check box for the order to process it further. For details about the settings specified in the sales order, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_SO_OrderInfo|Sales Order Entry].
==2. Reserve Items in the Warehouse==
For an ''SA'' order the system reserves stock items in inventory automatically. For an ''SO'' order, item allocation is optional and can be performed manually by user, if needed.{br}

For a sales order of the ''SO'' type, you may choose to manually allocate (reserve) the requested quantity for a specific item or multiple items if this is required by your company policies or was requested by the customer. If you perform allocation for any item on a sales order with the ''On Hold'', ''Credit Hold'', ''Pending Approval'', ''Rejected'', or ''Open'' status, the item quantity will be added to the SO Allocated quantity shown for the item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_20_00|Inventory Allocation Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) form. Also, you may want to reserve the line item if the item is available but the quantity required for the order line is distributed between different warehouses and any transfers are required.{br}

For a sales order of the ''SA'' type, once a user saves a new sales order, even with the ''On Hold'' status, the system automatically reserves the requested quantities of items for this order. On the '''Document Details''' tab, you can view the allocation for each line item and change it, if needed. by clicking a line and clicking the '''Allocations''' button. The quantities of the items that have been allocated for the order are added to SO Allocated quantities and deducted from Available for Shipping quantities (both of which are reflected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_20_00|Inventory Allocation Details] form)—thus, these quantities cannot be shipped for another order. If the ordered quantity is available only partially and cannot be fully allocated at the specified locations, the quantity that has been allocated for the order will be added to the SO Allocated quantity, while the remaining (unallocated) quantity will be added to the SO Back Ordered quantity. You can also click the '''Actions''' > '''Place on Back Order''' action on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form to back-order the sales order until the full quantities of ordered items become available in the specified warehouse. Alternatively, you can allocate the unavailable quantity in other warehouses.
==3. Prepare the Shipment==
You can create a shipment for an individual sales order by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Create Shipment''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. Alternatively, you can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) form to create shipments for multiple orders by executing the ''Create Shipment'' action for the selected sales orders. Each newly created shipment will have the ''Open'' status if the '''Hold Shipments on Entry''' check box is cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form.{br}

The way the order will be fulfilled depends on the shipping rules specified for the order and for each line of the order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. The shipping rule specified for a line on the '''Details''' tab defines whether the stock item should be shipped only in the full ordered quantity or the item can be shipped partially in one shipment or multiple shipments. For detailed information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Shipping_Rules|Shipping Rule Combinations]. {br}

If you attempt to create a shipment for an ''SA'' order before you allocate the entire quantities and if partial shipment is allowed by the specified line-level and document-level shipping rules, the system will be able to include only the allocated quantities in the shipment, even if the ordered quantities are available for shipping at another location or locations but were not allocated for the order.{br}

You can print a pick list for a particular shipment by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] form. For multiple shipments with the ''On Hold'' and ''Open'' statuses, you can print pick lists by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_30_00|Process Shipments] form. For more details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Shipment_Processing|Shipment Processing Steps].((({S:Hint}To track how a sales order is being fulfilled, you can check its status and the quantities that are being shipped and not yet shipped (the '''Shipped Qty.''' and '''Open Quantity''' columns, respectively, on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form.
)))
==4. Confirm the Shipment==
You can confirm a shipment for a particular order by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Confirm Shipment''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form, or you can confirm multiple shipments by executing the ''Confirm Shipment'' action for the selected shipments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_30_00|Process Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO503000|SO503000]) form. 
==5. Prepare the Sales Orders Invoice==
You can prepare a Sales Orders invoice for a particular shipment by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Prepare Invoice''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form, or you can create invoices by using the ''Prepare Invoice'' action and processing multiple selected shipments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_30_00|Process Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO503000|SO503000]) form. The prepared document or documents can be reviewed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form.{br}

You can print an SO invoice by clicking '''Reports &gt; Print Invoice''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form. 
==6. Release the Sales Orders Invoice==
To release the Sales Orders invoice, you click '''Actions &gt; Release''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form. When the SO invoice is released, a batch of General Ledger transactions is generated. {br}

When the SO invoice is released, the system automatically generates a corresponding inventory issue with the date and posting period of the invoice. If the invoice is linked to multiple shipments, the system generates a separate inventory issue for each shipment. If the invoice includes a part of the shipment, the system generates an individual inventory issue for this part. If the system cannot prepare any of the inventory issues for the invoice for some reason, the invoice release is rolled back. {br}

Also, when the SO invoice is released, a corresponding Accounts Receivable invoice is created and becomes available on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form. For more information on processing Accounts Receivable invoices, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__MNG_InvoicesMemos|Processing Invoices].{br}

If the ordered goods have been shipped in full according to the shipping rules, then on invoice release, the order gets the ''Completed'' status. If the order has been shipped partially, it gets the ''Back Order'' status and can be completed by additional shipments. 
==7. Release the Inventory Issue==
The generated inventory issue is released automatically if the '''Automatically Release IN Documents''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] form. If this check box is cleared, you have to release the inventory issue manually by clicking '''Release''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form.]]></column>
			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Processing Steps for Sales Orders To process a sale that requires the items to be shipped before an invoice can be prepared, you         can use sales orders of the  SO  and  SA  predefined types. A sales order of the            SO  type represents a customer request to buy goods in a specified quantity on a         specified date. A sales order of the  SA  type also represents a customer request to         buy goods in a specified quantity on a particular date, but in this case, the goods are         automatically reserved in inventory (that is, are allocated) for this particular order. In a         typical distribution organization, the customer order may be taken over the phone or         received by email. For a sales order of the  SO  or  SA  type that includes stock items and may         include non-stock items requiring shipment, the typical processing involves the actions and         generated documents shown in the following diagram. If quick processing is configured for the  SO  or  SA  order type, you can         perform complete processing of orders of that type directly from the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form. For more information, see  Quick Processing of Sales Orders. The following sections describe in detail the processing steps shown in the diagram. 1. Enter the Sales Order You create a new sales order of the  SO  or  SA  type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form. A reference number for a new orders are generated     according to the numbering sequence assigned to this order type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types form. If the order is created with the  On Hold  status, you     should clear the  Hold  check box for the order to process it further. For     details about the settings specified in the sales order, see  Sales Order Entry. 2. Reserve Items in the Warehouse For an  SA  order the system reserves stock items in inventory automatically. For an       SO  order, item allocation is optional and can be performed manually by user, if     needed. For a sales order of the  SO  type, you may choose to manually allocate (reserve) the     requested quantity for a specific item or multiple items if this is required by your company     policies or was requested by the customer. If you perform allocation for any item on a sales     order with the  On Hold ,  Credit Hold ,  Pending Approval ,  Rejected , or       Open  status, the item quantity will be added to the SO Allocated quantity shown for the     item on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) Inventory Allocation Details (IN402000) form. Also, you may want to reserve the     line item if the item is available but the quantity required for the order line is distributed     between different warehouses and any transfers are required. For a sales order of the  SA  type, once a user saves a new sales order, even with the       On Hold  status, the system automatically reserves the requested quantities of items for     this order. On the  Document Details  tab, you can view the allocation for     each line item and change it, if needed. by clicking a line and clicking the       Allocations  button. The quantities of the items that have been allocated     for the order are added to SO Allocated quantities and deducted from Available for Shipping     quantities (both of which are reflected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) Inventory Allocation Details form)—thus, these     quantities cannot be shipped for another order. If the ordered quantity is available only     partially and cannot be fully allocated at the specified locations, the quantity that has been     allocated for the order will be added to the SO Allocated quantity, while the remaining     (unallocated) quantity will be added to the SO Back Ordered quantity. You can also click the  Actions Place on Back Order  action on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders form to     back-order the sales order until the full quantities of ordered items become available in the     specified warehouse. Alternatively, you can allocate the unavailable quantity in other     warehouses. 3. Prepare the Shipment You can create a shipment for an individual sales order by clicking  Actions Create Shipment  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form.     Alternatively, you can use the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) Process Orders (SO501000) form to create     shipments for multiple orders by executing the  Create Shipment  action for the selected     sales orders. Each newly created shipment will have the  Open  status if the       Hold Shipments on Entry  check box is cleared on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences (SO101000) form. The way the order will be fulfilled depends on the shipping rules specified for the order         and for each line of the order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form. The         shipping rule specified for a line on the  Details  tab defines whether         the stock item should be shipped only in the full ordered quantity or the item can be         shipped partially in one shipment or multiple shipments. For detailed information, see  Shipping Rule Combinations.  If you attempt to create a shipment for an  SA  order before you allocate the entire     quantities and if partial shipment is allowed by the specified line-level and document-level     shipping rules, the system will be able to include only the allocated quantities in the     shipment, even if the ordered quantities are available for shipping at another location or     locations but were not allocated for the order. You can print a pick list for a particular shipment by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments form. For multiple shipments with the  On Hold  and  Open  statuses, you can print     pick lists by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO503000|SO503000]) Process Shipments form. For more details, see  Shipment Processing Steps. To track how a sales order is being fulfilled, you can check its status and the quantities     that are being shipped and not yet shipped (the  Shipped Qty.  and       Open Quantity  columns, respectively, on the  Document      Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders form. 4. Confirm the Shipment You can confirm a shipment for a particular order by clicking  Actions Confirm Shipment  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) form, or     you can confirm multiple shipments by executing the  Confirm Shipment  action for the     selected shipments on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO503000|SO503000]) Process Shipments (SO503000) form.  5. Prepare the Sales Orders Invoice You can prepare a Sales Orders invoice for a particular shipment by clicking  Actions Prepare Invoice  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) form, or     you can create invoices by using the  Prepare Invoice  action and processing multiple     selected shipments on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO503000|SO503000]) Process Shipments (SO503000) form. The prepared document     or documents can be reviewed on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form. You can print an SO invoice by clicking  Reports > Print Invoice  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form.  6. Release the Sales Orders Invoice To release the Sales Orders invoice, you click  Actions > Release  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form. When     the SO invoice is released, a batch of General Ledger transactions is generated.  When the SO invoice is released, the system automatically generates a corresponding inventory     issue with the date and posting period of the invoice. If the invoice is linked to multiple     shipments, the system generates a separate inventory issue for each shipment. If the invoice     includes a part of the shipment, the system generates an individual inventory issue for this     part. If the system cannot prepare any of the inventory issues for the invoice for some reason,     the invoice release is rolled back.  Also, when the SO invoice is released, a corresponding Accounts Receivable invoice is created     and becomes available on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form. For more     information on processing Accounts Receivable invoices, see  Processing Invoices. If the ordered goods have been shipped in full according to the shipping rules, then on     invoice release, the order gets the  Completed  status. If the order has been shipped     partially, it gets the  Back Order  status and can be completed by additional shipments.     7. Release the Inventory Issue The generated inventory issue is released automatically if the  Automatically      Release IN Documents  check box is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences     form. If this check box is cleared, you have to release the inventory issue manually by clicking       Release  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) Issues     (IN302000) form. ]]></column>

The fulfillment of sales orders is most effective if the system displays correct information about the quantities of items that are on hand and available for shipping. In Acumatica ERP, you can reserve (also called allocate) stock when you enter sales orders so that the items promised to a customer can’t be shipped to another customer; this helps your company to avoid overstocks and stockouts of items being sold.{br}

This article describes the allocation options available for orders of the ''SA'' and ''SO'' predefined types.{br}{TOC}
==Sales Orders with Automatic Allocation (SA)==
When you save an order of the ''SA'' type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, the system automatically attempts to reserve the requested quantities of all line items in the specified warehouse. To view whether the entire ordered quantity of a line item has been successfully reserved, on the '''Document Details''' tab, you can click a line in the order and click '''Allocations''' on the table toolbar; then review the allocation schedule in the '''Allocations''' dialog box, which is opened. For any of the line items, if there is an insufficient quantity in the specified warehouse, the system automatically splits the requested quantity into two allocation schedules: one with the available quantity reserved in the specified warehouse, and one with the remaining quantity, for which you can select another source warehouse and reserve the remaining quantity (or a part of it) manually.((({S:Hint}If you have reserved items at multiple warehouses, the processing of the sales order requires processing a transfer order to move items from the source warehouse to the warehouse where they are needed for sale. After the transferred quantities are received to a single warehouse, you can create a shipment for the order. For a detailed description of this process, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_scn_Sale_with_Transfer|Processing Steps for a Sale with Transfer].
)))
Also, you can use the '''Allocations''' dialog box to track the order fulfillment. For each allocation line, the '''Related Document''' column contains the reference number of the document related to the current stage of the order fulfillment. 
==Item Availability Calculation for the SA Order==
The way the order quantity is reflected in the system depends on the availability calculation rule selected for the item class (of each item included in the order) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form. Generally, as the status of a sales order of the ''SA'' type changes, the order quantity updates the SO Allocated, Back Ordered, and On Hand total quantities, which are reflected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_20_00|Inventory Allocation Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) form. For more information on item availability calculation in inventory, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Availability_Calculation|Availability Calculation].
==Reserving Stock Items for Sales Orders (SO)==
To ensure that your order will be fulfilled in a timely fashion, you can reserve the specified item quantities for the order (by marking them as allocated). On the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, you can click a sales order line and view the item availability information at the bottom of the form. In a sales order of the ''SO'' type, you may want to reserve the requested quantity for a specific item or multiple items if this is required by your company policies or was requested by the customer. {br}

To allocate stock for a particular line of an ''SO'' order, you use the '''Allocations''' dialog box, which opens if you click the needed line and then click '''Allocations''' on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form. By using this dialog box, for sales orders of the ''SO'' type, you can select whether to reserve the requested quantities of the item in a single warehouse or multiple warehouses. If subitems are used in your system, you can split the item quantity between the available subitems. Also, you can use the '''Allocations''' dialog box to track the order fulfillment. For each allocation line, the '''Related Document''' column contains the reference number of the document related to the current stage of the order fulfillment. ((({S:Hint} If the ordered items are out of stock at the shipping warehouse but available at other warehouses, you can allocate the items in other warehouses, and fulfill the order by any number of transfer orders from other warehouses. For more details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_scn_Sale_with_Transfer|Processing Steps for a Sale with Transfer]. Alternatively, you can process a purchase from a vendor for the subsequent sale to get the sufficient quantity of ordered items directly for this sales order. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Purchase_for_Sale|Processing Purchased Items for Sale].
)))
==Item Availability Calculation for the SO Order==
The way the order quantity is reflected in the system depends on the availability calculation rule selected for the item class (of each included item) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form. Generally, as the status of a sales order of the ''SO'' type changes, the order quantity updates the SO Prepared, SO Booked, SO Allocated, and On Hand total quantities, which are reflected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_20_00|Inventory Allocation Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) form.

If you have reserved items at multiple warehouses, the processing of the sales order         requires processing a transfer order to move items from the source warehouse to the         warehouse where they are needed for sale. After the transferred quantities are received to a         single warehouse, you can create a shipment for the order. For a detailed description of         this process, see  Processing Steps for a Sale with Transfer. Also, you can use the  Allocations  dialog box to track the order     fulfillment. For each allocation line, the  Related Document  column     contains the reference number of the document related to the current stage of the order     fulfillment.  Item Availability Calculation for the SA Order The way the order quantity is reflected in the system depends on the availability         calculation rule selected for the item class (of each item included in the order) on the             ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000) form. Generally, as the status of a sales order         of the  SA  type changes, the order quantity updates the SO Allocated, Back Ordered,         and On Hand total quantities, which are reflected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) Inventory Allocation Details         (IN402000) form. For more information on item availability calculation in inventory, see            Availability Calculation. Reserving Stock Items for Sales Orders (SO) To ensure that your order will be fulfilled in a timely fashion, you can reserve the specified         item quantities for the order (by marking them as allocated). On the  Document           Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, you can         click a sales order line and view the item availability information at the bottom of the         form. In a sales order of the  SO  type, you may want to reserve the requested quantity         for a specific item or multiple items if this is required by your company policies or was         requested by the customer.  To allocate stock for a particular line of an  SO  order, you use the            Allocations  dialog box, which opens if you click the needed line         and then click  Allocations  on the table toolbar of the            Document Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders form.         By using this dialog box, for sales orders of the  SO  type, you can select whether to         reserve the requested quantities of the item in a single warehouse or multiple warehouses.         If subitems are used in your system, you can split the item quantity between the available         subitems. Also, you can use the  Allocations  dialog box to track the         order fulfillment. For each allocation line, the  Related Document          column contains the reference number of the document related to the current stage of the         order fulfillment.   If the ordered items are out of stock at the shipping warehouse but available at other         warehouses, you can allocate the items in other warehouses, and fulfill the order by any         number of transfer orders from other warehouses. For more details, see  Processing Steps for a Sale with Transfer. Alternatively, you can process a purchase         from a vendor for the subsequent sale to get the sufficient quantity of ordered items         directly for this sales order. For more information, see  Processing Purchased Items for Sale. Item Availability Calculation for the SO Order The way the order quantity is reflected in the system depends on the availability         calculation rule selected for the item class (of each included item) on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000) form. Generally, as the status of a sales order of         the  SO  type changes, the order quantity updates the SO Prepared, SO Booked, SO         Allocated, and On Hand total quantities, which are reflected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) Inventory Allocation Details (IN402000) form.  ]]></column>

==To Reserve an Inventory Item in an Order==[anchor|#ol_isj_3lz_lz]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form by searching for or navigating to it.
#In the '''Order Type''' box, select the order type of the order for which you want to allocate items. 
#In the '''Order Nbr.''' box, select the reference number of the needed order.
#On the '''Document Details''' tab, for each item whose quantities should be reserved in the source warehouse, perform the following steps:
##Click the order line with the needed item, and click '''Allocations''' on the table toolbar.
##In the '''Allocations''' dialog box, which opens, select the '''Allocated''' check box for the allocation line. If the full quantity is not available in the source warehouse, the system replaces the quantity in the line with the available quantity and adds one more line for the remaining quantity.
##For the additional line (if added), select the check box in the '''Allocated''' column. In the '''Alloc. Warehouse''' column, select the source warehouse from the list of warehouses. If the item quantity available in this warehouse ('''Qty. On Hand''') is less than the remaining quantity, the system adds one more allocation line with the remaining quantity; if it does, either adjust the requested quantity or continue reserving item quantities in other warehouses.
##Click '''OK''' to save the created allocations and close the dialog box.

==Notes About the Procedure==

This topic briefly explains how the system creates shipments for sales orders depending on the shipping rules specified in these orders, and how you can consolidate shipments for multiple sales orders.{br}{TOC}
==Shipment Creation by Shipping Rules==
Each shipment is generated from one particular warehouse. The system creates an individual shipment from each warehouse that is specified in sales order lines, as if these were multiple orders being shipped from different warehouses. If you are creating shipments by processing orders on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) form, the system creates the shipments one by one from each warehouse that is referred to in each processed order. The document-level shipping rule of the sales order, which is specified on the '''Shipping Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders]form ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]), is applied to each warehouse as follows:[anchor|#ol_kl2_cyv_k5]
*If the document-level shipping rule is ''Ship Complete'', a shipment is created from the warehouse selected in the line only if all other order lines with the same warehouse can be shipped from that warehouse according to the shipping rule of each line. ''Ship Complete'' lines can be shipped in full, and other lines can be shipped at least partially.
*If the document-level shipping rule is ''Cancel Remainder'' or ''Back-Order Allowed'', a shipment is created from the selected warehouse if at least one order line can be shipped from that warehouse according to the shipping rule of the line.

When a shipment is created for a sales order, the system adds the lines with a nonzero open quantity to the shipment according to the following logic:[anchor|#ol_txp_czv_k5]
#The system adds to the shipment only the lines that have a '''Ship On''' date no later than the specified shipment date and have to be shipped from the warehouse specified for the shipment.
#The system adds the lines to the shipment according to the shipping rule of the line as follows:
#*A ''Ship Complete'' line is added to the shipment only if the open quantity can be shipped in full from the quantity available for shipping.
#*A ''Back Order Allowed'' or ''Cancel Remainder'' line is added to the shipment with the quantity that is available for shipping at the moment of shipment creation even if the quantity is less than the open quantity of the line.

For more detailed information on shipping rules, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Shipping_Rules|Shipping Rule Combinations].
==Consolidated Shipments==
You can consolidate shipments, creating one shipment (and corresponding shipment document) for multiple sales orders of the same customer, unless the '''Ship Separately''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form is selected for the order type being used. As long as the check box is cleared, you can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) form to create one shipment for multiple sales orders associated with the same customer. Sales orders with the predefined order type ''SO'' don&rsquo;t require goods to be shipped separately for separate sales orders. ((({S:Hint}The orders of the type for which the '''Ship Separately''' check box is selected can still be consolidated into a single shipment if you manually add them using the '''Add Order''' button on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form.
)))
One more setting that affects the creation of consolidated shipments is the '''Use Customer&rsquo;s Account''' setting specified in a shipment document on the '''Shipment Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form. The system copies the state of this check box from the related sales order. Thus, if you mass-process multiple sales orders that have different states of the '''Use Customer&rsquo;s Account''' check box on the '''Shipping Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, the system will group the sales orders by the state of this check box and create two consolidated shipments: The first shipment will include the sales orders in which the check box is selected, and the second shipment will include the sales orders in which this check box is cleared.

The document-level     shipping rule of the sales order, which is specified on the  Shipping      Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Ordersform (SO301000), is applied to     each warehouse as follows: If the document-level shipping rule is  Ship Complete , a shipment is created from the      warehouse selected in the line only if all other order lines with the same warehouse can be      shipped from that warehouse according to the shipping rule of each line.  Ship Complete       lines can be shipped in full, and other lines can be shipped at least partially.

When a shipment is created for a sales order, the system adds the lines with a nonzero open     quantity to the shipment according to the following logic: The system adds to the shipment only the lines that have a  Ship On       date no later than the specified shipment date and have to be shipped from the warehouse      specified for the shipment. The system adds the lines to the shipment according to the shipping rule of the line as       follows: A  Ship Complete  line is added to the shipment only if the open quantity can be        shipped in full from the quantity available for shipping. A  Back Order Allowed  or  Cancel Remainder  line is added to the shipment with        the quantity that is available for shipping at the moment of shipment creation even if the        quantity is less than the open quantity of the line.

Consolidated Shipments You can consolidate shipments, creating one shipment (and corresponding shipment document) for     multiple sales orders of the same customer, unless the  Ship Separately      check box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form is selected for     the order type being used. As long as the check box is cleared, you can use the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) Process Orders (SO501000) form to create one shipment for multiple     sales orders associated with the same customer. Sales orders with the predefined order type       SO  don't require goods to be shipped separately for separate sales orders.  The orders of the type for which the  Ship Separately  check box is     selected can still be consolidated into a single shipment if you manually add them using the       Add Order  button on the  Document Details  tab of     the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) form. One more setting that affects the creation of consolidated shipments is the  Use      Customer's Account  setting specified in a shipment document on the       Shipment Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000)     form. The system copies the state of this check box from the related sales order. Thus, if you     mass-process multiple sales orders that have different states of the  Use Customer's      Account  check box on the  Shipping Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, the system will group the sales orders     by the state of this check box and create two consolidated shipments: The first shipment will     include the sales orders in which the check box is selected, and the second shipment will     include the sales orders in which this check box is cleared. ]]></column>

Shipments, which are a key part of the order fulfillment process, can be incoming or outgoing. This topic discusses the outgoing shipments (based on the ''Issue'' operation) that are generated when a user processes a sale of items and ships the items to a customer; further we will refer to them as ''shipments''. The processing of incoming shipments (which are based on the ''Receipt'' operation, and thus are called receipts) involve customer returns based on return orders and is described in the topics of the [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Sale_Return|Processing Customer Returns] section. {br}

For a shipment prepared for a sales order, the typical processing involves the actions and generated documents shown in the following diagram. [anchor|#fig_pbz_bpd_h5][anchor|#image_zbv_1hn_dt][image:UserGuide/Images/Shipment_process.png|popup|Shipment process|300px]
The following sections describe in detail the processing steps shown in the diagram.{br}{TOC}
==1. Prepare the Shipment==
You can directly create a shipment document for a particular sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form by selecting '''Actions''' > '''Create Shipment''' on the form toolbar; this brings up the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form with the new shipment document that includes the lines with items to be shipped. Alternatively, by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] form as a starting point, you can create a new shipment document and add one order or multiple orders of the same customer. {br}

To create multiple shipments for multiple sales orders of multiple customers, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) form. The system automatically assigns reference numbers to the created shipment documents, in accordance with the numbering sequence assigned to shipments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form. {br}

If you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form to create shipments for a sales order that includes items to be shipped from multiple warehouses, you can create only one shipment at a time. Because an order with the ''Shipping'' status is read-only, there can be only one open shipment for the order from a particular warehouse. Once you confirm the open shipment, you can create a shipment to be sent from another warehouse. However, by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] form, you can create multiple shipments for these orders at once.
==2. Print the Pick List==
You can print a pick list for a particular shipment by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form. For multiple shipments with the ''On Hold'' or ''Open'' status, you can print pick lists by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_30_00|Process Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO503000|SO503000]) form. For more details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Shipment_Processing|Shipment Processing Steps].
==3. Confirm the Shipment==
After all the required goods are picked and packed, you can confirm the shipment by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Confirm Shipment''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form. You can confirm multiple shipments by executing the ''Confirm Shipment'' action for the selected shipments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_30_00|Process Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO503000|SO503000]) form. Shipment confirmation updates the available quantities and changes the status of the associated sales order. During shipment confirmation, the system checks that for all items for which lot or serial numbers are tracked, the appropriate numbers were specified.
==4. Print Shipment Confirmation==
If authorization is required before the shipment is confirmed, you can print a shipment confirmation document to be signed by the authorized person by clicking '''Reports &gt; Print Shipment Confirmation''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form. For multiple shipments, you can print shipment confirmations by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_30_00|Process Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO503000|SO503000]) form.{br}

To complete the sale, you must generate Sales Orders invoices and inventory issues and release these documents. The general workflow for most organizations is to first generate Sales Orders invoices and then release them; on release of these invoices, inventory issues are generated automatically. Another shipment processing workflow, in which an organization updates inventory and processes inventory issues before generating and processing customer invoices, is described in [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Shipment_Process_Variations|Shipment Process Variations]. 
==5. Correct the Shipment==
If you need to correct a shipment that has already been confirmed, click '''Actions''' > '''Correct Shipment''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form to reopen the shipment and make the required corrections. The associated order's status is changed to ''Shipping'' once you reopen the shipment. {br}

If an order that has a confirmed shipment has been canceled, you can reopen the order by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Re-Open Order''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. You can then delete or correct the shipment by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] form.{br}

If a shipment includes a sales order line that is also included in any subsequent shipments, you have to correct the subsequent shipments prior to correcting the preceding one. After you have completed all needed corrections, you can confirm the shipment or shipments that you have reopened.

Due to shipment policies, your organization may process customer invoices later than it does inventory issues. In this case, you can first create issues, then generate invoices, and finally release invoices and issues. {br}

The processing of a sales order with issues created before invoices includes the steps and generated documents shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#_683df3df-3a3b-481f-b818-b16a5aa8c616][image:UserGuide/Images/Inventory_Sale_with_Issuing_Before_Invoicing.png|popup|450px]

If the order is created with the ''On Hold'' status, you should clear the '''Hold''' check box for the order to process it further. For details on the settings to be specified in the order, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_SO_OrderInfo|Sales Order Entry].
==2. Prepare and Confirm the Shipment==
For a particular order, you can create a shipment by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Create Shipment''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. Then you need to confirm the shipment. For more details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Shipment_Processing|Shipment Processing Steps].
==3. Update Inventory==
To manually create the inventory issue for a shipment, you can click '''Actions''' > '''Create Shipment''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form, or you can create inventory issues for multiple selected shipments by executing the ''Update IN'' action on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_30_00|Process Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO503000|SO503000]) form. 
==4. Release the Inventory Issue==
To release the inventory issue (and thus, to update the item availability information in inventory), you click '''Actions &gt; Release''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form. When the inventory issue is released, the batch of General Ledger transactions is generated. 
==5. Process the Sales Orders Invoice==
You can prepare a Sales Orders (SO) invoice for a particular order by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Prepare Invoice''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form, or you can create invoices for multiple selected shipments by executing the ''Prepare Invoice'' action on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_30_00|Process Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO503000|SO503000]) form. {br}

To release the SO invoice, you click '''Actions &gt; Release''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form after reviewing its details. When the SO invoice is released, the batch of General Ledger transactions is generated. {br}

To adjust the dates in the invoices generated for confirmed shipments, you can use the '''Use Shipment Date for Invoice Date''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form as follows:[anchor|#ul_trq_kjl_gdb]

The shipping rules specified for a particular sales order define how the goods in the sales order should be shipped—whether they should be shipped only in full or partial shipments for the available quantities are allowed. The shipment rules for a sales order are applied when you create a shipment for a single order—by using the '''Create Shipment''' action on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form—or mass-create shipments for multiple orders, by running the '''Create Shipments''' process from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) form.{br}{TOC}
==Shipping Rule Options==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, you can specify the document-level shipping rule for the sales order document as a whole (in the '''Shipping Rule''' box on the '''Shipping Settings''' tab) and for each sales order line (in the '''Shipping Rule''' column on the '''Document Details''' tab). {br}

You can specify any of the following shipping rule options for order lines and for orders:[anchor|#ul_lmx_p53_zs]
*''Ship Complete''
* ''Cancel Remainder''
* ''Back Order Allowed''

The shipping rules applied to order lines are explained in the following table.[anchor|#table_v1d_3q3_zs]
===Line-Level Shipping Rules===
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="25%" ! Shipping Rule Option
!width="75%" ! Result 
|- 
| '''Ship Complete'''
| 
If a negative quantity is not allowed for the item specified in the line, the item can be included in a shipment only if the full ordered quantity is available for shipping. If the quantity of the item that is available for shipping is less than the ordered quantity, then the item in this line is not included in the shipment. The ordered quantity is shown as the '''Open Quantity''', and the line remains ''Open''. {br}

If shipping of the negative stock is allowed for the order type—that is, if '''Ship in Full If Negative Stock Is Allowed''' is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form—the items for which a negative quantity is allowed are included in a shipment in the full ordered quantity, regardless of whether this quantity is available for shipping. (This rule does not apply to lot- or serial-tracked stock items.){br}

After this shipment has been confirmed, the line has the ''Completed'' status on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form. For details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Shipments|Shipment of Ordered Items]. 
|- 
| '''Cancel Remainder'''
| 
With this shipping rule, shipping for the line is performed only once.{br}

If a negative quantity is not allowed for the item specified in the line, the item can be included in a shipment if any nonzero quantity that is less than or equal to the ordered quantity is available for shipping.{br}

If shipping of the negative stock is allowed for the order type, the items for which a negative quantity is allowed are included in a shipment in the full ordered quantity, regardless of whether it is available for shipping. (This rule does not apply to lot- or serial-tracked stock items.){br}

After this shipment has been confirmed, the line is marked as ''Completed'', and the '''Open Quantity''' value is set to zero.((({S:Hint}If you reopen a sales order line for which at least one shipment has been performed, the system changes the shipping rule to ''Back-Order Allowed'' for this line on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form.
)))
|- 
| '''Back Order Allowed'''
| 
If a negative quantity is not allowed for the item specified in the line, the item can be included in a shipment if any nonzero quantity that is less than or equal to the ordered quantity is available for shipping. The remaining quantity (if applicable) is shown as the '''Open Quantity''' on the line. The ordered quantity can be shipped in multiple shipments. The line gets the ''Completed'' status once the full ordered quantity has been shipped.{br}

If shipping of the negative stock is allowed for the order type, the items for which a negative quantity is allowed are included in a shipment in the full ordered quantity, regardless of whether the full quantity is available for shipping. (This rule does not apply to lot- or serial-tracked stock items.) After this shipment has been confirmed, the line has the ''Completed'' status.{br}

If shipping of the negative stock is not allowed for an order type, but you don&rsquo;t want to rely completely on availability data for the classes of items for which negative quantity is allowed, select the '''Add Zero Lines for Items Not in Stock''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] form. Then in the orders of this type, for order lines with the '''Back Order Allowed''' shipping rule, a zero-quantity line is added to the shipment if the item is not in stock; you can manually enter the actually available quantity of the item.

If shipping cannot be performed for each line of the order, no shipment is created, and the order is assigned the ''Back Order'' status.{br}

The shipment is created (and the order is assigned the ''Shipping'' status) if shipping can be performed for each line—that is, if the lines meet the following criteria:[anchor|#ul_np3_vrj_zs]
*For each ''Ship Complete'' line: The ordered quantity is available for shipping and can be shipped in full.
*For each ''Cancel Remainder'' line: Any nonzero quantity that is equal to or less than the ordered quantity is available for shipping.
*For each ''Back Order Allowed'' line: Any nonzero quantity that is equal to or less than the ordered quantity is available for shipping.

You cannot specify different '''Requested On''' dates for different lines in the order. {br}

When the shipment has been confirmed, the order is assigned the ''Completed'' status if all the lines have the ''Completed'' status. If any line is not completed, the order is assigned the ''Back Order'' status.

==Examples of the Application of Shipping Rules==
The table below presents the examples that illustrate how the shipping rules specified for the sales order and its lines affect the fulfillment of the order. Assume this order has the following lines: [anchor|#ul_ccy_db1_bt]
*Line 1: ''Product 1'' with an ordered quantity of 150
*Line 2: ''Product 2'' with an ordered quantity of 100

Each row of the table shows a combination of shipping rules, with the first column indicating the rule specified for the sales order as a whole and the second column indicating the rules specified for the lines of the sales orders. The third column shows the quantity of each product that is available for shipping in the example in the row. The fourth column then shows, for the particular shipping rules and available quantities, the result of and conditions. The table includes enough combinations to give you an idea how these settings work together without covering an overwhelming amount of detail.[anchor|#table_g2y_db1_bt]

==Shipment Thresholds==
You can use undershipment and overshipment thresholds, in addition to shipping rules, to determine whether a shipment results in changing the status of the sales order line to ''Completed''. {br}

On the '''Document Details''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, for each line of a sales order, you can specify whether undershipment and overshipment are allowed as follows:[anchor|#ul_czf_zpb_2t]
*To allow overshipment, you enter in the '''Overship. Threshold (%)''' column a value greater than 100 (meaning 100%). For an order line with the ''Ship Complete'' shipping rule for 100 yards of fabric, you might opt to have the whole lap shipped (a lap of fabric has 100 meters, and each meter is 1.093 yards). To do this, you can specify the overshipment threshold at 110%, which allows up to 10% more fabric than the ordered amount to be shipped. 
*To allow undershipment, you enter in the '''Undership. Threshold (%)''' a value that is less than 100. Suppose that when you create a shipment, for an order line with the ''Back Order Allowed'' shipping rule, the system detects a small shortage of goods—for example, only 99 units are available for shipping and 100 have been ordered. If the line&rsquo;s undershipment threshold was specified at 99% or lower, the 99 units for the line will be included in the shipment, the line will be marked as ''Completed'', and no open quantity will be left on the line for a back order.
((({S:Hint}If 100 is specified in both these columns, it means that undershipment or overshipment are not allowed.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Shipping Rule Combinations The shipping rules specified for a particular sales order define how the goods in the sales         order should be shipped—whether they should be shipped only in full or partial shipments for         the available quantities are allowed. The shipment rules for a sales order are applied when         you create a shipment for a single order—by using the  Create Shipment          action on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form—or mass-create shipments for         multiple orders, by running the  Create Shipments  process from the             ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) Process Orders (SO501000) form. Shipping Rule Options On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, you can specify the document-level         shipping rule for the sales order document as a whole (in the  Shipping           Rule  box on the  Shipping Settings  tab) and for each         sales order line (in the  Shipping Rule  column on the            Document Details  tab).  You can specify any of the following shipping rule options for order lines and for         orders: Ship Complete Cancel Remainder Back Order Allowed The shipping rules applied to order lines are explained in the following table. Line-Level Shipping Rules Shipping Rule Option Result  Ship Complete If a negative quantity is not allowed for the item specified in the line, the                   item can be included in a shipment only if the full ordered quantity is available                   for shipping. If the quantity of the item that is available for shipping is less                   than the ordered quantity, then the item in this line is not included in the                   shipment. The ordered quantity is shown as the  Open                     Quantity , and the line remains  Open .  If shipping of the negative stock is allowed for the order type—that is, if                      Ship in Full If Negative Stock Is Allowed  is selected on                   the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form—the items for which a negative                   quantity is allowed are included in a shipment in the full ordered quantity,                   regardless of whether this quantity is available for shipping. (This rule does not                   apply to lot- or serial-tracked stock items.) After this shipment has been confirmed, the line has the  Completed  status                   on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders form. For details, see  Shipment of Ordered Items.  Cancel Remainder With this shipping rule, shipping for the line is performed only once. If a negative quantity is not allowed for the item specified in the line, the                   item can be included in a shipment if any nonzero quantity that is less than or                   equal to the ordered quantity is available for shipping. If shipping of the negative stock is allowed for the order type, the items for                   which a negative quantity is allowed are included in a shipment in the full                   ordered quantity, regardless of whether it is available for shipping. (This rule                   does not apply to lot- or serial-tracked stock items.) After this shipment has been confirmed, the line is marked as  Completed ,                   and the  Open Quantity  value is set to zero. If you reopen a sales order line for which at least one shipment has been                   performed, the system changes the shipping rule to  Back-Order Allowed  for                   this line on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders form. Back Order Allowed If a negative quantity is not allowed for the item specified in the line, the                   item can be included in a shipment if any nonzero quantity that is less than or                   equal to the ordered quantity is available for shipping. The remaining quantity                   (if applicable) is shown as the  Open Quantity  on the line.                   The ordered quantity can be shipped in multiple shipments. The line gets the                      Completed  status once the full ordered quantity has been shipped. If shipping of the negative stock is allowed for the order type, the items for                   which a negative quantity is allowed are included in a shipment in the full                   ordered quantity, regardless of whether the full quantity is available for                   shipping. (This rule does not apply to lot- or serial-tracked stock items.) After                   this shipment has been confirmed, the line has the  Completed  status. If shipping of the negative stock is not allowed for an order type, but you don't                   want to rely completely on availability data for the classes of items for which                   negative quantity is allowed, select the  Add Zero Lines for Items Not                     in Stock  check box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences form. Then                   in the orders of this type, for order lines with the  Back Order                     Allowed  shipping rule, a zero-quantity line is added to the shipment                   if the item is not in stock; you can manually enter the actually available                   quantity of the item.  See the table below for details about how the shipping rule of a sales order affects the         mass-processing of the sales orders, which you perform by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) Process Orders (SO501000) form.

Shipment Thresholds You can use undershipment and overshipment thresholds, in addition to shipping rules, to         determine whether a shipment results in changing the status of the sales order line to            Completed .  On the  Document Details  tab on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders         (SO301000) form, for each line of a sales order, you can specify whether undershipment and         overshipment are allowed as follows: To allow overshipment, you enter in the  Overship. Threshold (%)            column a value greater than 100 (meaning 100%). For an order line with the  Ship             Complete  shipping rule for 100 yards of fabric, you might opt to have the whole lap           shipped (a lap of fabric has 100 meters, and each meter is 1.093 yards). To do this, you           can specify the overshipment threshold at 110%, which allows up to 10% more fabric than           the ordered amount to be shipped.  To allow undershipment, you enter in the  Undership. Threshold (%)            a value that is less than 100. Suppose that when you create a shipment, for an order line           with the  Back Order Allowed  shipping rule, the system detects a small shortage of           goods—for example, only 99 units are available for shipping and 100 have been           ordered. If the line's undershipment threshold was specified at 99% or lower, the 99 units           for the line will be included in the shipment, the line will be marked as            Completed , and no open quantity will be left on the line for a back order. If 100 is specified in both these columns, it means that undershipment or overshipment         are not allowed.

When you create a shipment for a sales order (by using either [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] form), the system checks the availability of the items included in the sales order and uses the shipping rules to determine whether the shipment can be created. This topic describes how the partial shipments are created and processed, and how to add zero lines for the items that currently are not available for shipment.{br}{TOC}
==Shipping of Stock Items in Parts==
You can create partial shipments for the sales orders if the '''Shipping Rule''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form has the ''Back Order Allowed'' option selected and ''Back Order Allowed'' shipping rule is selected for at least one order line. These settings let you ship the available quantity of goods in one shipment and the remainder in one shipment or multiple shipments as the goods are received. {br}

If the ''Cancel Remainder'' shipping rule is specified in a line, shipping for the line is performed only once. After the partial shipment of available items has been prepared and confirmed, the line is completed, and the open quantity of the line is set to zero. The lines with the ''Ship Complete'' shipping rule cannot be shipped partially. For more information on shipping rules, overshipment, and undershipment, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Shipping_Rules|Shipping Rule Combinations]. {br}

When you create a shipment by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form, if the system detects that no shipment can be created according to the shipment rules (due to a shortage of items), the system displays a warning; you then decide how to process the order further. If you mass-create shipments for multiple sales orders from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] form, and the system detects that no shipment can be created for a particular order according to the shipment rules, the system changes the status of the order to ''Back Order''. For information, on how to replan back-orders, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_ReplanBackOrders|Back Ordering and Replanning Back Orders].
==Partial Shipping of Free Items==
If a sales order is fulfilled with multiple partial shipments, the '''Free Item Shipping''' setting, located on the '''Price/Discount Calculation''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form, defines how free items should be shipped: proportionally to the amounts of goods in the partial shipments (''Proportional''), or sent with the last shipment (''On Last Shipment'').{br}

 If free items are sent with the last shipment and only part of the needed quantity of free items is available, only the available quantity is shipped, and no back order is initiated for the missing free items. {br}

If the quantity of the free items should be distributed between the partial shipments, the total quantity of free items on all partial shipments for the order may be less than the quantity initially calculated for the applicable group discount, because the system rounds the free item quantity down on each partial shipment. In such a case, you can add the missing quantity of the free item manually to any of the partial shipments.
==Shipments With Zero Lines==
Your organization may prefer to send customer invoices that list all the items from their sales orders so that they can see which items were ordered but at the time were unavailable. To allow the system to add these zero lines to shipments, select the '''Add Zero Lines for Items Not in Stock''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] form. {br}

Selecting this option also can be helpful if you don&rsquo;t want to rely completely on availability data, because in some cases, although the system shows an item as not in stock, the quantities required for a shipment may be available for some reason. You should select this check box if you have item classes for items of which negative quantities are allowed and if shipments are created manually on a per-order basis—then users can edit the shipments and specify the quantities that are currently not reflected on the books correctly and may be available on shipment confirmation (for instance, if shown as quantities on purchase receipts). For example, if you prepare a shipment for a sales order with a line that have the ''Back Order Allowed'' shipping rule, and the available quantity of the item is zero, the shipment will include a zero-line for this item, if the '''Add Zero Lines for Items Not in Stock''' is selected. You can then correct the quantity tho specify the quantity that is actually available for this order line.{br}

If the '''Add Zero Lines for Items Not in Stock''' check box is selected, you should also decide whether to allow the creation of shipments with all zero-quantity lines. To allow the creation of such shipments, you should select the '''Create Zero Shipments''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] form. However, we do not recommend using this option if in your organization, shipments are generally created automatically by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] form.

This topic explains when the system back-orders a sales order and how to replan a back order to process it further.{br}{TOC}
==Completing Sales Orders Lines on Shipping==
Lines with stock and non-stock items that require shipping are completed based on the item quantity in the shipments prepared for the sales order. When you confirm a shipment of the full open quantity of an order line, the '''Completed''' check box becomes selected in the order line. Non-stock lines that do not require shipping are completed by the prepared invoice. After all lines have been completed, the order is assigned the ''Completed'' status.{br}

When you confirm a partial shipment, if an open ''Ship Complete'' line or an incomplete ''Back Order Allowed'' line remains in the order, the remaining open quantity of the line becomes classified to the ''SO Back Ordered'' allocation type, and the sales order is assigned the ''Back Order'' status. The open quantities of ''Cancel Remainder'' lines are set to zero and the '''Completed''' check box is selected for the lines.{br}

Sales order lines that require shipping but cannot be shipped at the moment are assigned the ''SO Back Ordered'' allocation type if shipment creation has failed for them. For an individual sales order with the ''Back Order'' status, you can create a shipment directly from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form without replanning the order once the quantities of the items become above zero. To be able to mass-prepare shipments for back orders by using the ''Create Shipment'' action on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) form, you need to replan the back orders. 
==Automatic Replanning of Back Orders==
Replanning of a back order is a process that moves the ordered items with the ''SO Back Ordered'' allocation type to the ''SO Booked'' allocation type and changes the status of the back order to ''Open'' so that it can be shipped. You can make the system auto-replan back orders by selecting the '''Replan Back-Orders''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form. If this check box is selected, the system automatically replans back orders on release of every inventory transaction that increases the inventory on hand (inventory receipt, inventory transfer, or positive inventory adjustment). The system performs the replanning process for the items that are involved in the released inventory transactions.
==Manual Replanning of Back Orders==
If automatic replanning is switched off— that is, if the '''Replan Back-Orders''' check box is cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form— you can run the manual replanning process for the needed inventory items from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_50_00|Validate Inventory] ([~/?ScreenId=IN505000|IN505000]) form with the '''Replan Back Orders''' check box selected. Also, you can configure a schedule to run the process on that form at an appropriate interval, such as once a day.
==Back Order Replanning Process==
When automatic replanning is in process, for each inventory item being processed, the system selects the ''SO Booked'' and ''SO Back Ordered'' lines of open sales orders. The selected lines are sorted by '''Ship On''' date (starting from the earliest one), allocation type (''SO Booked'' lines are organized before ''SO Back Ordered'' lines), and line quantity, starting from the greatest quantity. ''SO Booked'' lines are included in the process to make sure that the units that are booked for orders created earlier are not counted for the fulfillment of back orders created later. The system distributes the quantity available for shipping among the selected lines in their sort order as follows:[anchor|#_5ff8d784-70d9-46bc-bf65-ed19d41017e3]
#The quantities of ''SO Booked'' lines are subtracted from the quantity available for shipping that can be distributed to the next lines.
#If there is some quantity available for shipping that can be distributed to an ''SO Back Ordered'' line, the system changes the allocation type of the line to ''SO Booked''. For lines with the ''Ship Complete'' shipping rule, the system changes the allocation type to ''SO Booked'' only if the line quantity can be booked in full.
#If the quantity available for shipping is not enough to distribute among all the selected lines, the remaining lines maintain the original ''SO Back Ordered'' status. Each processed line is replanned in full or not replanned at all (and never split) if the quantity that can be booked for the line is less than the line quantity.
((({S:Hint}The system does not reallocate items when it replans back orders. For each replanned back order of an order type that requires allocation—that is, if the '''Require Stock Allocation''' check box is selected for the order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form—you have to manually allocate items before further processing the order.

Back Order Replanning Process When automatic replanning is in process, for each inventory item being processed, the         system selects the  SO Booked  and  SO Back Ordered  lines of open sales orders.         The selected lines are sorted by  Ship On  date (starting from the         earliest one), allocation type ( SO Booked  lines are organized before  SO Back           Ordered  lines), and line quantity, starting from the greatest quantity.

If there is some quantity available for shipping that can be distributed to an  SO             Back Ordered  line, the system changes the allocation type of the line to  SO             Booked .

==To Create a Shipment for an Order==[anchor|#ol_elz_tlz_lz]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form by searching for or navigating to it.
#In the '''Order Type''' box, select the order type of the order for which you want to create a shipment.
#In the '''Order Nbr.''' box, select the reference number of the order for which you want to create a shipment.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Create Shipment'''.
#In the '''Specify Shipment Parameters''' dialog box, which appears, specify the date of the shipment and the source warehouse. Click '''OK''' to close the dialog box.
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form, which opens, check the settings on the '''Shipping Settings''' tab, and make any needed changes.
#On the '''Packages''' tab, manually specify the packages to be shipped, or review the automatically specified packages, if automatic packaging is configured in your system.
#In the Summary area, make sure the '''Hold''' check box is cleared. 
#Click '''Save''' on the form toolbar to save the shipment.

==Notes About the Procedure==[anchor|#_25522b65-e9f7-4798-822d-04cca3dea91b]
The notes in this section describe the nuances of the UI elements available on the form, such as when an element is required and when it is not, and when the system fills in settings by default. This section can include other notes.{br}

Note the following about this procedure:[anchor|#ul_cwd_yd1_kz]
*The system selects the packages for the order automatically if the ''Automatic Packaging'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form and automatic packaging is configured.
*You can process multiple orders at a time by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) form, which is also useful if you need to process a multi-line transfer order that involves multiple warehouses (and hence generates multiple shipments).

In the  Order Nbr.  box, select the reference number of the                 order for which you want to create a shipment. On the form toolbar, click  Actions Create Shipment . In the  Specify Shipment Parameters  dialog box, which appears,                 specify the date of the shipment and the source warehouse. Click                      OK  to close the dialog box. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) form, which opens,                 check the settings on the  Shipping Settings  tab, and make any                 needed changes. On the  Packages  tab, manually specify the packages to be                 shipped, or review the automatically specified packages, if automatic packaging is                 configured in your system. In the Summary area, make sure the  Hold  check box is cleared.  Click  Save  on the form toolbar to save the shipment. Notes About the Procedure The notes in this section describe the nuances of the UI elements available on             the form, such as when an element is required and when it is not, and when the system             fills in settings by default. This section can include other notes. Note the following about this procedure: The system selects the packages for the order automatically if the  Automatic                         Packaging  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features                     (CS100000) form and automatic packaging is configured. You can process multiple orders at a time by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) Process Orders (SO501000) form, which is also useful if you                     need to process a multi-line transfer order that involves multiple warehouses                     (and hence generates multiple shipments). ]]></column>

An invoice is a legally binding document that records the price and details of the sale and indicates that the order has been fulfilled. By the time an invoice is created for a sales order, the goods or services have been delivered or rendered; if some changes in the sale have occurred, you may need to reflect these changes directly in the invoice by editing it. The following types of documents can be processed by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000])form: [anchor|#ul_sdm_sh3_mdb]
*Invoices
*Cash sales
*Cash returns
*Credit memos

The sections below describe how different types of invoices created in the Sales Orders module are processed. {br}{TOC}
==Sales Orders Invoices and Accounts Receivable Invoices==
After you have prepared and confirmed the shipment of items, you need to bill the customer for the sold items. For a sales order, you prepare a Sales Orders (SO) invoice, which can be reviewed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form. On release of the SO invoice, the system creates an Accounts Receivable (AR) invoice that is related to the SO invoice and has the same reference number. This AR invoice becomes available for reviewing and further processing on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]). {br}

An AR invoice is a financial document that doesn&rsquo;t have information about freight details. This information, along with links to shipments and sales orders, is provided in the SO invoice. The reference number assigned to the SO and AR invoices is printed in the customer statement so that these invoices appear to be a single document from the customer&rsquo;s perspective. The AR invoice is released on the release of the SO invoice (that is, the AR invoice is released as soon as it is created); the link to the created batch of the generated General Ledger transactions can be found in both of these documents.
==Invoice Processing==
You can prepare an invoice for a sales order that has been shipped or does not require shipping, or you can prepare an invoice for a shipment. Also, you can mass-prepare invoices from orders or shipments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_30_00|Process Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO503000|SO503000]) form to consolidate multiple documents for the same customer into a single customer invoice. You can generate an invoice for a shipment only if it is confirmed (that is, if it has the ''Confirmed'' status). Also, you can create an invoice manually and add to it lines for multiple orders for the same customer. {br}

An invoice created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form in the Sales Orders module has one of the following statuses: [anchor|#ul_tdm_sh3_mdb]
*''On Hold'': You can save an invoice with this status if you want to continue editing it. To save the invoice with the ''Balanced'' status, clear the '''Hold''' check box and save the document. If the '''Validate Totals''' check box has been selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form, you first need to type the control total into the '''Amount''' box.
*''Balanced'': A ''Balanced'' invoice can be released to the Accounts Receivable module. When you release an invoice, the statuses of all shipments included in the invoice change to ''Invoiced''.
*''Open'': When an invoice has been released to the Accounts Receivable module, it is assigned the ''Open'' status until it is paid by the customer. Also, upon release of the invoice, the status of the original sales order changes to ''Completed''. You can print the invoice (individually or among other invoices and memos) and send it to the customer by postal mail, or you can send the invoice as an email or email attachment, depending on the mailing settings of the customer account. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__con_Predefined_Mailings_for_Customers_and_Vendors|Mailings for Customers].
*''Closed'': Once it has been fully paid, the invoice gets the ''Closed'' status.

The release of an invoice generates transactions in the Inventory and Accounts Receivable modules and updates the General Ledger module. The reference to the batch that posts transactions to the General Ledger can be found on the '''Financial Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] form. Salespersons' commissions are calculated when the invoice is released or paid, depending on the commission settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) form. Total freight charges may include premium freight, insurance, shipment, and other charges that apply to the shipped goods and to entire shipments. The premium freight amounts, which are specified for sales orders, are allocated among the shipments fulfilling the order, based on the option selected in the '''Freight Allocation on Partial Shipping''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form, which can be one of the following: [anchor|#ul_udm_sh3_mdb]
*''Allocate Proportionally'': Distributes the premium freight amount shipments proportionally to the partial shipment amounts
*''Full Amount First Time'': Assigns the premium freight amount to the first shipment

==Processing of Direct Invoices==
If the ''Advanced SO Invoices'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can process invoices with stock items directly on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) without processing the corresponding sales orders and invoices. On release of direct invoices, the system updates the inventory. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_scn_Direct_Sale|Processing Direct Sales and Returns].
==Credit Memo Processing==
A credit memo is generated when a sales order of the ''Credit Memo'' type is fulfilled to adjust the customer&rsquo;s balance with the company by the amount of the returned goods. Credit memos are used for unauthorized and authorized returns. A credit memo can be released to the Accounts Receivable module and can update the Inventory module. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form, for a ''Balanced'' credit memo, the following actions become available on the '''Actions''' menu of the form toolbar: [anchor|#ul_vdm_sh3_mdb]
*'''Release''': Releases the ''Balanced'' memo to the Accounts Receivable module, to credit the customer account for the returned goods.
*'''Update IN''': Releases relevant data to the Inventory module. The stock levels are increased in the Inventory module by the quantity of the returned goods.

The original order will be assigned the ''Completed'' status once the related Accounts Receivable credit memo has been released. The reference number of the batch that posted the related transactions to the General Ledger module can be found on the '''Financial Details''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] form. 
==COGS Posting Delay==
If there is a significant time interval between the release of issues and the release of invoices in your organization, you may need to delay posting the costs to the COGS accounts. To do this, select the '''Use Shipped-Not-Invoiced Account''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form, and then select the appropriate '''Shipped-Not-Invoiced Account''' and '''Shipped-Not-Invoiced Subaccount''' to be used to temporarily record the costs. After that, on release of issues, the costs of shipped items will be temporarily recorded to this shipped-not-invoiced account (with the specified subaccount); then later, on release of invoices, the costs will be moved from the shipped-not-invoiced account to the appropriate COGS /expense accounts.]]></column>

For more information, see  Mailings for Customers. Closed : Once it has been fully paid, the invoice gets the  Closed  status. The release of an invoice generates transactions in the Inventory and Accounts Receivable     modules and updates the General Ledger module. The reference to the batch that posts     transactions to the General Ledger can be found on the  Financial Details      tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices form.

Update IN : Releases relevant data to the Inventory module. The      stock levels are increased in the Inventory module by the quantity of the returned      goods. The original order will be assigned the  Completed  status once the related Accounts     Receivable credit memo has been released.

==Notes About the Procedure==[anchor|#_77112476-d76d-4c1c-b491-f76240c9e61c]
The notes in this section describe the nuances of the UI elements available on the form, such as when an element is required and when it is not, and when the system fills in settings by default. This section can include other notes.{br}

Note the following about this procedure:[anchor|#ul_l31_lnx_rdb]
*By default, when a user prepares invoices, the system uses the dates of corresponding shipments as invoice date if the '''Use Shipment Date for Invoice Date''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form. If you clear this check box, the system will prepare invoices with the current business date.
*The invoices are created with the ''Balanced'' status if the '''Hold Invoices on Entry''' check box is cleared in the settings of the order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. Otherwise, if the check box is selected, the invoices are created with the ''On Hold'' status.
*You can mass-prepare invoices for orders by using the ''Prepare Invoice'' action on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) form, as described in the [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_MassCreate_Invoices_SO|To Create Invoices for Multiple Orders] topic.

==To Prepare an Invoice for a Shipment==[anchor|#ol_bmc_qmz_lz]
#Open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form by searching for or navigating to it.
#In the '''Shipment Nbr.''' box, select the reference number of the needed shipment.
#Confirm the shipment if it has not been confirmed, by clicking '''Actions &gt; Confirm Shipment''' on the form toolbar.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Actions''' > '''Prepare Invoice'''. Once the operation completes successfully, the status of the shipment is changed to ''Invoiced''.
#Review the details of the prepared invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form, which opens.

==Notes About the Procedure==[anchor|#_0853493e-d8b4-4dd7-acd9-4420153b4338]
The notes in this section describe the nuances of the UI elements available on the form, such as when an element is required and when it is not, and when the system fills in settings by default. This section can include other notes.{br}

Note the following about preparing an invoice for the shipment:[anchor|#ul_l31_lnx_rdb]
*The system selects the packages for the order automatically if the ''Automatic Packaging'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form and automatic packaging is configured.
*You can mass-prepare invoices by using the ''Prepare Invoice'' action on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_30_00|Process Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO503000|SO503000]) form, as described in [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_MassCreate_Invoices|To Create Invoices for Multiple Shipments].
*By default, when a user prepares an invoice, the system uses the date of the corresponding shipment as the invoice date, because the '''Use Shipment Date for Invoice Date''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form. If you clear this check box, the system will prepare the invoice with the current business date.
*The invoice is created with the ''Balanced'' status if the '''Hold Invoices on Entry''' check box is cleared in the settings of the order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. If the check box is selected, the invoice is created with the ''On Hold'' status.

When you process a sale of inventory items, you can reserve one line or multiple lines of an open sales order of the ''SO'' or ''SA'' type in a warehouse other than the warehouse selected in the line. To be able to process a sales order with stock items that are reserved in a remote warehouse (that is, a warehouse other than the one specified in the order), you first need to transfer the reserved items from the remote source warehouse (at which the items were reserved) to the destination warehouse (for which the sales order is processed). For this purpose, a transfer order of the ''TR'' predefined order type is prepared and processed.((({S:Hint} For a description of other scenarios that may require preparing and processing transfer orders, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Transfer_Variations|Variations in the Transfer Order Process],
)))
The processing of a sale with the transfer of items involves the actions and generated documents shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#fig_xqs_s4n_jdb][anchor|#image_sqs_xrk_3db][image:UserGuide/Images/Inventory_Sale_With_Transferring_Stock.png|popup|400px]{br}{TOC}
==1. Enter the Sales Order==
You create a new sales order of the ''SO'' type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. If the order is created with the ''On Hold'' status, you should clear the '''Hold''' check box for the order to process it further. For more details on which information is to be specified in an order, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_SO_OrderInfo|Sales Order Entry].
==2. Reserve Items in the Source Warehouse==
To obtain the sufficient quantity of items for the sales order, you manually reserve the quantity for each specific item in the source warehouse. To be able to complete the sales order, you first need to perform a transfer of items allocated in a warehouse other than the destination warehouse. For the items allocated in a warehouse other than the warehouse specified in the sales order, the system automatically generates transfer requests of the ''SO Allocated'' plan type. Based on the transfer requests, you prepare transfer orders for these items.
==3. Prepare the Transfer Order==
To create a transfer order (an order of the ''TR'' type) for a sales order, you click '''Actions &gt; Create Transfer Order''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. {br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_90_00|Create Transfer Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO509000|SO509000]) form, which opens, you can create one transfer order or multiple transfer orders for transfer requests with the ''SO Allocated'' plan type. You can select the transfer requests by source and destination warehouses, item class, and product workgroup. After reviewing the resulting list, you can generate transfer orders for each line in the list, or you can select the orders to be generated by selecting the check boxes to the left of the plan types. 
==4. Prepare the Shipment==
A transfer order is fulfilled by one shipment or by multiple shipments from the source warehouse (in which the item is allocated) to the destination warehouse. You can create a shipment for a transfer order from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Create Shipment''' on the form toolbar. If you need to create shipments for multiple transfer orders, you can run the ''Create Shipment'' process by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) form. The shipments will be grouped by source and destination warehouses and by stock items. The item quantities on the shipment are deducted from the '''Available''' and '''Available for Shipping''' quantities and added to the '''SO Allocated''' quantity; you can see these quantities on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_20_00|Inventory Allocation Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) form, as well as on other forms.{br}

You can print a pick list for each shipment by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Print Pick List'''on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form. Alternatively, you can print pick lists for multiple shipments by applying the ''Print Pick Lists'' action for the selected shipments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_30_00|Process Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO503000|SO503000]) form.
==5. Confirm the Shipment==
You can confirm each shipment by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form. Upon shipment confirmation, the quantities of items on the shipment are added to the SO Shipped quantity. 
==6. Update Inventory==
To promptly update the item quantities in the destination warehouse, you click '''Actions''' > '''Update IN''' on the form toolbar; once you do, the system generates the inventory transfer document that issue items from the source warehouse. The item quantity is deducted from SO Shipped and added to In Transit. (These quantities are displayed on a variety of Inventory inquiries and reports.) 
==7. Release the Inventory Transfer==
To release the inventory transfer, you click '''Release''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_40_00|Transfers] ([~/?ScreenId=IN304000|IN304000]) form. On release of the inventory transfer, a batch of General Ledger transactions is generated that moves the cost of transferred items to the In-Transit account.
==8. Prepare the Transfer Receipt==
To complete the two-step inventory transfer, you should prepare the transfer receipt (that is, a receipt of the ''Transfer Receipt'' type) of items to the destination warehouse. You create a transfer receipt on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form and add to the receipt the lines from one transfer order or multiple transfer orders. A transfer receipt may include only some of the lines from a transfer order; you can also change the quantity in a particular line if the items specified in this line were received partially.
==9. Release the Transfer Receipt==
You release the transfer receipt by clicking '''Release''' on the table toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form. On release of the transfer receipt, the inventory receipt document is generated to receive the items to the destination warehouse.
==10. Release the Inventory Receipt==
You release the inventory receipt by clicking '''Release''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) form. On release of the inventory transfer, a batch of General Ledger transactions is generated that moves the cost of transferred items from the In-Transit account. Thus, the quantity of the item that has been transferred from the source warehouse to the destination warehouse becomes available for sale. The item quantity is deducted from the In-Transit quantity and added to Quantity Available and Quantity on Hand.{br}

After the transferred stock item or items have been received to the destination warehouse, you can complete the sales order in the same way as if you have just entered it. (For the general steps of sales order processing, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_scn_Sale_with_Shipping|Sale of Stock Items with Shipping].)

To be able to complete the sales         order, you first need to perform a transfer of items allocated in a warehouse other than the         destination warehouse. For the items allocated in a warehouse other than the warehouse         specified in the sales order, the system automatically generates transfer requests of the            SO Allocated  plan type. Based on the transfer requests, you prepare transfer orders         for these items. 3. Prepare the Transfer Order To create a transfer order (an order of the  TR  type) for a sales order, you click  Actions > Create Transfer Order  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form.  On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO509000|SO509000]) Create Transfer Orders (SO509000) form, which opens, you can         create one transfer order or multiple transfer orders for transfer requests with the  SO           Allocated  plan type. You can select the transfer requests by source and destination         warehouses, item class, and product workgroup. After reviewing the resulting list, you can         generate transfer orders for each line in the list, or you can select the orders to be         generated by selecting the check boxes to the left of the plan types.  4. Prepare the Shipment A transfer order is fulfilled by one shipment or by multiple shipments from the source         warehouse (in which the item is allocated) to the destination warehouse. You can create a         shipment for a transfer order from the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form by         clicking  Actions Create Shipment  on the form toolbar. If you need to create shipments for multiple transfer         orders, you can run the  Create Shipment  process by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) Process Orders (SO501000) form. The shipments will be grouped by source and         destination warehouses and by stock items. The item quantities on the shipment are deducted         from the  Available  and  Available for Shipping          quantities and added to the  SO Allocated  quantity; you can see these         quantities on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) Inventory Allocation Details (IN402000) form, as well as on other         forms. You can print a pick list for each shipment by clicking  Actions Print Pick List on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) form.         Alternatively, you can print pick lists for multiple shipments by applying the  Print Pick           Lists  action for the selected shipments on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO503000|SO503000]) Process Shipments         (SO503000) form. 5. Confirm the Shipment You can confirm each shipment by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) form.         Upon shipment confirmation, the quantities of items on the shipment are added to the SO         Shipped quantity.  6. Update Inventory To promptly update the item quantities in the destination warehouse, you click  Actions Update IN  on the form toolbar; once you do, the system generates the inventory transfer         document that issue items from the source warehouse. The item quantity is deducted from SO         Shipped and added to In Transit. (These quantities are displayed on a variety of Inventory         inquiries and reports.)  7. Release the Inventory Transfer To release the inventory transfer, you click  Release  on the form         toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN304000|IN304000]) Transfers (IN304000) form. On release of the inventory         transfer, a batch of General Ledger transactions is generated that moves the cost of         transferred items to the In-Transit account. 8. Prepare the Transfer Receipt To complete the two-step inventory transfer, you should prepare the transfer receipt (that         is, a receipt of the  Transfer Receipt  type) of items to the destination warehouse.         You create a transfer receipt on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form and add         to the receipt the lines from one transfer order or multiple transfer orders. A transfer         receipt may include only some of the lines from a transfer order; you can also change the         quantity in a particular line if the items specified in this line were received         partially. 9. Release the Transfer Receipt You release the transfer receipt by clicking  Release  on the table         toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form. On release of the transfer         receipt, the inventory receipt document is generated to receive the items to the destination         warehouse. 10. Release the Inventory Receipt You release the inventory receipt by clicking  Release  on the form         toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) Receipts (IN301000) form. On release of the inventory         transfer, a batch of General Ledger transactions is generated that moves the cost of         transferred items from the In-Transit account. Thus, the quantity of the item that has been         transferred from the source warehouse to the destination warehouse becomes available for         sale. The item quantity is deducted from the In-Transit quantity and added to Quantity         Available and Quantity on Hand. After the transferred stock item or items have been received to the destination warehouse,         you can complete the sales order in the same way as if you have just entered it. (For the         general steps of sales order processing, see  Sale of Stock Items with Shipping.) ]]></column>

 You can prepare the Sales Orders (SO) invoice by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Prepare Invoice''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, or you can create invoices by specifying the ''Prepare Invoice'' action on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) form and processing multiple selected orders. For the cash sale order, an SO invoice of the ''Cash Sale'' type is prepared. {br}

Any prepared SO invoice can be reviewed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form. You can print an SO invoice by clicking '''Reports &gt; Print Invoice''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] form. 
==3. Release the Sales Orders Invoice==
To release the Sales Orders invoice, you click '''Actions &gt; Release''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] form. When the SO invoice of the ''Cash Sale'' type is released, a batch of General Ledger transactions is generated. Also, when the SO invoice is released, the system automatically generates a corresponding inventory issue with the date and posting period of the SO invoice. The related Accounts Receivable cash sale with the same reference number becomes available for reviewing on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_40_00|Cash Sales] ([~/?ScreenId=AR304000|AR304000]) form. For more information on processing Accounts Receivable cash sales, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__MNG_ProcessingARDocs|Processing AR Documents].
==4. Release the Inventory Issue==
The generated inventory issue is released automatically if the '''Automatically Release IN Documents''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form. If this check box is cleared, you have to release the inventory issue manually by clicking '''Release''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form. On release of the inventory issue, a batch of General Ledger transactions is generated.
==Important Notes==
Note the following about the processing of cash sales orders:[anchor|#_7ae8fe89-5d47-4673-aa43-53ab950f4ce8]
*If you process a cash sales order with only non-stock items, no inventory issue is generated when the SO invoice of the ''Cash Sale'' type is released. 
*For non-stock items and services, you can enter a process a cash sale directly on the[HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_40_00|Cash Sales] ([~/?ScreenId=AR304000|AR304000]) form without creating and processing a cash sale order.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Sale of Stock Items by Cash To process a sale of items directly to the customer and when you are receiving payment at         that time (by cash, check, or credit card), you can create a cash sale order of the            CS  order type by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form. The         processing of cash sales orders involves the actions and generated documents shown in the         following diagram. If quick processing is configured for the  CS  order type, you can perform complete         processing of the order directly from the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders         (SO301000) form. For more information, see  Quick Processing of Sales Orders. The following sections describe in detail the processing steps shown in the diagram. 1. Enter the Sales Order A new sales order of the  CS  type is created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders         (SO301000) form. You can save the order of the  CS  type only after you specify the         payment information, including the payment method, cash account, and payment reference         number (and the card information if the payment is performed with a credit card).  The reference number for a new order is generated according to the numbering sequence         assigned to this order type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form. If the         order is created with the  On Hold  status, you should clear the            Hold  check box for the order to process it further. 2. Prepare the Sales Orders Invoice  You can prepare the Sales Orders (SO) invoice by clicking  Actions Prepare Invoice  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form,         or you can create invoices by specifying the  Prepare Invoice  action on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) Process Orders (SO501000) form and processing multiple selected orders. For the         cash sale order, an SO invoice of the  Cash Sale  type is prepared.  Any prepared SO invoice can be reviewed on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000)         form. You can print an SO invoice by clicking  Reports > Print Invoice  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices form.  3. Release the Sales Orders Invoice To release the Sales Orders invoice, you click  Actions > Release  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices form. When the SO         invoice of the  Cash Sale  type is released, a batch of General Ledger transactions is         generated. Also, when the SO invoice is released, the system automatically generates a         corresponding inventory issue with the date and posting period of the SO invoice. The         related Accounts Receivable cash sale with the same reference number becomes available for         reviewing on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR304000|AR304000]) Cash Sales (AR304000) form. For more information on         processing Accounts Receivable cash sales, see  Processing AR Documents. 4. Release the Inventory Issue The generated inventory issue is released automatically if the  Automatically           Release IN Documents  check box is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences (SO101000) form. If this check box is cleared, you have to         release the inventory issue manually by clicking  Release  on the form         toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) Issues (IN302000) form. On release of the inventory         issue, a batch of General Ledger transactions is generated. Important Notes Note the following about the processing of cash sales orders: If you process a cash sales order with only non-stock items, no inventory issue is           generated when the SO invoice of the  Cash Sale  type is released.  For non-stock items and services, you can enter a process a cash sale directly on             the  ([~/?ScreenId=AR304000|AR304000]) Cash Sales (AR304000) form without creating and processing a           cash sale order. For items that have lot or serial numbers tracked in  Acumatica ERP, you can specify these numbers, thus indicating that these particular items have been           delivered to the customer.  ]]></column>

In Acumatica ERP, services are represented by non-stock items that have the '''Require Shipment''' check box cleared in the item&rsquo;s settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. If a sales order includes only services that do not require shipment, the typical processing of the sales order involves the steps and generated documents shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#fig_rdm_bwr_gdb][anchor|#image_sdm_bwr_gdb][image:UserGuide/Images/Sale_of_Services.png|popup|450px]
The following sections describe in detail the processing steps shown in the diagram.{br}{TOC}
==1. Enter the Sales Order==
You create the sales order of the ''SO'' or ''IN'' type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. Reference numbers for new orders are generated according to the numbering sequence assigned to this order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. For the sales order, on the '''Document Details''' tab, you add lines with items to be sold. Non-stock items are considered to be always available and cannot be allocated. If the order has been created with the ''On Hold'' status, you should clear the '''On Hold''' check box for the order to process it further.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form, you can print a sales order by clicking '''Reports &gt; Print Sales Order/Quote''' on the form toolbar. 
==2. Prepare the Sales Orders Invoice==
You can prepare a Sales Orders invoice for a particular order you are viewing on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Prepare Invoice''' on the form toolbar. Alternatively, you can create multiple invoices by selecting the ''Prepare Invoice'' action and processing multiple orders (either all orders or only those you select) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) form. {br}

Any prepared Sales Orders invoice can be reviewed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form. You can print the Sales Orders invoice on this form by clicking '''Reports &gt; Print Invoice''' on the form toolbar. 
==3. Release the Sales Orders Invoice==
To release the Sales Orders invoice, you click '''Actions &gt; Release''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form. When the Sales Orders invoice is released, a batch of General Ledger transactions is generated. Also, when this invoice is released, the related Accounts Receivable invoice with the same reference number becomes available on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form. For more information on the further processing of Accounts Receivable invoices, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__MNG_InvoicesMemos|Processing Invoices].{br}

No inventory issue is generated because non-stock items are not tracked in inventory. ((({S:Hint}If you have prepared a sales order with mixed lines of items (stock or non-stock, or both) that require shipping and non-stock items that do not require shipping, the shipment prepared for the order includes only the items that require shipping, while the prepared Sales Orders invoice for the sales order lists all the items from the order. The inventory issue generated on release of the Sales Orders invoice includes only stock items because their quantities are tracked in inventory.

Enter the Sales Order You create the sales order of the  SO  or  IN  type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form. Reference numbers for new orders are generated         according to the numbering sequence assigned to this order type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form. For the sales order, on the  Document           Details  tab, you add lines with items to be sold. Non-stock items are         considered to be always available and cannot be allocated. If the order has been created         with the  On Hold  status, you should clear the  On Hold  check         box for the order to process it further. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders form, you can print a sales order by clicking  Reports > Print Sales Order/Quote  on the form toolbar.  2. Prepare the Sales Orders Invoice You can prepare a Sales Orders invoice for a particular order you are viewing on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form by clicking  Actions Prepare Invoice  on the form toolbar. Alternatively, you can create multiple invoices by         selecting the  Prepare Invoice  action and processing multiple orders (either all         orders or only those you select) on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) Process Orders (SO501000) form.  Any prepared Sales Orders invoice can be reviewed on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices         (SO303000) form. You can print the Sales Orders invoice on this form by clicking  Reports > Print Invoice  on the form toolbar.  3. Release the Sales Orders Invoice To release the Sales Orders invoice, you click  Actions > Release  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form.         When the Sales Orders invoice is released, a batch of General Ledger transactions is         generated. Also, when this invoice is released, the related Accounts Receivable invoice with         the same reference number becomes available on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos         (AR301000) form. For more information on the further processing of Accounts Receivable         invoices, see  Processing Invoices. No inventory issue is generated because non-stock items are not tracked in inventory.            If you have prepared a sales order with mixed lines of items (stock or non-stock, or           both) that require shipping and non-stock items that do not require shipping, the shipment           prepared for the order includes only the items that require shipping, while the prepared           Sales Orders invoice for the sales order lists all the items from the order. The inventory           issue generated on release of the Sales Orders invoice includes only stock items because           their quantities are tracked in inventory.  ]]></column>

Although non-stock items are not tracked in inventory, you may want to process them through shipment, so that these items will be listed in pick lists and shipment confirmations, if the customer has requested the listing of these items in these documents. If a non-stock item has the '''Require Shipment''' check box selected in the item&rsquo;s settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, the item is processed through shipments. {br}

If a sales order includes only non-stock items requiring shipment, the processing of the sales order involves the steps and generated documents shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#fig_gxr_bpd_h5][anchor|#image_y1h_nr5_dt][image:UserGuide/Images/Sale_of_Non_Stock_With_Shipping.png|popup|400px]

In Acumatica ERP, if the ''Drop Shipments'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can create sales orders whose goods are intended for drop-shipping. Drop-shipping means that a customer orders the goods from your company, sends the payment for the order to your company, and receives the goods directly from one of your vendors. {br}

For a sales order that includes items intended for drop-shipping, the typical processing involves the actions and generated documents shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#fig_ygr_p4d_h5][anchor|#image_dc1_xyx_2t][image:UserGuide/Images/Sale_for_Dropship.png|popup|350px]
The following sections describe in detail the processing steps shown in the diagram.{br}{TOC}
==1. Enter the Sales Order==
For a sales order in which some or all items will be drop-shipped, you create a new sales order of the ''SO'' type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. Its reference number is generated according to the numbering sequence assigned to this order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form, and the order is saved with the ''On Hold'' status by default if the '''Hold Documents on Entry''' check box is selected for this order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] form. If the order is on hold, you should clear the '''Hold''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form for the order so you can process it further.
==2. Mark the Line or Lines for Drop-Shipping==
For each line of the sales order that is intended for drop-shipping, on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form, you need to select the check box in the '''Mark for PO''' column and select ''Drop-Ship'' in the '''PO Source''' column. The system does not allocate stock items in inventory based on the quantities of goods and the document amounts on sales orders for drop-shipping. {br}

When you save a sales order with the ''Open'' status, for each sales order line that is marked for drop-shipping, a purchase request of the ''Drop-Ship'' type is generated in the system. You can review the purchase requests on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_50_00|Create Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) form and generate drop-ship purchase orders based on these purchase requests. 
==3. Create the Drop-Ship Purchase Order==
Drop-ship purchase orders can be mass-generated for multiple sales orders or can be created one by one for each sales order. For the latter option, while viewing a sales order with lines for drop-shipping on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, you click '''Actions &gt; Create Purchase Order'''; this opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_50_00|Create Purchase Orders] form, on which you can create drop-ship purchase orders based on the drop-ship purchase requests that have been created for this sales order. On this form, you select the unlabeled check box next to the lines to be processed (which could include lines from the sales order you were working with or any other order), and click '''Process''' on the form toolbar to generate the purchase order or orders of the ''Drop-Ship'' type.((({S:Hint}As an alternative to the actions in the previous paragraph, you can create a purchase order of the ''Drop-Ship'' type manually on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, and then return to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form and link each applicable sales order line to this drop-ship purchase order manually. To do this, on the '''Document Details''' tab, you click the needed sales order line, and click '''PO Link''' on the table toolbar. In the '''Purchasing Details''' dialog box, which the system opens, select the line of the drop-ship purchase order to which the sales order line has to be linked. 
)))
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form, you can print a purchase order you have created by clicking '''Reports &gt; Print Purchase Order''' on the form toolbar. 
==4. Create the Purchase Receipt for the Drop-Ship Purchase Order==
After you have received a confirmation that the customer has received the goods from the vendor, you prepare a purchase receipt for the drop-ship purchase order. For each separate drop-ship purchase order, while viewing the order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, you can click '''Actions &gt; Enter PO Receipt''' on the form toolbar to create the purchase receipt manually. {br}

Alternatively, you can create a receipt by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, and add to it multiple purchase orders of the same vendor by clicking '''Add PO''' or '''Add PO Line''' on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab. You then add the needed purchase orders or separate purchase order lines in the dialog that opens. 
==5. Release the Purchase Receipt==
To release the purchase receipt, you click '''Release''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form. The system does not create an inventory receipt on release of the purchase receipt because the items are not received in inventory and are instead delivered directly to the customer. When you release the purchase receipt, the status of the drop-ship purchase order is changed to ''Closed''; the sales order becomes completed, because for drop-ship lines of sales orders, purchase receipts function as shipments do. 
==6. Prepare the Accounts Payable Bill==
If the '''Create Bill''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, when you released the purchase receipt, the system generated an Accounts Payable bill to the vendor of the drop-shipped stock items automatically. Otherwise, you need to prepare the bill manually: While you are viewing the applicable purchase receipt on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] form, you can click '''Actions &gt; Enter AP Bill''' on the form toolbar.
==7. Release the Accounts Payable Bill==
To release the Accounts Payable bill, you click '''Release''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form. On release of the bill, a batch of General Ledger Transactions is generated. 
==8. Create a Sales Orders Invoice==
You can prepare a Sales Orders (SO) invoice to be sent to a customer by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Prepare Invoice''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form while viewing the applicable sales order. Alternatively, you can create multiple invoices on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) form by specifying the ''Prepare Invoice'' action and processing multiple orders (all listed orders or only those you select). {br}

Any prepared SO invoice can be reviewed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form. You can print an SO invoice by clicking '''Reports &gt; Print Invoice''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] form. 
==9. Release the Sales Orders Invoice==
To release the Sales Orders invoice, you click '''Actions &gt; Release''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] form. On release of the invoice, a batch of General Ledger transactions is generated, and the system automatically generates a corresponding inventory issue with the date and posting period of the invoice. {br}

Also, when the SO invoice is released, the related Accounts Receivable invoice with the same reference number is generated and can be viewed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form. For more information on processing Accounts Receivable invoices, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__MNG_InvoicesMemos|Processing Invoices].
==10. Release the Inventory Issue==
The generated inventory issue is released automatically if the '''Automatically Release IN Documents''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form. If this check box is cleared, you have to release the inventory issue manually by clicking '''Release''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form. On release of the inventory issue, a batch of General Ledger transactions is generated.

Enter the Sales Order For a sales order in which some or all items will be drop-shipped, you create a new sales         order of the  SO  type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form. Its         reference number is generated according to the numbering sequence assigned to this order         type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form, and the order is saved with the            On Hold  status by default if the  Hold Documents on Entry          check box is selected for this order type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types form. If         the order is on hold, you should clear the  Hold  check box on the             ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders form for the order so you can process it further. 2. Mark the Line or Lines for Drop-Shipping For each line of the sales order that is intended for drop-shipping, on the            Document Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders form,         you need to select the check box in the  Mark for PO  column and select            Drop-Ship  in the  PO Source  column. The system does not         allocate stock items in inventory based on the quantities of goods and the document amounts         on sales orders for drop-shipping.  When you save a sales order with the  Open  status, for each sales order line that is         marked for drop-shipping, a purchase request of the  Drop-Ship  type is generated in         the system. You can review the purchase requests on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) Create Purchase Orders         (PO505000) form and generate drop-ship purchase orders based on these purchase requests.        3. Create the Drop-Ship Purchase Order Drop-ship purchase orders can be mass-generated for multiple sales orders or can be created         one by one for each sales order. For the latter option, while viewing a sales order with         lines for drop-shipping on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, you click  Actions > Create Purchase Order ; this opens the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) Create Purchase Orders form, on which you can create         drop-ship purchase orders based on the drop-ship purchase requests that have been created         for this sales order. On this form, you select the unlabeled check box next to the lines to         be processed (which could include lines from the sales order you were working with or any         other order), and click  Process  on the form toolbar to generate the         purchase order or orders of the  Drop-Ship  type. As an alternative to the actions in the previous paragraph, you can create a purchase         order of the  Drop-Ship  type manually on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders         (PO301000) form, and then return to the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders form and link each         applicable sales order line to this drop-ship purchase order manually. To do this, on the            Document Details  tab, you click the needed sales order line, and         click  PO Link  on the table toolbar. In the  Purchasing           Details  dialog box, which the system opens, select the line of the drop-ship         purchase order to which the sales order line has to be linked.  On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form, you can print a purchase order you have         created by clicking  Reports > Print Purchase Order  on the form toolbar.  4. Create the Purchase Receipt for the Drop-Ship Purchase Order After you have received a confirmation that the customer has received the goods from the         vendor, you prepare a purchase receipt for the drop-ship purchase order. For each separate         drop-ship purchase order, while viewing the order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form, you can click  Actions > Enter PO Receipt  on the form toolbar to create the purchase receipt manually.  Alternatively, you can create a receipt by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form, and add to it multiple purchase orders of the same vendor         by clicking  Add PO  or  Add PO Line  on the table         toolbar of the  Document Details  tab. You then add the needed purchase         orders or separate purchase order lines in the dialog that opens.  5. Release the Purchase Receipt To release the purchase receipt, you click  Release  on the form         toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form. The system         does not create an inventory receipt on release of the purchase receipt because the items         are not received in inventory and are instead delivered directly to the customer. When you         release the purchase receipt, the status of the drop-ship purchase order is changed to            Closed ; the sales order becomes completed, because for drop-ship lines of sales         orders, purchase receipts function as shipments do.  6. Prepare the Accounts Payable Bill If the  Create Bill  check box is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form, when you released the purchase         receipt, the system generated an Accounts Payable bill to the vendor of the drop-shipped         stock items automatically. Otherwise, you need to prepare the bill manually: While you are         viewing the applicable purchase receipt on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts         form, you can click  Actions > Enter AP Bill  on the form toolbar. 7. Release the Accounts Payable Bill To release the Accounts Payable bill, you click  Release  on the form         toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form. On release of the bill, a         batch of General Ledger Transactions is generated.  8. Create a Sales Orders Invoice You can prepare a Sales Orders (SO) invoice to be sent to a customer by clicking  Actions Prepare Invoice  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders form while viewing         the applicable sales order. Alternatively, you can create multiple invoices on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) Process Orders (SO501000) form by specifying the  Prepare Invoice  action         and processing multiple orders (all listed orders or only those you select).  Any prepared SO invoice can be reviewed on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000)         form. You can print an SO invoice by clicking  Reports > Print Invoice  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices form.  9. Release the Sales Orders Invoice To release the Sales Orders invoice, you click  Actions > Release  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices form. On release         of the invoice, a batch of General Ledger transactions is generated, and the system         automatically generates a corresponding inventory issue with the date and posting period of         the invoice.  Also, when the SO invoice is released, the related Accounts Receivable invoice with the         same reference number is generated and can be viewed on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos         (AR301000) form. For more information on processing Accounts Receivable invoices, see  Processing Invoices. 10. Release the Inventory Issue The generated inventory issue is released automatically if the  Automatically           Release IN Documents  check box is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences (SO101000) form. If this check box is cleared, you have to         release the inventory issue manually by clicking  Release  on the form         toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) Issues (IN302000) form. On release of the inventory         issue, a batch of General Ledger transactions is generated. ]]></column>

Drop shipping is a type of sales order fulfillment in which the customers order goods from your company, receive them directly from a vendor (wholesaler or manufacturer), and send payments for the orders to your company. The quantities of stock items on completed drop-ship orders are not included in the quantities available at any warehouse of your company, and no data in the Inventory module is updated when the drop-ship orders are completed. {br}

With Acumatica ERP, you can create drop-ship orders for goods that should be delivered directly to a customer location. You can add the following types of items to drop-ship orders:[anchor|#ul_mdw_11x_p1b]
*Stock items: The system automatically assigns the ''Goods for Drop-Ship'' line type to these items.
*Non-stock items that have both the '''Require Receipt''' and '''Require Shipment''' check boxes selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form: The system automatically assigns the ''Non-Stock for Drop-Ship'' line type to these items.
*Non-stock items that have the '''Require Receipt''' check box selected and the '''Require Shipment''' check box cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form: The system automatically assigns the ''Non-Stock'' line type to these items. The ''Non-Stock'' lines do not need to be linked to a sales order document.
((({S:Hint}Kits cannot be drop-shipped, because they are manufactured in your company.
)))
You can create drop-ship orders based on sales orders and on requisitions created for customers. {br}{TOC}
==Enabling Drop-Ship Orders==
In Acumatica ERP, the functionality of drop-ship orders is available only if the ''Inventory'' and ''Drop Shipments'' features are enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. {br}

If the ''Multiple Warehouses'' and ''Multiple Warehouse Locations'' features are enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, before you start creating and processing drop-ship orders, make sure that the ''Drop Shipments'' feature is enabled and that each warehouse has a default location for drop-ship orders selected in the '''Drop-Ship Location''' box on the '''Location Table''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form. Because specifying a warehouse and warehouse location is mandatory for all inventory documents, the system will automatically insert this location in all documents generated for drop-ship orders. 
==Processing Different Line Types in Drop-Ship Orders==
Drop-ship orders can include lines of different types. The type a particular line has depends on the settings of the item selected in the '''Inventory ID''' box; the system processes lines of different types in different ways. The following line types are available in drop-ship orders:[anchor|#ul_vpl_d5k_x1b]
*''Goods for Drop-Ship'': The system assigns this line type to all stock items. Lines of this type are copied to purchase receipts, where each ''Goods for Drop-Ship'' line must be linked to a sales order document.
*''Non-Stock for Drop-Ship'': The system assigns this line type to non-stock items that have both the '''Require Receipt''' and '''Require Shipment''' check boxes selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. Lines of this type are copied to purchase receipts, where each ''Non-Stock for Drop-Ship'' line must be linked to a sales order document. 
*''Non-Stock'': The system assigns this line type to non-stock items that have the '''Require Receipt''' check box selected and the '''Require Shipment''' check box cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form. The ''Non-Stock'' lines are copied to purchase receipts and do not need to be linked to a sales order document.
*''Service'': The system assigns this line type to non-stock items that have the '''Require Receipt''' check box cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form, and to lines in which no '''Inventory ID''' is specified. The way the system processes ''Service'' lines in drop-ship orders depends on whether the '''Process Service Lines from Drop-Ship Purchase Orders via Purchase Receipt''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form. For more details, see the next section.
*''Freight'': You can add a line without an '''Inventory ID''' specified and select this line type manually to record freight expenses for the order. Lines of this type are copied to purchase receipt, or could be added directly to purchase receipt, and do not need to be linked to a sales order document. The freight amount is posted to the Freight Expense account and subaccount specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] form.
*''Description'': You can add a line without an '''Inventory ID''' specified and select this line type manually. These lines are used for informational purposes. Lines of this type are not copied to purchase receipts.
((({S:Hint}Kits cannot be drop-shipped, because they are manufactured in your company.
)))
==Processing Service Lines in Drop-Ship Orders==
Depending on your business processes, you can select which workflow the system should use for processing ''Service'' lines. You select the needed workflow by using the '''Process Service Lines from Drop-Ship Purchase Orders via Purchase Receipt''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form as follows:[anchor|#ul_qb5_mxk_x1b]
*If the check box is selected, you can process ''Service'' lines through purchase receipts: When you create a purchase receipt for the drop-ship purchase order, the non-stock lines of the ''Service'' type that haven&rsquo;t been billed to the vendor yet are copied to the created purchase receipt. You cannot create an Accounts Payable bill for the ''Service'' lines for which the purchase receipt has not been created yet. Also, you can add lines of the ''Service'' type directly to purchase receipts without linking them to a purchase order and sales order.
*:This setting gives you the ability to handle charges added by vendors of drop-ship orders when their goods are delivered to the customer. Your company will absorb these charges without again billing the customer for them. 
*If the check box is cleared (the default setting), processing ''Service'' lines doesn&rsquo;t involve creating a purchase receipt an Accounts Payable bill (or multiple bills) has to be created directly from the drop-ship order. These lines do not have to be linked to a sales order. 
*:((({S:Hint}When you create a purchase receipt for a purchase order with lines of different types, the system does not copy ''Service'' lines to a purchase receipt prepared from a purchase order. Also, ''Service'' lines cannot be added to the purchase receipt manually.
)))

==Approving Drop-Ship Purchase Orders==
Depending on the order processing flows established in your company, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) form to approve drop-ship purchase orders and the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_30_00|Print/Email Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO503000|PO503000]) form to email them to vendors or to print them for sending by mail. Optionally, the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form can be used by the users involved in this processing because the '''Actions''' menu includes the '''Approve''', '''Email Purchase Order''', and '''Print Purchase Order''' menu commands. 
==Creating a Purchase Receipt for a Drop-Ship Order==
To create a receipt, you need a confirmation that the customer has received the goods or services from the vendor. This confirmation may be received through a call, an email, or another means. Based on the business routines established in your company, you can create purchase receipts when you receive invoices from the vendors or when you have heard from the customer, or you can create purchase receipts in advance and release them when you enter vendor invoices as bills.

If your company sells items that are purchased only when sales orders for these items exist, each sales order may result in multiple purchase orders for different vendors, and each purchase order may include items from multiple sales orders. These factors make it difficult to track the fulfillment of sales orders.{br}

In Acumatica ERP, if the ''Sales Order to Purchase Order Link'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can easily link sales orders to existing purchase orders and receipts, to enable the tracking of sales order fulfillment. The system uses these links to allocate the items listed on purchase receipts for specific sales orders and to automate the creation of transfer orders, if needed. This functionality can be very helpful if you have multiple warehouses and perform purchasing only to particular larger warehouses (distribution centers)—the system will generate the required transfers between warehouses, and you can easily track where the particular sales order is in the fulfillment process.((({S:Hint}Sales order lines marked for purchase are not processed during the quick processing of a sales order. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Quick_Process_Workflow|Quick Processing of Sales Orders].
))){br}{TOC}
==Creating Sales Orders with Items Requested for Purchase==
If the quantity of an item added to a sales order is out of stock fully or partially, you can purchase the remaining quantity. You specify that the remaining quantity should be purchased for the order by selecting the '''Mark for PO''' check box for the line on the '''Document Details''' tab. The quantity initially allocated for the order remains allocated, while the quantity that must be purchased remains unallocated. Whether or not you can create partial shipments depends on the shipping rules specified for the orders lines and for the whole order. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Shipping_Rules|Shipping Rule Combinations]. {br}

Once you take the sales order off hold, the order appears on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_50_00|Create Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) form and you can generate a purchase order which will be linked to the original sales order. Once receipts for the remaining quantities are released, you can allocate the initially unallocated quantities manually by using the '''Allocations''' dialog box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. Even if the '''Replan Back-Orders''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences], releasing inventory receipts does not update automatically plan types for sales orders with allocations (on release of receipts, the unallocated quantities still are shown as ''Back Ordered'' until you manually allocate them). 
==Linking Sales Orders to Purchase Orders==
If you need to promptly fulfill a sales order line for which the quantity of the item is insufficient, or if the sales order includes an item that is purchased only for specific sales orders, you can mark the applicable lines for purchasing—that is, select the check box in the''' Mark for PO''' column. Also, after you have shipped the available quantity of an item, you may need to order the remaining quantity that was unavailable at the time of shipping; in this case, you also can select the '''Mark for PO''' check box for the line. ((({S:Hint}In a sales order of the ''RR'' or ''RM'' type, only a line with the ''Issue'' operation can be marked for purchasing.
)))
You can include a sales order line that requires purchasing in a purchase order in one of the following ways:[anchor|#ul_xb1_rmt_wp]
*By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form: Select the sales order line, and then click '''Create Purchase Order''' on the '''Actions''' menu on the form toolbar.
*By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_50_00|Create Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) form: Select multiple lines of different sales orders to create multiple purchase orders for these sales orders. The system consolidates the item quantities and group the items by vendor as needed.

You also can link the line of a sales order that has the '''Mark for PO''' check box selected to an existing purchase order that has not been completed yet. For instance, if you have created a new sales order that lists the same items as the existing purchase order does. If the purchase order has a quantity that exactly matches the total quantity on the sales orders that are already linked, you should first increase the quantity on the purchase order, and then link the sales order to this purchase order.
==Linking Purchase Receipts to Sales Orders==
The purchased items ordered in a sales order may be received to warehouses other than the warehouse specified on the sales order. If the users properly specify links between the purchase receipts and purchase orders, Acumatica ERP enables tracking of sales order fulfillment, reserves the received items for sales orders, and automates transfers of the items to the needed warehouses. {br}

To make it possible to track items from receipts to original sales orders, you need to link each receipt to the corresponding purchase order in one of the following ways:[anchor|#ul_hgm_m4p_wp]
*Open the purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, and create a receipt for it by selecting '''Enter PO Receipt''' from the '''Actions''' menu on the form toolbar.
*Create a receipt on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, and link all the related purchase orders to this new receipt by clicking '''Add PO''' or '''Add PO Line''' on the table toolbar.

To view the original sales orders linked to the purchase receipt, for each receipt line, click '''View PO''' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] form. A dialog box opens that displays the list of sales orders that are linked to the purchase orders on which this receipt is based.{br}

After a receipt has been properly linked to all the related purchase orders, you will be able to track the stage of fulfillment for each line of the original sales order by clicking '''Allocations''' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form. In the '''Allocations''' dialog box, which opens, you can view an allocation that the system automatically performs to reserve the line item quantity required for the sale order on the purchase receipt. In the '''Allocations''' dialog box, you can also view the reference numbers of the related documents in the '''Related Documents''' column: the purchase order and the receipt. (You can click any reference number of a related document to view the document.){br}

If a purchase order line that corresponds to a sales order is completed or canceled, the system adds a new allocation line, which can be viewed in the '''Allocations''' dialog box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form. This line has the '''Mark for PO''' check box cleared and indicates that the shipment should be prepared for the item quantity in this line. When the shipment is confirmed for this line, the line is removed from the '''Allocations''' dialog box.{br}

On release of the receipt, the quantities of items required for the sales orders are deducted from the item quantities available for shipping. If items are received to a warehouse other than the warehouse specified on the sales order, the system will generate a transfer request, which you can use to create a transfer order by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form for a single transfer order, or on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_90_00|Create Transfer Orders] form for multiple transfer orders. For details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Create_Transfer_Order|To Create a Transfer Order (TR)] and [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Process_Multiple_TRs|To Create Shipments for Multiple Orders]. ]]></column>

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
A point-of-sale (POS) system is an electronic system that is used to record the sales, payments, and return transactions of a retail store. The POS system can be operated by a cashier or can be a self-service terminal where customers perform all operations by themselves. When a customer pays for goods and services, the POS system processes a direct sales invoice to record the sale (that is, an invoice that updates inventory without a sales order and a shipment being processed).{br}

For simplified processing of direct sales with the integration of an external POS system, the ''Advanced SO Invoices'' feature should be enabled in Acumatica ERP on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. With this feature enabled, a user can add stock items directly to a Sales Orders invoice without creating and processing the associated sales order and shipment.{br}{TOC}
==Entry of a Direct Sale==
If the ''Advanced SO Invoices'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, a user can add lines with stock items directly to an invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form. With this feature enabled, the following columns, which should be filled in for a direct invoice, appear on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form:[anchor|#ul_ytb_1d4_xcb]
*'''Warehouse ID''': This column is mandatory if the ''Multiple Warehouses'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form.
*'''Location''': This column is mandatory if the ''Multiple Warehouse Locations'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form.
*'''Lot/Serial Nbr.''' and '''Expiration Date''': These columns appear if the ''Lot and Serial Tracking'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form. If the item selected in the line is lot- or serial-tracked, these columns could be mandatory or optional, depending on the item settings. For a serialized item added to a direct invoice, for each serial number, the user should add a separate invoice line with this item and a quantity of 1. For more information on configuring and processing lot- and serial-tracked items, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Lot_and_Serial_Numbers|Lot and Serial Numbers].
((({S:Hint}In sales invoices created from sales orders or shipments, the listed columns are automatically filled in by the system and are not available for editing.
)))
==Sales Lines Linked to a Sales Order==
A sales line in an invoice (that is, a line that represents a sold rather than returned item) could be linked to a sales order or not linked to any order. If a line of the direct sales invoice is linked to an open line of a sales order, the release of the invoice functions as a shipment does for the linked sales order line: On release of the invoice, the system updates the '''Shipped Qty.''' in the sales order line based on the quantity specified in the invoice line, and inserts the reference number of the Sales Orders invoice on the '''Shipments''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form.
==Return Lines in a Direct Sales Invoice==
Return lines in an invoice are lines that represent returned rather than sold items. In direct invoices of the ''Invoice'', ''Credit Memo'', and ''Debit Memo'' type created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form, lines with different signs (that is, sales and return lines) can be combined in one document. In this case, the inventory operation for the inventory document to be generated is defined on the line level. The lines with a positive quantity are processed in the usual way. The lines with a negative quantity are processed as lines of a reversing document (that is, the generated General Ledger batch contains the same transactions as it would in a reversing document). {br}

You can also link a return line to the original sales invoice. When a document with a return line is released, the system generates an inventory issue, with the date and posting period of the invoice, that returns the item to inventory. 
==General Workflow and Related Documents==
For a Sales Orders invoice created for processing a direct sale or return, the typical processing involves the actions and generated documents shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#_289a7ce2-cd9a-455f-a1c3-28e09c923dfc][anchor|#_3af062fe-0d5a-4426-87cd-a0bfc35e12db][image:UserGuide/Images/Direct_Sales_and_Returns.png|popup|400px]
The following sections describe in detail the processing steps shown in the diagram.[anchor|#_318e9841-5481-4086-b5c4-45249f0eacd0]
#''Entering a direct Sales Orders invoice''
#:You enter a direct Sales Orders invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form. For stock items to be sold, you specify the positive quantity in a line; lines with a negative quantity are processed as returns of the selected items. If the invoice is created with the ''On Hold'' status, you should clear the '''Hold''' check box for the invoice so you can process it further.
#:You can print the SO invoice by clicking '''Reports &gt; Print Invoice''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] form. 
#''Releasing the direct SO invoice''
#:To release the SO invoice, you click '''Actions &gt; Release''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form. When the SO invoice is released, a batch of General Ledger transactions is generated; also, the system automatically generates an inventory issue for the stock items with the date and posting period of the SO invoice. For sales lines in the invoice, the system creates inventory issue lines with the ''Invoice'' or ''Debit Memo'' transaction type that issue the items from inventory. For return lines in the invoice, the system creates inventory issue lines with the ''Credit Memo'' transaction type that add returned items to inventory. Also, after the SO invoice release, the related Accounts Receivable invoice becomes available for review on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form. 
#''Releasing the inventory issue''
#:The generated inventory issue is released automatically if the '''Automatically Release IN Documents''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form. If this check box is cleared, you have to release the inventory issue manually by clicking '''Release''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form while viewing the issue. On release of the inventory issue, a batch of General Ledger Transactions is generated.

==Integration with External POS Systems==
 Acumatica ERP provides a contract-based SOAP API for implementing integration with external POS systems. For code examples, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_POS_Integration|Integration of Acumatica ERP with POS systems (SOAP API Examples)].

With this feature enabled, the following         columns, which should be filled in for a direct invoice, appear on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form: Warehouse ID : This column is mandatory if the  Multiple             Warehouses  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features form.

In sales invoices created from sales orders or shipments, the listed columns are         automatically filled in by the system and are not available for editing. Sales Lines Linked to a Sales Order A sales line in an invoice (that is, a line that represents a sold rather than returned         item) could be linked to a sales order or not linked to any order. If a line of the direct         sales invoice is linked to an open line of a sales order, the release of the invoice         functions as a shipment does for the linked sales order line: On release of the invoice, the         system updates the  Shipped Qty.  in the sales order line based on the         quantity specified in the invoice line, and inserts the reference number of the Sales Orders         invoice on the  Shipments  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders         (SO301000) form. Return Lines in a Direct Sales Invoice Return lines in an invoice are lines that represent returned rather than sold items. In         direct invoices of the  Invoice ,  Credit Memo , and  Debit Memo  type         created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form, lines with different signs         (that is, sales and return lines) can be combined in one document. In this case, the         inventory operation for the inventory document to be generated is defined on the line level.         The lines with a positive quantity are processed in the usual way. The lines with a negative         quantity are processed as lines of a reversing document (that is, the generated General         Ledger batch contains the same transactions as it would in a reversing document).  You can also link a return line to the original sales invoice. When a document with a         return line is released, the system generates an inventory issue, with the date and posting         period of the invoice, that returns the item to inventory.  General Workflow and Related Documents For a Sales Orders invoice created for processing a direct sale or return, the typical         processing involves the actions and generated documents shown in the following diagram. The following sections describe in detail the processing steps shown in the diagram. Entering a direct Sales Orders invoice You enter a direct Sales Orders invoice             on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form. For stock items to be sold, you             specify the positive quantity in a line; lines with a negative quantity are processed as             returns of the selected items. If the invoice is created with the  On Hold  status,             you should clear the  Hold  check box for the invoice so you can             process it further. You can print the SO invoice by clicking  Reports > Print Invoice  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices form.            Releasing the direct SO invoice To release the SO invoice, you click  Actions > Release  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000)             form. When the SO invoice is released, a batch of General Ledger transactions is             generated; also, the system automatically generates an inventory issue for the stock             items with the date and posting period of the SO invoice. For sales lines in the             invoice, the system creates inventory issue lines with the  Invoice  or  Debit               Memo  transaction type that issue the items from inventory. For return lines in the             invoice, the system creates inventory issue lines with the  Credit Memo              transaction type that add returned items to inventory. Also, after the SO invoice             release, the related Accounts Receivable invoice becomes available for review on the                 ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form.  Releasing the inventory issue The generated inventory issue is released             automatically if the  Automatically Release IN Documents  check box             is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences (SO101000) form. If this check box is             cleared, you have to release the inventory issue manually by clicking                Release  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) Issues (IN302000) form while viewing the issue. On release of the             inventory issue, a batch of General Ledger Transactions is generated. Integration with External POS Systems  Acumatica ERP provides a contract-based SOAP API for implementing integration with external POS         systems. For code examples, see  Integration of Acumatica ERP with POS systems (SOAP API Examples).  ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) ]]></column>

Check the  Account  column and the                                  Subaccount  column (if applicable); by                             default, the system uses the sales account and subaccount of the                             customer. You can change these settings, if needed. Optional: If you want to save the invoice with the  On Hold  status, in the                     Summary area, select the  Hold  check box. On the form toolbar, click  Save . Notes About the Procedure The notes in this section describe the nuances of the UI elements available on             the form, such as when an element is required and when it is not, and when the system             fills in settings by default. This section can include other notes. Note the following about creating a direct return: You can enter a direct invoice with inventory items only if the  Advanced SO                         Invoices  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features                     (CS100000) form. For a sale of serialized items through a direct invoice, a separate invoice line                     with this item and a quantity of 1.00 should be created for each serial number.  If you enter a discount percentage manually in an invoice line, the system                     calculates the discount amount automatically by multiplying the total line                     amount by the discount percentage. If you specify a negative quantity in a line of a direct invoice of the                          Credit Memo  type, the sale of the item is processed on release of                     this direct invoice. Alternatively, you can process a sale of an item as a line                     with positive quantity in the direct invoice of the  Invoice  type. For                     detailed instruction, see  To Create a Direct Sales Invoice. ]]></column>

 Acumatica ERP gives you the flexibility to manage various types of customer returns. Depending on your company&rsquo;s return policies, you may need to perform a return for credit when shipping of returned items to inventory is not needed. This topic describes the processing steps you need to perform, and the transactions generated during these steps.{br}

To process an unauthorized return without receipt and shipment, you can use a credit memo order (''CM''). The processing of a return for credit involves the actions and generated documents shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#fig_xqs_s4n_jdb][anchor|#image_sqs_xrk_3db][image:UserGuide/Images/Return_for_Credit_Without_Receipt.png|popup|400px]
The following sections describe in detail the processing steps shown in the diagram.{br}{TOC}
==1. Enter the Credit Memo Order==
You create a new credit memo order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. A reference number for the new return order is generated according to the numbering sequence assigned to this order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. If the order is created with the ''On Hold'' status, you should clear the '''Hold''' check box for the order to process it further.
==2. Link the Original Invoice Line to the Order==
Each line in the order of the ''CM'' order type can include a reference to the original invoice for which the return is performed. To add an item to be returned and include a link to original invoice, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, you can click '''Add Invoice''' on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab and select the line of the needed invoice in the '''Add Invoice Details''' dialog box (which opens). ((({S:Hint}You can also add a stock item to be returned without linking it to an invoice. To do this, click '''Add Stock Item''' on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab, and select the item in the '''Inventory Lookup''' dialog box (which opens).
)))
==3. Prepare the Sales Orders Invoice==
You can prepare the Sales Orders (SO) invoice by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Prepare Invoice''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, or you can create any number of invoices by running the ''Prepare Invoice'' action for multiple selected orders on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) form. {br}

The prepared document or documents of the ''Credit Memo'' type can be reviewed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form. You can print an SO invoice by clicking '''Reports &gt; Print Invoice''' on the form toolbar of this form. 
==4. Release the Sales Orders Invoice==
For the credit memo order, the released Sales Orders invoice acts as a shipment does: On release of the invoice, the system updates the '''Qty. on Shipments''' value in the order lines based on the quantity specified in the credit memo lines, and inserts the reference number of the Sales Orders credit memo on the '''Shipments''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form.{br}

When the SO invoice is released, a batch of General Ledger transactions is generated, and the system automatically generates an inventory issue with the ''Credit Memo'' transaction type that adds the returned item to inventory. Also, a corresponding Accounts Receivable credit memo is generated and becomes available for review on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form.
==5. Release the Inventory Issue==
The generated inventory issue is released automatically if the '''Automatically Release IN Documents''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form. If this check box is cleared, you have to release the inventory issue manually by clicking '''Release''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form. On release of the inventory issue, a batch of General Ledger Transactions is generated.((({S:Hint}To finish the return process, you need to process Accounts Receivable credit memo to completion. You can apply the credit memo to the original invoice, or process the customer refund if the original invoice was already paid. For details on credit memo application, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__how_Closing_a_Credit_Memo|To Apply a Credit Memo]. For details on the processing of a customer refund, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__how_Issuing_a_Customer_Refund|To Issue a Refund].

The prepared document or documents of the  Credit Memo  type can be reviewed on the             ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form. You can print an SO invoice by clicking  Reports > Print Invoice  on the form toolbar of this form.  4. Release the Sales Orders Invoice For the credit memo order, the released Sales Orders invoice acts as a shipment does: On         release of the invoice, the system updates the  Qty. on Shipments          value in the order lines based on the quantity specified in the credit memo lines, and         inserts the reference number of the Sales Orders credit memo on the            Shipments  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000)         form. When the SO invoice is released, a batch of General Ledger transactions is generated, and         the system automatically generates an inventory issue with the  Credit Memo          transaction type that adds the returned item to inventory. Also, a corresponding Accounts         Receivable credit memo is generated and becomes available for review on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form. 5.

If this check box is cleared, you have to         release the inventory issue manually by clicking  Release  on the form         toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) Issues (IN302000) form. On release of the inventory         issue, a batch of General Ledger Transactions is generated. To finish the return process, you need to process Accounts Receivable credit memo to         completion. You can apply the credit memo to the original invoice, or process the customer         refund if the original invoice was already paid.

 Acumatica ERP gives you the flexibility to manage various types of customer returns. Depending on your company&rsquo;s return policies, you may need to perform a return of an inventory item for cash. This topic describes the processing steps you need to perform, and the transactions generated during these steps.{br}

To process a return for cash, you can use a return order for cash (that is, an order with the ''CR'' predefined order type). The processing of a return for cash involves the actions and generated documents shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#fig_xqs_s4n_jdb][anchor|#image_sqs_xrk_3db][image:UserGuide/Images/Return_for_Cash.png|popup|400px]
The following sections describe in detail the processing steps shown in the diagram.{br}{TOC}
==1. Enter the Return Order for Cash ==
You create a new return order for cash on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. A reference number for the new return order for cash is generated according to the numbering sequence assigned to this order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. If the order is created with the ''On Hold'' status, you should clear the '''Hold''' check box to process it further.
==2. Link the Original Invoice Line to the Order==
Each line in the order of the ''CR'' order type can include a reference to the original invoice for which the return is performed. To add an item to be returned with a link to the original invoice, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, you can click '''Add Invoice''' on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab and select the line of the needed invoice in the '''Add Invoice Details''' dialog box (which opens). If an item to be returned has a specific lot or serial number, you should select this particular item from the list of invoice lines.((({S:Hint}You can also add a stock item to be returned without linking it to an invoice. To do this, click '''Add Stock Item''' on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab, and select an item in the '''Inventory Lookup''' dialog box (which opens).
)))
In each line added on the '''Document Details''' tab for an order of the ''CR'' type, you must specify a reason code. Also, the payment information on the '''Payment Settings''' tab is required for the cash return.
==3. Prepare the Sales Orders Invoice==
You can prepare the Sales Orders (SO) invoice by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Prepare Invoice''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, or you can create multiple invoices by running the ''Prepare Invoice'' action for multiple selected orders on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) form. {br}

The prepared document or documents of the ''Cash Return'' type can be reviewed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form. You can print an SO invoice by clicking '''Reports &gt; Print Invoice''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form. 
==4. Release the Sales Orders Invoice==
When the Sales Orders invoice of the ''Cash Return'' type is released, the system automatically generates an inventory issue with the ''Credit Memo'' transaction type that adds the returned item to inventory; you can review the generated issue on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form. Also, the related Accounts Receivable cash return with the same reference number becomes available for reviewing on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_40_00|Cash Sales] ([~/?ScreenId=AR304000|AR304000]) form. The document updates the appropriate sales and cash accounts. 
==5. Release the Inventory Issue==
The generated inventory issue is released automatically if the '''Automatically Release IN Documents''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] form. If this check box is cleared, you have to release the inventory issue manually by clicking '''Release''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form. On release of the inventory issue, a batch of General Ledger Transactions is generated.]]></column>

 Acumatica ERP gives you the flexibility to manage various types of customer returns. Depending on your company&rsquo;s return policies, you may need to authorize a customer return in which the customer receives an exact replacement of a particular item or items. For this purpose, you can use a return order for replacement, and a printed or electronic copy of this document can be sent to the customer. The customer then returns the rejected goods according to this order, the goods are returned to inventory, and the customer receives a replacement for the rejected goods. This topic describes the processing steps you need to perform, and the transactions generated during these steps.{br}

To process a return for exact replacement, you use a return order for replacement (that is, an order with the ''RR'' predefined order type). The processing of a return order for replacement involves the actions and generated documents shown in the diagram below.[anchor|#_e16a8fa5-9988-4476-9d74-b81e91c36a16][image:UserGuide/Images/Return_for_Exact_Replacement.png|popup|450px]
The following sections describe in detail the processing steps shown in the diagram.{br}{TOC}
==1. Enter the Return Order for Replacement==
A new return order for replacement of the ''RR'' predefined type is created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. A reference number for the new return order is generated according to the numbering sequence assigned to this order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. If the order is created with the ''On Hold'' status, you should clear the '''Hold''' check box for the order to process it further.
==2. Link the Original Invoice Line to the Order==
Each return line in the order of the ''RR'' order type can include a reference to the original Sales Orders invoice for which the return is performed. To add an item to be returned and include a link to original invoice, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, you can click '''Add Invoice''' on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab and select the line of the needed invoice in the '''Add Invoice Details''' dialog box (which opens). ((({S:Hint}You can also add a stock item to be returned without linking it to an invoice. To do this, click '''Add Stock Item''' on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab, and select the item in the '''Inventory Lookup''' dialog box (which opens). 
)))
==3. Add a Line with the Item for Replacement==
An added return line (linked or not linked to an invoice) has the ''Receipt'' operation specified in the '''Operation''' column. Each line with the ''Receipt'' operation type in an ''RR'' order should have a corresponding line with the ''Issue'' operation type for a replacement item. If the item in a ''Receipt''-type line is not tracked by serial or lot numbers, you can select the '''Auto-Create Issue''' check box for the line; then (when the shipment is confirmed) the system will automatically add the corresponding ''Issue''-type lines with the details copied from the ''Receipt''-type lines. If the items to be returned have specific lot or serial numbers, clear the '''Auto-Create Issue''' check box for the line, and add an ''Issue''-type line for the replacement line manually.
==4. Prepare the Receipt==
A receipt of the items returned to inventory is processed in the system as a shipment document with the ''Receipt'' operation type. To create a receipt (also referred to as an incoming shipment), you click '''Actions''' > '''Create Receipt''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. The prepared incoming shipment can be reviewed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form.
==5. Confirm the Receipt==
You can confirm an incoming shipment for a particular order by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Confirm Shipment''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form; to confirm multiple incoming shipments, you can execute the ''Confirm Shipment'' action for the selected shipments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_30_00|Process Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO503000|SO503000]) form.
==6. Prepare the Shipment with the Replacement Item==
You prepare the shipment with the ''Issue'' operation type by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Create Shipment''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. Alternatively, you can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) form to create shipments for multiple orders by executing the ''Create Shipment'' action for the selected return orders. The prepared shipment can be reviewed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form.{br}

You can print a pick list for a particular shipment by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] form. For multiple shipments with the ''On Hold'' and ''Open'' statuses, you can print pick lists by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_30_00|Process Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO503000|SO503000]) form. For more details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Shipment_Processing|Shipment Processing Steps].
==7. Confirm the Shipment==
You can confirm a shipment for a particular order by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Confirm Shipment''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form; to confirm multiple shipments, you can execute the ''Confirm Shipment'' action for the selected shipments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_30_00|Process Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO503000|SO503000]) form.
==8. Update Inventory==
You can update inventory for each shipment separately by opening the shipment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form and clicking '''Actions''' > '''Update IN''' to generate the appropriate inventory transaction and to update the item availability data. Alternatively, you can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_30_00|Process Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO503000|SO503000]) form to update inventory by executing the ''Update IN'' action for the selected shipments.{br}

Notice that Sales Orders invoices and Accounts Receivable invoices are not generated for an ''RR'' order because the returned item is replaced with another item with no price changes.
==9. Release the Inventory Issues==
The generated inventory issues are released automatically if the '''Automatically Release IN Documents''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form. If this check box is cleared, you have to release the inventory issues manually by clicking '''Release''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form for each of the inventory issues. On release of the inventory issues, batches of General Ledger transactions are generated.]]></column>

In the resulting list of items, select the unlabeled check box in the                             row of the item you want to add, and in the  Qty.                                 Selected  column, specify the requested quantity of the                             item (measured in the default unit of measure shown in the                                  UOM  column).  Click the  Add & Close  button, which closes                             the dialog box. In the  Operation  column, make sure that                                  Receipt  is selected. Click  Save  on the form toolbar. On the  Document Details  tab, for each row with an item                     that will be replaced with other units (or another unit) of the same item, make                     sure the  Auto Create Issue  check box is selected.                          For items that are tracked by lot or serial numbers, always select the                              Auto Create Issue  check box. For the rows with the  Auto Create Issue  check box                     cleared, add new rows for the replacement items as follows: Click  Add Stock Item  on the table toolbar. The                                  Inventory Lookup  dialog box appears with a                             list of active inventory items. In the dialog box, type the inventory ID of the item in the                                  Inventory  box. Optional: Type its subitem (if subitems are used in your system) in the                                  Subitem  box. In the resulting list of items, select the unlabeled check box in the                             row with the information about the item, and in the  Qty.                                 Selected  column, specify the quantity of the replacement                             item.  Click the  Add & Close  button, which closes                             the dialog box. Click  Save  on the form toolbar. Clear the  Hold  check box in the Summary area of the form.  Click  Save  on the form toolbar. When you create an order of the  RR  type, make sure that for each line with                 the  Receipt  transaction type, the order has a line with  Issue  as the                 transaction type for a replacement item. You can add thees lines manually (at this                 point, you can select other items for replacement), or you can select the                      Auto-Create Issue  check box for each  Receipt -type                 line (for items that are not tracked by serial or lot numbers) to make the system                 add the lines of the  Issue  type automatically. ]]></column>

 Acumatica ERP gives you the flexibility to manage various types of customer returns. Depending on your company&rsquo;s return policies, you may need to perform a merchandise authorization return of an inventory item for possible credit and replacement. For this purpose, you an use a merchandise authorization return order, and you can send the customer a printed or electronic copy of it along with the goods to be returned. Once the goods are received by your organization, they are returned to inventory, and the customer receives other goods instead. For this type of return order, different items than those returned may be included for replacement, freight and shipping and handling charges may be included, and the items could be returned at higher or lower prices. {br}

To process a merchandise authorization return, you can use a return order of the ''RM'' predefined order type. The processing of a ''RM'' order (further in this topic referred to as a ''return order'') involves the actions and generated documents shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#_01f4db7a-e906-4749-beab-6c47fdb8a97d][image:UserGuide/Images/Generic_Authorized_Return.png|popup|450px]
The following sections describe in detail the processing steps shown in the diagram.{br}{TOC}
==1. Enter the Merchandise Return Order==
You create a new return order of the ''RM'' order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. A reference number for the new return order is generated according to the numbering sequence assigned to this order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. If the order is created with the ''On Hold'' status, you should clear the '''Hold''' check box for the order to process it further.
==2. Link the Original Invoice Line to the Order==
Each return line in an order of the ''RM'' order type could include a reference to the original invoice for which the return is performed. To add an item to be returned and include a link to the original invoice, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, you can click '''Add Invoice''' on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab and select the line of the needed invoice in the '''Add Invoice Details''' dialog box (which opens). ((({S:Hint}You can also add a stock item to be returned without linking it to an invoice. To do this, click '''Add Stock Item''' on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab, and select the item in the '''Inventory Lookup''' dialog box (which opens). 
)))
An added return line (whether or not it is linked to an invoice) has the ''Receipt'' operation specified in the '''Operation''' column. After you have added the ''Receipt'' lines, make sure that the '''Auto-Create Issue''' check box is cleared in these lines (because you need to add replacement items and specify their details manually).
==3. Add a Line with the Item for Replacement==
Each line with the ''Receipt'' transaction type in an ''RM'' order should have a corresponding line with the ''Issue'' operation type for a replacement item. You need to add an ''Issue''-type line for the replacement lines manually. Alternatively, if the returned item is not tracked by serial or lot numbers, and the item price wasn&rsquo;t changed between the original sale and return, you can select the '''Auto-Create Issue''' check box for the line; on shipment confirmation, the system will add the corresponding ''Issue''-type lines automatically and copy the line details from the ''Receipt''-type lines. 
==4a–4b. Process the Return and the Replacement==
To complete the order, you need to process the receipt of the returned item and the shipment of the replacement item. You can process the return and replacement in any order on its own, or you can process multiple returns and replacements simultaneously on mass-processing forms. You perform the following general steps for processing: [anchor|#_228a8628-2ef3-4115-aaae-ce8fbd6b3cec]
#Prepare the receipt (for return) and the shipment (for replacement) by doing the following:
#*You prepare the receipt (that is, the incoming shipment with the ''Receipt'' operation type) by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Create Receipt''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form.
#*You prepare the outgoing shipment with the ''Issue'' operation type by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Create Shipment''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form. 
#:The prepared shipment can be reviewed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) form.
#:Alternatively, you can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_10_00|Process Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) form to create both incoming and outgoing shipments for one order or multiple orders. To do this, you select the ''Create Shipment'' action, select the needed orders, and click '''Process''' on the form toolbar.
#Confirm the receipt and the shipment.
#:You can confirm a particular receipt or shipment by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Confirm Shipment''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] form; to confirm multiple shipments, you can select the ''Confirm Shipment'' action, select the needed shipments, and click '''Process''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_30_00|Process Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO503000|SO503000]) form.
#Prepare the Sales Orders invoices. 
#:You prepare the Sales Orders invoice for a particular receipt or shipment by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Prepare Invoice''' on the form toolbar on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] form, or you can create invoices by processing the ''Prepare Invoice'' action for multiple selected shipments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_30_00|Process Shipments] form. 
#:The prepared document or documents can be reviewed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form. For the return, the system generates a Sales Orders invoice of the ''Credit Memo'' type; for the shipment, the system generates a Sales Orders invoice of the ''Invoice'' type. 
#:You can print a Sales Orders invoice by clicking '''Reports &gt; Print Invoice''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] form. 
#Release the Sales Orders invoices.
#:When the Sales Orders invoices are released, the system automatically generates two inventory issues: one with the ''Return'' transaction type for the return, and one with the ''Issue'' transaction type for replacement. Also, the related Accounts Receivable credit memo and invoice with the same reference numbers become available for reviewing on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form. 
#:Once you release the Sales Orders invoices, the original ''RM'' order is assigned the ''Completed'' status. 
#Release the generated inventory issues.
#:The generated inventory issues are released automatically if the '''Automatically Release IN Documents''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form. If this check box is cleared, you have to release each inventory issue manually by clicking '''Release''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form. On release of each inventory issue, a batch of the General Ledger transactions is generated.

The following sections describe in detail the processing steps shown in the diagram. 1. Enter the Merchandise Return Order You create a new return order of the  RM  order type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form. A reference number for the new return order is         generated according to the numbering sequence assigned to this order type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form. If the order is created with the  On Hold          status, you should clear the  Hold  check box for the order to process         it further. 2. Link the Original Invoice Line to the Order Each return line in an order of the  RM  order type could include a reference to the         original invoice for which the return is performed. To add an item to be returned and         include a link to the original invoice, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000)         form, you can click  Add Invoice  on the table toolbar of the            Document Details  tab and select the line of the needed invoice in         the  Add Invoice Details  dialog box (which opens).  You can also add a stock item to be returned without linking it to an invoice. To do         this, click  Add Stock Item  on the table toolbar of the            Document Details  tab, and select the item in the            Inventory Lookup  dialog box (which opens).  An added return line (whether or not it is linked to an invoice) has the  Receipt          operation specified in the  Operation  column. After you have added the            Receipt  lines, make sure that the  Auto-Create Issue  check         box is cleared in these lines (because you need to add replacement items and specify their         details manually). 3. Add a Line with the Item for Replacement Each line with the  Receipt  transaction type in an  RM  order should have a         corresponding line with the  Issue  operation type for a replacement item. You need to         add an  Issue -type line for the replacement lines manually. Alternatively, if the         returned item is not tracked by serial or lot numbers, and the item price wasn't changed         between the original sale and return, you can select the  Auto-Create           Issue  check box for the line; on shipment confirmation, the system will add         the corresponding  Issue -type lines automatically and copy the line details from the            Receipt -type lines.  4a–4b. Process the Return and the Replacement To complete the order, you need to process the receipt of the returned item and the         shipment of the replacement item. You can process the return and replacement in any order on         its own, or you can process multiple returns and replacements simultaneously on         mass-processing forms. You perform the following general steps for processing:  Prepare the receipt (for return) and the shipment (for replacement) by doing the             following: You prepare the receipt (that is, the incoming shipment with the  Receipt                operation type) by clicking  Actions Create Receipt  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders(SO301000)               form. You prepare the outgoing shipment with the  Issue  operation type by clicking  Actions Create Shipment  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders form.  The prepared shipment can be reviewed on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments             (SO302000) form. Alternatively, you can use the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO501000|SO501000]) Process Orders             (SO501000) form to create both incoming and outgoing shipments for one order or multiple             orders. To do this, you select the  Create Shipment  action, select the needed             orders, and click  Process  on the form toolbar. Confirm the receipt and the shipment. You can confirm a particular receipt or shipment             by clicking  Actions Confirm Shipment  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments form; to             confirm multiple shipments, you can select the  Confirm Shipment  action, select             the needed shipments, and click  Process  on the form toolbar of             the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO503000|SO503000]) Process Shipments (SO503000) form. Prepare the Sales Orders invoices.  You prepare the Sales Orders invoice for a             particular receipt or shipment by clicking  Actions Prepare Invoice  on the form toolbar on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments form, or you             can create invoices by processing the  Prepare Invoice  action for multiple             selected shipments on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO503000|SO503000]) Process Shipments form.  The prepared             document or documents can be reviewed on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000)             form. For the return, the system generates a Sales Orders invoice of the  Credit               Memo  type; for the shipment, the system generates a Sales Orders invoice of the                Invoice  type.  You can print a Sales Orders invoice by clicking  Reports > Print Invoice  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices form.            Release the Sales Orders invoices. When the Sales Orders invoices are released, the             system automatically generates two inventory issues: one with the  Return              transaction type for the return, and one with the  Issue  transaction type for             replacement.

Many businesses perform sales on credit: A customer order is paid after the order has been shipped and an invoice for the shipped goods and services has been sent to the customer. In some cases, businesses may require prepayments or payments to be made for particular orders, or your organization can charge a customer card for specific orders. If you rely on payment auto-application, payments are applied to unrelated invoices starting from the earliest documents, and it is difficult to perform reconciliation of balances later.{br}

With Acumatica ERP, you can create payments and prepayments directly on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, thus reserving these payments or prepayments for the particular order in full or partially. Also, you can link an order to existing prepayments or payments by their reference numbers. There may be many variations of processing a sales order with reserved payment, such as multiple shipments and multiple invoices for the order, multiple payments reserved for one order, or multiple orders paid by one prepayment. If the order is being shipped in multiple shipments, you can track how the payment's partial amounts was applied to multiple invoices.{br}{TOC}
==Linking Orders and Payments==
When you enter a new sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, you can create a payment or prepayment directly from the '''Payments''' tab by clicking '''Create Payment''' or '''Create Prepayment''' on the table toolbar. The system brings up the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_20_00|Payments and Applications] ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) form in a pop-up window. After you enter and save the payment or prepayment, it is linked to the sales order and can be reviewed on the '''Payments''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders]form. {br}

When you enter a new customer prepayment or payment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_20_00|Payments and Applications] form, you can link it directly to a particular order or multiple by adding the order or orders on the '''Orders to Apply''' tab. Payments with balances that have been partially applied to invoices (whether or not the invoices are related to the order) can also be reserved for sales orders. {br}

For customers who pay by using credit cards, you can create a payment, link it to particular sales order or orders, and charge the credit card by using the same form, [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_20_00|Payments and Applications]. 
==Applying Parent and Child Payments==
If the ''Parent-Child Customer Relationship'' feature has been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can configure parent-child relationships between customer accounts. If the '''Consolidate Balance''' check box is selected for a child account on the '''Billing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form, you can apply parent payments and prepayments to the open sales orders of this child account. When the invoice is prepared for the sales order, the payment application amount is transferred to the invoice. If you enter an invoice for a child customer directly on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form, you can also apply payments and prepayments of the parent customer to this invoice. {br}

For more information on the configuration of parent-child relationships, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__MNG_ParentChild|Managing Parent-Child Relationships].
==Processing Orders with Reserved Payments==
An order with a payment linked is processed in the same way as any other order is. Once an order with linked payments or prepayments is shipped, the payment or prepayment amount applied to an order is transferred to the Sales Orders invoice or invoices generated for the order. On release of the SO invoices, the system applies the payment amounts reserved for the order to the invoices. If the amount of payments is equal to the order total, the invoices are closed. If the total amount of payments or prepayments applied to the order is less than the order total, the system leaves one of the invoices open with the unpaid balance (which is the difference between the order total and the payments&rsquo; total). {br}

You can view the history of application on the '''Application History''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_20_00|Payments and Applications] ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) form. As orders linked to this payment are shipped and completed, you will see on the '''Application History''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_20_00|Payments and Applications] form the list of applied invoices (generated for those orders) as it is populated.{br}

When a full-amount payment has been reserved for an order, once the order has been shipped and an invoice has been generated and released, the payment amount is applied to the invoice; the invoice is assigned the ''Closed'' status on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form, while the order is assigned the ''Completed'' status on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. If an order with a full-amount payment is shipped partially and then is completed or canceled, the amount applied to the order is reset to zero, while the payment with an unapplied balance is assigned the ''Open'' status and its applied amount is transferred to the invoice. 
==Limitations on Payment Application==
The application of payments to sales orders has the following limitations:[anchor|#_9e2822e1-9e57-4355-ad92-76a923ec3658]
*Payments and prepayments can be applied to only sales orders with single-installment credit terms specified in the '''Terms''' box on the '''Financial Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. If you change single-installment credit terms to multiple-installment terms for an existing sales order with payments or prepayments applied, these applications will be unlinked from the sales order. For more information on configuring credit terms, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__con_Credit_Terms|Setup of Credit Terms].
*If approval of sales orders is required in your organization, you can specify payments for only orders that have undergone the required approvals and have the ''Open'' status. For details about approval processes, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Approvals|Sales Order Approval].

==Canceling Payment Reservation==
If no invoice has been generated for the order, you can cancel payment application by removing the reserved payment from the list on the '''Payments''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Reserving Payments for Sales Orders Many businesses perform sales on credit: A customer order is paid after the order has been     shipped and an invoice for the shipped goods and services has been sent to the customer. In some     cases, businesses may require prepayments or payments to be made for particular orders, or your     organization can charge a customer card for specific orders. If you rely on payment     auto-application, payments are applied to unrelated invoices starting from the earliest     documents, and it is difficult to perform reconciliation of balances later. With  Acumatica ERP,     you can create payments and prepayments directly on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders     (SO301000) form, thus reserving these payments or prepayments for the particular order in full     or partially. Also, you can link an order to existing prepayments or payments by their reference     numbers. There may be many variations of processing a sales order with reserved payment, such as     multiple shipments and multiple invoices for the order, multiple payments reserved for one     order, or multiple orders paid by one prepayment. If the order is being shipped in multiple     shipments, you can track how the payment's partial amounts was applied to multiple invoices. Linking Orders and Payments When you enter a new sales order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, you     can create a payment or prepayment directly from the  Payments  tab by     clicking  Create Payment  or  Create Prepayment  on     the table toolbar. The system brings up the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) Payments and Applications (AR302000) form in a     pop-up window. After you enter and save the payment or prepayment, it is linked to the sales     order and can be reviewed on the  Payments  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Ordersform.   When you enter a new customer prepayment or payment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) Payments and Applications     form, you can link it directly to a particular order or multiple by adding the order or orders     on the  Orders to Apply  tab. Payments with balances that have been     partially applied to invoices (whether or not the invoices are related to the order) can also be     reserved for sales orders.  For customers who pay by using credit cards, you can create a payment, link it to particular     sales order or orders, and charge the credit card by using the same form,   ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) Payments and Applications.  Applying Parent and Child Payments If the  Parent-Child Customer Relationship  feature has been enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, you can configure parent-child relationships between     customer accounts. If the  Consolidate Balance  check box is selected for a     child account on the  Billing Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000) form, you can apply parent payments and prepayments to the     open sales orders of this child account. When the invoice is prepared for the sales order, the     payment application amount is transferred to the invoice. If you enter an invoice for a child     customer directly on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form, you can also apply     payments and prepayments of the parent customer to this invoice.  For more information on the configuration of parent-child relationships, see  Managing Parent-Child Relationships. Processing Orders with Reserved Payments An order with a payment linked is processed in the same way as any other order is. Once an     order with linked payments or prepayments is shipped, the payment or prepayment amount applied     to an order is transferred to the Sales Orders invoice or invoices generated for the order. On     release of the SO invoices, the system applies the payment amounts reserved for the order to the     invoices. If the amount of payments is equal to the order total, the invoices are closed. If the     total amount of payments or prepayments applied to the order is less than the order total, the     system leaves one of the invoices open with the unpaid balance (which is the difference between     the order total and the payments' total).  You can view the history of application on the  Application History  tab     of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) Payments and Applications (AR302000) form. As orders linked to this payment are     shipped and completed, you will see on the  Application History  tab of the        ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) Payments and Applications form the list of applied invoices (generated for those orders)     as it is populated.

If an order with a full-amount payment is shipped     partially and then is completed or canceled, the amount applied to the order is reset to zero,     while the payment with an unapplied balance is assigned the  Open  status and its applied     amount is transferred to the invoice.

To process a purchase of items in Acumatica ERP, you create and process purchase orders of the ''Normal'' type. In Acumatica ERP, you can process purchases in which the bills are generated after the ordered goods and services have been received from the vendors. {br}

The following diagram represents the general workflow of the processing of a purchase receipt before the bill is generated. [anchor|#_81d8c218-8f3a-4d5b-83f0-73c461393634][anchor|#_313a6c88-2601-4ed8-b70d-0cb493b80ab7][image:UserGuide/Images/PO_Receipt_Before_Bill.png|popup|450px]
The remaining sections of this topic describe in detail the processing steps shown in the diagram.{br}{TOC}
==1. Enter the Purchase Order==
You create a new purchase order of the ''Normal'' type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. On the purchase order, you can list the stock and non-stock items to be purchased from the particular vendor. The reference number for a new purchase order is generated in accordance with the numbering sequence specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form. If the order is initially created with the ''On Hold'' status, you should clear the '''Hold''' check box when you are ready to process the order further. For details about the settings specified in the purchase order, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_Purchase_Order_Processing|Purchase Order Creation].
==2. Prepare the Purchase Receipt==
While you are viewing the purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, you can create a purchase receipt for the purchase order by clicking '''Actions &gt; Enter PO Receipt''' on the form toolbar. The system navigates to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form with the prepared purchase receipt. The reference number for the new purchase receipt is generated in accordance with the numbering sequence specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form. If the purchase receipt is initially created with the ''On Hold'' status, you should clear the '''Hold''' check box when you are ready to process the receipt further.{br}

As an alternate way to prepare the purchase receipt, you can create a new purchase receipt of the ''Receipt'' type manually on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] form and add the lines of the purchase order (or of multiple purchase orders with the same vendor) to the purchase receipt. 
==3. Release the Purchase Receipt==
To release the prepared purchase receipt, while you are viewing it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, you click '''Release''' on the form toolbar. Alternatively, you can release multiple purchase receipts at the same time by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_10_00|Release Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO501000|PO501000]) form. {br}

When the purchase receipt is released, the system automatically generates a corresponding inventory receipt, with the date and posting period of the purchase receipt, to add the received items to inventory. You can review the generated inventory receipt on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) form.{br}

After all the lines in the purchase order have been received in full, the purchase order is assigned the ''Completed'' status.
==3. Prepare and Release the Accounts Payable Bill==
If the '''Create Bill''' check box is selected for the purchase receipt on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, when you release the purchase receipt, the system generates an accounts payable bill to the vendor automatically. Otherwise, you need to prepare the bill manually from the related purchase receipt by clicking '''Actions &gt; Enter AP Bill''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] form. You can view the generated AP bill on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form. {br}

Alternatively, you can create a new AP bill manually on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] form and add or link the lines of the purchase orders (for non-stock items that do not require purchase receipts) or purchase receipts (for stock items and non-stock items requiring receipt) to the bill. For more information on the processing of Accounts Payable bills, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AP_MNG_BillsAndAdjustments|Processing Bills and Adjustments].((({S:Hint}To be able to link the lines of a bill to the lines of the corresponding purchase orders and purchase receipts, make sure that for the bill, the ''Tax Settings'' option is selected in the '''Tax Calculation Mode''' box on the '''Financial Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] form.
)))
If all the lines in the purchase order have been billed in full, the purchase order is assigned the ''Closed'' status. For more information on the rules that affect line closing and completion, see the topics of the [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_LineTypes|Line Types in Purchase Orders] section.
==4. Release the Inventory Receipt==
The generated inventory receipt is released automatically if the '''Release IN Documents Automatically''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form. If this check box is cleared, you have to release the inventory receipt manually by clicking '''Release''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) form. On release of the inventory receipt, a batch of GL transactions is generated.

As an alternate way to prepare the purchase receipt, you can create a new purchase receipt         of the  Receipt  type manually on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts form and add the         lines of the purchase order (or of multiple purchase orders with the same vendor) to the         purchase receipt.  If all the lines in the purchase order have been received and billed in full, the purchase         order is assigned the  Closed  status. For more information on the rules that affect         line closing and completion, see the topics of the  Line Types in Purchase Orders         section. 4. Release the Purchase Receipt Because the AP bill has been already prepared, clear the  Create Bill          check box in the purchase receipt (if it was selected by default) before you release the         purchase receipt. To release the prepared purchase receipt, while you are viewing it on the             ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form, you click  Release          on the form toolbar. Alternatively, you can release multiple purchase receipts at the same         time by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO501000|PO501000]) Release Purchase Receipts (PO501000) form. When the purchase receipt is released, the system automatically generates a corresponding         inventory receipt with the date and posting period of the purchase receipt to add the         received items to inventory. You can view the generated inventory receipt on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) Receipts (IN301000) form. 5. Release the Inventory Receipt The generated inventory receipt is released automatically if the  Release IN           Documents Automatically  check box is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) Purchase Orders Preferences (PO101000) form. If this check box is cleared, you have to         release the inventory receipt manually by clicking  Release  on the         form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) Receipts (IN301000) form. On release of the         inventory receipt, a batch of GL transactions is generated. ]]></column>

In Acumatica ERP, you can process direct purchase receipts that does not have corresponding purchase orders. {br}

The following diagram represents the general workflow of the processing of a direct purchase receipt. [anchor|#_08c3387e-7753-4eaf-a870-b3b350b70f02][anchor|#_cd127059-1cce-4f0d-8a40-18734f665efd][image:UserGuide/Images/PO_Direct_Receipt.png|popup|450px]
The remaining sections of this topic describe in detail the processing steps shown in the diagram.{br}{TOC}
==1. Enter the Purchase Receipt==
You create a new purchase receipt on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form and assign it the ''Receipt'' type. On the purchase receipt, you can list the stock and non-stock items to be received from the particular vendor. The reference number for a new purchase receipt is generated in accordance with the numbering sequence specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form. If the purchase receipt is created with the ''On Hold'' status, you should clear the '''Hold''' check box when you are ready to process the receipt further.
==2. Release the Purchase Receipt==
To release the purchase receipt, while you are viewing it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, you click '''Release''' on the form toolbar. Alternatively, you can release multiple purchase receipts at the same time by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_10_00|Release Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO501000|PO501000]) form. {br}

When the purchase receipt is released, the system automatically generates a corresponding inventory receipt, with the date and posting period of the purchase receipt, to add the received items to inventory. You can review the generated inventory receipt on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) form. 
==3. Prepare the Accounts Payable Bill==
If the '''Create Bill''' check box is selected for the purchase receipt on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, when you release the purchase receipt, the system generates an accounts payable bill to the vendor automatically. Otherwise, you need to prepare the bill manually from the related purchase receipt on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] form by clicking '''Actions &gt; Enter AP Bill''' on the form toolbar. {br}

You can view the generated AP bill on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form. For more information on the processing of AP bills, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AP_MNG_BillsAndAdjustments|Processing Bills and Adjustments].
==4. Release the Inventory Receipt==
The generated inventory receipt is released automatically if the '''Release IN Documents Automatically''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form. If this check box is cleared, you have to release the inventory receipt manually by clicking '''Release''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) form. On release of the inventory receipt, a batch of GL transactions is generated. {br}

You can release the receipt before or after preparing the AP bill.

The following diagram represents the general workflow of the processing of a direct         purchase receipt.  The remaining sections of this topic describe in detail the processing steps shown in the         diagram. 1. Enter the Purchase Receipt You create a new purchase receipt on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form         and assign it the  Receipt  type.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
The purchase process typically starts with an employee entering a purchase order. This topic describes how you create a purchase order, which settings could affect the purchase order processing, which lines could be added to the order, and how to track unbilled quantities and amounts in the order.{br}{TOC}
==Creating a Purchase Order==
In general, the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form is the starting point for creating a purchase order, and employees can use this form to track the processing of the order. In Acumatica ERP, for processing most purchases, purchase orders of the ''Normal'' type are used. When you are creating a new order, you should first select a vendor and the vendor location. {br}

A newly created purchase order has the ''On Hold'' status. To reduce input errors on order entry, you can set up the validation of order totals by selecting the '''For Normal and Standard Orders''' check box in the '''Validate Total on Entry''' section of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form. If this check box is selected, then when you create a new purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, to take the order off hold, you must enter the order total in the '''Control Total''' box after verifying the order details. For more information on how you can set up document processing, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_AffectingProcessingDocs|Changing the Processing of Purchase Documents].((({S:Hint}Purchase orders based on requisitions, customer drop-ship orders, customer orders marked for purchasing, and replenishment requests can be created in bulk on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_50_00|Create Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) form.
)))
==Adding Lines to a Purchase Order==
In a purchase order created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, you list the stock and non-stock items to be purchased from the particular vendor. Purchase orders can include multiple lines of different line types. You can add stock items by clicking the '''Add Item''' button on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab and selecting from only the vendor&rsquo;s items or from the entire list of stock items. If you want to add non-stock items of any type (''Labor'', ''Service'', ''Non-Stock'', or ''Expense''), you can add a line and select a non-stock item by its inventory ID. The system processes different line types in different ways, which are described in detail in the following topics:[anchor|#_c005c8df-2e2d-420a-ac52-56479d9ec2a2]
*[HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_Purchase_of_Stock|Stock Item Lines in Purchase Orders]
*[HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_Purchase_of_NStock_w_Receipt|Non-Stock Lines in Purchase Orders]
*[HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_Purchase_of_Services|Service Lines in Purchase Orders]

If a purchase order includes stock and non-stock items of various types, its processing includes the creation of a receipt or multiple receipts. Then you can create separate bills: one based on receipts linked to the order, and another based on those lines of the original purchase order whose line items do not require receipt. Alternatively, you can create a single bill for all purchase order lines, both stock and non-stock by manually adding the items not requiring receipt to a bill prepared based on a receipt. ((({S:Hint}If the ''Blanket and Standard Purchase Orders'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can also add a blanket purchase order or a line of a blanket purchase order to a purchase order.
)))
==Approving a Purchase Order==
 If the approval of purchase orders is configured in your system, the order is given the ''Pending Approval'' status once you take it off hold; the status will change to ''Pending Printing'', ''Pending Email'', or ''Open'' once all the assigned approvers approve it. For details on approval, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_Purchase_Order_Approvals|Purchase Order Approval]. {br}

If the approval of purchase orders is not configured, a purchase order may need to be emailed or printed once you take it off hold. After that, the order is given the ''Open'' status and can be processed.
==Variations in Processing a Purchase Order ==
The general workflow of processing a purchase order with lines of any type is to process a purchase receipt (if one is needed) before creating an AP bill. However, if you receive bills from a particular vendor before the ordered items are received to inventory, you can configure this vendor so that for the purchase orders of this vendor, you can create and process an AP bill even before the purchase receipt is created for the purchase order. {br}

The order in which you create and process documents related to a purchase order depends on the state of the '''Allow AP Bill Before Receipt''' check box specified for a purchase order on the '''Other Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. The state of this check box is copied from the vendor settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form, or from the vendor location settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_10|Vendor Locations] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303010|AP303010]) form. The setting affects the processing of purchase orders in the following way:[anchor|#_3b7eb647-9682-4cc4-8d99-3e0d9e8d839e]
*If the check box is cleared, the AP bill can be created for a purchase order only after the related purchase receipt has been released. You can add to the created bill only unbilled lines of the released purchase receipts (for stock items and non-stock items requiring receipt) and unbilled purchase order lines (for non-stock items that do not require receipt). 
*If the check box is selected, the AP bill and purchase receipt can be prepared in any order. If the AP bill is prepared first, you can add to it unbilled lines of a purchase order that have not yet been included in any other bill.

Optional: In the  Currency  box, check the                     currency and the currency exchange rate; change these, if needed. Check the date of the purchase order, and change it if needed. Optional: In the  Vendor Ref.  box, specify the reference                     number of the vendor's original document. (This value may be required, based on                     your organization's settings.) Specify a brief description of the purchase order. On the  Document Details  tab, perform the                     following steps to add one item or multiple stock items to the purchase                         order: Click  Add Item  on the table toolbar. The                                  Inventory Lookup  dialog box appears with the                             list of active stock items. You can use the selection criteria at the                             top of the dialog box to narrow the list of items. In the line or lines with the items that you want to add, in the                                  Qty.

When you add a stock item to a purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, the system inserts ''Goods for IN'' as the line type for this line. If a purchase order includes only stock items that are intended for inventory and not linked to a drop-ship order or any other sales order, its processing involves the creation of a purchase receipt (or multiple receipts if the order is fulfilled by multiple shipments from the vendor) and the preparation of an accounts payable bill. You can configure a particular vendor so that the AP bill for a purchase order can be created before the purchase receipt is processed.{br}

This topic describes how the system processes stock lines added to a purchase order.{br}{TOC}
==Processing of the Purchase Receipt for the Purchase Order==
You can create a receipt for a purchase order by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Enter PO Receipt''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. Alternatively, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, you can create a receipt and link it to an existing purchase order or a particular line of the order by clicking '''Add PO''' or '''Add PO Line''' on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab. You can also allocate the lines with the ''Goods for IN'' line type by clicking '''Allocations''' on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form. {br}

The inventory account that is used for a stock item on a receipt by default is selected according to the '''Use Inventory/Accrual Account from''' setting of the posting class. On release of each purchase receipt linked to the purchase order, the system automatically generates an inventory receipt for the items listed in the purchase receipt and calculates the quantities of the received goods for each order line. These values are displayed in the '''Qty. On Receipts''' column on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form. {br}

For each purchase receipt, you can create an AP bill or multiple bills.
==Processing of the Accounts Payable Bill for the Purchase Order==
The general workflow of processing purchase orders with lines of any type is to process a purchase receipt (if one is needed) before creating an AP bill (see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_scn_Purchase_with_Receipt|Purchase with Receipt Before Billing] for details). However, if you receive bills from a particular vendor before the ordered items are received to inventory, you can configure this vendor so that for the purchase orders of this vendor, you can create and process an AP bill before the purchase receipt is released. {br}

To do this, you need to select the '''Allow AP Bill Before Receipt''' check box in the vendor settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form; in addition, you can select this check box for a particular vendor location on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_10|Vendor Locations] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303010|AP303010]) form. The state of this check box is copied to each purchase order created for this vendor, and can be reviewed on the '''Other Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. For a detailed description on how to process a purchase order with the associated bill being prepared before the receipt, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_scn_Purchase_with_Bill_Before_Receipt|Purchase with Billing Before Receipt].
==Rules for Closing and Completing Goods for IN Lines=={br}

 A ''Goods for IN'' line of a purchase order is considered closed on release of the purchase receipt or AP bill if the sum of the received quantity for all released purchase receipts prepared for this line is equal to the line quantity in all released AP bills prepared for this line, and the quantity in the AP bill lines is equal to or greater than purchase order line quantity &#42; ('''Complete On %'''/100). The line is also considered closed on release of the purchase receipt or AP bill if the sum of the received quantity for all released purchase receipts prepared for this line is equal to the line quantity in all released AP bills prepared for this line, and the user has selected the '''Completed''' check box manually.{br}

A ''Goods for IN'' line of a purchase order is completed in any of the following cases:[anchor|#_37dda7d2-6f03-479a-870a-e23da8230ea6]
*Automatically if the system has closed the line (that is, if the '''Closed''' check box is selected)
*On release of the purchase receipt prepared for the line if the user has selected the '''Completed''' check box manually
*If the sum of the received quantity for all released purchase receipts prepared for this line is equal to or greater than the quantity of the purchase order line &#42; ('''Complete On %'''/100)

If a user processes the lines of a purchase order partially, multiple related purchase receipts and AP bills can be prepared for a single purchase order. The system determines which purchase order lines should be added to the prepared purchase receipt or AP bill depending on the status of the '''Completed''' and '''Closed''' check boxes in each line, as follows:
*Completed purchase order lines are not added to the purchase receipt.
*Closed lines are added to neither purchase receipts, nor to AP bills.

If all purchase order lines have the '''Completed''' check box selected, and at least one line still has the '''Closed''' check box cleared, the purchase order is assigned the ''Completed'' status. If all purchase order lines have the '''Completed''' and '''Closed''' check boxes selected, the purchase order is assigned the ''Closed'' status.

==Processing of the Accounts Payable Bill for the Purchase Order==
The general workflow of processing purchase orders with lines of any type is to process the associated purchase receipt (if one is needed) before the creation of the associated AP bill (see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_scn_Purchase_with_Receipt|Purchase with Receipt Before Billing] for details). However, if you receive bills from a particular vendor before the purchased items are received to inventory, you can configure this vendor so that for its purchase orders, you can create and process an AP bill before the purchase receipt is released. {br}

To do this, you need to select the '''Allow AP Bill Before Receipt''' check box in the vendor settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form; in addition, you can select this check box for a particular vendor location on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_10|Vendor Locations] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303010|AP303010]) form. The state of this check box will be copied to each purchase order created to this vendor, and can be reviewed on the '''Other Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. For a detailed description on how to process a purchase order with the associated bill being prepared before the receipt, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_scn_Purchase_with_Bill_Before_Receipt|Purchase with Billing Before Receipt].
==Posting Accounts for Non-Stock Lines==
For the ''Non-Stock'' lines on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form, in the '''Account''' column, the system inserts the Expense account defined by the '''Use COGS / Expense Account From''' setting of the posting class specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) form. If the ''Subaccounts'' feature is enabled in your system, the system also inserts the subaccount, which is composed as defined by the '''Combine COGS / Expense Sub From''' setting of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) form, in the '''Sub.''' column of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form. {br}

Accounts and subaccounts are used for processing ''Non-Stock'' lines as follows:[anchor|#ul_okt_f2w_nt]
*When a purchase order is created, the item amount is recorded to the Expense account (with the Expense subaccount).
*When a purchase receipt linked to the purchase order is released, the line amount is moved from the Expense account (with the Expense subaccount) to the PO Accrual account (with the PO Accrual subaccount).
*When a bill is created for the receipt, the amount is moved back from the PO Accrual account (with the PO Accrual subaccount) to the Expense account (with the Expense subaccount).

The Expense and PO Accrual accounts to be used for receipt-related transactions are defined by the posting class of the item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) form; the default accounts assigned to the item on the '''GL Accounts''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form will be used if the posting class's '''Use COGS / Expense Account From''' and '''Use PO Accrual Account From''' settings have the ''Inventory Item'' option selected. The Expense subaccount and PO Accrual subaccount are also defined by the settings of posting class of the item; the default subaccounts assigned to the item on the''' GL Accounts''' tab will be used as the segment value sources for the resulting subaccounts based on the '''Combine COGS / Expense Sub From''' and '''Combine PO Accrual Sub From''' rules. For more information, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Posting_Classes__Definition_and_Usage|Posting Classes in Inventory].
==Rules for Closing and Completing Non-Stock Lines==
The way the lines of the ''Non-Stock'' type are completed and closed depends on the completion rule specified for the applicable non-stock item in the '''Complete PO Line''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. The system determines if a line of the ''Non-Stock'' type should be closed and completed by using the following rules: [anchor|#_857f97f2-07ea-4acf-b261-d816eb8ea88a]
*If ''By Quantity'' is selected in the '''Complete PO Line''' box for the item (the default option for non-stock items of the ''Non-Stock Item'' type), the purchase order line is considered completed in either of the following cases:
**If the sum of the received quantity for the released purchase receipts prepared for the line is equal to or greater than the quantity of the purchase order line &#42; ('''Complete On %'''/100)
**On release of the purchase receipt prepared for the line if the user has selected the '''Completed''' check box manually
*:With the ''By Quantity'' completion rule selected for the item, the line is considered closed on release of the purchase receipt or AP bill if the sum of the received quantity for all released purchase receipts prepared for this line is equal to the line quantity in all released AP bills prepared for this line, and the quantity in the AP bill lines is equal to or greater than purchase order line quantity &#42; ('''Complete On %'''/100). The line is also considered closed on release of the purchase receipt or AP bill if the sum of the received quantity for all released purchase receipts prepared for this line is equal to the line quantity in all released AP bills prepared for this line, and the user has selected the '''Completed''' check box manually in the purchase receipt line. 
*If ''By Amount'' is selected in the '''Complete PO Line''' box for the item (the default option for non-stock items of the ''Labor, Service, Charge'', and ''Expense'' types), the purchase order line is considered completed in either of the following cases:
**Automatically if the system has closed the line (that is, if the '''Closed''' check box is selected)
**On release of the purchase receipt prepared for the line if the user has selected the '''Completed''' check box manually
*:With the ''By Quantity'' completion rule selected for the item, the line is considered closed on release of the purchase receipt or AP bill if the sum of received quantity for all released purchase receipts prepared for this line is equal to the quantity in all released AP bills prepared for this line, and if the amount in the AP bill lines is equal to or greater than the amount of the purchase order line.

If a user processes the lines of a purchase order partially, multiple related purchase receipts and AP bills can be prepared for a single purchase order. The system determines which purchase order lines should be added to the prepared purchase receipt or AP bill depending on the status of the '''Completed''' and '''Closed''' check boxes in each line, as follows:[anchor|#_754bdfa6-cfdc-49aa-b7a9-0552abda029e]
*Completed purchase order lines are not added to the purchase receipt.
*Closed lines are added to neither purchase receipts nor AP bills.

If all purchase order lines have the '''Completed''' check box selected, and at least one line still has the '''Closed''' check box cleared, the purchase order is assigned the ''Completed'' status. If all purchase order lines have the '''Completed''' and '''Closed''' check boxes selected, the purchase order is assigned the ''Closed'' status.

If the  Subaccounts  feature is     enabled in your system, the system also inserts the subaccount, which is composed as defined by     the  Combine COGS / Expense Sub From  setting of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) Posting Classes (IN206000) form, in the  Sub.  column of the        ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form.  Accounts and subaccounts are used for processing  Non-Stock  lines as follows: When a purchase order is created, the item amount is recorded to the Expense account (with      the Expense subaccount). When a purchase receipt linked to the purchase order is released, the line amount is moved      from the Expense account (with the Expense subaccount) to the PO Accrual account (with the PO      Accrual subaccount). When a bill is created for the receipt, the amount is moved back from the PO Accrual account      (with the PO Accrual subaccount) to the Expense account (with the Expense subaccount). The Expense and PO Accrual accounts to be used for receipt-related transactions are defined by     the posting class of the item on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) Posting Classes (IN206000) form; the     default accounts assigned to the item on the  GL Accounts  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items form will be used if the posting class's  Use COGS /      Expense Account From  and  Use PO Accrual Account From      settings have the  Inventory Item  option selected. The Expense subaccount and PO Accrual     subaccount are also defined by the settings of posting class of the item; the default     subaccounts assigned to the item on the  GL Accounts  tab will be used as     the segment value sources for the resulting subaccounts based on the  Combine COGS /      Expense Sub From  and  Combine PO Accrual Sub From  rules. For     more information, see  Posting Classes in Inventory. Rules for Closing and Completing Non-Stock Lines The way the lines of the  Non-Stock  type are completed and closed depends on the     completion rule specified for the applicable non-stock item in the  Complete PO      Line  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form. The system     determines if a line of the  Non-Stock  type should be closed and completed by using the     following rules:  If  By Quantity  is selected in the  Complete PO Line  box for the      item (the default option for non-stock items of the  Non-Stock Item  type), the purchase      order line is considered completed in either of the following cases: If the sum of the received quantity for the released purchase receipts prepared for the        line is equal to or greater than the quantity of the purchase order line *         ( Complete On % /100) On release of the purchase receipt prepared for the line if the user has selected the          Completed  check box manually With the  By Quantity  completion rule selected for the item, the line is       considered closed on release of the purchase receipt or AP bill if the sum of the received       quantity for all released purchase receipts prepared for this line is equal to the line       quantity in all released AP bills prepared for this line, and the quantity in the AP bill       lines is equal to or greater than purchase order line quantity * ( Complete On        % /100). The line is also considered closed on release of the purchase receipt or       AP bill if the sum of the received quantity for all released purchase receipts prepared for       this line is equal to the line quantity in all released AP bills prepared for this line, and       the user has selected the  Completed  check box manually in the purchase       receipt line.  If  By Amount  is selected in the  Complete PO Line  box for the      item (the default option for non-stock items of the  Labor, Service, Charge , and        Expense  types), the purchase order line is considered completed in either of the      following cases: Automatically if the system has closed the line (that is, if the          Closed  check box is selected) On release of the purchase receipt prepared for the line if the user has selected the          Completed  check box manually With the  By Quantity  completion rule selected for the item, the line is       considered closed on release of the purchase receipt or AP bill if the sum of received       quantity for all released purchase receipts prepared for this line is equal to the  quantity       in all released AP bills prepared for this line, and if the amount in the AP bill lines is       equal to or greater than the amount of the purchase order line. If a user processes the lines of a purchase order partially, multiple related purchase     receipts and AP bills can be prepared for a single purchase order. The system determines which     purchase order lines should be added to the prepared purchase receipt or AP bill depending on     the status of the  Completed  and  Closed  check boxes     in each line, as follows: Completed purchase order lines are not added to the purchase receipt. Closed lines are added to neither purchase receipts nor AP bills. If all purchase order lines have the  Completed  check box selected, and     at least one line still has the  Closed  check box cleared, the purchase     order is assigned the  Completed  status. If all purchase order lines have the       Completed  and  Closed  check boxes selected, the     purchase order is assigned the  Closed  status. ]]></column>

For each non-stock item, you define whether a purchase receipt is required by selecting or clearing the '''Require Receipt''' check box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. In a purchase order line on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, when you select a non-stock item that does not require receipt, the system inserts ''Service'' as the line type; also, the system inserts the ''Service'' line type in purchase order lines with no item specified. Although the ''Service'' lines are not tracked in inventory and do not require receipt, if you want to list them in purchase receipts for informational purposes, you can configure the system so that these lines are added to purchase receipts.{br}

This topic describes how the system processes ''Service'' lines added to a purchase order, and explains how the lines with these items are completed.{br}{TOC}[anchor|#servlines]
==General Workflow and Related Documents==
 The following diagram illustrates how the ''Service'' lines in purchase orders can be processed depending on the system settings.[anchor|#_5cbad372-ea71-49f0-a976-51e36baa1a61][anchor|#_72644f85-0573-4629-96c9-891ba85ab88d][image:UserGuide/Images/PO_Service_Lines.png|popup|450px]
The remainder of this topic describes in detail the processing steps shown in the diagram and issues related to how this processing unfolds. The processing of the service order consists of the following steps:[anchor|#_8d7c5a90-a14c-4ed8-abd9-78251d245624]
#''Entering a purchase order''
#:You enter a purchase order of the ''Normal'' type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, and you add a ''Service'' line or multiple lines to the order. The reference number for a new purchase order is generated in accordance with the numbering sequence specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form. If the order is created with the ''On Hold'' status, you should clear the '''Hold''' check box for the order to process it further. For details about the settings specified in the purchase order, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_Purchase_Order_Processing|Purchase Order Creation].
#''Conditionally processing ''Service'' lines''
#:The way the system processes ''Service'' lines depends on the state of the '''Process Service Lines from Normal Purchase Orders via Purchase Receipt''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form. 
#:If the check box is cleared (the default setting), processing ''Service'' lines doesn&rsquo;t involve creating a purchase receipt; an AP bill (or multiple bills) has to be created directly from the purchase order (see Step 4). When a user creates a purchase receipt for a purchase order with lines of different types, some of which require receipt and some of which do not require receipt, the system does not copy ''Service'' lines to a purchase receipt that is prepared from this purchase order. Also, in this case, ''Service'' lines cannot be added to the purchase receipt manually.
#''Preparing a purchase receipt (optional)''
#: If the '''Process Service Lines from Normal Purchase Orders via Purchase Receipt''' check box is selected, a purchase receipt is required for the lines of the ''Service'' type. A user creates a purchase receipt from a purchase order by clicking '''Actions &gt; Enter PO Receipt''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form. The prepared purchase receipt is available for reviewing on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form. If the purchase receipt is created with the ''On Hold'' status, you should clear the '''Hold''' check box for the receipt to process it further.
#:As an alternative to creating the purchase receipt while viewing the purchase order, a user can create a new purchase receipt manually and add ''Service'' lines to it by clicking '''Add PO''' or '''Add PO Line''' on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] form and using the dialog box that opens.
#''Preparing an AP bill''
#:You prepare the AP bill by clicking '''Actions &gt; Enter AP Bill''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form. The system brings up the generated AP bill on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form. 

==Processing of the Accounts Payable Bill for the Purchase Order==
The general workflow of processing purchase orders with lines of any type is to process a purchase receipt (if it is needed) before creating an AP bill (see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_scn_Purchase_with_Receipt|Purchase with Receipt Before Billing] for details). However, if you receive bills from a particular vendor before the ordered items are received to inventory, you can configure this vendor so that for the purchase orders of this vendor, you can create and process an AP bill before the purchase receipt is released. {br}

To do this, you need to select the '''Allow AP Bill Before Receipt''' check box in the vendor settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form; in addition, you can select this check box for a particular vendor location on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_10|Vendor Locations] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303010|AP303010]) form. The state of this check box is copied to each purchase order created for this vendor, and can be reviewed on the '''Other Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. For a detailed description on how to process a purchase order with the associated bill being prepared before the receipt, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_scn_Purchase_with_Bill_Before_Receipt|Purchase with Billing Before Receipt].
==Posting Accounts for Service Lines==
When you add a ''Service'' line to a purchase order on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, in the '''Account''' column, the system inserts the expense account defined by the '''Use COGS / Expense Account''' setting of the posting class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) form. If the'' Subaccounts'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, in the '''Sub.''' column of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form, the system inserts the subaccount composed as defined by the '''Combine COGS / Expense Sub From''' setting of the posting class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) form. 
==Rules for Closing and Completing Service Lines==
The way the lines of the ''Service'' type (including the ''Service'' lines with the '''Inventory ID''' column empty) are completed and closed depends on whether the service lines are processed through receipts, and on the completion rule specified for each non-stock item in the '''Complete PO Line''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. ((({S:Hint}If you change the '''Complete PO Line''' setting for a non-stock item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form, the system does not change this setting for already existing purchase orders; the newly specified setting applies to new purchase orders only. Existing purchase orders will be billed with the settings that were specified when the order was entered.
)))
The system determines if a line of the ''Service'' type should be closed and completed by using the following rules: [anchor|#_88f1e6e2-f406-4a14-8465-5748e51cfe98]
*If the ''Service'' line is processed through a receipt and ''By Amount'' is selected in the '''Complete PO Line''' box for an item, the line is completed automatically when the line is closed or on release of the purchase receipt if the user has selected the '''Completed''' check box manually. The line is closed in either of the following cases: 
**When a purchase receipt for the line is released if a user has selected the '''Complete PO Line''' check box manually in the purchase receipt line on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form.
**When an AP bill for the line is released if the billed quantity for all bills that have been released for this line is equal to or greater than the amount of the purchase order line.
*If the ''Service'' line is processed through a receipt and ''By Quantity'' is selected in the '''Complete PO Line''' box for an item, the line is closed when an AP bill for the line is released if the sum of the line quantities in all released bills for this line is equal to or greater than the quantity of the purchase order line &#42; ('''Complete On %'''/100). The line is completed in the following cases:
**Automatically if the system has closed the line (that is, if the '''Closed''' check box is selected)
**On release of the purchase receipt prepared for the line if the user has selected the '''Completed''' check box manually
**If the sum of the received quantity for the released purchase receipts prepared for the line is equal to or greater than the quantity of the purchase order line &#42; ('''Complete On %'''/100)
*If the ''Service'' line is processed without a receipt and ''By Amount'' is selected in the '''Complete PO Line''' box for the line item, the line is closed on release of the AP bill if the billed amount for all released bills for this line is equal to or greater than the amount of the purchase order line. The line is completed automatically when it is closed.
*If the ''Service'' line is processed without a receipt and ''By Quantity'' is selected in the '''Complete PO Line''' box for the line item, the line is closed on release of the AP bill if the sum of the quantities in released bills for this line is equal to or greater than the quantity of the purchase order line &#42; ('''Complete On %'''/100). The line is completed automatically when it is closed.

If a user processes the lines of a purchase order partially, multiple related purchase receipts and AP bills can be prepared for a single purchase order. The system determines which purchase order lines should be added to the prepared purchase receipt or AP bill depending on the status of the '''Completed''' and '''Closed''' check boxes in each line, as follows:[anchor|#_7aed7b2c-e176-4580-9d67-86bb979340fb]
*Completed purchase order lines are not added to the purchase receipt.
*Closed lines are added to neither purchase receipts nor AP bills.

If all purchase order lines have the '''Completed''' check box selected, and at least one line still has the '''Closed''' check box cleared, the purchase order is assigned the ''Completed'' status. If all purchase order lines have the '''Completed''' and '''Closed''' check boxes selected, the purchase order is assigned the ''Closed'' status.

The system       brings up the generated AP bill on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000) form.       Processing of the Accounts Payable Bill for the Purchase Order The general workflow of processing purchase orders with lines of any type is to process a     purchase receipt (if it is needed) before creating an AP bill (see  Purchase with Receipt Before Billing for details). However, if you receive bills     from a particular vendor before the ordered items are received to inventory, you can configure     this vendor so that for the purchase orders of this vendor, you can create and process an AP     bill before the purchase receipt is released.  To do this, you need to select the  Allow AP Bill Before Receipt  check     box in the vendor settings on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors (AP303000) form; in addition,     you can select this check box for a particular vendor location on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303010|AP303010]) Vendor Locations (AP303010) form. The state of this check box is copied to each     purchase order created for this vendor, and can be reviewed on the  Other      Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form. For a     detailed description on how to process a purchase order with the associated bill being prepared     before the receipt, see  Purchase with Billing Before Receipt. Posting Accounts for Service Lines When you add a  Service  line to a purchase order on the  Document      Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form, in the       Account  column, the system inserts the expense account defined by the       Use COGS / Expense Account  setting of the posting class on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) Posting Classes (IN206000) form. If the  Subaccounts  feature is enabled on the        ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, in the  Sub.  column of     the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form, the system inserts the subaccount composed as defined     by the  Combine COGS / Expense Sub From  setting of the posting class on     the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) Posting Classes (IN206000) form.  Rules for Closing and Completing Service Lines The way the lines of the  Service  type (including the  Service  lines with the            Inventory ID  column empty) are completed and closed depends on         whether the service lines are processed through receipts, and on the completion rule         specified for each non-stock item in the  Complete PO Line  box on the             ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form.  If you change the  Complete PO Line  setting for a non-stock item         on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items form, the system does not change this setting for         already existing purchase orders; the newly specified setting applies to new purchase orders         only. Existing purchase orders will be billed with the settings that were specified when the         order was entered. The system determines if a line of the  Service  type should be closed and completed         by using the following rules:  If the  Service  line is processed through a receipt and  By Amount  is           selected in the  Complete PO Line  box for an item, the line is           completed automatically when the line is closed or on release of the purchase receipt if           the user has selected the  Completed  check box manually. The line is           closed in either of the following cases:  When a purchase receipt for the line is released if a user has selected the                  Complete PO Line  check box manually in the purchase receipt               line on the  Document Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form. When an AP bill for the line is released if the billed quantity for all bills that               have been released for this line is equal to or greater than the amount of the               purchase order line. If the  Service  line is processed through a receipt and  By Quantity  is           selected in the  Complete PO Line  box for an item, the line is           closed when an AP bill for the line is released if the sum of the line quantities in all           released bills for this line is equal to or greater than the quantity of the purchase           order line * ( Complete On % /100). The line is completed in the           following cases: Automatically if the system has closed the line (that is, if the                  Closed  check box is selected) On release of the purchase receipt prepared for the line if the user has selected               the  Completed  check box manually If the sum of the received quantity for the released purchase receipts prepared for               the line is equal to or greater than the quantity of the purchase order line *                 ( Complete On % /100) If the  Service  line is processed without a receipt and  By Amount  is           selected in the  Complete PO Line  box for the line item, the line is           closed on release of the AP bill if the billed amount for all released bills for this line           is equal to or greater than the amount of the purchase order line. The line is completed           automatically when it is closed. If the  Service  line is processed without a receipt and  By Quantity  is           selected in the  Complete PO Line  box for the line item, the line is           closed on release of the AP bill if the sum of the quantities in released bills for this           line is equal to or greater than the quantity of the purchase order line *             ( Complete On % /100). The line is completed automatically when it           is closed. If a user processes the lines of a purchase order partially, multiple related purchase         receipts and AP bills can be prepared for a single purchase order. The system determines         which purchase order lines should be added to the prepared purchase receipt or AP bill         depending on the status of the  Completed  and            Closed  check boxes in each line, as follows: Completed purchase order lines are not added to the purchase receipt. Closed lines are added to neither purchase receipts nor AP bills. If all purchase order lines have the  Completed  check box selected,         and at least one line still has the  Closed  check box cleared, the         purchase order is assigned the  Completed  status. If all purchase order lines have the            Completed  and  Closed  check boxes selected,         the purchase order is assigned the  Closed  status. ]]></column>

A purchase receipt is used to track the one-time receipt of goods purchased from a single vendor. The purchase receipt can be linked to a purchase order (or to multiple orders) to verify purchase order fulfillment, or the purchase receipt can be processed independently without being linked to any purchase orders. {br}

This topic describes the possible ways you can create purchase receipts. For the general workflow of processing purchase receipts in Acumatica ERP, see the topics of the [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_Purchase_Order_Processing|Purchase Order Creation] section. {br}{TOC}
==Creating a Purchase Receipt Based on a Purchase Order==
If purchase orders are involved in your purchasing workflow, you can create a purchase receipt for the goods or services received for this particular purchase order by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Enter PO Receipt''' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. The system opens the created purchase receipt on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, where you can review it.{br}

The lines that appear in a purchase receipt based on a purchase order depend on the line type of each line and on particular system settings that affect line processing. For more details on different types of lines added to purchase receipts, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_LineTypes|Line Types in Purchase Orders]. For a detailed description on processing a purchase order and all related documents, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_Purchase_Order_Processing|Purchase Order Creation].{br}

For each purchase order or purchase order line added to the purchase receipt, the system calculates the quantities of the received goods, and displays this value for each line in the '''Qty. On Receipts''' column on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. If all purchase order lines have been received in full, and if at least one line has not yet been billed in full, the purchase order is assigned the ''Completed'' status.((({S:Hint}For blanket purchase orders, the quantities of items in the '''Qty. On Receipts''' column are updated from the lines of the normal purchase orders linked to these blanket orders. 
)))
==Creating a Direct Purchase Receipt==
You can create a direct purchase receipt and process it without linking it to any purchase order. When goods are received, you create a new purchase receipt document on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form. On the '''Document Details''' tab, you add lines to specify the quantity and additional details of all received goods.{br}

 If lot or serial numbers are tracked for the received items, they may be assigned at the time of receipt if they are configured to do so. To view the assigned lot and serial numbers of the received items, click '''Allocations''' on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab. You can allocate stock items that have the ''Goods for IN'' line type, and lot- or serial-tracked stock items that have the ''Goods for Drop-Ship'' line type and that belong to the lot/serial class for which the '''Required for Drop Shipments''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_70_00|Lot/Serial Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) form.{br}

For detailed instructions on creating and processing a direct purchase receipt, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_scn_Direct_Purchase_Receipt|Purchase with Direct Purchase Receipt].
==Linking Purchase Orders or Their Lines to an Existing Purchase Receipt==
When you receive purchases from a single vendor and create a new purchase receipt on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, you can add an entire purchase order, multiple purchase orders, or particular purchase order lines to this receipt. The lines that can be added to a purchase receipt depend on the line types of these lines and on particular system settings. For more information about which lines are processed through purchase receipts, see the topics of the [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_LineTypes|Line Types in Purchase Orders] part.{br}

Purchase receipts can be linked to only normal or drop-ship purchase orders; see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_Types_of_Purchase_Orders|Types of Purchase Orders] for details about these and other purchase order types. 
==Consolidating Multiple Purchase Orders into a Single Purchase Receipt==
For a new purchase receipt that you have created by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, you can add multiple purchase orders of the same vendor. You can add an entire purchase order or individual purchase order lines. The lines that can be added to a purchase receipt depend on the line types of these lines and on particular system settings. For more information about which lines are processed through purchase receipts, see the topics of the [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_LineTypes|Line Types in Purchase Orders] part.{br}

Purchase receipts can be linked to only normal or drop-ship purchase orders; see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_Types_of_Purchase_Orders|Types of Purchase Orders] for details about these and other purchase order types. 
==Assigning Purchase Receipts for Processing==
You may need to distribute receipts among employees for processing. To enable automatic assignment of receipts based on the receipt properties, you can create an assignment map by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_55_00|Assignment and Approval Maps] ([~/?ScreenId=EP205500|EP205500]) form and specify the map in the '''Receipt Assignment Map''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form. Then when a new receipt is created, it will be automatically assigned to the appropriate employee for processing.

When you process a purchase of stock items by using the purchase order or purchase receipt as a starting point, the AP bills generated based on these documents are automatically linked to the related purchase documents.

Stock and non-stock items may be listed in a bill. When you add a stock item to a bill, the system displays a message that warns you that the line must be linked to a purchase receipt before the bill can be released. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] form, you must link each line of a bill with a stock item to a line of a released purchase receipt. If the bill includes non-stock items, you also may link the lines with non-stock items to the lines of released purchase receipts or open purchase orders, depending on the type of non-stock items. {br}

==Notes About the Procedure==[anchor|#_3120d1a2-56e5-4a2a-81f0-1c7f17b28fbc]
The notes in this section describe the nuances of the UI elements available on the form, such as when an element is required and when it is not, and when the system fills in settings by default. This section can include other notes.{br}

Note the following about adding purchase orders to AP bills:[anchor|#ul_lqk_24v_tz]
*You can consolidate the lines of multiple purchase orders of one vendor into one bill.
*The system adds lines of a purchase order to the bill depending on the '''Allows AP Bill Before Receipt''' setting specified for the purchase order on the '''Other Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. If the check box is cleared, only unbilled lines with the ''Service'' line type are added to the bill. If the check box is selected, all unbilled lines are added to the bill.
*Information about the related documents appears for each linked line of the bill on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form (in the '''PO Type''', '''PO Number''', '''PO Receipt Nbr.''', and '''PO Receipt Line''' columns). Until the bill is released, you can cancel the established links and link the bill lines to other documents if needed.

The purchase price variance (PPV) amount is the difference between an item&rsquo;s actual unit cost on a purchase receipt (calculated as the item extended cost divided by its quantity) and its actual unit cost on a bill (calculated as the extended cost divided by the quantity on the bill) multiplied by the quantity of the item on the bill. ((({S:Hint} In Acumatica ERP, on purchase orders, purchase receipts, inventory receipts, and bills, the purchase prices of items are referred to as ''costs''. 
)))
The difference may occur due to various reasons, such as exchange rate fluctuations or unplanned changes in the vendor price or delivery costs. Different businesses may use different approaches when accounting for the purchase price variance amounts. The topic describes the options available in Acumatica ERP for allocation of the purchase price variance amounts for stock items.{br}{TOC}
==PPV Calculation==
 Generally, the actual vendor prices and discounts may change frequently, and when you enter a purchase receipt on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form and specify an item by its inventory ID, the exact vendor price and applicable discounts are not known. Even if the unit cost appears automatically in the '''Unit Cost''' column, you can manually enter only the item quantity and the extended cost (which may include the vendor&rsquo;s current promotional price and discount for the specified quantity not yet configured in the system); the extended cost will not be recalculated based on the unit cost. For the PPV calculation, the system will use the actual unit cost (calculated as the extended amount per unit), not the unit cost that is available in the system and was inserted automatically. {br}

When you enter a related bill by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form, you know the prices and any additional costs, and you can reflect them on the bill. On release of a bill that is linked to the purchase receipt, the system calculates the purchase price variance amount for each line item as follows:[anchor|#ul_hnx_yfs_4t]
* Calculates the unit&rsquo;s actual cost on the purchase receipt as the extended cost on the purchase receipt divided by the quantity
* Calculates the unit&rsquo;s actual cost on the bill as the extended cost on the bill divided by the quantity on the bill
* Subtracts the unit&rsquo;s actual cost on the bill from the unit&rsquo;s actual cost on the receipt
* Multiplies the difference by the quantity on the bill

For example, the following documents (a purchase receipt and the AP bill linked to the receipt) were entered into the system.[anchor|#table_kry_w4s_4t]
===Receipt Details===
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|-

!width="33%" ! Extended Cost
|- 
| New Item1

| 2000
|- 
| New Item2
| 30
| 9900
|}{br}

The PPV amounts are calculated as follows:[anchor|#table_wth_gqs_4t]
===PPV Calculation===
{| class="checklist" | width="100%"

!width="33%" ! Item

!width="33%" ! PPV
|- 
| New Item1
| 10
| 250
|- 
| New Item2
| 30
| -900
|}
The ways the calculated PPV amounts can be allocated depend on the item valuation method and the selected allocation mode and are described in the following sections.
==PPV Allocation for Exchange Rate Changes==
By default, in a purchase receipt, the system inserts the currency rate that is current on the purchase receipt date. If needed, you can override the default currency rate if all of the following are true:[anchor|#_4917e597-18d0-4813-a652-0f68e58d618a]
*The ''Multi-Currency Accounting'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
*The '''Change Currency Rate on Receipt''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form.
*The '''Enable Rate Override''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form for the vendor specified in the purchase receipt.

The system will use the new exchange rate for calculating the unit cost of the items in the inventory receipt that it creates on release of the current purchase receipt. {br}

On release of an AP bill that is linked to this purchase receipt, the system calculates the purchase price variance amount for each line item as follows:[anchor|#_083759b9-30af-4012-8934-821fb782dd0e]
*Calculates the unit&rsquo;s actual cost on the purchase receipt based on the exchange rate of the purchase receipt
* Calculates the unit&rsquo;s actual cost on the bill based on the exchange rate of the bill
* Subtracts the unit&rsquo;s actual cost on the bill from the unit&rsquo;s actual cost on the receipt
* Multiplies the difference by the quantity on the bill

==PPV Allocation for Items with Standard Costs==
For stock items with ''Standard'' assigned as the cost valuation method on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, any PPV amounts are allocated to the Purchase Price Variance account defined by the posting class of the item. For more information, see the '''Standard Cost Valuation Method''' section of the [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Item_Costs_and_Valuation_Methods|Item Costs and Valuation Methods] topic.
==PPV Allocation Modes for Items with Other Valuation Methods==
In Acumatica ERP, you can select how you want to process the purchase price variance amounts for stock items with the following valuation methods: ''Average'', ''FIFO'', or ''Specific''. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form, you can select one of the following modes of PPV allocation:[anchor|#ul_l14_yys_hs]
*''Inventory Account'': To record the variance to the inventory accounts to update the item costs. If you select this mode, you also need to select the reason code (in the adjacent box) that will provide the expense accounts and subaccounts used for the allocation of the PPV amounts.
*''Purchase Price Variance Account'': To record any variance amounts to the purchase price variance accounts to be further processed as additional expenses. 

The modes of PPV allocation are discussed in detail in the sections below.
==The Inventory Account Mode of PPV Allocation==
If the ''Inventory Account'' mode is selected as the mode of PPV allocation, on release of a bill, an inventory adjustment for the PPV amounts is generated automatically. You can view the reference number of the adjustment in the '''PPV Ref. Nbr.''' column on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] form.{br}

Consider a few scenarios that may occur with a received stock item (with no lot or serial numbers) when the bill is released:[anchor|#ul_iq1_trt_hs]
*If no units of the item have been issued from a warehouse since the item was received, this adjustment debits the inventory account of the item for the positive variance amount and credits the PO Accrual account (or credits the inventory account for the negative amount and debits the PO Accrual account for the same amount). See [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_PPV_Scenario1|Purchase Price Variance Allocation: Example 1].
*If all the units of the item have been issued from a warehouse before the bill has been created and an adjustment has been generated, this adjustment debits the variance amount to the expense account associated with the reason code. 
*If some (but not all) of the units of the item have been issued from the warehouse, the adjustment distributes the variance amount proportionally between the quantity of units issued and the quantity of units still in the warehouse, and allocates the respective amounts to the expense account (associated with the reason code) and to the inventory account. For details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_PPV_Scenario2|Purchase Price Variance Allocation: Example 2].
*:((({S:Hint}If multiple bills are created for partial quantities of items from a receipt and certain quantities of the items (from that receipt) have been issued from the warehouse, the PPV amounts on each adjustment generated for a partial bill are allocated between the inventory accounts and the expense accounts in the same proportion in which the original quantities from the receipt are distributed between the quantities issued and the quantities still in stock.
)))
((({S:Hint}If a PPV adjustment would result in negative balance of the inventory account, the adjustment amount is posted to the expense account. 
)))
If you need to reverse the bill linked to the receipt, you can do this only if the adjustment has been released. On reversal of the bill, no new adjustment is created to revert the original adjustment—the original adjustment remains in the system. If you then create a second bill for the same purchase receipt, the system generates a new adjustment that adjusts the first (original) adjustment.
==The Purchase Price Variance Account Mode of PPV Allocation==
If ''Purchase Price Variance Account'' is selected as the mode of PPV allocation, on release of a bill, the entire PPV amount is recorded to the Purchase Price Variance account defined by the posting class of the item.

The type of purchasing transaction for which a buyer pays at the time of delivery is generally referred to as ''cash on delivery (COD)'' or, because other methods of payment besides cash might be involved, ''collect on delivery (COD)''. Acumatica ERP provides you with functionality that you can use to account for payments made on delivery. {br}

This topic describes the basic workflow when you process a purchase order to be paid on delivery.
==Basic Process==
To process a purchase order that will be paid on delivery, you perform the following general steps:[anchor|#ol_zqc_nxg_bq]
#''Create a purchase order.''
#:On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, create a purchase order. Select the vendor, and provide all the required details about the goods and services to be purchased. Save the order. 
#:((({S:Hint}Depending on your company&rsquo;s policies, additional steps might follow the creation of the purchase order—for instance, for approval of the order.
)))
#''Create a prepayment request linked to the purchase order.''
#:While you are viewing the purchase order, on the '''Actions''' menu, select ''Create Prepayment''. The system opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form, with information filled in for a new prepayment request from the purchase order; the reference number of the purchase order is shown in the '''Vendor Ref.''' box. Save the prepayment request. For more details, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AP__how_Entering_a_Prepayment|To Enter a Prepayment]. Release the prepayment request.
#:((({S:Hint}An unreleased prepayment request is synchronized with a purchase order as follows: If you edit the details of the purchase order, the prepayment request is changed accordingly.
)))
#:Open the purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, and make sure that the reference number of the prepayment request is shown in the '''Prepayment Ref. Nbr.''' box. 
#''Prepare an AP check''.
#:On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form, open the prepayment request, and click ''Pay Bill/Apply Adjustment'' on the '''Actions''' menu. This action opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_20_00|Checks and Payments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP302000|AP302000]) form with information filled in for a new AP check, which is ready to be saved. Save and release the check. For more details, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AP__how_Creating_an_AP_Check|To Create an Accounts Payable Check].
#''Create a receipt for the purchase order''.
#:Once the goods are received and payment is made, you can create a receipt in either of the following ways:
#*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form, open the original purchase order. On the''' Actions''' menu, select '''Create Receipt'''. This opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] form with a ready-to-save receipt.
#*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] form, specify the vendor, and on the table toolbar of the '''Details''' tab, click '''Add PO'''. Select the original purchase order to add to the receipt. 
#:Save the receipt.
#''Release the receipt.''
#: On release of the receipt, the system generates an AP bill, applies prepayment to the purchase order, and changes the status of the purchase order to ''Closed''.

 Acumatica ERP supports four purchase order types: normal, drop ship, blanket, and standard. For all these types, the same set of statuses is used; however, different processing steps can be configured for purchase orders of different types. {br}

The purchasing process usually starts when you create a purchase order in Acumatica ERP on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. You can add goods to the purchase order and specify the details for each line. The system changes the status of the purchase order during its processing. {br}

The following table describes each of the possible statuses and the ways they fit into purchase order processing; the statuses are listed in the order in which they occur, if applicable. [anchor|#table_cpp_fxt_mt]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="20%" ! Status
!width="80%" ! Description
|- 
| ''On Hold''
| 
A newly created purchase order that does not originate from a change order has a status of ''On Hold''. The system may also assign the purchase order this status if it has been rejected by the person assigned to approve it or if you have selected the '''Hold''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form. The purchase order can be left on hold for future editing, including the addition or removal of lines.{br}

If a purchase order has a line related to a project with the change order workflow enabled, you can select the '''Hold''' check box only if the purchase order has the ''Rejected'' status. You cannot select the '''Hold''' check box for a purchase order that has at least one related change order. For more information about change orders, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__con_Change_Management|Change Management].{br}

When a purchase order is on hold, its totals and quantities of listed goods are not traced or checked. To move the ''On Hold ''purchase order to the next step in its processing and change its status, you clear the '''Hold''' check box. You can turn on the validation of totals for purchase orders of specific types by selecting the relevant check boxes in the '''Validate Total on Entry''' section on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form. This validation (if it is turned on for purchase orders of the specific type) is performed when you clear the '''Hold''' check box for the order.{br}

 Whether or not validation is performed, when you clear this check box, the system changes the status of the purchase order to ''Pending Approval'', ''Pending Printing'', ''Pending Email'', or ''Open'', depending on the purchase order approval rules specified in the system and your required processing steps.
|- 
| ''Pending Approval''
| 
Depending on your organization&rsquo;s approval rules for purchase orders as defined in Acumatica ERP, the status of a purchase order might be changed to ''Pending Approval'' after the '''Hold''' check box has been cleared. This status indicates that the purchase order requires approval. This status remains until all required approvals have been performed.{br}

To approve a purchase order with this status, an authorized user selects '''Actions''' > '''Approve''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form. When the user performing the last (or only) required approval invokes this action, the system changes its status to ''Pending Printing'', ''Pending Email'', or ''Open''.{br}

To reject a purchase order with this status, an authorized user selects '''Actions''' > '''Reject''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form. When this user invokes this action, the system changes its status to ''Rejected''.
|- 
| ''Rejected''
| 
Depending on your organization&rsquo;s approval rules for purchase orders as defined in Acumatica ERP, the status of a purchase order might be changed to ''Rejected'' after an employee who was assigned to approve the purchase order has rejected it.{br}

You can save a purchase order with the ''Rejected'' status with the ''On Hold'' status for further editing by selecting the '''Hold''' check box.
|- 
| ''Pending Printing''
| 
Printing a purchase order is an optional step in purchase order processing that is performed if the vendor prefers to receive printed purchase orders by fax or postal mail. Depending on the vendor settings, the status of the purchase order may be changed to ''Pending Printing'' from ''On Hold'' or ''Pending Approval'' to ''Pending Printing''. To require printing in the purchase order processing steps for a particular vendor, you select the '''Print Order''' check box on the '''Purchase Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form. The '''Printed''' check box on the '''Other Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form shows whether the order has been printed.{br}

A newly created purchase order that originates from a change order is assigned the ''Pending Printing'' status if the vendor&rsquo;s settings require the printing of purchase orders. The system also assigns the ''Pending Printing'' status to a purchase order if the vendor&rsquo;s settings require the printing of purchase orders and the purchase order, which had the ''Open'' status, has been changed by means of change orders.{br}

The ''Pending Printing'' status indicates that an employee must print the purchase order and then send or fax it to the vendor. To print the purchase order, you select '''Reports''' > '''Print Purchase Order''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form. This changes the status of the purchase order to ''Pending Email'' or ''Open''.
|- 
| ''Pending Emai''l
| 
Emailing a purchase order to the vendor is an optional step in purchase order processing that is performed if the vendor prefers to receive purchase orders by email. Depending on the vendor settings, the status of the purchase order may be changed to ''Pending Email'' from ''On Hold'', ''Pending Approval'', or ''Pending Printing''. To require emailing in the purchase order processing steps for a particular vendor, select the '''Email Order''' check box on the '''Purchase Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] form. The '''Emailed''' check box on the '''Other Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form shows whether the order has been emailed.{br}

A newly created purchase order that originates from a change order is assigned the ''Pending Email'' status if the vendor&rsquo;s settings require the emailing of purchase orders. The system also assigns the ''Pending Email'' status to a purchase order if the vendor&rsquo;s settings require the emailing of purchase orders and the purchase order, which had the ''Open'' status, has been changed by means of change orders.{br}

When a purchase order has the ''Pending Email'' status, the purchase order must be sent by email to the vendor. To complete this step, you select '''Actions''' > '''Email Purchase Order''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form. This changes the order status to ''Open''.
|- 
| ''Canceled''
| 
The status of the purchase order is changed to ''Canceled'' if the purchase order has been canceled by a user selecting '''Actions''' > '''Cancel Order''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form. This status means the purchase order cannot be edited, and no receipts can be created for it.{br}

The canceled purchase order keeps this status unless you change the status to ''On Hold'' by selecting the '''Hold''' check box for it. If the status is changed to ''On Hold'', the document can be edited, and the usual purchase order processing steps can be performed.
|- 
| ''Open''
| 
The status of the purchase order is changed to ''Open'' after any necessary approvals and any other required processing steps (printing the order, emailing it, or both) have been performed for the purchase order. If no approvals or optional processing steps are required, the status of the purchase order changes from ''On Hold'' to ''Open'' when the '''Hold''' check box is cleared.{br}

A newly created purchase order that originates from a change order is assigned the ''Open'' status if the vendor&rsquo;s settings do not require the printing or emailing of purchase orders.{br}

The ''Open'' status means that the quantity of the items on purchase receipts for this purchase order is less than the quantity required to complete the purchase order. In Acumatica ERP, you create the receipts for the ordered and received items by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form.{br}

When a purchase order has the ''Open'' status, the system traces the quantities of items received for the order and displays the item availability information on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_20_00|Inventory Allocation Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) form in accordance with the availability calculation rule assigned to the item class to which the item belongs. This rule is specified for the item class in the '''Availability Calculation Rule''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form.
|- 
| ''Closed''
| 
The status of the purchase order is changed from ''Open'' to ''Closed'' after all the lines of the order have been completed according to the appropriate rules or manually. Also, you can manually complete the order by selecting '''Actions''' > '''Complete Order''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form.{br}

The          purchase order can be left on hold for future editing, including the addition or removal of          lines. If a purchase order has a line related to a project with the change order workflow          enabled, you can select the  Hold  check box only if the purchase          order has the  Rejected  status. You cannot select the  Hold           check box for a purchase order that has at least one related change order. For more          information about change orders, see  Change Management. When a purchase order is on hold, its totals and quantities of listed goods are not          traced or checked. To move the  On Hold  purchase order to the next step in its          processing and change its status, you clear the  Hold  check box. You          can turn on the validation of totals for purchase orders of specific types by selecting the          relevant check boxes in the  Validate Total on Entry  section on the             ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) Purchase Orders Preferences (PO101000) form. This validation (if it is turned on          for purchase orders of the specific type) is performed when you clear the            Hold  check box for the order.  Whether or not validation is performed, when you clear this check box, the system          changes the status of the purchase order to  Pending Approval ,  Pending           Printing ,  Pending Email , or  Open , depending on the purchase order          approval rules specified in the system and your required processing steps. Pending Approval Depending on your organization's approval rules for purchase orders as defined in  Acumatica ERP, the status of a purchase order might be changed to  Pending Approval  after the            Hold  check box has been cleared. This status indicates that the          purchase order requires approval. This status remains until all required approvals have          been performed. To approve a purchase order with this status, an authorized user selects  Actions Approve  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form. When the          user performing the last (or only) required approval invokes this action, the system          changes its status to  Pending Printing ,  Pending Email , or  Open . To reject a purchase order with this status, an authorized user selects  Actions Reject  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form. When this          user invokes this action, the system changes its status to  Rejected . Rejected Depending on your organization's approval rules for purchase orders as defined in  Acumatica ERP, the status of a purchase order might be changed to  Rejected  after an employee          who was assigned to approve the purchase order has rejected it. You can save a purchase order with the  Rejected  status with the  On Hold           status for further editing by selecting the  Hold  check box. Pending Printing Printing a purchase order is an optional step in purchase order processing that is          performed if the vendor prefers to receive printed purchase orders by fax or postal mail.          Depending on the vendor settings, the status of the purchase order may be changed to            Pending Printing  from  On Hold  or  Pending Approval  to  Pending           Printing . To require printing in the purchase order processing steps for a particular          vendor, you select the  Print Order  check box on the            Purchase Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors (AP303000) form. The  Printed  check box on the            Other Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form          shows whether the order has been printed. A newly created purchase order that originates from a change order is assigned the            Pending Printing  status if the vendor's settings require the printing of purchase          orders. The system also assigns the  Pending Printing  status to a purchase order if          the vendor's settings require the printing of purchase orders and the purchase order, which          had the  Open  status, has been changed by means of change orders. The  Pending Printing  status indicates that an employee must print the purchase          order and then send or fax it to the vendor. To print the purchase order, you select  Reports Print Purchase Order  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form. This          changes the status of the purchase order to  Pending Email  or  Open . Pending Emai l Emailing a purchase order to the vendor is an optional step in purchase order processing          that is performed if the vendor prefers to receive purchase orders by email. Depending on          the vendor settings, the status of the purchase order may be changed to  Pending           Email  from  On Hold ,  Pending Approval , or  Pending Printing . To          require emailing in the purchase order processing steps for a particular vendor, select the            Email Order  check box on the  Purchase           Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors form. The            Emailed  check box on the  Other Information           tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form shows whether the order has been          emailed. A newly created purchase order that originates from a change order is assigned the            Pending Email  status if the vendor's settings require the emailing of purchase          orders. The system also assigns the  Pending Email  status to a purchase order if the          vendor's settings require the emailing of purchase orders and the purchase order, which had          the  Open  status, has been changed by means of change orders. When a purchase order has the  Pending Email  status, the purchase order must be          sent by email to the vendor. To complete this step, you select  Actions Email Purchase Order  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form. This          changes the order status to  Open . Canceled The status of the purchase order is changed to  Canceled  if the purchase order has          been canceled by a user selecting  Actions Cancel Order  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form. This status          means the purchase order cannot be edited, and no receipts can be created for it. The canceled purchase order keeps this status unless you change the status to  On           Hold  by selecting the  Hold  check box for it. If the status is          changed to  On Hold , the document can be edited, and the usual purchase order          processing steps can be performed. Open The status of the purchase order is changed to  Open  after any necessary approvals          and any other required processing steps (printing the order, emailing it, or both) have          been performed for the purchase order. If no approvals or optional processing steps are          required, the status of the purchase order changes from  On Hold  to  Open  when          the  Hold  check box is cleared. A newly created purchase order that originates from a change order is assigned the            Open  status if the vendor's settings do not require the printing or emailing of          purchase orders. The  Open  status means that the quantity of the items on purchase receipts for this          purchase order is less than the quantity required to complete the purchase order. In  Acumatica ERP, you create the receipts for the ordered and received items by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form. When a purchase order has the  Open  status, the system traces the quantities of          items received for the order and displays the item availability information on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) Inventory Allocation Details (IN402000) form in accordance with the availability          calculation rule assigned to the item class to which the item belongs. This rule is          specified for the item class in the  Availability Calculation Rule           box on the  General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000) form. Closed The status of the purchase order is changed from  Open  to  Closed  after all          the lines of the order have been completed according to the appropriate rules or manually.          Also, you can manually complete the order by selecting  Actions Complete Order  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form.

In most cases, the purchasing process is completed when goods are received, and Accounts Payable bills are released to adjust your outstanding balance with the vendor. In some cases, however, items that have been delivered in an unsatisfactory condition or shipped by mistake should be returned to the vendor for replacement or reimbursement. Also, services that were not rendered or were provided partially should be reimbursed.{br}

This topic describes the general workflow of processing purchase returns in Acumatica ERP. {br}{TOC}
==Processing a Purchase Return==
To process a vendor return, you create a document of the ''Return'' type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form. You can select particular lines of the needed purchase receipt and create a return with these items. Alternatively, you can create a new purchase return and add any number of purchase receipts or individual purchase receipt lines to it by clicking '''Add PR''' or '''Add PR Line''' on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab. In the added lines, you can change the quantity of items to be returned.{br}

You can create purchase returns for purchase receipts, whether or not they are linked to a purchase order. For lines that are linked to a purchase order, you can select the '''Open PO Line''' check box in purchase return lines on the '''Document Details''' tab to specify that the system should change the status of the related purchase order to ''Open'' on release of the return (if you want to keep the purchase order open until the replacement items are received). If the '''Open PO Line''' check box is cleared, the related purchase order remains closed.{br}

You can process returns for purchase receipt lines with stock and non-stock items. For stock items, you must specify the warehouse and warehouse location from which the items will be issued to be sent back to the vendor. For items with lot or serial numbers, you can click '''Allocations''' on the table toolbar of the '''Document Details''' tab to specify these numbers for the returned units. For each line in the return receipt, a reason code must be specified. By default, the system specifies the reason code that is selected in the '''PO Return Reason Code''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form. For vendor returns, a reason code with the ''Vendor Return'' usage type should be used.((({S:Hint}For processing returns at the calculated cost, you can also use a reason code with the ''Issue'' usage type, but these reason codes are not applicable for processing returns at the original receipt cost.
)))
When a user processes a purchase return, the related inventory document (inventory adjustment or inventory issue) and accounts payable debit adjustment are generated. On release of the inventory document, the quantities of returned items are deducted from the item quantities available at the specified warehouse locations. If the purchase receipt for which the return was created is linked to a purchase order, the '''Qty. On Receipts''' in the purchase order is decreased by the quantity of returned items. The further processing of returns depends on the agreement between your company and the vendor. You can complete the processing of the return in the Accounts Payable module by processing a vendor refund, or by receiving replacement items for the original purchase order.{br}

When creating a purchase return, you can process the items at the cost that was originally specified in the purchase receipt, or at the cost calculated according to the valuation method of the item. The remaining sections of this topic describe these two processes in more details.
==Processing a Return of Items at the Original Receipt Cost==
The costs of items could change over time. To specify that items should be returned to inventory at exactly the same cost at which the items have been purchased, you need to select the '''Return by Original Receipt Cost''' check box in the purchase return document on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form.{br}

Once the purchase return is released, the system automatically generates an inventory adjustment that includes the stock items and non-stock items requiring receipt. Service lines (that is, lines with non-stock items that do not require receipt) are not included in the inventory adjustment. The reference number of the inventory adjustment generated for the purchase return is shown in the '''IN Ref. Nbr.''' box on the '''Other Information''' tab. The inventory adjustments that are generated for purchase returns are released immediately; when inventory adjustments are released, the availability data for the items in inventory is updated.{br}

For a line with a stock item, the following general ledger transactions are generated on release of an inventory adjustment:[anchor|#_c7d660f9-543c-4959-8d6a-077adda13b4e]
*PO Accrual account and subaccount: Dr, original cost
*Inventory account and subaccount: Cr, original cost

The original cost for stock items is defined by the following rules:[anchor|#_2c8f6a96-cc32-4e96-b778-feafd92f72a8]
*For items with the FIFO valuation method, the system uses the average cost of the cost layer that corresponds to the purchase receipt for which the return is processed.
*For items with the average, specific, and standard valuation methods, the system uses the cost specified in the line of the original inventory receipt or purchase receipt.

The cost adjustments, such as landed costs or purchase price variance are not included in the original cost.{br}

If the '''Create Bill''' check box is selected in the purchase return on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] form, when you release the purchase return, the system generates an accounts payable debit adjustment to the vendor automatically. Otherwise, you need to prepare the bill manually by clicking '''Actions &gt; Enter AP Bill''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] form. The generated AP debit adjustment is available on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form. {br}

The accounts payable debit adjustments are released immediately if the '''Release AP Documents Automatically''' option is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] form; otherwise, you should release these adjustments manually. {br}

On release of a debit adjustment, the following general ledger transactions are generated:[anchor|#_b4394948-f001-4da0-b5d4-a49e69c7fcaf]
*Accounts Payable account and subaccount: Dr, original cost
*PO Accrual account and subaccount: Cr, original cost

For return lines with stock items, on release of the AP debit adjustment prepared for the purchase return, the system records any PO Accrual difference to the Purchase Price Variance account and subaccount that are defined in the posting class of the stock item.
==Processing a Return of Items at the Cost Calculated by the System==
If the '''Return by Original Receipt Cost''' check box is cleared in the purchase return document on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, the system calculates the cost at which the item should be returned according to the item's valuation method.{br}

Once the purchase return is released, the system automatically generates an inventory issue that includes stock items and non-stock items requiring receipt. Service items (that is, non-stock items that do not require receipt) are not included in the inventory issue. The reference number of the inventory issue generated for a purchase return is shown in the '''IN Ref. Nbr.''' box on the '''Other Information''' tab. The inventory issues that are generated for returns are released immediately; once inventory issues are released, the availability data for the items in inventory is updated.{br}

On release of an inventory issue, the following general ledger transactions are generated:[anchor|#_d563f08b-5a99-4246-bee8-ac2b2b81c222]
*PO Accrual account and subaccount: Dr, calculated cost
*Inventory account and subaccount: Cr, calculated cost

The cost to be used in the lines of an inventory issue is calculated depending on the item&rsquo;s valuation method (for instance, for items with ''Average'' as the valuation method, it is the current unit cost calculated at the moment of release of the issue). {br}

For a line with a non-stock item requiring receipt, the following general ledger transactions are generated on release of an inventory issue:[anchor|#_157e8900-822a-4e30-a967-81028bb9ea14]
*PO Accrual account of the posting class of the item: Dr, unit cost of the purchase return line
*Expense account of the posting class of the item: Cr, unit cost of the purchase return line

If the '''Create Bill''' check box is selected in the purchase return on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] form, when you release the purchase return, the system generates an accounts payable debit adjustment to the vendor automatically. Otherwise, you need to prepare the bill manually by clicking '''Actions &gt; Enter AP Bill''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] form. The generated AP debit adjustment is available on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form. {br}

The Accounts Payable debit adjustments are released immediately if the '''Release AP Documents Automatically''' option is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] form; otherwise, you should release these adjustments manually. {br}

On release of debit adjustment, the following general ledger transactions are generated:[anchor|#_0e2b3809-41d8-4904-896f-35a9e0a1f5a1]
*Accounts Payable account of the vendor: Dr, calculated cost
*PO Accrual account of the posting class of the item: Cr, calculated cost 

On release of the AP debit adjustment prepared for the purchase return, the system records any PO Accrual difference to the Purchase Price Variance account and subaccount that are defined in the posting class of the stock item.
==Processing a Return of Non-Stock Items Requiring Receipt==
Purchase return lines with the ''Non-Stock'' line type are added to the inventory issue or adjustment generated on the release of the purchase return. On release of the inventory transaction, the following batch of general ledger transactions is generated: [anchor|#_2da62979-1fb0-441b-a0a0-d2a921bf43cc]
*PO Accrual account of the purchase return line: Dr, unit cost of the purchase return line
*Expense account of the purchase return line: Cr, unit cost of the purchase return line

On release of debit adjustment, the following General Ledger transactions are generated:[anchor|#_a7a58688-0d95-4085-9f66-2ca19fca3f75]
*Accounts Payable account of the vendor: Dr, calculated cost
*PO Accrual account of the purchase return line: Cr, calculated cost 

On release of the AP debit adjustment prepared for the purchase return, the system records any PO Accrual difference based on the '''Allocation Mode''' selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form as follows:[anchor|#_be8df457-ca2b-48f9-b7b4-613545732aeb]
*If ''Purchase Price Variance Account'' is selected, the system posts the PO Accrual difference to the Purchase Price Variance account and subaccount specified in the posting class of the item.
*If ''Inventory Account'' is selected, the system posts the PO Accrual difference to the Expense account and subaccount specified in the related purchase return line.

The reference number of the inventory issue generated for a purchase return 				is shown in the  IN Ref. Nbr.  box on the  Other 					Information  tab.

In Acumatica ERP, you can design and maintain landed cost codes to be used to account for various types of additional costs that your company incurs when purchased goods are being shipped to your company warehouses, or when a transfer of certain stock is performed between warehouses via an external carrier. Landed cost amounts may depend on specific items, or on items&rsquo; weight or volume.{br}

This chapter describes how you can configure and process landed cost documents in Acumatica ERP, and how the cost of inventory items is updated on release of the landed cost documents.

With Acumatica ERP, your company can track the landed costs incurred for purchased or transferred stock items, to accurately calculate the total costs of the items. Landed costs in Acumatica ERP are processed through landed cost documents. In a landed cost document, you specify the landed cost amounts, and the purchase receipts or transfer receipts, to which these landed cost amounts should be allocated. {br}{TOC}
==General Workflow and Related Documents==
You can add to a single landed cost document either purchase receipts or transfer receipts (but not both types). The type of the added receipts does not affect the landed cost document workflow. The diagram below shows the processing steps for landed cost documents.[anchor|#_53a0eda2-c0f0-4b05-8770-62e7247e53b3][anchor|#_02578cd5-5d6c-4514-b39d-bff4d0f26b40][image:UserGuide/Images/LC_Process.png|popup|450px]
The following sections describe in detail the processing steps shown in the diagram.
==1. Enter the Landed Cost Document==
You create a new landed cost document on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_30_00|Landed Costs] ([~/?ScreenId=PO303000|PO303000]) form. The reference number for the new landed cost document is generated in accordance with the numbering sequence specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form. If the landed cost document is created with the ''On Hold'' status, you should clear the '''Hold''' check box for the document before releasing it.
==2. Add Receipt Lines to which Landed Costs Will Be Allocated==
You add the documents or particular document lines for which the landed costs were incurred by clicking '''Add PO Receipt''' or '''Add PO Receipt Line''' on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_30_00|Landed Costs] ([~/?ScreenId=PO303000|PO303000]) form. You then select the unlabeled check boxes in the rows of the needed lines in the dialog box that opens, and click '''Add&Close''' to add the selected lines. You can add the lines of either purchase receipts or transfer receipts to a landed cost document.
==3. Specify Landed Cost Codes and Amounts==
You add the landed costs to be allocated between the added receipt lines by adding the landed cost code and specifying the amount to be allocated on the '''Landed Costs''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_30_00|Landed Costs] ([~/?ScreenId=PO303000|PO303000]) form. 
==4. Release the Landed Cost Document==
To release the prepared landed cost document, you click '''Release''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_30_00|Landed Costs] ([~/?ScreenId=PO303000|PO303000]) form. Alternatively, you can release multiple landed cost documents at the same time by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_60_00|Release Landed Costs] ([~/?ScreenId=PO506000|PO506000]) form. {br}

When the landed cost document is released, the system automatically generates a corresponding inventory adjustment (one for each landed cost code) to update the cost of items in inventory. You can view the generated inventory adjustment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_30_00|Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=IN303000|IN303000]) form.
==5. Release the Inventory Adjustment==
The generated inventory adjustment is released automatically if the '''Release LC IN Adjustments Automatically''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form. If this check box is cleared, you have to release the inventory adjustment manually by clicking '''Release''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_30_00|Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=IN303000|IN303000]) form. {br}

On release of the inventory adjustment, a batch of GL transactions is generated. The costs of inventory items are updated according to the items&rsquo; valuation methods, as described in the [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_Updating_Cost_by_LC|Adding Landed Costs to Items' Costs].
==6. Prepare the Accounts Payable Bill==
If the '''Create Bill''' check box is selected in the landed cost document on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_30_00|Landed Costs] ([~/?ScreenId=PO303000|PO303000]) form, when you release the landed cost document, the system generates an AP bill to the landed cost vendor automatically. {br}

Otherwise, you need to prepare the bill from the purchase receipt by clicking '''Actions &gt; Enter AP Bill''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form. Alternatively, you can create a new AP bill manually on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form and add or link the lines of the landed cost document to the bill. For more information on the processing of AP bills, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AP_MNG_BillsAndAdjustments|Processing Bills and Adjustments].{br}

If the exact amount of the landed costs has changed, in the generated AP bill, you can manually adjust the amount of the landed costs. Any difference will be posted to dedicated accounts, as described in the [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_LC_Postponed|Adjusting the Landed Cost Variance].

Some landed costs, such as freight, are typically known when the goods are received. Other types of landed costs may become known later, when a bill from the service provider is received. When you need to enter the landed costs of a specific type in a landed cost document, if the exact amount of the landed costs is not known yet, you can enter the estimated amount for the appropriate landed cost code in the landed cost document on the '''Landed Costs''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_30_00|Landed Costs] ([~/?ScreenId=PO303000|PO303000]) tab. {br}

Later, when the exact amount becomes known, you can manually adjust the amount of the landed costs in the accounts payable bill generated for the landed cost document, and release the bill. The difference between the estimated amount and the adjusted amount is automatically added to the Landed Cost Variance account specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_20_20_00|Landed Cost Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=PO202000|PO202000]) form for the landed cost used on the original receipt. {br}

The following accounts are involved in the GL transactions that are generated on release of the AP bill to the landed cost vendor:[anchor|#_47388038-5957-4c9a-9aae-86ce280882c3]
*Accounts Payable account of the landed cost vendor
*Landed Cost Accrual account of the landed cost code
*Landed Cost Variance account of the landed cost code

On release of the AP bill to the landed cost vendor, if the landed cost amount specified in the landed cost document hasn&rsquo;t been changed, the following general ledger transactions are posted:[anchor|#_f053a904-650d-4fa9-a144-2906891e82ea]
*Accounts Payable account: Cr, landed cost amount
*Landed Cost Accrual account: Dr, landed cost amount

*Accounts Payable account: Cr, bill amount
*Landed Cost Accrual account: Cr, correction amount
*Landed Cost Variance account of the landed cost code: Dr, correction amount
*Landed Cost Accrual account: Dr, bill amount

On release of the landed cost document, the system generates the inventory adjustment that updates the items&rsquo; cost in inventory according to the allocated landed cost amounts and the valuation method of these items. The following sections describe how the system updates costs for the items of purchase receipts and transfer receipts.{br}{TOC}
==Cost Updating When Landed Costs Are Allocated to Purchase Receipts==
Upon release, an inventory adjustment updates the inventory costs of items differently depending on the valuation method of the item: [anchor|#ul_z4p_g3z_xv]
*For inventory items with the ''FIFO'' or ''Specific'' valuation method, the cost on the particular cost layer (created by the purchase receipt) is updated as follows: 
**If the layer still has the original quantity, the cost of all items on the layer is updated, and the landed cost amount from the Landed Cost Accrual account is transferred to the Inventory account assigned to the item.
**If the current quantity on the layer is less than the original quantity, the landed cost amount is moved from the Landed Cost Accrual account to update the Landed Cost Variance account of the stock item and the Inventory account in proportion with the sold and unsold quantities, respectively. (If you need to adjust the sales account on release of the inventory adjustment, you can use the same account for the COGS account and the Landed Cost Variance account.)
*For items with the ''Average'' valuation method, the landed cost amount from the Landed Cost Accrual account is transferred to the Inventory account assigned to the item and updates the average cost of the unit.
*:((({S:Hint}At the moment of inventory adjustment release, if some of the units listed on the purchase receipt were sold, the landed cost amount updates both the Landed Cost Variance account of the stock item and the Inventory account of the stock item proportionally to the unsold and sold quantities (as on the original purchase receipt), respectively. 
)))
*For items with the ''Standard Cost'' valuation method, the amount from the Landed Cost Accrual account is moved to the Landed Cost Variance account of the stock item.

==Cost Updating When Landed Costs Are Allocated to Transfer Receipts==
Upon release, an inventory adjustment updates the inventory costs of items differently depending on the valuation method of the item as follows: [anchor|#_1fcd950e-fbf4-4714-9131-83eacfc1a047]
*For items with the ''Standard cost'' valuation method, the landed cost amount is moved from the Landed Cost Accrual account to the Standard Cost Variance account. The following transactions are generated:
**Standard Cost Accrual account: Cr, landed cost amount
**COGS account: Dr, landed cost amount
*For items with the ''Average'' cost valuation method, the landed cost amount moved from the Landed Cost Accrual account to the Inventory account (determined by the posting class of the item) updates the average cost of the unit. The following transactions are generated:
**Landed Cost Accrual account: Cr, landed cost amount
**Inventory account: Dr, landed cost amount
*:((({S:Hint}At the moment of the release of the inventory adjustment, if some of the units (listed on the transfer receipt) were sold, the landed cost amount updates both the COGS account and the Inventory account of the item proportionally to the unsold and sold quantities (as specified on the original transfer receipt), respectively. 
)))
*For inventory items with the ''FIFO'' or ''Specific'' valuation method, the system creates a new cost layer based on the transfer receipt (this layer has the date and the quantity from the transfer receipt) and the amounts moved between accounts vary as follows, based on the quantity of the layer:
**If the layer still has the original quantity, the cost of all items in the layer is updated, and the landed cost amount from the Landed Cost Accrual account is transferred to the Inventory account assigned to the item.
**If the current quantity in the layer is less than the original quantity on the receipt, the landed cost amount is moved from the Landed Cost Accrual account to update the COGS account and the Inventory account in proportion to the sold and unsold quantities, respectively.

==An Example of Cost Updating for a Transferred FIFO Item ==
If a stock item with the ''FIFO'' valuation method was transferred from one warehouse to another, a new cost layer for the transferred quantity is created with the date of the transfer receipt. {br}

The history of receipts in the table below illustrates how the landed costs update the cost of the transferred item with the ''FIFO'' valuation method.[anchor|#_5587037c-9916-4c36-a31b-40b79f497856]

An Example of Cost Updating for a Transferred FIFO Item  If a stock item with the  FIFO  valuation method was transferred from one warehouse to     another, a new cost layer for the transferred quantity is created with the date of the transfer     receipt.  The history of receipts in the table below illustrates how the landed costs update the cost of     the transferred item with the  FIFO  valuation method. N Tran. Type Date Ref. Nbr. Qty. Warehouse Unit Cost Comment 1 Receipt February 01 RCP001 5 WHL1 300 A new cost layer for 5 units was created with the date February 1. 2 Receipt February 01 RCP001 7 WHL2 450 A new cost layer for 7 units was created with the date February 1. 3 Transfer from warehouse WHL1 February 08 TRAN001 -3 WHL1 300 The cost layer was updated. 4 Transfer receipt at warehouse WHL2 Landed cost amount added: 240 February 09 TRREC01 3 WHL2 (3 * 300 + 240) / 3= 380 A new cost layer for 3 units was created with the date February 9. If the item is moved within the same warehouse from a location with the  Cost      Separately  check box selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses (IN204000)     form to a location with the  Cost Separately  check box cleared (or if the     reverse is true), a new cost layer is created too; however, it has the date of the original     receipt. In the above example, if a transfer was performed between the L1 and L2 locations     (which have different cost settings) of the same warehouse, the cost layer mentioned in Row 4     would have the date February 1.  ]]></column>

An organization may want to pursue a clear, cost-efficient purchasing process that prioritizes the purchase of items from the most appropriate vendors at the best possible time and in the right quantities. To facilitate this process, an organization can use purchase requests and requisitions—that is, documents that track the items the organization wants to purchase from vendors. In Acumatica ERP, you can create requests, create purchase requisitions based on these requests, and solicit bids from multiple vendors so that your personnel can select the best bid.{br}

To use the requisition functionality, you must have the ''Purchase Requisitions'' feature enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

In this topic, you will find information about the basic process of purchase requisitions in Acumatica ERP.{br}{TOC}
==Request Classes in Acumatica ERP==
A request class is an entity in Acumatica ERP that contains the general settings for requests of a particular type. You can create a request class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_20_10_00|Request Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ201000|RQ201000]) form and specify the following settings for the class:[anchor|#ul_vf2_yhl_wfb]
*What the promised lead time is: In the '''Promised Lead Time (days)''' box (Summary area), you specify the number of days within which a request of the class should be fulfilled.
*Whether requests of the class are external or internal: External requests contain items requested by customers of your organization. To indicate that the request class will be used for external requests, you select the '''Customer Request''' check box in the Summary area. Internal requests are initiated by employees of your organization and contain items that the employees need in their work.
*Whether the items from a request of the class can be divided among multiple vendors: If a request contains multiple items, you can order these items from multiple vendors if one vendor cannot fulfill the entire request or if another vendor has lower prices for particular items. You select the '''Allow Multiple Vendors per Request''' check box, also in the Summary area, to indicate that the system can suggest multiple vendors to fulfill the request.
*Which items are available for ordering in requests of this class (optional): You can restrict the list of items that users can add to the request during creation to reduce the probability of mistakenly added items. To do this, you select the '''Restrict Requests Items to the Specified List''' check box in the Summary area, and you add the items to the list on the '''Request Class Item List''' tab.
*Whether the request must be validated against the budget: If you control expenses on particular items by using budgets, you can set up budget validation on the '''GL Accounts''' tab by selecting ''Warning'' or ''Error'' in the '''Budget Validation''' box (the default setting is ''None'') and specifying an expense account in the '''Expense Account''' box (and the corresponding subaccount, if applicable, in the '''Expense Sub. '''box).

==Purchase Requisition Usage==
In a simple case of using purchase requests and requisitions, you create one request or multiple requests, and then you create a purchase requisition based on the requests, manually select a vendor, and purchase items from this vendor (see the following diagram). You can use this simplified process, for example, when employees of your organization order low-cost items, such as office supplies. If you already work with a vendor that gives your company the best prices and discounts for these items, you do not need to gather bids from multiple vendors to save on price.[anchor|#fig_cv1_nq3_chb][anchor|#image_dv1_nq3_chb][image:UserGuide/Images/Requisition_Internal.png|popup|Overview of the simplified requisition process|450px]
If your organization works with multiple vendors that provide you with the same type of items (such as computers), you can request and process vendor bids to select the best offers. For example, if you have received an order for laptops from your employees, you can find a vendor or multiple vendors with the lowest prices to fulfill the order.{br}

Depending on the business processes of your organization, you can use budget validation for requests or approvals for requests and requisitions to secure the purchase requisitions process against fraud and unnecessary expenses. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\RQ__con_Extended_Requisitions|Extended Purchase Requisition Process].
==Basic Purchase Requisition Process==
The basic purchase requisition process includes the following steps (also shown in the diagrams below):[anchor|#ol_v1c_wfk_wfb]
#Creating a request: You create a request by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_10_00|Requests] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ301000|RQ301000]) form.
#Creating a purchase requisition based on one request or multiple requests: You create a purchase requisition on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_50_40_00|Create Requisitions] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ504000|RQ504000]) form.
#Sending proposals to vendors by email (optional): You automatically send requests for proposals to vendors by email by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_20_00|Requisitions] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ302000|RQ302000]) form.
#Selecting a vendor (or multiple vendors) for the purchase: 
#*If you manually select a vendor (or multiple vendors for different items) for the requisition, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_20_00|Requisitions] form.
#*If you have run automatic bidding, you analyze and correct the automatic bidding results by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_50_30_00|Complete Bidding] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ503000|RQ503000]) form.
#:For details on selecting vendors, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\RQ__con_Bidding_Process|Processing and Selection of Bids].
#Creating all needed purchase orders (and, optionally, all needed sales orders for external requests): You create these orders by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_20_00|Requisitions] form.
#Sending all purchase orders that have been created to the applicable vendors: By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, you send the created purchase order or orders to the vendor or vendors selected to fulfill the requisition.
#Receiving items in a warehouse: You create and process the documents related to the items being received in a warehouse by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] and [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) forms.
#Providing items to requesters: For external requests, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) forms to create and process the documents for shipping items to customers. For internal requests, you can create and process the documents for issuing items to employees of your organization by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form.
[anchor|#fig_mxv_jr3_chb][anchor|#image_nxv_jr3_chb][image:UserGuide/Images/Requisition_for_Customers_Part1.png|popup|Overview of requisition process with bids (part 1)|450px][anchor|#fig_f3p_lr3_chb][anchor|#image_g3p_lr3_chb][image:UserGuide/Images/Requisition_for_Customers_Part2.png|popup|Overview of requisition process with bids (part 2)|450px]
==Creation of a Purchase Requisition Document==
After the requests have been created, you create a requisition document. You can include multiple requests in one requisition if the items in these requests will be ordered from the same vendors. For creating a requisition, you can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_50_40_00|Create Requisitions] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ504000|RQ504000]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_20_00|Requisitions] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ302000|RQ302000]) form. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_50_40_00|Create Requisitions] form, you can create any number of requisitions. While on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_20_00|Requisitions] form, you can fully process a requisition (from creation to release).{br}

When the system is creating a requisition, it can merge lines with the same items into one line if the item was requested by the same requester (a customer or an employee) and has the same estimated unit cost. If you want the system to merge items in all requisitions, you can select the '''Merge Lines by Default''' check box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_10_10_00|Purchase Requisitions Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ101000|RQ101000]) form. Before you create any requisitions on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_50_40_00|Create Requisitions] form, you can select the '''Merge Lines''' check box in the Selection area to merge items for created requisitions, or clear the check box to not merge items.{br}

If a requisition has already been created, you can merge lines manually on the '''Document Details''' tab of the Requisitions form by selecting the Included check box for the lines in the list and clicking '''Merge Lines''' on the table toolbar.((({S:Hint}With manual merging in this way, the system will merge lines even if they have different unit costs and requesters. For external requests, we do not recommend that you merge items requested by different customers, because this may cause sales documents to be linked incorrectly to purchase requisitions.
)))
==Sending of Requests for Proposals==
If you have email functionality configured in the system, you can automatically send requests for proposals to vendors by email by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_20_00|Requisitions] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ302000|RQ302000]) form. To do this, on the '''Bidding''' tab, you select a vendor in the '''Bidding Vendors''' table and click '''Send Request'''. Alternatively, you can send requests to all vendors at once by clicking '''Vendor Notifications''' > '''Send All Requests''' on the form toolbar.

If your organization takes measures to secure the purchasing process against fraud and unnecessary expenses, in Acumatica ERP, you can configure validation of requests against budget and approval of requests and requisitions as extensions of the basic process.{br}

In this topic, you will read about the extended process of purchase requisitions.{br}{TOC}
==Advanced Purchase Requisition Process==
The purchasing process that involves budget validation and approval of requests and requisitions includes the following steps (also shown in the diagrams below):[anchor|#ol_v1c_wfk_wfb]
#Creating a request: You create a request by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_10_00|Requests] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ301000|RQ301000]) form.
#Validating a request against a budget: You analyze the validation results on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_10_00|Requests] form and correct the list of items if the request cost exceeds the budget.
#Approving the request: The employee that is assigned as the request approver approves or rejects the request by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_10_00|Requests] form.
#Creating a purchase requisition based on one request or multiple requests: You create a purchase requisition on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_50_40_00|Create Requisitions] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ504000|RQ504000]) form.
#Approving the requisition: The assigned requisition approver approves or rejects the requisition by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_10_00|Requests] form.
#Sending notifications to vendors: On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_20_00|Requisitions] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ302000|RQ302000]) form, you send a request for proposal to each vendor that may opt to participate in bidding by clicking the vendor on the '''Bidding''' tab (in the '''Bidding Vendors''' table) and clicking '''Send Request''' on the table toolbar.
#Entering vendor responses: You enter vendor responses into the system by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_30_00|Bidding Responses] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ303000|RQ303000]) form.
#Running automatic bidding: On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_50_30_00|Complete Bidding] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ503000|RQ503000]) form, you run automatic bidding among vendors.
#Selecting a vendor (or multiple vendors) for the purchase: You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_20_00|Requisitions] form to manually select a vendor (or multiple vendors for different items) for the requisition. If you have run automatic bidding, you analyze and correct the automatic bidding results by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_50_30_00|Complete Bidding] form.
#Creating all needed purchase orders (and, optionally, all needed sales orders for external requests): You create these orders from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_20_00|Requisitions] form.
#Sending all purchase orders that have been created to the applicable vendors: By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, you send the created purchase order or orders to the vendor or vendors selected to fulfill the requisition.
#Receiving items in a warehouse: You create and process the documents related to the items being received in a warehouse by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] and [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) forms.
#Providing items to requesters: For external requests, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_00|Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) forms to create and process the documents for shipping items to customers. For internal requests, you create and process the documents for issuing items to employees of your organization by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form.

==Request and Requisition Approvals==
In the system, you can create approval maps so that requests that meet particular criteria are submitted for approval to the appropriate employees. For example, if the total cost of the items in a request exceeds a particular amount, the request must be approved by the head of the department whose employee requested the items.{br}

You can configure the system so that particular requisitions or all requisitions require approval. For example, approval can be set up so that all requisitions that contain computer equipment that costs more than a particular amount must be approved by the IT department before purchasing can take place.{br}

Before you turn on the approval of requests and requisitions, you should make sure that the needed approval maps and notification templates (if needed) have been configured. The approval map defines the employees designated for approving documents and the conditions that the documents must meet (if applicable) to be assigned for approval; the template of the notification email will be used by the system for notifying approvers about the documents pending their approval.{br}

You then enable the approval of purchase requests or requisitions on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_10_10_00|Purchase Requisitions Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ101000|RQ101000]) form by selecting the appropriate '''Require Approval''' check box (in the '''Request Settings''' or '''Requisition Settings''' section). Then on the '''Approval''' tab of this form, for each document type (request or requisition), you specify the approval map and, optionally, the template of the notification email. For the step-by-step instruction, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\RQ__how_Set_Up_Approval|To Set Up Approval of Requests and Requisitions].{br}

With approvals turned on, when a purchase request or requisition that is subject to approval has been created, taken off hold, and saved, the document is assigned the ''Pending Approval'' status. The responsible approver receives an email notification (if an email notification template has been specified for this type of document) about the document pending approval. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) form, an approver can review the list of documents pending approval, and can select one record or multiple records in the list and approve or reject all selected records.((({S:Hint}To be able to approve requests and requisitions, an approver must have access to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_10_00|Requests] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ301000|RQ301000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_20_00|Requisitions] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ302000|RQ302000]) forms accordingly.

If the document is approved, the system assigns it the ''Open'' status, and document processing can continue.{br}

If the document is rejected, it is assigned the ''Rejected'' status, and you cannot continue processing the document. You can edit the document after you select the '''Hold''' check box on the corresponding form.
==Budget Validation for Requests==
If your organization allocates budgets for valuable internal purchases, you can configure budget validation for requests to prevent cost overruns of requested goods and services. An employee who is creating a request can see whether the cost of the items included in the request is below the budget. If the cost exceeds the budget, the employee can edit the list of items in the request.{br}

Before you set up this validation, you should make sure that the budgets have been created and released in the system on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_30_20_10|Budgets] ([~/?ScreenId=GL302010|GL302010]) form.{br}

The setup of budget validation for requests includes the following tasks:[anchor|#ol_znk_vdl_wfb]
#Defining the way the system will calculate the costs of items included in a request: On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_10_10_00|Purchase Requisitions Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ101000|RQ101000]) form, in the '''Budget Ledger''' box of the '''General Settings''' tab, you select the budget ledger that the system will use for verification. You can also specify the time period over which the system will aggregate amounts from all requests created. In the '''Budget Calculation''' box, you select one of the following options:
#*''YTD Values'': Calculates the total cost of requests created from the beginning of the financial year to the end of the current financial period
#*''PTD Values'': Calculates the total cost of requests created from the beginning of the financial period
#*''Annual'': Calculates the total cost of requests created for the current calendar year
#Turning on budget validation in the settings of each needed request class: On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_20_10_00|Request Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ201000|RQ201000]) form, you turn on budget validation by selecting the appropriate option in the '''Budget Validation''' box of the '''GL Accounts''' tab. (The default setting is ''None''.) If you select ''Warning'', a user will be able to save a request of this class even if the requested amount exceeds the budgeted amount, but the system will display a warning. If you select ''Error'', a user will not be able to save a request of this class with an amount that exceeds the budgeted amount, and the system will display an error message.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Extended Purchase Requisition Process If your organization takes measures to secure the purchasing process against fraud and     unnecessary expenses, in  Acumatica ERP,     you can configure validation of requests against budget and approval of requests and     requisitions as extensions of the basic process. In this topic, you will read about the extended process of purchase requisitions. Advanced Purchase Requisition Process The purchasing process that involves budget validation and approval of requests and     requisitions includes the following steps (also shown in the diagrams below): Creating a request: You create a request by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ301000|RQ301000]) Requests      (RQ301000) form. Validating a request against a budget: You analyze the validation results on the   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ301000|RQ301000]) Requests form and correct the list of items if the request cost exceeds the      budget. Approving the request: The employee that is assigned as the request approver approves or      rejects the request by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) Approvals (EP503010) or   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ301000|RQ301000]) Requests form. Creating a purchase requisition based on one request or multiple requests: You create a      purchase requisition on the   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ504000|RQ504000]) Create Requisitions (RQ504000) form. Approving the requisition: The assigned requisition approver approves or rejects the      requisition by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) Approvals or   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ301000|RQ301000]) Requests      form. Sending notifications to vendors: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ302000|RQ302000]) Requisitions (RQ302000) form,      you send a request for proposal to each vendor that may opt to participate in bidding by      clicking the vendor on the  Bidding  tab (in the  Bidding       Vendors  table) and clicking  Send Request  on the table      toolbar. Entering vendor responses: You enter vendor responses into the system by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ303000|RQ303000]) Bidding Responses (RQ303000) form. Running automatic bidding: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ503000|RQ503000]) Complete Bidding (RQ503000) form, you run      automatic bidding among vendors. Selecting a vendor (or multiple vendors) for the purchase: You use the   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ302000|RQ302000]) Requisitions form to manually select a vendor (or multiple vendors for different      items) for the requisition. If you have run automatic bidding, you analyze and correct the      automatic bidding results by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ503000|RQ503000]) Complete Bidding form. Creating all needed purchase orders (and, optionally, all needed sales orders for external      requests): You create these orders from the   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ302000|RQ302000]) Requisitions form. Sending all purchase orders that have been created to the applicable vendors: By using the         ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form, you send the created purchase order or orders      to the vendor or vendors selected to fulfill the requisition. Receiving items in a warehouse: You create and process the documents related to the items      being received in a warehouse by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders and   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) forms. Providing items to requesters: For external requests, you use the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) and   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302000|SO302000]) Shipments (SO302000) forms to      create and process the documents for shipping items to customers. For internal requests, you      create and process the documents for issuing items to employees of your organization by using      the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) Issues (IN302000) form. Process of purchase requisitions with budget validation and approval (part 1) Process of purchase requisitions with budget validation and approval (part 2) Request and Requisition Approvals In the system, you can create approval maps so that requests that meet particular criteria are     submitted for approval to the appropriate employees. For example, if the total cost of the items     in a request exceeds a particular amount, the request must be approved by the head of the     department whose employee requested the items. You can configure the system so that particular requisitions or all requisitions require     approval. For example, approval can be set up so that all requisitions that contain computer     equipment that costs more than a particular amount must be approved by the IT department before     purchasing can take place. Before you turn on the approval of requests and requisitions, you should make sure that the     needed approval maps and notification templates (if needed) have been configured. The approval     map defines the employees designated for approving documents and the conditions that the     documents must meet (if applicable) to be assigned for approval; the template of the     notification email will be used by the system for notifying approvers about the documents     pending their approval. You then enable the approval of purchase requests or requisitions on the  General      Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ101000|RQ101000]) Purchase Requisitions Preferences (RQ101000) form by selecting     the appropriate  Require Approval  check box (in the  Request      Settings  or  Requisition Settings  section). Then on the       Approval  tab of this form, for each document type (request or     requisition), you specify the approval map and, optionally, the template of the notification     email. For the step-by-step instruction, see  To Set Up Approval of Requests and Requisitions. With approvals turned on, when a purchase request or requisition that is subject to approval     has been created, taken off hold, and saved, the document is assigned the  Pending      Approval  status. The responsible approver receives an email notification (if an email     notification template has been specified for this type of document) about the document pending     approval. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) Approvals (EP503010) form, an approver can review the     list of documents pending approval, and can select one record or multiple records in the list     and approve or reject all selected records. To be able to approve requests and requisitions, an approver must have access to the   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ301000|RQ301000]) Requests (RQ301000) and   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ302000|RQ302000]) Requisitions (RQ302000) forms     accordingly. If the document is approved, the system assigns it the  Open  status, and document     processing can continue. If the document is rejected, it is assigned the  Rejected  status, and you cannot     continue processing the document. You can edit the document after you select the       Hold  check box on the corresponding form. Budget Validation for Requests If your organization allocates budgets for valuable internal purchases, you can configure     budget validation for requests to prevent cost overruns of requested goods and services. An     employee who is creating a request can see whether the cost of the items included in the request     is below the budget. If the cost exceeds the budget, the employee can edit the list of items in     the request. Before you set up this validation, you should make sure that the budgets have been created and     released in the system on the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL302010|GL302010]) Budgets (GL302010) form. The setup of budget validation for requests includes the following tasks: Defining the way the system will calculate the costs of items included in a request: On the         ([~/?ScreenId=RQ101000|RQ101000]) Purchase Requisitions Preferences (RQ101000) form, in the  Budget Ledger       box of the  General Settings  tab, you select the budget ledger that the      system will use for verification. You can also specify the time period over which the system      will aggregate amounts from all requests created. In the  Budget       Calculation  box, you select one of the following options: YTD Values : Calculates the total cost of requests created from the beginning of the        financial year to the end of the current financial period PTD Values : Calculates the total cost of requests created from the beginning of the        financial period Annual : Calculates the total cost of requests created for the current calendar        year Turning on budget validation in the settings of each needed request class: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ201000|RQ201000]) Request Classes (RQ201000) form, you turn on budget validation by selecting the      appropriate option in the  Budget Validation  box of the  GL       Accounts  tab.

The bidding process entails sending requests for proposals to vendors and choosing the vendor that best meets your company&rsquo;s needs. The Purchase Requisitions module of Acumatica ERP supports and streamlines the bidding process, helping you to reduce purchase expenses. You can manually assign a vendor to the requisition or select the vendor as a result of the bidding process.{br}

In this topic, you will read about how to process and select bids.{br}{TOC}
==Bid Processing==
You begin the processing of vendors&rsquo; bids for a particular requisition when you receive responses (that is, bids) from vendors. The processing involves the following steps:[anchor|#ol_apb_pd3_chb]
#You enter responses into the system by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_30_00|Bidding Responses] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ303000|RQ303000]) form.
#You select the best bids in any of the following ways:
#*By using the automatic algorithm of selecting the best bids. This algorithm uses information about vendor&rsquo;s prices, minimal quantities, and bid quantities of the requested items. For more details, see [[#section_yr3_5c3_chb|Automatic Selection of Bids].
#*By analyzing responses and selecting vendors manually. For details, see [[#section_hrq_5c3_chb|Manual Selection of Bids].
[anchor|#section_yr3_5c3_chb]
==Automatic Selection of Bids==
You process the bids for a particular requisition by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_50_30_00|Complete Bidding] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ503000|RQ503000]) form. To run automatic bidding, you click '''Update Result''' on the form toolbar. The system selects a vendor or multiple vendors for each item automatically based on the offered price (bid unit cost) and the quantity limitations (bid quantity), if any, from vendor responses. You can view bidding results and correct them if you are not satisfied with the automatically selected vendors.{br}

If any vendor response has changed or been withdrawn after the system selected vendors for a requisition, you enter new responses on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_30_00|Bidding Responses] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ303000|RQ303000]) form. Then you go back to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_50_30_00|Complete Bidding] form, click '''Clear Result''' on the form toolbar to clear the selected vendors for all lines of a requisition, and click '''Update Result''' again.{br}

After you have analyzed and corrected the bidding results, you accept the results by clicking '''Complete Bidding''' on the toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_50_30_00|Complete Bidding] form. The system assigns the selected vendor or vendors to the requisition.[anchor|#section_hrq_5c3_chb]
==Manual Selection of Bids==
When selecting the best bids, you may want to analyze the bidding responses and select the bids manually. You may want to take into account not only the vendor offering the lowest price but also any of the following:[anchor|#ul_krq_5c3_chb]
*The number of days needed to deliver the order 
*The carrier used by a vendor
*The shipping terms used by a vendor
*Special offers from a vendor

You can select a vendor with a better bid by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_20_00|Requisitions] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ302000|RQ302000]) form as follows: You click the vendor line in the '''Bidding Vendors''' table on the '''Bidding''' tab and click '''Choose Vendor''' on the table toolbar.
==User Roles for Bid Processing==
To avoid fraud in selecting bids, you can control which employees can view bidding responses and results. If you want particular users to only enter bidding results, you create a user role that has access to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_30_00|Bidding Responses] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ303000|RQ303000]) form and does not have access to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_50_30_00|Complete Bidding] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ503000|RQ503000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_20_00|Requisitions] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ302000|RQ302000]) forms and assign this role to the users. For users who are selecting the best bids you create a user role with access to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_50_30_00|Complete Bidding] and [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_20_00|Requisitions] forms and without access to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\RQ_30_30_00|Bidding Responses] ([~/?ScreenId=RQ303000|RQ303000]) form and assign this role to the users. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Role_Configuration|Access Rights for Roles].

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[To Set Up Approval of Requests and Requisitions For many businesses, approval of requests and requisitions is essential. In  Acumatica ERP, you can set up approval for requests only, requisitions only, or for both types of             documents. You can set up approval of requests and requisitions by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ101000|RQ101000]) Purchase Requisitions Preferences (RQ101000) form. To open any form, you can navigate to it or search             for it (by its name or by its form ID without periods). For more information about             search capabilities, see  Search in the Modern UI. Before You Proceed Before you proceed with enabling approval, make sure the following steps are                 completed: Make sure that the  Approval Workflow  check box is                     selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. Make sure that needed approval maps and notification templates (if needed) have                     been configured as described in  Managing Assignment and Approval Maps. The approval map defines the employees designated for approving documents                     and the conditions that documents must match to be assigned for approval; the                     template of the notification email will be used by the system for notifying                     approvers about the documents pending their approval. You need to configure both                     the approval map and the notification template before you start to set up the                     approval process on the   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ101000|RQ101000]) Purchase Requisitions Preferences form.  To Set Up Approval for Requests Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ101000|RQ101000]) Purchase Requisitions Preferences (RQ101000) form by searching for or                         navigating to it. On the  General Settings  tab of this form, in the                              Request Settings  section, select the                              Require Approval  check box. On the  Approval  tab, If you have configured an                         approval map for requests, add it as follows: Click  Add Row . In the  Type  column, select                                  Request . In the  Approval Map  column, select the                                 approval map to be used for requests.  If no map                                     is selected for requests, all new requests will be automatically                                     approved. In the  Pending Approval Notification  column,                                 select the email template you created for generating emails about                                 requests that are pending approval. If multiple parallel approvals are required for requests, repeat Step 3 for                         each of the approval maps. Click  Save  on the form toolbar. To Set Up Approval for Requisitions Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=RQ101000|RQ101000]) Purchase Requisitions Preferences (RQ101000) form by searching for or                         navigating to it. On the  General Settings  tab of this form, in the                              Requisition Settings  section, select the                              Require Approval  check box. On the  Approval  tab, if you have configured an                         approval map for requisitions, add it as follows: Click  Add Row . In the  Type  column, select                                  Requisition . In the  Approval Map  column, select the                                 approval map to be used for requisitions.  If no                                     map is selected for requisitions, all new requisitions will be                                     automatically approved. In the  Pending Approval Notification  column,                                 select the email template you created for generating emails about                                 requisitions that are pending approval. If multiple parallel approvals are required for requisitions, repeat Step 3                         for each of the approval maps. Click  Save  on the form toolbar. ]]></column>

 Acumatica ERP provides a solution to automate basic warehouse operations, such as picking, packaging, receiving, putting away, transferring, and counting of items. This functionality and the related forms become available if the ''Automated Warehouse Operations'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

In this topic, you will read about the automation of warehouse operations in Acumatica ERP.{br}{TOC}
==Supported Warehouse Operations==
You can automate the following warehouse operations by using a barcode scanner or a mobile device with barcode scanning support:[anchor|#ul_wdj_x5j_ygb]
*Picking the items for a particular shipment. For details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Automating_WMS_PickPackShip|Pick, Pack, and Ship Operations].
*Packing the items to fulfill a particular shipment, as described in [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Automating_WMS_PickPackShip|Pick, Pack, and Ship Operations].
*Shipping items based on a shipment defined in the system. For details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Automating_WMS_PickPackShip|Pick, Pack, and Ship Operations].
*Receiving items based on a purchase receipt defined in the system. (See [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Automating_WMS_ReceivePutAway|Receive and Put Away Operations].)
*Putting away received items based on a purchase receipt. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Automating_WMS_ReceivePutAway|Receive and Put Away Operations].
*Issuing items from a warehouse. For details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\IN__con_Automating_WMS_Scan_and_Issue|Scan and Issue Operation].
*Transferring items within a warehouse or between warehouses located in the same building, as described in [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\IN__con_Automating_WMS_Scan_and_Transfer|Scan and Transfer Operation].
*Receiving items in a warehouse. For details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\IN__con_Automating_WMS_Scan_and_Receive|Scan and Receive Operation].
*Counting items within the physical inventory. For details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\IN__con_Automating_WMS_ScanAndCount|Scan and Count Operation].

In the system, a working mode corresponds to each of these operations (for more information, see [[#section_fy2_pbm_zgb|Working and Service Modes]). You can configure the workflow for each group of operations, as described in [[#section_bqz_sbm_zgb|Workflow Configuration].[anchor|#section_fy2_pbm_zgb]
==Working and Service Modes==
The forms you use for automated warehouse operations provide both ''working modes'' and ''service modes''. Working modes are modes that correspond to key operations users perform while using the form. Service modes are modes that correspond to secondary operations, such as removing document lines.{br}

Some forms that support the automation of warehouse operations, such as [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]), have multiple working modes. Each mode of a form, which corresponds to the operation you are currently performing, shows different content and supports a different set of actions. Other forms, such as [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_40_20|Scan and Transfer] ([~/?ScreenId=IN304020|IN304020]), have only one working mode, so that you can perform only a particular operation by using this form.{br}

While you are performing warehouse operations, you can change the working mode on the current form or navigate from the current form to another form by entering special commands (or by scanning special barcodes) starting with @. For example, if you scan or enter <tt>@pack</tt> in the '''Scan''' box (which is on all of the forms related to automated warehouse operations), the system navigates to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) in Pack mode. When you change the mode of a form, the system keeps the current document selected. For example, if you have entered the shipment number in Pick mode and have entered the command (or have scanned the barcode) to switch to Pack mode, the system automatically selects the current shipment.{br}

On each form related to automated warehouse operations, you can activate any of the following service modes:[anchor|#ul_w3x_t2f_zgb]
*Quantity Editing: In this mode, you can change a quantity of an item in the selected line. You activate the mode by scanning the <tt>&#42;qty</tt> barcode or by clicking '''Set Qty''' on the form toolbar. This mode is available if the '''Use Default Quantity''' check box is cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) forms and the '''Use Default Quantity in ...''' check boxes are cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form.
*Remove: In this mode, you can remove the selected document line or a specific quantity of the inventory item from the current document. You activate the mode by scanning the <tt>&#42;remove</tt> barcode or by clicking '''Remove''' on the form toolbar.
*Cart-specific modes:
**Cart Loading: In this mode, you load the selected cart with items. When you start picking or putting away items by using a cart, the system activates this mode automatically. If you want to activate this mode after unloading a cart, you scan the <tt>&#42;cart&#42;in</tt> command while using the corresponding form.
**Cart Unloading: In this mode, you unload the selected cart. You activate the mode by scanning the <tt>&#42;cart&#42;out</tt> command.

In addition to having multiple modes, each of the forms provided by the ''Automated Warehouse Operations'' feature has the '''Scan Log''' tab, which shows a log of the data scanned or entered in the '''Scan''' box. (Depending on preferences of the forms related to purchase orders and sales orders functionality, this tab can be hidden.)[anchor|#section_bqz_sbm_zgb]
==Workflow Configuration==
You can configure the workflow for each group of related operations so that the workflow corresponds to the business processes of your organization. For example, when shipping items, you can use only the Pick, Pack, or Ship mode, use them in any combination, or use all the modes in the same workflow. When receiving items with a purchase order, you can use either the Receive mode or the Put Away mode, or you can use both modes in one workflow. Additionally, you can track the use of carts for picking and putting away items (for more details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_WMS_CartTracking|Cart Tracking in Warehouse Operations]).{br}

For more information about workflow configuration and other settings, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_WMS_Config|Configuration of Warehouse Operation Workflows].
==Special Commands for Scanning==
When you work in any of the modes, you can use special commands to quickly switch to another mode or to perform an action in the current mode. You can scan a barcode of the command or type the command in the '''Scan''' box of a processing form. For the list of commands, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_WMS_Commands_List|Working Modes and Supported Commands].
==Operations with Lot- and Serial-Tracked Items==
If the ''Lot and Serial Tracking'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, while using the forms that facilitate the automated processing of warehouse operations, you can process items with lot or serial numbers in any mode. For details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_WMS_LotSerial|Warehouse Operations with Lot- and Serial-Tracked Items].
==Support of Automatic and Manual Packaging==
If the ''Automatic Packaging'' feature is disabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form, while you are performing picking and packing operations on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) form, you specify the packaging options for the order manually.{br}

If the ''Automatic Packaging'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form, when you process a shipment in Pick mode, all applicable boxes are selected and confirmed, and the box weight is specified automatically. If a single box was automatically specified for a shipment while you picked the items, then in Pack mode, the system automatically specifies the packaging details and confirms the box. Shipments for which multiple boxes were assigned cannot be packed automatically; you have to manually specify the packaging details and confirm the boxes. For a description of the picking and packing processes, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Automating_WMS_PickPackShip|Pick, Pack, and Ship Operations].
==Search for Items==
As you perform any of the warehouse operations, you may need to search for items. For example, you might find a box that is not in storage and want to get information about what is in the box, or you may need to view the full list of items in a specific location or cart.{br}

To get information about a particular item by scanning the item barcode, you can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_20|Item Lookup] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202520|IN202520]) form.{br}

If you want to view the list of items in a specific location or a cart, you can scan the barcode of the location or cart when the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_90_20|Storage Lookup] ([~/?ScreenId=IN409020|IN409020]) form is opened on the screen of your device.{br}

You can switch to either of these forms in any of the working modes by scanning or typing the corresponding command. For the list of commands, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_WMS_Commands_List|Working Modes and Supported Commands].

In the system, a working mode corresponds to each of these operations (for more         information, see  Working and Service Modes Working and Service Modes). You can configure the workflow for each group of operations, as         described in  Workflow Configuration Workflow Configuration. Working and Service Modes The forms you use for automated warehouse operations provide both  working modes  and            service modes . Working modes are modes that correspond to key operations users         perform while using the form. Service modes are modes that correspond to secondary         operations, such as removing document lines. Some forms that support the automation of warehouse operations, such as   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) Pick, Pack, and Ship (SO302020), have multiple working modes. Each mode         of a form, which corresponds to the operation you are currently performing, shows different         content and supports a different set of actions. Other forms, such as   ([~/?ScreenId=IN304020|IN304020]) Scan and Transfer (IN304020), have only one working mode, so that you can perform         only a particular operation by using this form. While you are performing warehouse operations, you can change the working mode on the         current form or navigate from the current form to another form by entering special commands         (or by scanning special barcodes) starting with @. For example, if you scan or enter            @pack  in the  Scan  box (which is on all of         the forms related to automated warehouse operations), the system navigates to the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) Pick, Pack, and Ship (SO302020) in Pack mode. When you change the mode         of a form, the system keeps the current document selected. For example, if you have entered         the shipment number in Pick mode and have entered the command (or have scanned the barcode)         to switch to Pack mode, the system automatically selects the current shipment. On each form related to automated warehouse operations, you can activate any of the         following service modes: Quantity Editing: In this mode, you can change a quantity of an item in the selected           line. You activate the mode by scanning the  *qty  barcode or           by clicking  Set Qty  on the form toolbar. This mode is available if           the  Use Default Quantity  check box is cleared on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences (SO101000) and   ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) Purchase Orders Preferences (PO101000)           forms and the  Use Default Quantity in ...  check boxes are cleared           on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000) form. Remove: In this mode, you can remove the selected document line or a specific quantity           of the inventory item from the current document. You activate the mode by scanning the              *remove  barcode or by clicking              Remove  on the form toolbar. Cart-specific modes: Cart Loading: In this mode, you load the selected cart with items. When you start               picking or putting away items by using a cart, the system activates this mode               automatically. If you want to activate this mode after unloading a cart, you scan the                  *cart*in  command while using the corresponding               form. Cart Unloading: In this mode, you unload the selected cart. You activate the mode by               scanning the  *cart*out  command. In addition to having multiple modes, each of the forms provided by the  Automated           Warehouse Operations  feature has the  Scan Log  tab, which shows         a log of the data scanned or entered in the  Scan  box. (Depending on         preferences of the forms related to purchase orders and sales orders functionality, this tab         can be hidden.) Workflow Configuration You can configure the workflow for each group of related operations so that the workflow         corresponds to the business processes of your organization. For example, when shipping         items, you can use only the Pick, Pack, or Ship mode, use them in any combination, or use         all the modes in the same workflow. When receiving items with a purchase order, you can use         either the Receive mode or the Put Away mode, or you can use both modes in one workflow.         Additionally, you can track the use of carts for picking and putting away items (for more         details, see  Cart Tracking in Warehouse Operations). For more information about workflow configuration and other settings, see  Configuration of Warehouse Operation Workflows. Special Commands for Scanning When you work in any of the modes, you can use special commands to quickly switch to         another mode or to perform an action in the current mode. You can scan a barcode of the         command or type the command in the  Scan  box of a processing form. For         the list of commands, see  Working Modes and Supported Commands. Operations with Lot- and Serial-Tracked Items If the  Lot and Serial Tracking  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, while using the forms that facilitate the         automated processing of warehouse operations, you can process items with lot or serial         numbers in any mode. For details, see  Warehouse Operations with Lot- and Serial-Tracked Items. Support of Automatic and Manual Packaging If the  Automatic Packaging  feature is disabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features form, while you are performing picking and packing operations on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) Pick, Pack, and Ship (SO302020) form, you specify the packaging options for the order         manually. If the  Automatic Packaging  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features         form, when you process a shipment in Pick mode, all applicable boxes are selected and         confirmed, and the box weight is specified automatically. If a single box was automatically         specified for a shipment while you picked the items, then in Pack mode, the system         automatically specifies the packaging details and confirms the box. Shipments for which         multiple boxes were assigned cannot be packed automatically; you have to manually specify         the packaging details and confirm the boxes. For a description of the picking and packing         processes, see  Pick, Pack, and Ship Operations. Search for Items As you perform any of the warehouse operations, you may need to search for items. For         example, you might find a box that is not in storage and want to get information about what         is in the box, or you may need to view the full list of items in a specific location or         cart. To get information about a particular item by scanning the item barcode, you can use the             ([~/?ScreenId=IN202520|IN202520]) Item Lookup (IN202520) form. If you want to view the list of items in a specific location or a cart, you can scan the         barcode of the location or cart when the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN409020|IN409020]) Storage Lookup (IN409020) form is         opened on the screen of your device. You can switch to either of these forms in any of the working modes by scanning or typing         the corresponding command. For the list of commands, see  Working Modes and Supported Commands. ]]></column>

If the ''Fulfillment'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can perform automated picking, packing, and shipping operations with inventory items by using a barcode scanner or a mobile device with a scanning option. {br}

This topic describes the workflows of automated operations that you can configure in Acumatica ERP for processing shipments.{br}{TOC}
==Applicable Documents==
You perform automated operations for processing shipments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) form. {br}

You can process the following documents in Pick mode:[anchor|#_bef6af98-4154-4241-adc5-0b93ad7bc68b]
*Open shipments of the ''Shipment'' operation type (shipments prepared for sales orders)
*Open shipments of the ''Transfer'' operation type (shipments prepared for transfer orders)
*Open shipments of the ''Receipt'' operation type (shipments prepared for return orders)

In Pack mode, you can process open shipments of the ''Shipment'' or ''Transfer'' operation type. (If the picking of items is required before packing, the shipment must have at least one picked item.)
==Workflow Variations==
Based on the settings specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form, the following shipping workflow variations can be configured and used:[anchor|#_77cd0a10-0afb-41a2-823d-433d4616753b]
*A user processes the picking of items in Pick mode, and then processes the packing of items in Pack mode.
*In Pick mode, a user processes the picking of items and confirms the shipment.
*In Pack mode, a user processes the packing of items (without first picking them) and confirms the shipment.
*In Pick mode, a user processes the picking of items and enters a shipping location for each item.
*In Pack mode, a user processes the packing of items, and the system automatically calculates weight of each package.

In addition, in any of these workflow variations, the user can switch to Ship mode (see [[#_6419ca4e-632c-419d-aa23-d600eff07fa6|Workflow of Automated Shipping]) before confirming the shipment, and select shipping options, such as the particular carrier and carrier rate to be used for shipping.{br}

For more information on configuring workflows, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_WMS_Config|Configuration of Warehouse Operation Workflows].
==Workflow of Automated Picking==
The automated processing of the picking of items to be packed involves the actions shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#_9a92ac48-c9f2-40e0-be74-8656e0577935][anchor|#_15a75575-9e06-4bd9-be65-29b6a9a63fd9][image:UserGuide/Images/WMS_Pick.png|popup|450px]
To process the picking of items by using Pick mode, you perform the following steps:[anchor|#_fc3acd1f-81f8-43c4-af60-3107a80987dc]
#''Switch to Pick mode''.
#:You switch to Pick mode by scanning or entering the ''@pick'' barcode. The system opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) form with the '''Pick''' tab displayed.
#''Scan the document number''.
#:To start automated processing, you scan the reference number of the shipment to be processed. The system displays the lines of the scanned document in the table and inserts the reference number of the document that is currently selected for processing in the '''Shipment Nbr.''' box.
#''Scan the location barcode''.
#:When you scan the barcode of the location from which the item is picked, the system searches for the location in the lines of the document that is currently selected.
#''Scan the item barcode''.
#:When you scan the item barcode of the picked item, the system searches for the item in the lines of the currently selected document. The system displays the picked quantity in the '''Picked Qty.''' column and highlights the line (with bold if the line has been picked partially, or in green if the line has been picked in full). If the barcode of the scanned item is specified for a non-base unit of measure (UOM), the system converts this quantity to the picked quantity in the base unit of measure for this item. 
#Optional: ''Scan the lot or serial number of the item''.
#:This step is required only if the item is lot- or serial-tracked item, and only if the '''Default Auto-Generated Lot/Serial Nbr.''' check box is cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form. If the check box is selected, the system specifies the lot or serial number for the serialized item automatically.
#Optional: ''Scan the item quantity''.
#:To change the picked quantity in the line that is currently being processed, you switch to Quantity Editing mode by scanning or entering the <tt>&#42;qty</tt> barcode, and manually enter the quantity in the UOM of the scanned item barcode.
#Optional: ''Scan the barcode to confirm the picked quantity''.
#:If no more changes are needed for the line that is currently being processed, you scan the <tt>&#42;ok</tt> barcode or click the '''OK''' button to confirm the picked quantity.
#''Pick another line''.
#:If another item needs to be picked for the currently selected location, you scan the item barcode (return to Step 4), and repeat the process for the item.
#''Pick items from another location''.
#:If you need to pick items from another location, you scan the location barcode (return to Step 3), and repeat the process for the location.
#''Complete the picking process''.
#:If you have finished the picking operation and packaging is not needed, you scan the <tt>&#42;confirm&#42;shipment</tt> barcode or click the '''Confirm Shipment''' button on the form toolbar. The system confirms the shipment that is currently being processed.
#:If you have finished the picking operation, to proceed with packaging, you scan the <tt>@pack</tt> barcode to switch to Pack mode.

==Workflow of Automated Packing Already-Picked Items==
The automated processing of packing items that have been picked involves the actions shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#_ee52c6b5-a477-47f1-8d73-66c47468551f][anchor|#_76d736dc-cd0c-4728-9e0b-6767ee1bd0e8][image:UserGuide/Images/WMS_PackwPick.png|popup|450px]
To process the packing of items (and use Pack mode) after picking them, you perform the following steps:[anchor|#_7bef02b8-d7c5-4ee8-998c-3cd6748f2317]
#''Switch to Pack mode''.
#:You switch to Pack mode by scanning or entering the ''@pack'' barcode. The system opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) form with the '''Pack''' tab displayed.
#''Scan the document number''.
#:To start automated processing, you scan the reference number of shipment to be processed. (If you have switched to Pack mode from Pick mode with the document selected, the document is selected automatically.) The system shows the lines of the scanned document in the table and inserts the reference number of the document that is currently selected for processing in the '''Shipment Nbr.''' box.
#''Scan the barcode of the box''.
#:You scan the barcode of the box into which the items will be packed.
#:((({S:Hint}If the ''Automatic Packaging'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, this step is performed automatically.
)))
#''Scan the item barcode''.
#:When you scan the barcode of the packed item, the system searches for the item in the lines of the document that is currently selected. If the barcode of the scanned item is specified for a non-base unit of measure, the system converts this quantity to the packed quantity in the base unit of measure for this item; the system also shows the packed quantity in the '''Packed Qty.''' column, and highlights the line (with bold if the line has been processed partially, or in green if the line has been processed in full).
#Optional: ''Scan the lot or serial number of the item''.
#:This step is required if the item is lot- or serial-tracked, and only if the '''Default Auto-Generated Lot/Serial Nbr.''' check box is cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form. If the check box is selected, the system specifies the lot or serial number for the serialized item automatically.
#Optional: ''Scan the item quantity''.
#:To change the packed quantity in the line that is currently being processed, you switch to Quantity Editing mode by scanning or entering the <tt>&#42;qty</tt> barcode, and manually enter the quantity in the UOM of the scanned item barcode.
#''Pack another line''.
#:If another item needs to be packed in the current box, you return to scanning the item barcode (return to Step 4), and repeat the process for the item. 
#''Confirm the box''.
#:If all items have been packed in the box, you confirm the current box by scanning the <tt>&#42;ok</tt> barcode or by clicking the '''OK''' button. 
#:((({S:Hint}This step is performed automatically for the shipments that are being packed to a single box that the system has suggested automatically.
)))
#''Enter the box weight''.
#:You enter the total weight of the box.
#:((({S:Hint}This step is performed automatically for the shipments that are being packed to a single box that the system has suggested automatically.
)))
#''Pack another box''.
#:If more items need to be packed for the current shipment, you return to scanning the barcode of the box barcode (return to Step 3), and repeat the process for another box. 
#''Complete the packing process''.
#:If you have finished the packing operation and specifying shipping options is not needed, you scan the <tt>&#42;confirm&#42;shipment</tt> barcode or click the '''Confirm Shipment''' button on the form toolbar. The system confirms the shipment that is currently being processed.
#:If you have finished the packing operation and want to specify shipping options, you scan the <tt>@ship</tt> barcode to switch to Ship mode (see [[#_6419ca4e-632c-419d-aa23-d600eff07fa6|Workflow of Automated Shipping]).

==Workflow of Automated Packing Without Picking==
The automated processing of directly packing items (without first picking them) involves the actions shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#_11398c96-3c05-4f35-b204-60fb5d4775ae][anchor|#_b4d8d5b0-6877-4d4f-b219-92cfb7014a21][image:UserGuide/Images/WMS_PackwoPick.png|popup|450px]
To process the packing of items (and use Pack mode) without picking them, you perform the following steps: [anchor|#_540f2ba7-75be-494c-a788-24cf820a187f]
#''Switch to Pack mode''.
#:You switch to Pack mode by scanning or entering the ''@pack'' barcode. The system opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) form with the '''Pack''' tab displayed.
#''Scan the document number''.
#:To start automated processing, you scan the reference number of the shipment to be processed. The system shows the lines of the scanned document in the table and inserts the reference number of the document that is currently selected for processing in the '''Shipment Nbr.''' box.
#''Scan the barcode of the box''.
#:You scan the barcode of the box to which the items will be packed.
#:((({S:Hint}If the ''Automatic Packaging'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, this step is performed automatically.
)))
#''Scan the location barcode''.
#:When you scan the barcode of the location from which the item is being taken for packing, the system searches for the location in the lines of the document that is currently selected.
#''Scan the item barcode''.
#:When you scan the item barcode of the packed item, the system searches for the item in the lines of the document that is currently selected. If the scanned item barcode corresponds to a non-base unit of measure, the system converts this quantity to the packed quantity in the base unit of measure for this item; the system also displays the packed quantity in the '''Packed Qty.''' column, and highlights the line (with bold if the line is processed partially, or in green if the line is processed in full).
#Optional: ''Scan the lot or serial number of the item''.
#:This step is required only if the item is lot- or serial-tracked. You need to scan the lot or serial number of the packed item if the '''Default Auto-Generated Lot/Serial Nbr.''' check box is cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form. If the check box is selected, the system specifies the lot or serial number for the serialized item automatically.
#Optional: ''Scan the item quantity''.
#:To change the packed quantity in the line that is currently being processed, you switch to Quantity Editing mode by scanning or entering the <tt>&#42;qty</tt> barcode, and manually enter the quantity in the UOM of the scanned item barcode.
#''Pack another line''.
#:If another item needs to be packed in the current box, you return to scanning the item barcode (that is, return to Step 4), and repeat the process for the item. 
#''Confirm the box''.
#:If all items are packed in the box, you confirm the current box by scanning the <tt>&#42;ok</tt> barcode or by clicking the '''OK''' button. 
#:((({S:Hint}This step is performed automatically for the shipments that are being packed to a single box that the system has suggested automatically.
)))
#''Enter the box weight''.
#:You enter the total weight of the box.
#:((({S:Hint}This step is performed automatically for the shipments that are being packed to a single box that the system has suggested automatically.
)))
#''Pack another box''.
#:If at least one other item needs to be packed for the current shipment, you return to scanning the barcode of the box (that is, return to Step 3), and repeat the process for another box. 
#''Complete the packing process''.
#:If you have finished the packing operation and you don&rsquo;t need to specify shipping options, you scan the <tt>&#42;confirm&#42;shipment</tt> barcode or click the '''Confirm Shipment''' button on the form toolbar. The system confirms the shipment that is currently being processed.
#:If you have finished the packing operation, to select shipping options, you scan the <tt>@ship</tt> barcode to switch to Ship mode (see the following section).

==Workflow of Automated Shipping==
After you have picked and packed items, you perform the final shipping workflow. In this workflow, you specify shipping options and confirm the shipment, as shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#_8ce84116-ebf0-4fcd-8a14-7af90bac11d3][anchor|#_8088ada2-3a1d-454b-9472-b082e2c4f452][image:UserGuide/Images/WMS_Ship.png|popup|450px]
To specify shipping options for the shipment that is currently being processed, you perform the following steps:[anchor|#_74de1687-1474-4a62-bbbc-e3588228ab42]
#''Switch to Ship mode''.
#:You switch to Ship mode by scanning or entering the ''@ship'' barcode. The system opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) form with the '''Ship''' tab displayed.
#''Scan the document number''.
#:To start automated processing, you scan the reference number of the shipment to be processed. The system inserts the reference number of the document that is currently selected for processing in the '''Shipment Nbr.''' box. (If you have switched to Ship mode from Pick mode or Pack mode with a document selected, the document is selected automatically.)
#:The boxes for the shipment are shown in the '''Packages''' table. 
#''Select the carrier rate''.
#:In the '''Carrier Rates''' table, you select the unlabeled check box in the line of the carrier rate to be used for shipping.
#Optional: ''Generate return labels''.
#:On the table toolbar of the '''Carrier Rates''' table, click '''Get Return Labels''' to generate return labels for the shipment.
#''Confirm the shipment''.
#:To confirm the processed shipment, you scan the <tt>&#42;confirm&#42;shipment</tt> barcode, or click the '''Confirm Shipment''' button on the form toolbar.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Pick, Pack, and Ship Operations If the  Fulfillment  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features         (CS100000) form, you can perform automated picking, packing, and shipping operations with         inventory items by using a barcode scanner or a mobile device with a scanning option.  This topic describes the workflows of automated operations that you can configure in  Acumatica ERP for processing shipments. Applicable Documents You perform automated operations for processing shipments on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) Pick, Pack, and Ship (SO302020) form.  You can process the following documents in Pick mode: Open shipments of the  Shipment  operation type (shipments prepared for sales           orders) Open shipments of the  Transfer  operation type (shipments prepared for transfer           orders) Open shipments of the  Receipt  operation type (shipments prepared for return           orders) In Pack mode, you can process open shipments of the  Shipment  or  Transfer          operation type. (If the picking of items is required before packing, the shipment must have         at least one picked item.) Workflow Variations Based on the settings specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences (SO101000) form, the         following shipping workflow variations can be configured and used: A user processes the picking of items in Pick mode, and then processes the packing of           items in Pack mode. In Pick mode, a user processes the picking of items and confirms the shipment. In Pack mode, a user processes the packing of items (without first picking them) and           confirms the shipment. In Pick mode, a user processes the picking of items and enters a shipping location for           each item. In Pack mode, a user processes the packing of items, and the system automatically           calculates weight of each package. In addition, in any of these workflow variations, the user can switch to Ship mode (see            Workflow of Automated Shipping Workflow of Automated Shipping) before confirming the shipment, and select shipping options, such as the         particular carrier and carrier rate to be used for shipping. For more information on configuring workflows, see  Configuration of Warehouse Operation Workflows. Workflow of Automated Picking The automated processing of the picking of items to be packed involves the actions shown in         the following diagram. To process the picking of items by using Pick mode, you perform the following steps: Switch to Pick mode . You switch to Pick mode by scanning or entering the                @pick  barcode. The system opens the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) Pick, Pack, and Ship (SO302020)             form with the  Pick  tab displayed. Scan the document number . To start automated processing, you scan the reference             number of the shipment to be processed. The system displays the lines of the scanned             document in the table and inserts the reference number of the document that is currently             selected for processing in the  Shipment Nbr.  box. Scan the location barcode . When you scan the barcode of the location from which             the item is picked, the system searches for the location in the lines of the document             that is currently selected. Scan the item barcode . When you scan the item barcode of the picked item, the             system searches for the item in the lines of the currently selected document. The system             displays the picked quantity in the  Picked Qty.  column and             highlights the line (with bold if the line has been picked partially, or in green if the             line has been picked in full). If the barcode of the scanned item is specified for a             non-base unit of measure (UOM), the system converts this quantity to the picked quantity             in the base unit of measure for this item.  Optional:  Scan the lot or serial number of the item . This step is required only             if the item is lot- or serial-tracked item, and only if the  Default               Auto-Generated Lot/Serial Nbr.  check box is cleared on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences (SO101000) form. If the check box is selected, the system             specifies the lot or serial number for the serialized item automatically. Optional:  Scan the item quantity . To change the picked quantity in the line             that is currently being processed, you switch to Quantity Editing mode by scanning or             entering the  *qty  barcode, and manually enter the quantity             in the UOM of the scanned item barcode. Optional:  Scan the barcode to confirm the picked quantity . If no more changes             are needed for the line that is currently being processed, you scan the                *ok  barcode or click the  OK              button to confirm the picked quantity. Pick another line . If another item needs to be picked for the currently             selected location, you scan the item barcode (return to Step 4), and repeat the process             for the item. Pick items from another location . If you need to pick items from another             location, you scan the location barcode (return to Step 3), and repeat the process for             the location. Complete the picking process . If you have finished the picking operation and             packaging is not needed, you scan the                *confirm*shipment  barcode or click the                Confirm Shipment  button on the form toolbar. The system             confirms the shipment that is currently being processed. If you have finished the             picking operation, to proceed with packaging, you scan the  @pack              barcode to switch to Pack mode. Workflow of Automated Packing Already-Picked         Items The automated processing of packing items that have been picked involves the actions shown         in the following diagram. To process the packing of items (and use Pack mode) after picking them, you perform the         following steps: Switch to Pack mode . You switch to Pack mode by scanning or entering the                @pack  barcode. The system opens the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) Pick, Pack, and Ship (SO302020)             form with the  Pack  tab displayed. Scan the document number . To start automated processing, you scan the reference             number of shipment to be processed. (If you have switched to Pack mode from Pick mode             with the document selected, the document is selected automatically.) The system shows             the lines of the scanned document in the table and inserts the reference number of the             document that is currently selected for processing in the  Shipment               Nbr.  box. Scan the barcode of the box . You scan the barcode of the box into which the             items will be packed. If the  Automatic Packaging  feature is enabled on             the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS101000) form, this step is performed             automatically. Scan the item barcode . When you scan the barcode of the packed item, the system             searches for the item in the lines of the document that is currently selected. If the             barcode of the scanned item is specified for a non-base unit of measure, the system             converts this quantity to the packed quantity in the base unit of measure for this item;             the system also shows the packed quantity in the  Packed Qty.              column, and highlights the line (with bold if the line has been processed partially, or             in green if the line has been processed in full). Optional:  Scan the lot or serial number of the item . This step is required if             the item is lot- or serial-tracked, and only if the  Default Auto-Generated               Lot/Serial Nbr.  check box is cleared on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences (SO101000) form. If the check box is selected, the system specifies the lot or serial             number for the serialized item automatically. Optional:  Scan the item quantity . To change the packed quantity in the line             that is currently being processed, you switch to Quantity Editing mode by scanning or             entering the  *qty  barcode, and manually enter the quantity in the             UOM of the scanned item barcode. Pack another line . If another item needs to be packed in the current box, you             return to scanning the item barcode (return to Step 4), and repeat the process for the             item.  Confirm the box . If all items have been packed in the box, you confirm the             current box by scanning the  *ok  barcode or by clicking the                OK  button.  This step is performed automatically for             the shipments that are being packed to a single box that the system has suggested             automatically. Enter the box weight . You enter the total weight of the box. This step             is performed automatically for the shipments that are being packed to a single box that             the system has suggested automatically. Pack another box . If more items need to be packed for the current shipment, you             return to scanning the barcode of the box barcode (return to Step 3), and repeat the             process for another box.  Complete the packing process . If you have finished the packing operation and             specifying shipping options is not needed, you scan the                *confirm*shipment  barcode or click the  Confirm               Shipment  button on the form toolbar. The system confirms the shipment that             is currently being processed. If you have finished the packing operation and want             to specify shipping options, you scan the  @ship  barcode to switch             to Ship mode (see  Workflow of Automated Shipping Workflow of Automated Shipping). Workflow of Automated Packing Without Picking The automated processing of directly packing items (without first picking them) involves         the actions shown in the following diagram. To process the packing of items (and use Pack mode) without picking them, you perform the         following steps:  Switch to Pack mode . You switch to Pack mode by scanning or entering the                @pack  barcode. The system opens the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) Pick, Pack, and Ship (SO302020)             form with the  Pack  tab displayed. Scan the document number . To start automated processing, you scan the reference             number of the shipment to be processed. The system shows the lines of the scanned             document in the table and inserts the reference number of the document that is currently             selected for processing in the  Shipment Nbr.  box. Scan the barcode of the box . You scan the barcode of the box to which the items             will be packed. If the  Automatic Packaging  feature is enabled on the                 ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS101000) form, this step is performed             automatically. Scan the location barcode . When you scan the barcode of the location from which             the item is being taken for packing, the system searches for the location in the lines             of the document that is currently selected. Scan the item barcode . When you scan the item barcode of the packed item, the             system searches for the item in the lines of the document that is currently selected. If             the scanned item barcode corresponds to a non-base unit of measure, the system converts             this quantity to the packed quantity in the base unit of measure for this item; the             system also displays the packed quantity in the  Packed Qty.              column, and highlights the line (with bold if the line is processed partially, or in             green if the line is processed in full). Optional:  Scan the lot or serial number of the item . This step is required only             if the item is lot- or serial-tracked. You need to scan the lot or serial number of the             packed item if the  Default Auto-Generated Lot/Serial Nbr.  check             box is cleared on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences (SO101000) form. If the check box             is selected, the system specifies the lot or serial number for the serialized item             automatically. Optional:  Scan the item quantity . To change the packed quantity in the line             that is currently being processed, you switch to Quantity Editing mode by scanning or             entering the  *qty  barcode, and manually enter the quantity             in the UOM of the scanned item barcode. Pack another line . If another item needs to be packed in the current box, you             return to scanning the item barcode (that is, return to Step 4), and repeat the process             for the item.  Confirm the box . If all items are packed in the box, you confirm the current             box by scanning the  *ok  barcode or by clicking the                OK  button.  This step is performed automatically for             the shipments that are being packed to a single box that the system has suggested             automatically. Enter the box weight . You enter the total weight of the box. This step             is performed automatically for the shipments that are being packed to a single box that             the system has suggested automatically. Pack another box . If at least one other item needs to be packed for the current             shipment, you return to scanning the barcode of the box (that is, return to Step 3), and             repeat the process for another box.  Complete the packing process . If you have finished the packing operation and             you don't need to specify shipping options, you scan the                *confirm*shipment  barcode or click the                Confirm Shipment  button on the form toolbar. The system             confirms the shipment that is currently being processed. If you have finished the             packing operation, to select shipping options, you scan the  @ship              barcode to switch to Ship mode (see the following section). Workflow of Automated Shipping After you have picked and packed items, you perform the final shipping workflow. In this         workflow, you specify shipping options and confirm the shipment, as shown in the following         diagram. To specify shipping options for the shipment that is currently being processed, you perform         the following steps: Switch to Ship mode . You switch to Ship mode by scanning or entering the                @ship  barcode. The system opens the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) Pick, Pack, and Ship (SO302020)             form with the  Ship  tab displayed. Scan the document number . To start automated processing, you scan the reference             number of the shipment to be processed. The system inserts the reference number of the             document that is currently selected for processing in the  Shipment               Nbr.  box. (If you have switched to Ship mode from Pick mode or Pack mode             with a document selected, the document is selected automatically.) The boxes for             the shipment are shown in the  Packages  table.  Select the carrier rate . In the  Carrier Rates  table, you             select the unlabeled check box in the line of the carrier rate to be used for             shipping. Optional:  Generate return labels . On the table toolbar of the                Carrier Rates  table, click  Get Return               Labels  to generate return labels for the shipment. Confirm the shipment . To confirm the processed shipment, you scan the                *confirm*shipment  barcode, or click the                Confirm Shipment  button on the form toolbar. ]]></column>

For more information on configuring workflows, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_WMS_Config|Configuration of Warehouse Operation Workflows].
==Workflow of Automated Receipt of Items==
The automated processing of the receipt of items involves the actions shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#_9a92ac48-c9f2-40e0-be74-8656e0577935][anchor|#_15a75575-9e06-4bd9-be65-29b6a9a63fd9][image:UserGuide/Images/WMS_Receive.png|popup|450px]
To process the receipt of items (and to use Receive mode), you perform the following steps:[anchor|#_9079e2ce-98a2-4b28-b448-5025e22a7f6f]
#''Switch to Receive mode''.
#:You switch to Receive working mode by scanning or entering the ''@receive'' barcode. The system opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_20|Receive and Put Away] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302020|PO302020]) form with the '''Receive''' tab displayed.
#''Scan the document number''.
#:To start automated processing, you scan the reference number of purchase order, purchase receipt, or purchase return document to be processed. The system displays the lines of the scanned document in the table. If you have scanned the purchase order number, the system creates and saves the related purchase receipt automatically. In the '''Receipt Nbr.''' box, the system inserts the reference number of the document that is currently selected for processing.
#''Scan the barcode of receiving location''.
#:You scan the barcode of the warehouse location where items are being received.
#''Scan the item barcode''.
#:When you scan the barcode of the received item, the system searches for the item in the lines of the document that is currently selected. If the item is found, the system highlights the line with bold. If the scanned item barcode corresponds to a non-base unit of measure, the system converts this quantity to the received quantity in the base unit of measure for this item.
#Optional: ''Scan the lot or serial number of the item''.
#:This step is required only if the item is lot- or serial-tracked. You need to scan the lot or serial number of the received item if the '''Default Auto-Generated Lot/Serial Nbr.''' check box is cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form. If the check box is selected, the system inserts the lot or serial number for the serialized item automatically.
#Optional: ''Scan or enter the expiration date of the item''.
#:This step is required only if the item is lot- or serial-tracked. You need to scan the expiration date of the received item if the '''Default Expiration Date''' check box is cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] form. If the check box is selected, the system fills in the expiration date for the serialized item automatically.
#Optional: ''Scan the item quantity''.
#:To change the received quantity in the line that is currently being processed, you switch on Quantity Editing mode by scanning or entering the <tt>&#42;qty</tt> barcode, and manually enter the quantity in the base unit of measure.
#Optional: ''Scan the barcode to confirm the received quantity''.
#:If no more changes are needed for the line that is currently being processed, you scan the <tt>&#42;ok</tt> barcode or click the '''OK''' button to confirm the received quantity.
#''Receive another line''.
#:If at least one other item needs to be received for the document currently being processed, you return to scanning the item barcode (that is, return to Step 4), and repeat the process for the item.
#''Receive items in another location''.
#:If items must be received in another warehouse location, you scan the barcode of this location (return to Step 3) and repeat the process for the next location.
#''Complete the receiving process''.
#:If you have finished the receiving operation but not all items have been received for the purchase receipt (and they will not be received in the future), you scan the <tt>&#42;complete&#42;polines</tt> barcode, or click the '''Complete PO Lines''' button. The system marks all purchase receipt lines as completed and releases the purchase receipt.
#:If you have finished the receiving operation and all items have been received for the purchase receipt (or the items were received partially but more items will be received in the future), you scan the <tt>&#42;release&#42;receipt</tt> barcode or click the '''Release Receipt''' button. The system does not mark partially received lines as completed and releases the purchase receipt.

==Receipt of Extra Quantity==
If the actual quantity of received items is more than the quantity specified in the processed purchase document, you can process the receipt of these items as an automated operation as well. If you scan the quantity that exceeds the quantity in the line that is currently being processed, the system requests confirmation for adding this quantity. If you confirm this addition with the <tt>&#42;ok</tt> barcode or the '''OK''' button, the system adds a new line with the extra quantity to the processed purchase receipt document, and shows this line in the table on the '''Receive''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_20|Receive and Put Away] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302020|PO302020]) form. The line with the extra quantity is not linked to the purchase order for which the purchase receipt was prepared.
==Workflow of Automated Putting Away of Items==
The automated processing of putting away items involves the actions shown in the following diagram. [anchor|#_a2be4902-fdfa-4e1a-b828-e028d42f8fac][anchor|#_84647252-944b-4fe1-b54d-f001df68cad4][image:UserGuide/Images/WMS_Put_Away.png|popup|450px]
To process the putting away of items by using Put Away mode, you perform the following steps:[anchor|#_6dd4e1fb-e362-4aa3-a79c-1246a336a887]
#''Switch to Put Away mode''.
#:You switch to Put Away mode by scanning or entering the ''@putaway'' barcode. The system opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_20|Receive and Put Away] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302020|PO302020]) form with the '''Put Away''' tab displayed.
#''Scan the document number''.
#:To start automated processing, you scan the reference number of released purchase receipt to be processed. (If you switched to Put Away mode from Receive mode with a document selected, the system selected the document automatically.) The system displays the lines of the scanned document in the table. In the '''Receipt Nbr.''' box, the system inserts the reference number of the document that is currently selected for processing.
#''Scan the barcode of the destination location''.
#:You scan the barcode of the destination location to which you are putting away items. If the items of a particular line are put away to multiple locations, the system creates line splits for the line. You can review the IDs of the locations to which the items are put away by clicking '''Transfer Allocations''' on the table toolbar of the '''Put Away''' tab.
#:Once you have specified the destination location, the system automatically creates a one-step inventory transfer document that reflects the movement of the item from the receiving location to the storage location.
#''Scan the barcode of the item''.
#:When you scan the item barcode of the received item, the system searches for the item in the lines of the document that is currently selected. If the scanned item barcode is specified for a non-base unit of measure, the system converts this quantity to the quantity in the base unit of measure for this item. To indicate the line or lines with the scanned barcode, the system selects the '''Matched''' check box in these lines. The system highlights in bold the lines that are processed partially, and in green if the line is processed in full.
#Optional: ''Scan the lot or serial number of the item''.
#:This step is required if the item is lot- or serial-tracked. You need to scan the lot or serial number of the item to be put away.
#Optional: ''Scan the item quantity''.
#:To change the put away quantity in the line that is currently being processed, you switch to Quantity Editing mode by scanning or entering the <tt>&#42;qty</tt> barcode, and manually enter the quantity in the UOM of the scanned item barcode.
#Optional: ''Scan the barcode to confirm the quantity being put away''.
#:To confirm the quantity being put away, you scan the <tt>&#42;ok</tt> barcode or click the '''OK''' button.
#''Scan another item''.
#:If at least one other item needs to be put away, you return to scanning the barcode of the item (that is, return to Step 4), and repeat the process for the item.
#''Scan another destination location''.
#:If items must be transferred to another destination location, you scan the barcode of this location (return to Step 3) and repeat the process.
#''Complete the put away process''.
#:When you have finished the operation of putting away items, you scan the <tt>&#42;release&#42;transfer</tt> barcode or clicks the '''Release Transfer''' button. The system releases the inventory transfer document that was prepared during the automated operation; the items are moved to the destination locations.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Receive and Put Away Operations  If the  Receiving  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features         (CS100000) form, you can perform automated receiving and putting away of inventory items by         using a barcode scanner or a mobile device with a scanning option.  This topic describes the workflows of automated operations that you can configure in  Acumatica ERP for processing purchase documents. Applicable Documents You perform automated operations for processing purchase documents on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302020|PO302020]) Receive and Put Away (PO302020) form. You can process the following documents in Receive mode: Purchase orders with the Open status Purchase receipts with the Balanced status Purchase returns with the Balanced status In Put Away mode, you can process purchase receipts with the  Released  status. Workflow Variations Based on the settings specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) Purchase Orders Preferences (PO101000) form, the         following workflow variations can be configured and used for the automated receiving and         putting away of inventory items: You process the receipt of items to the receiving location in Receive mode, and then           process the putting away of items in storage locations in Put Away mode. In Receive mode, you receive items directly to a single storage location. In Put Away mode, you process the receipt of items to multiple storage locations. In Receive mode, you scan the barcode of the receiving location for each new item to be           received. In Put Away mode, you scan the barcode of the destination location for each item to be           put away. For more information on configuring workflows, see  Configuration of Warehouse Operation Workflows. Workflow of Automated Receipt of Items The automated processing of the receipt of items involves the actions shown in the         following diagram. To process the receipt of items (and to use Receive mode), you perform the following         steps: Switch to Receive mode . You switch to Receive working mode by scanning or             entering the  @receive  barcode. The system opens the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302020|PO302020]) Receive and Put Away (PO302020) form with the  Receive  tab displayed. Scan the document number . To start automated processing, you scan the reference             number of purchase order, purchase receipt, or purchase return document to be processed.             The system displays the lines of the scanned document in the table. If you have scanned             the purchase order number, the system creates and saves the related purchase receipt             automatically. In the  Receipt Nbr.  box, the system inserts the             reference number of the document that is currently selected for processing. Scan the barcode of receiving location . You scan the barcode of the warehouse             location where items are being received. Scan the item barcode . When you scan the barcode of the received item, the             system searches for the item in the lines of the document that is currently selected. If             the item is found, the system highlights the line with bold. If the scanned item barcode             corresponds to a non-base unit of measure, the system converts this quantity to the             received quantity in the base unit of measure for this item. Optional:  Scan the lot or serial number of the item . This step is required only             if the item is lot- or serial-tracked. You need to scan the lot or serial number of the             received item if the  Default Auto-Generated Lot/Serial Nbr.  check             box is cleared on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) Purchase Orders Preferences (PO101000) form. If the check box             is selected, the system inserts the lot or serial number for the serialized item             automatically. Optional:  Scan or enter the expiration date of the item . This step is required             only if the item is lot- or serial-tracked. You need to scan the expiration date of the             received item if the  Default Expiration Date  check box is cleared             on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) Purchase Orders Preferences form. If the check box is selected, the system             fills in the expiration date for the serialized item automatically. Optional:  Scan the item quantity . To change the received quantity in the line             that is currently being processed, you switch on Quantity Editing mode by scanning or             entering the  *qty  barcode, and manually enter the quantity in the             base unit of measure. Optional:  Scan the barcode to confirm the received quantity . If no more changes             are needed for the line that is currently being processed, you scan the                *ok  barcode or click the  OK  button to             confirm the received quantity. Receive another line . If at least one other item needs to be received for the             document currently being processed, you return to scanning the item barcode (that is,             return to Step 4), and repeat the process for the item. Receive items in another location . If items must be received in another             warehouse location, you scan the barcode of this location (return to Step 3) and repeat             the process for the next location. Complete the receiving process . If you have finished the receiving operation             but not all items have been received for the purchase receipt (and they will not be             received in the future), you scan the  *complete*polines  barcode,             or click the  Complete PO Lines  button. The system marks all             purchase receipt lines as completed and releases the purchase receipt. If you have             finished the receiving operation and all items have been received for the purchase             receipt (or the items were received partially but more items will be received in the             future), you scan the  *release*receipt  barcode or click the                Release Receipt  button. The system does not mark partially             received lines as completed and releases the purchase receipt. Receipt of Extra Quantity If the actual quantity of received items is more than the quantity specified in the         processed purchase document, you can process the receipt of these items as an automated         operation as well. If you scan the quantity that exceeds the quantity in the line that is         currently being processed, the system requests confirmation for adding this quantity. If you         confirm this addition with the  *ok  barcode or the            OK  button, the system adds a new line with the extra quantity to         the processed purchase receipt document, and shows this line in the table on the            Receive  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302020|PO302020]) Receive and Put Away (PO302020) form.         The line with the extra quantity is not linked to the purchase order for which the purchase         receipt was prepared. Workflow of Automated Putting Away of Items The automated processing of putting away items involves the actions shown in the following         diagram.  To process the putting away of items by using Put Away mode, you perform the following         steps: Switch to Put Away mode . You switch to Put Away mode by scanning or entering             the  @putaway  barcode. The system opens the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302020|PO302020]) Receive and Put Away             (PO302020) form with the  Put Away  tab displayed. Scan the document number . To start automated processing, you scan the reference             number of released purchase receipt to be processed. (If you switched to Put Away mode             from Receive mode with a document selected, the system selected the document             automatically.) The system displays the lines of the scanned document in the table. In             the  Receipt Nbr.  box, the system inserts the reference number of             the document that is currently selected for processing. Scan the barcode of the destination location . You scan the barcode of the             destination location to which you are putting away items. If the items of a particular             line are put away to multiple locations, the system creates line splits for the line.             You can review the IDs of the locations to which the items are put away by clicking                Transfer Allocations  on the table toolbar of the  Put               Away  tab. Once you have specified the destination location, the             system automatically creates a one-step inventory transfer document that reflects the             movement of the item from the receiving location to the storage location. Scan the barcode of the item . When you scan the item barcode of the received             item, the system searches for the item in the lines of the document that is currently             selected. If the scanned item barcode is specified for a non-base unit of measure, the             system converts this quantity to the quantity in the base unit of measure for this item.             To indicate the line or lines with the scanned barcode, the system selects the                Matched  check box in these lines. The system highlights in bold             the lines that are processed partially, and in green if the line is processed in             full. Optional:  Scan the lot or serial number of the item . This step is required if             the item is lot- or serial-tracked. You need to scan the lot or serial number of the             item to be put away. Optional:  Scan the item quantity . To change the put away quantity in the line             that is currently being processed, you switch to Quantity Editing mode by scanning or             entering the  *qty  barcode, and manually enter the quantity in the             UOM of the scanned item barcode. Optional:  Scan the barcode to confirm the quantity being put away . To confirm             the quantity being put away, you scan the  *ok  barcode or click             the  OK  button. Scan another item . If at least one other item needs to be put away, you return             to scanning the barcode of the item (that is, return to Step 4), and repeat the process             for the item. Scan another destination location . If items must be transferred to another             destination location, you scan the barcode of this location (return to Step 3) and             repeat the process. Complete the put away process . When you have finished the operation of putting             away items, you scan the  *release*transfer  barcode or clicks the                Release Transfer  button. The system releases the inventory             transfer document that was prepared during the automated operation; the items are moved             to the destination locations. ]]></column>

==Overview of Automated Scanning and Issuing==
The automated issuing of inventory items involves the steps shown in the following diagram and described below.[anchor|#image_fdy_1b4_zgb][image:UserGuide/Images/WMS_Scan_Issue.png|popup|450px]
==Workflow of Automated Scanning and Issuing==
To issue items by using Scan and Receive mode, you perform the following steps:[anchor|#ol_cw5_cd4_xgb]
#''Switch to Scan and Issue mode''.
#:You switch to Scan and Issue mode by scanning or entering the ''@inissue'' barcode. The system opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_20|Scan and Issue] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302020|IN302020]) form.
#''Scan the location barcode''.
#:You scan the barcode of the warehouse location where items to be issued are stored.
#Optional: ''Scan the warehouse barcode''.
#:If a location with the identifier scanned on the previous step is assigned to multiple warehouses, you scan the warehouse barcode. The system inserts the warehouse ID in the '''Warehouse''' box.
#''Scan the item barcode''.
#:When you scan the item barcode, the system adds the line for the item to the table and displays the location scanned in the previous step in the '''Location''' column.
#Optional: ''Scan the lot or serial number of the item''.
#:This step is required only if the item is lot- or serial-tracked. You need to scan the lot or serial number of the received item if the ''' Use Default Auto-Generated Lot/Serial Nbr.''' check box is cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form. If the check box is selected, the system specifies the lot or serial number for the serialized item automatically.
#Optional: ''Scan expiration date of the item''.
#:This step is required only if the item is lot- or serial-tracked. You need to scan the expiration date of the received item if the '''Use Default Expiration Date''' check box is cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] form. If the check box is selected, the system specifies the expiration date for the serialized item automatically.
#Optional: ''Scan the item quantity''.
#:To change the issued quantity in the line that is currently being processed, you switch to Quantity Editing mode by scanning or entering the <tt>&#42;qty</tt> barcode or by clicking '''Set Qty''' on the form toolbar; you then manually enter the quantity in the base unit of measure.
#Optional: ''Scan the barcode to confirm the quantity being issued''.
#:If the '''Use Explicit Line Confirmation''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] form, you confirm the line that is currently being processed by scanning the <tt>&#42;ok</tt> barcode or by clicking '''OK''' on the form toolbar.
#Optional: ''Scan the barcode of the next item to be issued from the selected location''
#:If another item must be issued from the currently selected location, you scan the barcode of the next item (return to Step 4) and repeat the process for the next item.
#Optional: ''Scan the barcode of the next location''.
#:If items must be issued from another warehouse location, you scan the barcode of this location (return to Step 2) and repeat the process for the next location.
#''Release the inventory issue''.
#:When you have finished issuing items, you scan the <tt>&#42;release&#42;issue</tt> command or click '''Release''' on the form toolbar. The system releases the inventory issue.

Overview of Automated Scanning and Issuing The automated issuing of inventory items involves the steps shown in the following diagram         and described below. Workflow of Automated Scanning and Issuing To issue items by using Scan and Receive mode, you perform the following steps: Switch to Scan and Issue mode . You switch to Scan and Issue mode by scanning or             entering the  @inissue  barcode. The system opens the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302020|IN302020]) Scan and Issue (IN302020) form. Scan the location barcode . You scan the barcode of the warehouse location where             items to be issued are stored. Optional:  Scan the warehouse barcode . If a location with the identifier scanned             on the previous step is assigned to multiple warehouses, you scan the warehouse barcode.             The system inserts the warehouse ID in the  Warehouse            box. Scan the item barcode . When you scan the item barcode, the system adds the line             for the item to the table and displays the location scanned in the previous step in the                Location  column. Optional:  Scan the lot or serial number of the item . This step is required only             if the item is lot- or serial-tracked. You need to scan the lot or serial number of the             received item if the   Use Default Auto-Generated Lot/Serial Nbr.              check box is cleared on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000) form. If the             check box is selected, the system specifies the lot or serial number for the serialized             item automatically. Optional:  Scan expiration date of the item . This step is required only if the             item is lot- or serial-tracked. You need to scan the expiration date of the received             item if the  Use Default Expiration Date  check box is cleared on             the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences form. If the check box is selected, the system             specifies the expiration date for the serialized item automatically. Optional:  Scan the item quantity . To change the issued quantity in the line             that is currently being processed, you switch to Quantity Editing mode by scanning or             entering the  *qty  barcode or by clicking  Set               Qty  on the form toolbar; you then manually enter the quantity in the base             unit of measure. Optional:  Scan the barcode to confirm the quantity being issued . If the                Use Explicit Line Confirmation  check box is selected on the                 ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences form, you confirm the line that is currently being             processed by scanning the  *ok  barcode or by clicking                OK  on the form toolbar. Optional:  Scan the barcode of the next item to be issued from the selected             location If another item must be issued from the currently selected location, you             scan the barcode of the next item (return to Step 4) and repeat the process for the next             item. Optional:  Scan the barcode of the next location . If items must be issued from             another warehouse location, you scan the barcode of this location (return to Step 2) and             repeat the process for the next location. Release the inventory issue . When you have finished issuing items, you scan the                *release*issue  command or click                Release  on the form toolbar. The system releases the inventory             issue.  ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000])  ([~/?ScreenId=IN302020|IN302020]) ]]></column>

==Workflow of Automated Scanning and Receiving==
To receive items (and to use Scan and Receive mode), you perform the following steps:[anchor|#ol_cz1_5pn_xgb]
#''Switch to Scan and Receive mode''.
#:You switch to Scan and Receive mode by scanning or entering the ''@inreceive'' barcode. The system opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_20|Scan and Receive] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301020|IN301020]) form.
#''Scan the location barcode''.
#:When you scan the barcode of the receiving location, the system fills in the location ID in the '''Location''' column in the line that is currently being processed.
#Optional: ''Scan the warehouse barcode''.
#:If a location with the identifier scanned on the previous step is assigned to multiple warehouses, you scan the warehouse barcode. The system inserts the warehouse ID in the '''Warehouse''' box.
#''Scan the item barcode''.
#:You scan the barcode of the item being received.
#Optional: ''Scan the lot or serial number of the item''.
#:This step is required only if the item is lot- or serial-tracked. You need to scan the lot or serial number of the received item if the ''' Use Default Auto-Generated Lot/Serial Nbr.''' check box is cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form. If the check box is selected, the system specifies the lot or serial number for the serialized item automatically.
#Optional: ''Scan the expiration date of the item''.
#:This step is required only if the item is lot- or serial-tracked. You need to scan the expiration date of the received item if the '''Use Default Expiration Date''' check box is cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] form. If the check box is selected, the system specifies the expiration date for the serialized item automatically.
#Optional: ''Scan item quantity''.
#:To change the received quantity in the line that is currently being processed, you switch to Quantity Editing mode by scanning or entering the <tt>&#42;qty</tt> barcode or by clicking '''Set Qty''' on the form toolbar; you then manually enter the quantity in base unit of measure.
#Optional: ''Scan the barcode to confirm the quantity being received''.
#:If the '''Use Explicit Line Confirmation''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] form, you confirm the line that is currently being processed by scanning the <tt>&#42;ok</tt> barcode or by clicking '''OK''' on the form toolbar.
#Optional: ''Scan the barcode of the next item to be received''.
#:If more items need to be received, you return to scanning the item barcode (return to Step 4), and repeat the process for the item.
#Optional: ''Scan the barcode of the next location''.
#:If items must be received in another warehouse location, you scan the barcode of this location (return to Step 2) and repeat the process for the next location.
#''Release the inventory receipt''.
#:When you have finished receiving items, you scan the <tt>&#42;release&#42;receipt</tt> command or click '''Release''' on the form toolbar. The system releases the inventory receipt.

If items must be             transferred between another locations, you scan the barcode of the next origin location             (return to Step 2) and repeat the process. Release the inventory transfer . When you have finished transferring items, you             scan the  *release*transfer  command or click                Release  on the form toolbar. The system releases the inventory             transfer.  ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000])  ([~/?ScreenId=IN304020|IN304020]) ]]></column>

Lot numbers and serial numbers are used to track certain types of inventory items and keep accurate records about their distribution. If the ''Lot and Serial Tracking'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can configure the tracking of stock items by lot or serial number, as well as by expiration date. (For more information, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Lot_and_Serial_Number_Tracking|Lot and Serial Number Tracking].){br}

This topic describes the specifics of processing lot- and serial-tracked items in automated warehouse operations.{br}{TOC}
==Picking and Packing Lot- and Serial-Tracked Items==
When you switch to Pick mode and scan the shipment number, the system loads the shipment lines into the table on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) form. To select a line for processing, you scan the item barcode and the barcode of the location from which the item is picked. {br}

For serial-tracked items (with any assignment method), the system shows a separate line for each picked item. For lot-tracked items, the system shows the total quantity to be picked as one line and splits the line by lots.{br}

When you process the packing of items in Pack mode, for each item to be packed to a selected box, you scan the item barcode, lot or serial number, and, optionally, expiration date (which must be the same as the expiration date in the shipment).
==Receiving Lot- and Serial-Tracked Items==
When you switch to Receive mode and scan the purchase receipt number, the system loads the purchase receipt lines into the table on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_20|Receive and Put Away] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302020|PO302020]) form. To select a line for processing, you scan the item barcode and the barcode of the location to which the item is received. The settings of the item being received determine the item settings that you must enter as follows:[anchor|#_35955f55-6b95-485d-80ea-4104fccac27e]
*For serial-tracked and lot-tracked items with the ''When Received'' assignment method, you must scan or enter the lot or serial number when receiving an item. For items that belong to a lot/serial class for which the '''Auto-Generate Next Number''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_70_00|Lot/Serial Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) form, the system automatically generates lot or serial numbers and displays them in the '''Lot/Serial Nbr.''' column. For items with the ''When Used'' assignment method, specifying the lot or serial number is not applicable.
*For items of a lot/serial class that requires the expiration date to be specified—that is, a class for which the '''Track Expiration Date''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_70_00|Lot/Serial Classes] form—you must enter the expiration date. 
*For serial-tracked items with the ''When Received'' assignment method, the system requires that you specify serial number for the item, and it splits the line once you enter a serial number for a received item. If you specify another serial number than the one that was automatically generated by the system, the system replaces the auto-generated number with the one that you have entered. 
*For lot-tracked items, you receive each lot from a received quantity separately; the system split the lines by the received lots.

When you process the putting away of the items in Put Away mode, for each item to be put away, you scan the barcode of the receiving location, the item barcode, and then the lot or serial number.
==Receiving, Issuing, Transferring, and Counting Lot- and Serial-Tracked Items==
When you receive, issue, transfer, or count lot- or serial-tracked items, for each item to be processed, you scan the location barcode, the item barcode, the barcode of the lot or serial number, and, optionally, the expiration date.{br}

During the counting of the items, you find an item with an unregistered serial number, you can add this item to the physical inventory document by scanning the item barcode and the serial number.

If the ''Cart Tracking'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can configure cart entities, which represent physical carts used for moving inventory items within a warehouse, and track item movements between warehouse locations.{br}{TOC}
==Configuring Carts==
When the ''Cart Tracking'' feature is enabled, you can configure carts on the '''Carts''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form. For a warehouse, you can create any number of carts. For each cart, you specify the ID and a short description, and you select the '''Active''' check box to indicate that the cart can be used for moving items.
==Viewing Items in Carts==
When you use carts in automated warehouse operations, you can quickly view the list of items in a particular cart by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_90_20|Storage Lookup] ([~/?ScreenId=IN409020|IN409020]) form. You scan the barcode of a cart in a particular warehouse, and the system displays the list of items and their quantities in the cart.
==Tracking Carts in Picking Operations==
If the '''Use Carts for Picking''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form, specifying a cart is added as a required step of picking items workflow. This configuration is used to track item movements when a warehouse worker first takes the items to a cart, and then picks them from the cart and packs for shipping. That is, a cart represents a temporary location from which the items are picked for processing.{br}

Before scanning a shipment number in Pick mode, you scan the barcode of the cart that you are going to use for picking items. The system shows the ID of the currently selected cart in the '''Cart ID''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) form. Then you scan the location barcode and the item barcode and specify the quantity of items loaded to the cart; the system shows this quantity in the '''Cart Qty.''' column for each line, thus indicating the items that have been loaded to the currently selected cart. To indicate picking items from the cart, you use the <tt>&#42;cart&#42;out</tt> command to enter Cart Unloading mode, and you scan the item barcode and quantity; the system reduces the '''Cart Qty.''' and adds this quantity to the '''Picked Quantity'''. After the items are picked from the cart, you pack and ship the items, or you confirm the shipment without packing, depending on the workflow set up in your company. For more information about picking and packing workflows, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Automating_WMS_PickPackShip|Pick, Pack, and Ship Operations].
==Tracking Carts in Putting Away Operations==
If the '''Use Carts for Putting Away''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form, the specification of a cart is added as a required step of the workflow of putting away items. This configuration is used to track item movements when a warehouse worker first loads items into the cart from the receiving location, and then puts them away from the cart to the place of storage. That is, a cart represents a temporary location from which the items are taken for processing.{br}

Before scanning a receipt number in Put Away mode, you scan the barcode of the cart that you are going to use for putting away items. The system shows the ID of the currently selected cart in the '''Cart ID''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_20|Receive and Put Away] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302020|PO302020]) form. Then you scan the item barcode and specify the quantity of items loaded into the cart; the system shows this quantity in the '''Cart Qty.''' column for each line, thus indicating loading items to the currently selected cart. To indicate putting away each item from the cart, you use the <tt>&#42;cart&#42;out</tt> command to enter Cart Unloading mode, and scan the item barcode, the location barcode, and the quantity; the system reduces the '''Cart Qty.''' to indicate the item being put away. After all the items for the current document are put away from the cart, you release the transfer document, and the processing is completed. For more information about workflows associated with receiving items and putting them away, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Automating_WMS_ReceivePutAway|Receive and Put Away Operations].
